  abstract     = {While the special properties of exceptional points (EPs) may improve application relevant features such as hypersensing, often their realization requires a precise fine-tuning of parameters. Here we report the robust formation of EP chains in coupled optical microcavities over intercavity distances on the order of the cavity size. We find that coupling, or more generally, the availability of an outer (coupling) channel, is sufficient to induce EPs in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index along with . This occurs even at of several wavelengths, yielding a network of EPs in parameter space with a periodicity of the order of the wavelength in the direction. Upon the increase of , we observe a sharp transition in the sign of the chirality measured in one of the cavities that further structures the system properties. While the details of the Riemannian surfaces associated with the formation of exceptional points are mode dependent and allow for a variety of single-cavity chiralities, we find the underlying mechanism to be universal, robust, applicable to other and more general coupled systems, and promising for potential applications such as optical measurements of pressure, voltages, or distances.},

By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow with a spatially bounded supersonic region, forming an acoustic analog of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasiperiodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of the frequencies of ring soliton oscillations within the black-hole horizon. The solitons seen in the simulations are emitted from the region between the two horizons in a process that we attribute to the Landau instability. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.},

We characterize an intrinsic comagnetometer that is available in crystals, which can be used to suppress spurious magnetic-field effects through comparing sets of ions related by spatial reflection symmetry.

Instead of exhibiting energy-conserving persistent coherent motion, the dynamics of such open systems feature, in most cases, a steady state, which is approached in the long-time limit from all initial conditions. This can, in fact, be advantageous as it offers a mechanism for the creation of robust quantum correlations on demand without the need for fine-tuning. Here, we show this for a system consisting of two coherently coupled bosonic modes, which is a paradigmatic scenario for the realization of quantum resources such as squeezed entangled states. Rather counterintuitively, the mere addition of incoherent hopping, which results in a statistical coupling between the bosonic modes, leads to steady states with robust quantum entanglement and enables the emergence of persistent coherent nonstationary behavior.},

We perform an exhaustive search for triangle-local models, and from it we infer analytic expressions for the boundaries of the set of distributions that admit such models, which we conjecture to be all the tight Bell inequalities for the scenario.

This approach allows us to accurately estimate assemblages without assuming uniform detection efficiency on the untrusted party's side. Using an evidence-based framework grounded in the Akaike information criterion, we demonstrate faithful reconstructions while balancing model complexity.

Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg limit up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform.

In the quantum regime, current approaches to smoothing either give unphysical outcomes, due to the noncommutativity of the measurements at different times, or require assumptions about how the environment is measuring the system, which with current technology is unverifiable. We propose a novel definition of the smoothed quantum state based on quantum Bayesian retrodiction, which mirrors the classical retrodictive approach to smoothing. This approach always yields physical results and does not require any assumption on the environment. We show that this smoothed state has, on average, greater purity than the state reconstructed using just the prior information. Finally, we make a connection with the smoothing theory of Guevara and Wiseman in a well-studied regime, and describe from a purely quantum perspective how it conditions on the posterior information.},

The principle asserts the sufficiency of local measurements for achieving a tomographic characterization of any bipartite state. In this work, we explore the meaning of the principle of tomographic locality by developing a simple scheme for generating a wide variety of theories that violate the principle. In this scheme, one starts with a tomographically local theory—which can be classical, quantum, or postquantum—and a physical symmetry, and one restricts the processes in the theory to all and only those that are covariant with respect to the collective action of that symmetry. We refer to the resulting theories as twirled worlds . We show that failures of tomographic locality are ubiquitous in twirled worlds. From the possibility of such failures in classical twirled worlds, we argue that the failure of tomographic locality (i.e., tomographic non locality) does not imply ontological holism. Our results also demonstrate the need for researchers seeking to axiomatize quantum theory to take a stand on the question of whether there are superselection rules that have a fundamental status.},

  abstract     = {Quantum optics routinely uses beam splitters to generate entanglement, including in pioneering experiments conducted by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss and Hong, Ou, and Mandel. The quantum interference at beam splitters lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asbóth et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 , 173602 (2005) ]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones including mixed-state generalizations of entanglement entropy and purity by uncovering monotonicity and convexity with respect to photon loss for these monotones. At the same time, we highlight an infinite class of lesser-used monotones for which the conjecture fails. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, including proof of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss and a more efficient computational strategy for optimizing entanglement generation over linear optics. These results justify the value of seeking mathematical rigor behind commonly accepted facts and the danger of trusting them unconditionally.},

In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n , the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung -like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wave-packet motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.},

We find that for relatively large free-space decay rates, the population dynamics of each qubit features Rabi oscillations, while for smaller decay rates it exhibits a complex behavior, which nevertheless can be understood by semianalytical expressions using the sub- and superradiant states of the system. Additionally, we observe phenomena, such as population and entanglement trapping, induced by the strong interaction of the qubits with the graphene nanodisk, with trapping values depending solely on the initial conditions of the two qubits.

  abstract     = {Systems in contact with an environment provide a ubiquitous challenge in quantum dynamics. Many fascinating phenomena can arise if the coupling is strong, leading to non-Markovian dynamics of the system, or collective, where the environment can become highly excited. We introduce a significant improvement of the hierarchy of pure states (HOPS) approach, which is able to efficiently deal with such highly excited, non-Markovian environments in a nearly unitary way. As our method relies on quantum trajectories, we can obtain dynamics efficiently, also for large system sizes, by (1) avoiding the quadratic scaling of a density matrix and (2) exploiting the localization properties of the trajectories with an adaptive basis. We provide the derivation of the nuHOPS (nearly unitary hierarchy of pure states) method, compare it to the original HOPS, and discuss numerical subtleties based on an illustrative dephasing model. Finally, we show its true power using the Dicke model as the paradigmatic example of many emitters decaying superradiantly inside a cavity. We reach numerically exact solutions for up to 1000 emitters. We apply our method to study emerging higher-order correlations in the emitter system or the cavity mode environment and their scaling with the number of emitters.},

In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the optomechanical interaction, cavity field, and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction when probe field detuning is nonzero. The photonic SHE in bilayer graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.},

The system, modeled as a Rice-Mele chain using a double-well lattice and facilitating giant-atom-like nonlocal interaction, exhibits intriguing phenomena such as subradiance and superradiance. We demonstrate that APBSs with tunable chirality can be realized in the bound states in the continuum (BICs) and quasi-BICs and support the decoherence-free interaction via two distinct schemes. We also reveal the dynamical mechanisms for the topologically protected SAP, where the chiral-APBS fidelity during the adiabatic transfer is highly sensitive to the topology. These findings open possibilities for quantum simulation and information processing with cold atoms, particularly through the integration of topologically protected controllable mechanisms.},

In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green's function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a nonperturbative approach.},

To our knowledge, the impacts of BICs on the single-photon purity and brightness in the blockade process remain less explored. Here, we put forward a scheme to simultaneously enhance both the purity and brightness of single-photon emission in one cavity mode of such an integrated microresonator-waveguide system, while the other cavity mode is considered to be an active mode, modeled as incoherent-pumping (gain)-like laser production. Physically, this enhancement is achieved through BICs produced by quantum destructive interference between different dissipative pathways. We demonstrate that BICs enable the improvement of emission brightness by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, accompanied by high single-photon purity of 0.98 (or strong photon blockade of 0.02) compared with the BIC-free configuration. As a check, the full numerical results for the second-order correlation function and the average photon number of the emission cavity mode, which respectively determine the purity and brightness of single-photon emission, are in excellent agreement with the semianalytical solutions. Our BICs-based work offers a promising avenue for constructing single-photon sources with high purity and high brightness.},

  abstract     = {How environments affect the dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum of boson modes. Previous analytic solutions show that, starting from the initial condition that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes are in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamical transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here we study the dynamical transition for the case that particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. The boson modes are assumed to follow a spectral function up to a cutoff frequency with . In particular, we access the effects of an all-to-all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the nonperturbative numerical renormalization group method. We find that the value of the critical coupling for the transition exhibits a maximum at a finite and decreases with sufficiently large , and is suppressed (enlarged) by a ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding of environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.},

The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed.},

This was seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based on engineered environments.},

While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of enantiomer selectivity, many existing studies focus on perfectly chiral cavities that contain only one type of enantiomer. Here, we investigate a scenario of imperfect cavities containing varying mixtures of enantiomers. Using a generalized Hopfield-type model, we systematically explore how the degree of enantiomeric mixing and cavity imperfections affect chiral selectivity. Our analysis includes both an examination of the cavity's eigenmode structure and a quantitative assessment of differential energy transfer into specific enantiomeric species. We demonstrate that both cavity imperfections and the presence of enantiomer mixtures profoundly modify the polaritonic dispersion. We also highlight that pushing the system into the deep strong coupling regime—by increasing molecular concentration—can decrease the efficiency of energy transfer to matter modes. These findings emphasize that precise cavity design and detailed consideration of enantiomeric composition are essential for achieving optimal chiral selectivity in practical cavity QED systems.},

  abstract     = {Optical down-conversion is widely used for generating photon pairs, squeezed and entangled states of light, making it an indispensable tool in quantum optics and quantum information. In the regime where the pump is much stronger than the generated field, the standard parametric approximation treats the pump amplitude as a fixed parameter of the model. This approximation has a limited domain of validity since it assumes a nondepleted and nonentangled pump. By finding an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation of the down-conversion process, we obtain an improved analytical model beyond the parametric one, which accounts for pump depletion and pump-signal entanglement. Our model is advantageous, first, because it allows one to compute averages of field operators far beyond the domain of validity of the parametric approximation, and second, because it allows one to establish error-specific limits of the latter domain. For a given pump amplitude, we find a maximum squeezing parameter, up to which the approximation remains valid within a specified acceptable error. Our results confirm that recent experiments on Gaussian boson sampling, with a squeezing parameter of and a coherent pump amplitude of , can still be accurately described by the standard parametric approximation. However, we observe a sharp decline in validity as the squeezing parameter increases. For pump amplitudes of , the parametric approximation breaks down when the squeezing parameter exceeds , whereas the new approximation remains valid up to with an acceptable error of 1%.},

This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for -function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.},

Specifically, we show how one can access higher moments of the mode operators, crucial for detecting entanglement of non-Gaussian states, using a single beamsplitter with variable phase and photon-number-resolving detectors. We demonstrate that the use of an entangled state paired with a suitable reference state is sufficient to detect entanglement in, e.g., two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON states, and mixed entangled cat states.

The phases of coupling strengths between the giant molecule and waveguides are considered. Using a real-space method, we obtain the exact analytical expressions for the single-photon scattering coefficients, which are valid both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that the transmission spectra strongly depend on phases, including the phases accumulated by photons traveling between coupling points and the phase difference between two coupled channels of the giant-molecule upper (lower) waveguide. Under the Markovian limit, we find that by selecting appropriate accumulated phases and local phase difference, targeted routing and asymmetrical scattering of photons can be achieved without breaking the symmetry in the coupling configuration between the giant molecule and waveguides. Moreover, all the optimal phase combinations for implementing single-photon routing have been summarized. In the non-Markovian regime, the scattering spectra show more complicated line shapes with multiple staggered peaks and dips. More interestingly, the scattering spectrum exhibits periodic changes during the transition from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime, which makes one obtain a means to control photon routing in addition to phases.

We also explore the possibilities offered by such a system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering depends on parameters such as the Stokes–anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry, and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.},

The non-Gaussianity evolution during the coupling process is quantitatively analyzed via quantum relative entropy, and the entanglement between the two output modes is confirmed from an entropic perspective. Furthermore, the entanglement properties of the zero-phase and -phase positive Wigner squeezed states at the third- and sixth-order moments are revealed by applying the partial transpose positive criterion based on the higher-order covariance matrix. In particular, it is found that the steerability of the two output modes at the third- and sixth-order moments can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the intensity of the input light and the transmission of the beam splitter.

Our results reveal a transition from anomalous to normal in the ellipticity dependence as the laser frequency increases. Simultaneously, the structure of the orientation dependence undergoes a transformation. By analyzing the conduction-band electron populations, we attribute these changes to the transformation of the dominant excitation mechanism. At low frequencies, tunneling ionization dominates, whereas at high frequencies, multiphoton ionization prevails. Furthermore, the limitation of the solid Keldysh parameter is discussed. These findings underscore the crucial role of the dominant excitation mechanism in solid high-order harmonic generation.},

  abstract     = {Singular optics is an important and meaningful subject that has attracted widespread attention. The famous vortex beam and vector beam carrying different singularities have found broad applications, and there are four kinds of optical singularities including one kind of phase singularity and three kinds of polarization singularities. However, the classification of optical singularities remains incomplete, as the polarization singularity with indeterminate ellipticity and determinate orientation has not been defined. Here, we propose a kind of E -point singularity, where the ellipticity of polarization is indeterminate and the orientation is determinate. The amount, positions, and topological charges of the E -point singularities can be theoretically and experimentally manipulated on the wave front of the beam. It is found that the E -point singularity has a function of polarization purification in propagation, and the E -point singularity acts like catalyst when achieving pure transverse spin angular momentum (SAM) in tight focusing process. The proposed E -point singularity not only supplements the theoretical framework of singular optics, but also enables SAM manipulation during propagation and focusing processes, demonstrating broad application potential across various regions.},

This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the Lorentz oscillators are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.},

While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional (2D) systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase-space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection on two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.},

This approach exploits parity-asymmetric interactions between chiral particles and the metasurface-engineered needle-like optical field, eliminating the need for complex background structures. Leveraging the field manipulation versatility of spin-decoupled metasurfaces, we demonstrate enantiomer separation across thousands of particle diameters—exceeding previous works by an order of magnitude in terms of particle-scale displacement. Furthermore, by tuning the chirality density of the field, directional control of particle motion can be achieved, underscoring its potential for large-scale chiral sorting and enantioselective drug purification.},

It involves two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under the standard assumptions for the mean-field approach (high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion) we demonstrate that our model closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our equation provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations to the steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods.

Superscattering, induced by degenerate resonances, allows the scattering cross section of subwavelength structures to surpass the fundamental single-channel limit. However, most existing superscattering techniques depend on complex multilayered structures and primarily aim to enhance scattering magnitudes. In this work, we propose a single-layer plasmonic core-shell nanoparticle that achieves superdirectional scattering without relying on high-permittivity materials and magnetic resonances. We demonstrate that for nanoparticles with a thin plasmonic nanoshell, both dielectric dipolar and quadrupolar resonances occur at nearly the same frequency, where the permittivity of the plasmonic shell approaches zero (degenerate epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) resonances), enabling superscattering in this simple nanoparticle. Furthermore, by tuning the amplitudes of these ENZ resonances, we show that both zero-backward and super-forward scattering can be realized. This approach, relying solely on pure electric ENZ modes in a simple core-shell nanoparticle, offers a new pathway for achieving superdirectional scattering and holds significant potential for applications in photovoltaic devices, biosensors, and nanoantennas.},

Here we utilize the conservation of optical chirality to connect the parity and time-reversal symmetries of the intrinsic excitational eigenmodes of a material to those of their associated electromagnetic eigenfields as dictated by Maxwell's equations. To make this connection explicit, we theoretically examine the Born-Kuhn (BK) system, composed of a pair of plasmonic nanorods of variable separation, as a prototypical material model that is both geometrically chiral in its static structure and truly excitationally chiral in its eigenexcitations and eigenfields. By relaying optical chirality metrics of the BK eigenfields back to their underlying sourcing material degrees of freedom, we derive a unique mechanical chirality measure that is related to, but distinct from, other pseudoscalar metrics recently discussed in the literature. Beyond analysis in the absence of sources, we further derive optical chiral extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections under external drive and discuss their rigorous connection to more common circular dichroism measurements as well as their limitations in comparison to eigenfield chirality metrics. Finally, we investigate the conversion of achiral linearly polarized light into chiral elliptically polarized light through interaction with the BK system, illustrating the conservation of optical chirality in the interaction between light and matter through an analytically tractable example.},

In this work, we systematically investigate the multiple-order differential imaging based on two types of topological singularity in 1D photonic crystals (PhCs). For both oblique and normal incidences, we conduct a detailed investigation of differential imaging effect. For the oblique incident cases, the first type of topological singularities support first-order differential imaging in both x and y directions. Meanwhile, based on the second type of topological singularities, ∂ 2 / ∂ x ∂ y -type differential imaging can be achieved. For the normal incident cases, the first type of topological singularities can support radial second-order and fourth-order differential imaging and the second type of topological singularities can support radial fourth-order differential imaging without the need for fine-tuning of the structural parameters. We further demonstrate the realization of these differential imaging effects in the deep-subwavelength region by shifting the first type of topological singularities into this region. This research connects the topological properties of PhCs with optical differential imaging, paving the way for the development of multiple-order differential imaging devices with improved robustness and functionality.},

We have also derived analytical expressions for the STLG mode with an arbitrary radial and angular indices propagating in the isotropic media. The propagation dynamics can be understood as a unitary transformation generated by a conserved quantity, where the rotation angle is exactly the intermodal Gouy phase of the spatiotemporal modes in the same order subspace. This spatiotemporal Gouy phase depends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity dispersion of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation distance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion, anomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of anomalous dispersion, the nonmonotonic behavior induces both distortion and revival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked mechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.},

Starting from the linearized quantum Langevin equations, we derive the drift matrix and confirm system stability by verifying that all eigenvalue real parts remain negative. We then analyze the probe transmission spectrum under two complementary control mechanisms. First, with collisional interactions suppressed, increasing the OPA gain within the stability region transforms the standard Lorentzian cavity response into a tunable Fano-like profile, accompanied by asymmetric dispersive line shapes and pronounced group delays. Second, with the OPA turned off, including atomic collisions yields an intrinsically narrow Bogoliubov excitation that interferes with the cavity continuum, reproducing Fano resonances, “S-shaped” phase dispersion, slow- and fast-light windows, and positive Goos-Hänchen shifts. By examining both absorptive (real) and dispersive (imaginary) components of the transmitted field, we establish direct links between destructive interference pathways, steep phase slopes, and enhanced optical delays. Our results demonstrate that parametric amplification and collisional nonlinearities are equally versatile tools for engineering quantum interference in cavity QED with ultracold atoms, opening prospects for reconfigurable slow-light buffers, Fano-switchable photonic routers, and atom-integrated delay lines.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the focusing characteristics of scalar and vector beams within an atomic medium. An active-Raman-gain configuration is employed to achieve significant Kerr nonlinearity in a four-state atomic system. The probe beams can attain focusing within the medium through careful selection of input beam intensities and the spatial profile of the control field. We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.},

Moving beyond conventional linearized approximations, we derive analytical expressions for both the second-order sideband efficiency and mass-sensing sensitivity using a perturbation approach. Our scheme enables mass detection by monitoring shifts in the second-order sideband generation efficiency when a target mass is deposited on the dielectric membrane. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we identify the maximum achievable efficiency of the second-order upper sideband and its corresponding optimal sensitivity. Remarkably, with the aid of a gain cavity, both the sideband efficiency and mass sensitivity are significantly enhanced—particularly near the exceptional point, where improvements exceeding three orders of magnitude are demonstrated. This work provides a promising approach to high-precision mass measurement, advancing and complementing existing methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are electromagnetic eigenstates that theoretically exhibit infinite quality factors. However, scattering losses induced by manufacturing defects inevitably affect the confinement performance of BICs. Studies have shown that combining multiple BICs can enhance their robustness against such defects. Currently, approaches to merging BICs at off- points typically rely on altering the geometry of the central structure, which not only increases the complexity of device design but also potentially raises costs. Based on this, we propose a scheme that maintains the central structure while introducing specific defect holes to break the in-plane symmetry of the system, thereby inducing the splitting of the higher-order BIC and forming multiple off- BICs. Subsequently, these split BICs, along with the accidental BICs, will merge at the off- point as the structural parameters are varied. The proposed concept not only enhances optical confinement but also enables flexible control over the splitting direction of the higher-order BIC by manipulating the spatial positions of the defect apertures. More importantly, by rationally designing the positions of defects, we can construct merging BICs at arbitrary wave vectors through manipulations of split BICs and accidental BICs. Furthermore, even in the presence of manufacturing defects, the merging BICs demonstrate exceptional robustness. This provides new insights for the flexible control of BICs in diversified applications while also expanding their potential in a broader momentum space.},

In this study, we present a tunable bilayer optical matter motor controlled by distance-modulated electromagnetic interlayer coupling. Using the generalized Lorentz-Mie scattering theory for multispheres and the Langevin dynamics method, we investigate the dynamics of the bilayer motor during light-driven self-organization and rotation. Through the modulation of the interlayer distance to tune coupling effects, we demonstrate the capacity to selectively manipulate the rotation modes of the motor—both layers can rotate clockwise (receiving negative optical torque), rotate anticlockwise, or counterrotate. These modes arise from changes in the relative contributions of excited electric and magnetic multipoles, offering an intuitive understanding of interlayer coupling from the perspective of multipoles. The bilayer motor exhibits stable rotation across a wide range of coupling distances due to strong long-range electromagnetic coupling, and demonstrates excellent robustness to both the polarization of the incident light and structural offset from the beam center, facilitating experimental implementation. Our structural stability analysis indicates that bilayer optical matter motors constructed from equilateral triangular units maintain remarkable stability during light-driven self-organization and rotation, even with varying interlayer coupling. This research enhances our understanding of light-matter interactions in the dynamics of bilayer optical matter systems while providing theoretical foundations for novel micromotor design.},

Here, we propose a scheme for realizing the classical non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes in photonic waveguides system. The Hamiltonian of the designed system is built via the interplay between two sub-Hamiltonians, where one of them enables the non-Abelian braiding, while the other one generates the coupled modes. In this way, the non-Abelian braiding of coupled modes of arbitrarily high order can be realized. We carry out numerical simulations to verify the concept for coupled modes with an order of four, including the mode switching behavior as well as the non-Abelian geometric phase. The proposed concept may lead to on-chip applications including mode division multiplexing non-Abelian braiding.},

As an illustrative example, we employ a cosine-Gaussian correlated Schell-model pulse to conduct in-depth analyses. Our numerical results reveal that the obstructed pulses, with the help of the source degree of coherence, exhibit outstanding self-reconstruction properties in the nonlinear Kerr media. Although the nonlinearity can to some extent impair the self-reconstruction ability of pulses, ultrastrong self-reconstruction of the pulses can be achieved by reducing the optical coherence.

In this work, we propose an integrated and tunable transducer that combines a coplanar waveguide microwave resonator with a magno-optomechanical microcavity via flip-chip bonding. Benefiting from the broad frequency tunability of the magnon mode, the working frequency range can be tuned over several gigahertz. Through optimization of the geometry and pump powers, our design achieves a theoretical microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency exceeding 50% using experimentally achievable parameters, alongside a bandwidth greater than 10 kHz. An added noise near the quantum limit is achievable at 10 mK using lower pump powers at the cost of conversion efficiency or a pulsed-pump protocol.

PSS rises as increases, reaching a maximum of roughly 300 and 120 for the transverse and longitudinal shift values, respectively.

The first is independent of the tunneling parameter and emerges when the steady-state frequency of the mode is resonant with the TLS transition. This resembles lasing in uncoupled MCs and relies on population inversion. The second scenario arises from the nonreciprocal nature of dissipative tunneling and enables lasing of nonresonant modes even at vanishingly small population inversion, owing to energy redistribution across the network. In the latter case, interference effects along graph paths induce node-dependent frequency shifts and nonreciprocal photon transmission. We further propose a renormalization-group hypothesis for the PN to explain the observed spectral features. We analyze the phase structure of photonic modes in the scale-free RL and discuss its relevance for photonic Ising machines operating under the minimum power dissipation principle.},

Here, we study the quantum optical signatures of high-harmonic generation (HHG) from solid-state material driven by squeezed coherent states. We find that squeezed coherent states can either enhance or suppress the HHG yields compared to that driven by coherent light, depending on the photon bunching or antibunching characteristics of driving light. The analysis on semiclassical trajectories indicates that the amplitude fluctuation alters the recombination energy, while the phase fluctuation affects the birth and recombination time of electron-hole pairs. By calculating the Husimi Q distributions of HHG, we demonstrate that the squeezing of the two conjugate quadratures of driving light asymmetrically influence the squeezing phase of harmonics. Surprisingly, we find that even under coherent driving, the harmonics still exhibit squeezing due to the highly nonlinear response of solid-state HHG, which was overlooked previously. Numerical calculations of the Mandel parameter are performed to characterize the photon statistics of emitted HHG arising from different microscopic mechanisms. The results indicate that intraband radiation can exhibit a super-Poissonian distribution, while interband emission exhibits sub-Poissonian distribution under coherent driving.},

  abstract     = {Single-mode semiconductor lasers support fast nonlinear dynamics for investigating extreme events. Although one laser subject to perturbation is sufficient for yielding extreme events, multiple lasers with mutual interactions have yet to be considered. Here, extreme events are found experimentally using two detuned lasers under delayed mutual injection. The mutually injected lasers each emit an intensity that exhibits locking to a constant, except for interruptions by intermittent pulses, including very strong ones as extreme events. Such extreme eruptions from a constant background under mutual injection are different from the continual chaotic oscillations usually obtained under unidirectional injections. By varying the detuning frequency between the lasers, the intermittent pulsations with extreme events are found in a route that involves regular switching between constant and periodic oscillatory intensities. By adopting space-time representation, the extreme events are observed to emerge stochastically, together with some partial repetitions of pulses corresponding to a slightly lengthened round trip. By optimizing the detuning, the maximal normalized occurrence of extreme events reaches 0.8%, which is relatively high among approaches on lasers without external modulations for excitations. On average, about six extreme events are yielded within one round trip of 130 ns, while their short pulse widths are of the order of 0.1 ns. Applicable to generating strong random electrical pulses, the experiments point to the importance of mutual interactions in single-mode lasers for extreme events.},

The Photon extra-bunching effect, as a special class of the superbunching effect ( ), describes the enhanced photon correlation ( ) through the interference of bright twin beams produced in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In this work, we report that this effect can exist in classical beams and that can approach 4 in some extended extreme models. We experimentally demonstrate the nontrivial extra-bunching correlation ( gain) in pairwise-generated holographic thermal light beams with a Dove prism-embedded balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The interaction of such a pair of conjugated thermal light beams can generate a pair of uncorrelated superthermal light beams, enabling ghost imaging and Young's intensity interference with enhanced visibility. The quantum-inspired interference-induced spatial extra-bunching effect provides novel insights into inducing superbunching correlation in classical light and holds the potential for application in the coherent two-photon Lidar system to enhance sensitivity.},

In the dynamic equilibrium, the spot size, pulse duration, wave-front curvature, phase, and chirp evolve self-consistently along the propagation path. Significant intensity enhancement at remote distances is achieved by tailoring the laser parameters in such a way that the transverse and longitudinal focal points nearly coincide. In addition, the hybrid filamentation-modulation instability is analyzed and simulated, indicating that the beam breaks up transversely and longitudinally.

We have studied our levitated system over a wide range of trapping parameters and determined four distinct dynamical states of the trapped particle motion, which are associated with the retaining force and drag force nonlinearities. Like any other nonlinear system, the considered one possesses a phase transition in its behavior that demarcates linear and nonlinear regimes of motion. The nonlinear regime manifests itself as the formation of a specific limit cycle of the trapped particle motion also known as an extended orbit . We have shown that the birth of the extended orbits is foretold by the appearance of half-integer trapping frequency multiples in the particle motion oscillation. These half-integer multiples are highly sensitive to trapping parameters and external perturbation. We have demonstrated that the phase transition is a continuous process over a range of system parameters and can be exploited to detect small influences on the levitated system. We have tested the system response in the transient state to the external optical perturbation. The strong sensitivity to perturbation laser power has been shown for both the spectral composition of the trapped particle translational oscillations and extended orbit formation point. We believe in the potential to apply the nonlinear state of the levitodynamic system with massive particles to the field of precision measurements and nonequilibrium physics investigation.},

Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model.

  abstract     = {In the low-energy limit, nonrelativistic particles with short-range interactions exhibit universal behavior that is largely independent of microscopic details. This universality is typically described by effective field theory, in which the two-body interaction is renormalized to a single parameter—the scattering length. For systems of identical bosons, the three-body problem reveals the Efimov effect, a novel phenomenon proposed that necessitates the introduction of an additional three-body parameter. However, the exact relation between this three-body parameter, the coupling constants in the effective field theory, and the binding energies of Efimov states remains unresolved. In this work, we address this question through a comprehensive analysis of the Skorniakov–Ter-Martirosian equation with a finite cutoff. We establish an exact renormalization relation for the three-body parameter and determine its connection to the energies of Efimov bound states. These results are validated through high-precision numerical simulations. We expect our findings to be of fundamental interest across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics, and to have broad applications in both few-body and many-body physics.},

We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new Ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This Ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wave function, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement.

Any tilt of the Raman lasers with respect to the vertical direction introduces systematic errors in gravity measurements. In this work, we report a determination of the tilt of Raman lasers, where the fringe of the atom interferometer is scanned by varying the tilt, rather than the phase, of the Raman lasers. Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom interferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the tilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic in tilt and exhibits a shift due to the presence of a nonzero tilt. The tilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to the tilt-caused shift, enabling convenient and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom gravimeters. We demonstrate that one tilt-scanned fringe, corresponding to a tilt measurement sampling time of 13 s, can determine the tilt with a typical precision of about in our developed atom gravimeter. The short-term sensitivity and measurement accuracy of the tilt-scanned fringe method were evaluated, demonstrating performance comparable to conventional tilt determination techniques.

Novel phases are identified at moderate interaction strengths for both densities, and their robustness is investigated in the presence of flavor imbalance. Furthermore, we provide microscopic explanations of the phases found and their stability. Analysis of thermal ensembles of random mean-field solutions indicate that, at temperatures accessible in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments, some spin orders are hard for conventional scattering or local observable measurements to detect, but can be more accessible with quantum gas microscopy in optical lattice experiments. This work also shows that nesting and Mottness, intertwined in the usual SU(2) Hubbard model in stark contrast to generic materials, can be tuned in the SU(3) model and play distinct roles. The resulting phase diagrams not only deepen our understanding of Fermi-Hubbard models but also inform future experimental search for new phases.},

  abstract     = {We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes and confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible-to-miscible quenching transition, under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex production and sound-wave (phonon) propagation. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound-wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number . The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, and , for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals.},

  abstract     = {The most sensitive direct neutrino mass searches today are based on measurement of the end point of the spectrum of tritium to infer limits on the mass of the unobserved neutrino. To avoid the smearing associated with the distribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next generation of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than molecular tritium sources, at currents of at least atoms per second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational and/or magnetic bottles for spectrum experiments, if and only if it can first be cooled to millikelvin temperatures. Accomplishing this cooling presents substantial technological challenges. The Project 8 collaboration is developing a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline (MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magnetogravitational trap that also serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of the approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper presents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique and applies these calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic Li and T. A scheme is outlined that could provide a current of T at the millikelvin temperatures required for the Project 8 neutrino mass search.},

Invoking an ensemble-average formalism and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.},

When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or biconical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.

Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number-conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near-equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two, and three dimensions at high phase-space density and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full nonlinear SPGPE are in close agreement and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime.

We solve the Schrödinger equation for a fermionic system across a broad range of attractive and repulsive interactions by constructing the system's wave function as a superposition of two-coboson states. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. The density profiles calculated agree with both the Tonks-Girardeau and Lieb-Liniger limits and provide a portrait of the transition between those regimes. In the strong repulsive regime, the ansatz captures the Fridel-Wigner transition characterized by a doubling of the peaks in the density profiles. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the usefulness of the coboson superposition ansatz for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems.},

The dynamical phase diagram in nonlinear parameter space is presented, identifying oscillation regions with different skewed sinusoidal dependence, and diffusion regions with irreversible soliton spreading due to instability of the barrier.

In a two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature, in addition to the vortex drift-out process from the boundary, a vortex-antivortex pair can annihilate in bulk, but controversy remains on the number of vortices involved in the annihilation process. We find that a dynamic crossover exists from four-body to three-body vortex annihilation processes with time evolution in decaying 2D quantum turbulence of a boundary-less uniform quasi-2D BEC. Such a dynamical crossover depends on the initial vortex pair density and occurs when the sound waves generated in the vortex annihilation process surpass a threshold energy. As the confinement along the third direction is relaxed in a quasi-2D BEC, the threshold sound wave energy decreases due to the three-dimensional (3D) vortex line curve and reconnection, shifting the dynamical crossover to the early time. Our work reveals an elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy that may help understand exotic matter and dynamics in quantum liquids.},

The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric-field gradients in the molecular environment. The formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed, with their variance products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at steady state are also predicted for any spin quantum number.},

The technique relies on optical pumping in Autler Townes configuration, whose efficiency is controlled by the presence or absence of a Rydberg excitation. Taking rubidium atoms as an example, we give realistic estimates for the achievable fidelities and parameters. However, our protocol can be transferred to any other atomic species that features multiple stable states.

The corresponding ab initio simulations reveal a characteristic “knee” in the ionization yield at lower field intensities than in comparable two-electron systems. To understand the origin of this shift, a quantitative semianalytic model for double ionization of a three-electron atom has been created. In this model, ionization is treated as a combination of different scenarios and channels. Each channel is simulated with either quantitative rescattering theory (QRS) or a two-electron ab initio model. Analysis of the semianalytical results indicates that the shifted part of the “knee” is dominated by a recollision-excitation channel in which the rescattering electron initially escapes the parent atom from an inner orbital. This counterintuitive phenomenon is then discussed and explained.},

This work incorporates dephasing effects in the theoretical simulations of HHG from topological insulators described by finite-size tight-binding models. This is done by formulating a density-matrix approach in both length and velocity gauges within dipole approximation, with a gauge-invariant treatment of dephasing properly introduced such that the HHG response of a sufficiently large solidlike system is consistent with the periodic limit obtained using semiconductor Bloch equations. Applying the approach to Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains reveals how dephasing affects the impact of topological edge states on the HHG spectra. It is found that dephasing can either weaken or strengthen the spectral contrast between the topological and trivial phases, depending on which of the intra- and interband mechanisms is dominant for a specific harmonic in the trivial phase.},

We consider the photoeffect in which the ejected photoelectron is described by a vortex scattering state and characterized by a definite projection of its angular momentum on a given vortex axis. Although the plane-wave and vortex transition matrix elements can be expressed in terms of each other, the corresponding cross sections cannot. We develop a theory of the molecular photoeffect with vortex photoelectrons, which includes the introduction and analysis of various vortex photoionization observables and their averaging over molecular orientations. The averaging is essential for treating photoionization of randomly oriented molecules in the gas phase. We show that the averaged vortex differential cross sections reveal new chiral asymmetries caused by the chirality of the vortex photoelectron, which generalize the phenomenon of photoelectron circular dichroism. The theory is illustrated by calculations for the glyceraldehyde molecule described within the molecular zero-range potential model. We also propose and validate by calculations a scheme based on a ring-shaped forked grating which allows, at least in principle, to verify our predictions experimentally.},

We find that the cutoff position of the harmonic spectrum emitted from the ring-current state is extended, but the harmonic efficiency is reduced in a chirped IR field compared with a chirp-free IR field. This harmonic broadening can be well understood by the semiclassical three-step model and the quantum time-frequency analysis. By introducing a UV field into the chirped IR field with a proper chirp parameter, both the efficiency and chirality of harmonic spectrum can be improved. Our analysis indicates that the generation of the elliptically polarized harmonics can be attributed to the asymmetric emission of ionized electrons in the y direction. By optimizing the laser parameters, an isolated 98-as pulse with an ellipticity up to 0.94 is obtained by the broadband elliptically polarized supercontinuum.

Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy. Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [B. Ma and M. Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 236901 (2024) ], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter, which is a hallmark parameter for ultrafast light-matter interactions, alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons, and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.},

  abstract     = {In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, as the ionizing field increases we find that (1) in CO, orbital distortion is responsible for the switch of the position of the global maximum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to the opposite orientation, and (2) in , the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum to a local maximum. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction [OE-WFAT(1)] in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.},

The subsequent Larmor precession of the atomic magnetic moment is probed via continuous ionization by an optical dipole trap (ODT) laser. The resulting ionization fragments—photoelectrons and photoions—are detected in coincidence using a cold target recoil ion momentum spectrometer (COLTRIMS). While the ODT facilitates further cooling of the atoms, its continuous-wave laser field does not provide the pulsed timing reference typically required to extract photoelectron momentum distributions in COLTRIMS. Here, we present an extension of the standard COLTRIMS technique that exploits redundancies in the measured data to reconstruct the ionization time.

Spectroscopy of trapped atomic samples can greatly improve the accuracy of these tests. Trapping atomic hydrogen in an optical dipole trap or an optical lattice has never been achieved. Only trapping in magnetic fields that lead to large Zeeman shifts has been demonstrated. Standard techniques of atomic physics are difficult to apply to atomic hydrogen. The small mass of the atom and the large photon energy of the 1 S -2 P cooling transition significantly complicate Doppler cooling. This proposal introduces a photon recoil-assisted loading scheme that uses these properties to our advantage to load atomic hydrogen into an optical dipole trap without laser cooling. The magic wavelength (515 nm) for the 1 S -2 S clock transition (1.3-Hz natural linewidth) is easily accessible with current laser technology. Since the 1 S -2 S clock transition can be driven Doppler free, we do not require a very low temperature. Besides improving spectroscopy for fundamental science, such a system can also be used as a “computable” atomic clock that may one day justify the redefinition of the SI second in terms of the Rydberg constant.},

  abstract     = {Vortex states of photons or electrons are a novel and promising experimental tool across atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called superkick that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic Møller scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.},

We tabulate isotope shift coefficients for closed-shell systems from Ne to Og and benchmark selected open-shell cases, used to test the interpolation formula. A simple power-law interpolation reproduces calculated field shifts to within about 1% across the table, with the effective exponent growing from roughly 5 near to about 12 at . Due to the domination of inner shells, differences between neutrals and singly charged ions does not exceed a few percent, becoming noticeable mainly when an outer electron is removed. Therefore, these results may also be used for higher charge ions.},

  abstract     = {We perform real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations with Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate how the incident point and initial kinetic energy of hydrogen atom projectiles influence their interaction with a graphenelike structure. To evaluate the role of electronic excitations, we compare these nonadiabatic results against two adiabatic approaches: Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics and ground-state energy profiling. We find that the incident point strongly affects the hydrogen atom's postcollision kinetic energy, scattering angle, and the vibrational response of the graphene lattice. Trajectories that avoid direct collisions with carbon atoms lead to longer interaction times and reduced energy transfer, increasing the likelihood of hydrogen adsorption by facilitating penetration of the graphene's potential energy barrier. Comparison with adiabatic methods reveals that electronic excitations and other non-adiabatic effects—captured by TDDFT—play a significant role in modulating energy loss and scattering direction. These results underscore the importance of including electron dynamics to accurately model hydrogen-graphene interactions and highlight how both geometric and energetic factors govern adsorption and scattering outcomes.},

Further, by combining our computed NSD-PNC transition amplitudes with a Cs experiment [C. S. Wood et al. , Science 275 , 1759 (1997) ], we extract the value of the nuclear anapole moment and pion-mediated meson-nucleon coupling constant f π . The deviation in our f π from the standard model value could be attributed to the existence of new particles such as Z ′ bosons. By combining our nuclear spin-independent PNC calculation with experiment [ Science 275 , 1759 (1997) ], we extract the mass of the Z ′ boson to be M Z ′ > 1.6 TeV/ c 2 . To check the accuracy of the wave functions used in the calculations, we compute the excitation energies, E 1 transition amplitudes, and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants for ground and low-lying excited states. To improve the accuracy of the computed properties, we incorporate the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations are accounted for perturbatively. Our results on excitation energies, E 1 transition amplitudes, and hyperfine constants are in good agreement with the available experimental results. Our polarizability results using the FSPRCC theory match well with the experimental values. The values of parity-violating transition amplitudes from our calculations are in general on the lower side of the previous values. From a detailed analysis of electron correlations, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction and QED effects are important to get accurate results of NSD-PNC amplitudes in Cs. The largest cumulative contribution from the Breit and QED corrections is found to be approximately equal to 3.2% of the total value. The upper bound on the theoretical uncertainty in our calculated NSD-PNC amplitudes is estimated to be about 1%.},

This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.},

This phenomenon is different from that observed in recent experiments [ Science 370 , 339 (2020) ], which is related to the PMD along the propagation direction of the laser. This phenomenon holds even for H 2 + with short-range Coulomb potentials but disappears for atoms, different from that observed in attoclock experiments. We show that the molecular Coulomb potential near the two atomic centers plays an important role here, and theoretical models associated with a more accurate continuum wave function of the molecule are needed for reproducing this phenomenon. This phenomenon also appears for other molecules such as N 2 . It can be useful for ultrafast probing of molecules with a high resolution of several attoseconds or even zeptoseconds.},

In this work the wave-packet convergent close-coupling method is extended to calculating these cross sections for electrons ejected with energies from 1 to 75.4 eV. The approach utilizes a two-center expansion and correlated two-electron helium wave functions to describe the four-body proton-helium system. While there is good agreement with the experiment for electrons ejected with energies near the matching-velocity point, elsewhere, the results overall do not support the picture provided by the available measurements. Hence, further investigations, both theoretical and experimental, are necessary to resolve the intermediate-energy proton-helium differential ionization problem.},

Moreover, we determine the relative ratio of the two dissociation pathways for each channel. We find that proton emission in the first step of the sequential dissociation is the dominant process (94% branching ratio) for the channel involving the H migration of . It can be explained by the pyridine trication undergoing ultrafast hydrogen migration and forming a more stable -isomeric ion, which attenuates the ring-opening reactions.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a novel method that integrates quantum state preparation of polar molecular ions and the detection of spatially resolved fluorescence in specific regions to study the high-precision spectroscopy of molecular ions in traps. The detection technique not only enables real-time signal measurement but also suppresses common-mode noise arising from fluorescence fluctuations and reduces the state redistribution induced by blackbody radiation. Thus, this method overcomes the key limitations encountered during quantum state preparation of polar molecules through resonance-enhanced threshold photoionization. By utilizing this approach, we measured the ( ): rovibrational transition of ions, with an unperturbed frequency of 303.396 506 7(20) THz. This value is in excellent agreement with the predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Looking forward, our method could be extended to detect hot-band transitions of excited from highly excited rovibrational states. This provides high-precision tools for determining fundamental constants such as the proton-to-electron mass ratio and for exploring the unknown contributions of QED.},

Conventional approaches for remotely preparing entangled states typically require joint operations on multiple particles at the local site, which poses practical challenges in scalable quantum networks. Here, we propose a general remote quantum state preparation scheme based on an asymmetric maximally entangled state, where only single-particle operations are needed at the local node to prepare arbitrary multiqubit states at the remote site. We demonstrate this scheme experimentally on a linear optical platform, using a three-photon asymmetric entangled state as a resource. By applying single-particle operations on a four-dimensional photonic ququart, we remotely prepare arbitrary two-qubit states with fidelities ranging from 0.8534 to 0.9444, all surpassing the classical threshold. This approach simplifies local control requirements and offers a scalable route for remote entanglement generation in quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.},

Multiphase Hadamard codes, based on coherent-state binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and decoded using vacuum-or-pulse (VP) detectors, offer a promising approach for achieving high communication rates while relying only on linear optics and single-photon detectors (SPDs). However, their performance does not reach the ultimate Holevo limit. In this work, we propose a generalization of Hadamard codes that distributes the signal across multiple modes with optimized probabilities, rather than concentrating it in a single mode, dubbed probabilistic pulse-position modulation (PPPM). We derive an achievable communication rate, demonstrating that our PPPM can outperform traditional Hadamard codes in certain intermediate energy regimes.},

Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Subspace Methods, offer practical solutions but face limitations in circuit depth and measurement overhead. In this article, we propose a variational strategy based on symmetry-preserving cost functions to iteratively construct a reduced subspace for the extraction of low-lying energy states. We show that, under certain conditions, our approach leads to a tridiagonal representation similar to that obtained with the Lanczos algorithm. The iterative process allows control over the trade-off between circuit depth, the number of variational parameters, and the number of measurements required to achieve the desired accuracy, making it suitable for current quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we test the proposed algorithms on a H 4 chain and ring, targeting both the ground-state energy and the charge gap.},

We employ multichannel message-passing neural networks, with each channel tailored to address a specific error type. Our neural-network model is trained to minimize the weighted sum of different errors, based on frequency-dependent error models, e.g., two-level-system defects that affect individual qubits, quantum crosstalk that depends on the graph structure formed by qubit couplings, and microwave crosstalk that relies on the spatial arrangement of qubits. The trained neural-network model is adaptable to chips with varying qubit arrangements and scales. Recognizing the diverse experimental conditions of different chips, we compare our algorithm with the snake algorithm across various scales and error weights, providing valuable guidance for experimenters in algorithm selection.

  abstract     = {Ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays are an emerging platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental breakthroughs have enabled precise control over individual molecules, paving the way for implementing two-qubit quantum gates, based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is, however, the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength—stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials—that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasistatic deviations of either system Hamiltonian parameters, external control parameters, or both, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction using reasonable experimental parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled-state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only. We demonstrate that, under the adiabatic approximation, i.e., where molecular motion occurs on timescales comparable to, or faster, than that of the exchange interaction, the noise arising from thermal motion can be effectively treated as quasistatic variations of Hamiltonian parameters. This allows us to extend our treatment to the concrete experimental case of polar molecules.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multilevel qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in nonlocal operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the nonlocality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. Notably, for superconducting devices, the control complexity of qudits compared to qubits does not increase prohibitively for four-level systems, making them practical for near-term demonstrations, though control challenges grow with increasing dimensionality. Therefore, we provide solutions to the operator decompositions of the Trotterized quantum dynamics into one- and two-qudit gates for all mappings. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t − V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Finally, we show the connection between the plaquette constraint of our mapping and the Z 2 toric code. This connection can be exploited to prove that the ground state of the localized qudit mapping can be efficiently prepared using quantum circuits or measurement-based feedback control. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.},

In this work, measurement-based braiding about MZM Y junctions is simulated by multiqubit parity measurements of a logical qubit.

  abstract     = {Quantum coherence is critical resource for applications in quantum technology, among which quantum-enhanced sensing represents a typical example. Compared with quantum metrology with entangled states of multiple qubits, bosonic interferometers have the advantage of being hardware efficient, enabled by the infinite-dimension Hilbert space of bosonic modes. Phase estimations with precisions approaching the Heisenberg limit have been demonstrated with superpositions of Fock states of single bosonic modes. We here present a scheme for realizing quantum metrology based on a fundamentally distinct kind of superposition states, Schrödinger cat states, defined as quantum superpositions of two quasiclassial states of a bosonic mode. The interferometer aims to estimate the frequency shift of a photonic mode with respect to a reference frequency, which produces a phase-space rotation. We find that such a phase-space rotation can be extracted with a qubit, without mapping the state of the photonic mode to the qubit. This phase-space rotation is directly related to the qubit's population through the combination of a phase-space displacement, a dispersive qubit-photon interaction, and two qubit rotations. The signal-to-noise ratio exhibits a scaling approaching the Heisenberg limit, like interferometers based on Fock state superpositions, but without requiring a step-by-step procedure to prepare the resource state.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic-field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.},

  abstract     = {The computation of dynamical response functions is central to many problems in condensed matter physics. Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations following a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an efficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume access to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice. In this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter techniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical properties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only requires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired energy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from measurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We illustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical conductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent localization properties of the model.},

Using quantum estimation theory, we demonstrate that the ultimate limit for estimating the separation between two unequal-brightness thermal sources via interferometry remains constant, enabling the potential for superresolution. We give a comparative analysis of two primary stellar interferometric schemes: amplitude interferometry and intensity interferometry. Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) schemes have greatly enhanced the performance of quantum computers, mostly by reducing errors caused by interactions with the environment. Nevertheless, the presence of coherence errors, typically arising from miscalibration and interqubit crosstalk, is a significant challenge to the scalability of quantum computing. Such errors are often addressed using a refined Pauli twirling scheme called randomized compiling (RC) that converts the coherent errors into incoherent errors that can then be mitigated by conventional QEM. Unfortunately for multiqubit gates, RC is restricted to Clifford gates such as cnot and cphase . However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that a direct implementation of multiqubit non-Clifford gates, i.e., without using multiqubit Clifford gates, has reduced the depth of the circuit by a factor of four and more. Recently, a framework called pseudotwirling (PST) for treating coherent error in multiqubit non-Clifford gates has been introduced and experimentally demonstrated. We show analytically that a higher-order correction to the existing PST theory yields an over-rotation coherent error generated by the PST protocol itself. This PST effect has no analog in RC. Although the small induced over-rotation can amount to a significant coherent error in deep circuits, we explain why it does not degrade the performance of the gate. Interestingly, we find that a simplified twirling scheme that was introduced and exploited experimentally by Kim et al . also displays an induced over-rotation. We study the conditions under which the two twirling schemes display the same over-rotation behavior.},

Consequently, there is a correspondence between qubit count and the size of the native gate set. One might then wonder, what is the smallest number of auxiliary qubits that still allows for universal parity computing? Here, we demonstrate that the answer is 1 if the number of logical qubits is even, and 2 otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing. As a consequence, we obtain (i) minimal implementations of the parity framework on, e.g., a triangular lattice, (ii) hardware-specific implementations of the parity flow framework on, e.g., a heavy-hex lattice, and (iii) novel universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation.},

Here, we treat them on equal footing in controlling a finite-dimensional quantum system under a time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which is inspired by the D'Alembert principle of regarding active force, constraint force, and inertial force in an unbiased way. Under the biorthogonal condition, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, which is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces. The passage ends up with a desired target state that is automatically normalized without artificial normalization in the existing treatments for non-Hermitian quantum systems. Moreover, the passage is found to be robust against the parametric deviation when the real part of its global phase is rapidly varying with time. Our protocol is explicitly verified for the perfect population transfer in the two-level system and the chiral population transfer in the three-level system. It generalizes our framework of universal quantum control to the field of the biorthogonal quantum mechanics.},

However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal-noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods.

However, existing IGTBQC protocols lack mechanisms for clients to verify the correctness of computation results and deal with only one type of clients capable of preparing qubits. To address these limitations, we first extend the current IGTBQC protocol to be a verifiable one and then propose another verifiable IGTBQC protocol tailored for a different type of clients with the capability of measuring single-qubit states. Furthermore, both protocols are shown to satisfy blindness and verification simultaneously in a relatively formal way.

  abstract     = {This study investigates the entanglement dynamics of a bipartite system comprising two two-level atoms, initially prepared in a pure entangled state and independently coupled to spatially separated cavities under local squeezed thermal environments. We demonstrate that environmental interactions induce entanglement sudden death (ESD), leading to the abrupt loss of quantum correlations. To mitigate this effect, we propose a protocol involving local unitary operations—X gate and XX gate —applied to the time-evolved state. We further analyze the impact of these operations under symmetric and asymmetric probability amplitudes of the atomic states, considering variations in thermal and squeezing parameters across different reservoirs. Our results show that these operations extend entanglement duration in specific reservoir conditions, while in the case of a vacuum reservoir, they transform ESD into asymptotic decay for both symmetric and asymmetric probability amplitudes of the atomic states. Moreover, independent variations of the thermal and squeezing parameters in each reservoir influence the dynamics of local gate operations, thereby affecting the overall entanglement evolution. Additionally, applying these operations at an earlier stage of the system's evolution can further delay ESD. This scheme offers valuable insights into entanglement behavior and its resilience under various noisy environmental conditions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with physical learning applications in physics and quantum chemistry.},

Device-independent conference key agreement (DI-CKA) is multipartite DI-QKD in which more than two parties share a common secure key. The performance of DI-CKA, however, is strictly limited because of its susceptibility to losses due to, e.g., imperfect detection efficiency and channel transmission. Here, we propose a DI-CKA protocol which reduces this limitation by using a heralding scheme to distribute multipartite entanglement. We analyze key rates of our protocol for two different measurement scenarios, and we show that our protocol outperforms a previous DI-CKA protocol even with an experimentally feasible measurement.},

In this work, we construct a sequence of physically feasible dynamical decoupling operators for the three-level system to mitigate not only the transverse dephasing between the excited state and ground states, but also the longitudinal relaxation among them. Combining the Hamiltonian engineering and our constructed dynamical decoupling sequence, we further realize the dynamical decoupling protection of qutrit-based quantum gates.

Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using only local Pauli measurements to perform DFE with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), and Dicke states, establishing tighter bounds (by factors of 14.22 and 16 for GHZ and /Dicke, respectively) on the number of measurements required for desired precision. These protocols are derived by adjusting the distribution of observables. Notably, they require no preprocessing steps other than the sampling algorithms.},

It is found that if we define the evolution speed of a quantum unitary system as the changing rate of the path distance between a quantum state and the state during its evolution, the instantaneous evolution speed is determined by the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues, rather than its expectation value or variance imposed on any quantum state. More specifically, the range of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues determines the evolution speed of a quantum system through the relation ω H = 1 2 ( λ max − λ min ) , which is independent of the quantum state. Given an initial state ρ 0 in a quantum unitary system, the minimum time required to evolve it to a target state ρ τ is τ min = L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) ω H , where L min ( ρ 0 , ρ τ ) is the path distance contained in the shortest evolution from ρ 0 to ρ τ .

Our findings suggest that evaluating the performance of quantum variational circuits against variational circuits with subuniversal gate sets is a valuable benchmark for identifying areas where quantum variational circuits can excel.},

  abstract     = {The difficulty of training variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning models is well established. In particular, quantum loss landscapes are often highly nonconvex and dominated by poor local minima. While this renders their training NP hard in general, efficient heuristics that work well for typical instances may still exist. Here we propose a protocol that uses a targeted noise injection to smooth and regularize quantum loss landscapes. It works by exponentially suppressing the high-frequency components in the Fourier expansion of the quantum loss function. The protocol can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and simulations. We observe significant and robust improvements of solution quality across various problem types. Our method can be combined with existing techniques mitigating the local minima, such as the quantum natural gradient optimizer, and adds to the toolbox of methods for optimizing quantum loss functions.},

  abstract     = {In the scenario of the probe-ancilla interaction, we propose a quantum metrology protocol by the unconditional measurement on the ancillary qubit after an optimized period of joint evolution from a product state. Its key element is the construction of two parallel evolution paths by the measurement that can transform the probe system (a spin ensemble) from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ to a superposed state ( | 𝑗 , 𝑚 ⟩ + | 𝑗 , − 𝑚 ⟩ ) / ⁢ √ 2 . With synchronous parametric encoding and qubit measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system with optimized initial states can exactly attain the Heisenberg scaling 𝑁 2 with respect to the probe size (spin number) 𝑁 . The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time, the time delay between encoding and measurement, and the coherence in the probe ensemble or the ancillary system that would be degraded by local dephasing. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle joint evolution after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states can hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.},

In this work, a protocol for quantum noise spectroscopy is presented by qudit spectators, that are arbitrary -level quantum systems passively spectating noises, which possess stochastic and stationary Gaussian distributions. The protocol uses Weyl basis decomposition, consisting of generalized Pauli matrices, as the theoretical tool, and the Alvarez-Suter noise spectroscopy method, by which the qudit is being exposed to a series of pulse sequences, and the noise polyspectra is extracted by multiple measurements of an observable of the qudit. The formalism is further developed and simulated for three theoretical frameworks: The first two frameworks utilize a simplified Weyl basis and are capable of detecting -type dephasing noise. One is specifically modeled for a qutrit ( = 3), and the second framework is designed for all qudits and has been tested through simulations of a ququad ( = 4) and a quoct ( = 8). The third framework employs the full Weyl basis, enabling it to identify all types of XYZ -dephasing noise. The simulations for this framework have been conducted for a quoct ( = 8) implemented by the antimony atom. The analytical protocol for noise spectroscopy that has been introduced transforms qudit systems into quantum spectators, and the presented simulations demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this noise spectroscopy protocol.},

In the present work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system.

In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE, we obtain an average reduction of the error by ( 18.2 ± 0.5 ) % and ( 52.8 ± 6.3 ) % for the respective above observables.

We find that the unit effectively removes leakage with minimal effect on the qubit subspace by taking advantage of energy level disorder for the qubit subspace and resonant leakage energy levels. There are two optimal measurement rates for removing leakage, which we show analytically to correspond to the characteristic timescales of the propagation and disintegration of the leakage excitation. The performance of the leakage removal unit depends on the strength of disorder, coupling between the transmons, and the length of the array. We simulate the system under experimentally feasible parameters and present an optimal configuration.

Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain optimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about the scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize variational quantum loss functions for random Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization instances in the presence of uncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical noise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size grows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss variance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of VQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required measurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated loss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderatelysized problems. Our findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in optimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to achieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.},

If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) by Van Herstraeten et al. [ Quantum 7 , 1021 (2023) ]. In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general N -mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of N -mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.},

  abstract     = {Geometric phases depend only on the evolution path determined by the closed circuit in the projective Hilbert space but not on evolution details of the quantum system, leading to geometric quantum computation possessing some intrinsic robustness against control errors. Coordinated with dynamical decoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the environment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption of physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the logical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we put forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation based only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the additional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as well as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our scheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and its environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather regular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and effective approach towards the realization of geometric control with decoherence mitigation.},

  abstract     = {The quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement is one of the most studied quantum measurement procedures. Usually, such a process involves the coupling of a single system of interest, called signal, with a single probe system, so that the relevant information in the signal system is indirectly measured by observing the probe system. Here we extend the concept of quantum nondemolition interaction to the cases in which the signal and the probe systems are each one multipartite continuous-variable system. Specifically, we propose a general scheme that performs the multipartite QND interactions, relying on beam-splitter couplings between the signal and probe modes with only two ancillary modes prepared offline in squeezed states. The scheme is also composed of homodyne detection and feedforward modulation. The ancillary modes are detected in the process, providing photocurrents for postmodulation of the output systems, as well as sufficient information to calculate genuine multipartite entanglement conditions of the input systems and to monitor similar conditions of the output systems.},

Recently the study of quantum correlations in networks has undergone remarkable progress owing to technological development towards scalable quantum networks. However, compared to the standard Bell scenario, manifestation of the interplay between these two aspects has received less attention in network scenarios featuring independent sources. In this work we have analyzed the relation between entanglement content of the sources and detectable non- -locality in two distinct network topologies (linear and star). We have studied the extremal violations of -local inequalities (compatible with linear and star network) for any fixed amount of entanglement (in terms of concurrence) of the independent sources. It is observed that each of the sources must be entangled for detecting non- -locality in a linear network. However, the same is not true for star -local network. The present analysis reveals that entanglement of all the independent sources is not a necessity for generation of non- -local correlations in star topology. Characterization of sources in terms of the minimum entanglement requirement for any fixed violation amount of the -local inequalities is also provided. Interestingly, detection of non- -locality is ensured in the network if product of concurrence of all the sources involved exceeds},

Our main results are the following bounds on the relative entropy of entanglement after evolution: , connecting it on one side to the initial relative entropy of coherence and information extractable from the environment and on the other side to the decoherence strength, making the statement that larger entanglement leads to more decoherence quantitatively precise. As an illustration, we apply our results to the spin-boson model, where a qubit interacts with a bosonic bath, showing the time evolution of the entanglement and the crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Our results help us better understand and quantify the complicated correlations produced during open evolution, which will hopefully lead to better and new decoherence-mitigation techniques.},

This duration is referred to as the lifetime of a quantum system. In this paper, we investigate the lifetime of a two-level atomic system undergoing spontaneous emission. We construct an exact statistical ensemble of the lifetimes for two-level systems using quantum reliability theory, incorporating comprehensive information such as mean values, fluctuations, and non-classical properties. Notably, we demonstrate that the ensemble exhibits can be represented by a density matrix, which is recorded in the monitoring apparatus by an observation process. Under the Born-Markov approximation, the diagonal elements decay exponentially at a state-dependent rate related to quantum fidelity. Beyond this approximation, the off-diagonal elements arise from interference between radiation pathways and are determined by the first-order coherence of the field. This feature indicates that the off-diagonal elements encode spectral information beyond the Markovian decay rate, suggesting a potential protocol for probing the environmental spectral density using two-level atoms.},

Next, we consider a single defect in a topologically nontrivial lattice with time-reversal symmetry based on the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger configuration. We unveil how topologically nontrivial defect states and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from topologically nontrivial defect states to skin states.

In addition to the conventional time-conditional (Schrödinger) wave function ψ ( x , y , z | t ) , we introduce space-conditional wave functions such as ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) , where x plays the role of the evolution parameter. The function ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) represents the probability amplitude for the particle to arrive on the plane x = constant at time t and transverse position ( y , z ) . More generally, within our framework, any coordinate x μ ∈ { t , x , y , z } can be conveniently chosen as the evolution parameter, depending on the experimental context. This leads to a unified formalism governed by a generalized Schrödinger-type equation P ̂ μ | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 = i ℏ η μ ν d d x ν | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 . It reproduces standard QM when x μ = t , with | ϕ 0 ( x 0 ) 〉 = | ψ ( t ) 〉 , and recovers the STS extension when x μ = x i ∈ { x , y , z } . For a free particle, we show that ϕ ( t , y , z | x ) = 〈 t , y , z | ϕ ( x ) 〉 naturally reproduces the same dependence on the momentum wave function as the axiomatic Kijowski distribution. Possible experimental tests of these predictions are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the different states | ϕ μ ( x μ ) 〉 can emerge by conditioning (i.e., projecting) a timeless and spaceless physical state onto the eigenstate | x μ 〉 , leading to constraint equations of the form P ̂ μ | Φ μ 〉 = 0 . Rather than privileging time as the sole evolution parameter, this formulation treats all coordinates on equal footing.},

Recent advancements in randomized measurement techniques have provided fresh insights in this area. Specifically, protocols such as classical shadow tomography and shadow overlap have been proposed. Building on these developments, we investigate the fundamental properties of schemes that certify pure quantum states through random local Haar measurements. We derive bounds for sample fluctuations that are applicable regardless of the specific estimator construction. These bounds depend on the operator size distribution of either the observable used to estimate fidelity or the valid variation of the reduced density matrix for arbitrary observables. Our results unveil the intrinsic interplay between operator complexity and the efficiency of quantum algorithms, serving as an obstacle to local certification of pure states with long-range entanglement.},

The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudomagnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus nongeodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction.

However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here we introduce a class of prethermal DTCs termed “unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals” (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform or staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.},

We prove that the degree of degeneracy at any given state corresponds to the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic form when restricted to the manifold of states that are locally unitary equivalent with . Additionally, we provide a physical interpretation of this symplectic indicator of entanglement, articulating it as an inherent ambiguity within the associated classical dynamical framework. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of symplectic geometry in elucidating entanglement properties in quantum mechanics and suggest avenues for further exploration into the geometric structures underlying quantum state spaces.},

  abstract     = {The Mpemba effect has garnered growing attention and diverse interpretations within the realm of quantum physics. Recently, Medina et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 220402 (2025) ] introduced the ergotropic Mpemba effect in quantum batteries governed by Markovian dynamics, highlighting the anomalous phenomenon where batteries in higher ergotropy states discharge faster than those in lower ergotropy states. Building on this foundation, our research proposes an all-optical scheme to realize the ergotropic Mpemba effect in open quantum systems, and further investigates its implications in systems exhibiting non-Markovian dynamics. We find that the ergotropic Mpemba effect persists in non-Markovian dynamics. In the strong non-Markovian regime, prior to the occurrence of the ergotropic Mpemba effect, the ergotropy evolution shows multiple crossings, which we refer to as the quasiergotropic Mpemba effect . Moreover, we derive the analytical solution for the critical point at which the ergotropic Mpemba effect occurs, and we establish the necessary conditions for this effect to emerge. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme based on continuous-variable quantum circuits to realize our theoretical prediction.},

Irrespective of the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation for the battery, which is found to be equivalent to the high-order Fermi's golden rule adapted to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and spontaneous decay.

We investigate both a two-qubit system, with swap and controlled- not gates, and -qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.},

Using this protocol, we numerically simulate a Grover walk search algorithm in a cubic network with circuit QED. Our simulations, which consider decoherence, align well with theoretical predictions.

Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally . That is, we derive a time-independent bound on the leakage itself, expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the norm of the perturbation, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times.

While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement.

The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. We obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the enhancement of the photon number's susceptibility with a scaling larger than the enhancement of the standard deviation of the photon number.

This is achieved by spectrally overlapping the magnetic dipole resonance with the electric toroidal and magnetic quadrupole modes. Then the destructive interference between the Cartesian electric dipole and the electric toroidal mode suppresses the spherical electric dipole response and thus generates a nonradiating anapole mode, enabling ideal magnetic resonance scattering with overlapping magnetic dipole and quadrupole responses in the far field. Moreover, the wavelengths of magnetic resonance responses are tunable in the visible light range.},

With a recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of three Pauli matrices in 2D quasimomentum space plus 1D time , and then respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the CS invariants near and 0, which are consistent with theoretical predictions.

Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.},

Here thermal resonance-enhanced transparency (TRET) is induced when the detuning of the two lasers is adjusted to compensate the atomic thermal-motion-induced energy shifts, i.e., single- and two-photon Doppler shifts. We show that the atomic velocity is mapped into the transmission of the probe fields, which can be altered by independently and selectively exciting different velocity groups through sweeping the detuning. The maximal transmission in TRET is about 8 times higher than that under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Utilizing the TRET effect, we enhance the sensitivity of a Rydberg microwave receiver to be 28.7 nV cm − 1 Hz − 1 / 2 , ultimately reaching a factor of 2.1 of the EIT case. When atoms of separate velocity groups are excited simultaneously by multiple laser sets of different detuning, the receiver sensitivity increases with the number of laser sets. Our study paves the way to exploit light-matter interaction via the TRET, and contributes to current efforts in developing quantum sensing, primary gas thermometry, and wireless communication with room-temperature atomic gases.},

In phase I of the protocol we create a spin-squeezed state by measuring the light's polarization rotation due to the Faraday effect in a balanced polarimeter, equivalent to a homodyne measurement. In phase II we send a second probe beam through the sample and detect single photons scattered into the signal mode. Before doing so, we rotate the uncertainty bubble to increase the projection fluctuations of the measured spin component. This increases the coupling strength between the atoms and photons and thus the rate of scattering of single photons into the signal mode. In the ideal case, the result is a squeezed Dicke state, with substantial quantum advantage for sensing spin rotations. We benchmark the protocol's utility in the presence of inevitable decoherence due to optical pumping using the Fisher information as a measure of quantum advantage. We show that in the presence of decoherence, the quantum Fisher information associated with the non-Gaussian mixed state we prepare is substantially larger than the classical Fisher information obtained from the standard measurement of spin rotations. We deduce a measurement basis that is close to optimal for achieving the quantum Cramér-Rao bound in the presence of decoherence.},

Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.},

Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an n -degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an ( n − 1 ) -degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional 2 n -photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral instabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully treated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian. The stabilizing terms preserve low-photon subspaces, avoid negative infinite energies, and facilitate reliable numerical calculations used to validate analytical predictions. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing various nonlinear effects.},

For an incident photon pair, we find near-perfect single excitation transfer efficiency with negligible double excitation transfer in the weak-coupling regime. In the strong-coupling regime, single excitation transfer efficiency was greater than , while the double excitation efficiency was approximately . We have found that the three main factors which determine high transfer efficiencies are large acceptor probabilities, long acceptor decay times, and strong photon-ring coupling.

  abstract     = {Noiseless quantum amplifiers are probabilistic quantum devices that enhance the amplitude of coherent states without adding any noise, which has far reaching applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing. Here, we report on an experimental implementation of an advanced noiseless quantum amplifier for coherent states of light that is based on the conditional addition of two photons followed by the conditional subtraction of two photons. We comprehensively characterize the noiselessly amplified coherent states via quantum state tomography and analyze the amplification gain and noise properties of the amplifier. We observe very good agreement between the experiment and theoretical predictions. Our work reveals that sequences of multiple photon additions and subtractions represent an efficient and experimentally feasible alternative to multiplexing that was originally proposed to boost the performance of noiseless quantum amplifiers. Beyond noiseless quantum amplification, our experiment represents a significant step forward towards engineering complex quantum operations on traveling light beams by coherent combinations of various sequences of multiphoton additions and subtractions.},

  abstract     = {We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of | 0 〉 and | 1 〉 , the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon nonclassical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and have applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark-matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.},

  abstract     = {We predict and experimentally demonstrate a type of collective (cooperative) coupling effect where a disordered atomic ensemble absorbs light with a rise time longer (i.e., at a rate slower) than what is dictated by single-atom physics. This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as the absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a dilute ensemble of ultracold Rb 87 atoms with a low optical depth, and time resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant laser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on establishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction is not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly susceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 µ K is enough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a theoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. The model uses the density-dependent dephasing rate of the long-range dipole-dipole correlations as a single adjustable parameter. Experiment-theory comparison indicates a dephasing coefficient of β / 2 π = 4.9 × 10 − 5 Hz cm 3 , which is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the known dipole-dipole line broadening coefficient in Rb 87 .},

We derive an analytical expression for transmittance by using the scattering formalism for three distinct sublattice sites (A, B, and AB) of the waveguide, which couple to the system. We have demonstrated that the system's response is topology independent for A and B sublattice-site coupling and becomes topology dependent for AB sublattice-site coupling. In a weak-control-field regime, the system behaves as a perfect mirror in all of these configurations. Upon control field strength enhancement, the transmission spectrum evolves from Electromagnetically Induced Transparency to Autler-Townes splitting in A and B sublattice-site coupling. The manipulation of transmission from opaque to transparent holds the key mechanism of a single-photon switching. Furthermore, the topology-dependent AB sublattice configuration allows multiple-path-induced quantum interference, resulting in the sharper Fano line shape. This topological Fano resonance is not only tunable via the control field and coupling strength but also robust against structural imperfections due to the topological nature of the waveguide. These combined features such as tunability and topological protection make our system a promising platform for next-generation quantum technologies, including single-photon switches, high-resolution sensors, and communication devices.},

The four-detector PNR case admits an analytic result valid for any combination of parameters, while all other cases leverage low-efficiency approximations to arrive at closed-form expressions. Interestingly, our model reveals appreciable fidelity improvements from four detectors as opposed to two but minimal advantages for PNR over threshold detectors in the regimes explored.

  abstract     = {We investigate dissipative superradiant phase transitions and multicritical effects in an open dual-coupling Jaynes-Cummings model, where two cavity fields are simultaneously coupled to a single atom. The cavity fields are squeezed via a nondegenerate optical parametric amplification process. We show that the interplay between interactions, two-mode squeezing, and dissipation leads to rich critical behaviors, including both first-order and second-order superradiant phase transitions. The critical points are governed by the detunings between atomic (or photonic) frequencies and external pump field. Thus, these transitions can occur in the strong-coupling regime and can be easily controlled by tuning the external pump field. Utilizing the mean-field theory that explicitly neglects quantum fluctuations, we determine the phase-transition boundaries in the steady state. Additionally, we employ a full quantum description of the lowest-energy Hamiltonian in the large atomic detuning limit to analyze the quantum fluctuations. Notably, the phase diagram features two tricritical points where the critical lines of first-order and second-order phase transitions meet. Furthermore, when the two coupling pathways have specific coupling strengths, increasing the external pump strength can drive the system from the normal phase to the superradiant phase. Our work offers new insights into dissipative phase transitions and multicriticality, with potential applications in quantum sensing and information processing.},

Here, using the polarization-dependent longitudinal and transverse optical beam shift as a platform, we experimentally realize a classical optical analog of the quantum joint weak measurement. Polarization states are cleverly pre- and postselected, and different single and joint canonical position-momentum observables of the beam are experimentally extracted and subsequently analyzed for successful detection of the complex joint weak value.

We furthermore show how this parametric process can be exploited to generate optical frequency combs with a tunable repetition rate.},

Most analytical solutions available today for ultrashort optical solitons are obtained upon neglecting a number of relaxation terms in the governing equations for the medium response. The suggested method is based on finding explicit analytical expressions for the extended soliton tails distant enough from the soliton central part, when taking into consideration all relaxation processes. These soliton tails can be described by the linearized equations for the medium response both at the soliton leading and trailing edges. Afterwards, the analytical expressions for the soliton tails and its central part can be matched to yield the full analytical description of ultrashort dissipative solitons with all relaxation processes in the resonant medium properly treated. The proposed approach is demonstrated for ultrashort dissipative solitons in a resonant medium consisting either of only amplifying resonant two-level centers or of a mixture of amplifying and absorbing two-level centers.},

Our approach replaces traditional mechanical elements in cavity optomechanics with molecular vibrations, allowing optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) to emerge even in regimes with ultralow optical quality factor ( Q ) that are typically inaccessible to standard cavity optomechanics. We observe that the OMIT window exhibits gain at very low Q factor and with a large number of molecular ensembles. Specifically, we demonstrate dynamic control of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) by tuning the optical susceptibility through parameters such as molecular resonance, collective coupling strength, and the Q factor. Our method first computes the coefficients of the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) components of reflected light using the Fresnel formula, demonstrating the transverse shift of reflected light from positive to negative at the Brewster angle. Our findings suggest that molecular ensembles are a viable platform for room-temperature nanophotonics, facilitating spin-controlled signal processing and quantum-enhanced sensing through integrated optomechanics and spin-orbit coupling.},

Nevertheless, a key challenge remains: precisely controlling the factor of these resonances is difficult, and maintaining a high- factor across a wide range of incident angles is even more demanding. Here, we achieve substantial enhancement of THG by introducing perturbations within the metasurface. The guided modes below the light line can be folded into the light cone, resulting in high- resonant modes. Compared with previous BICs, this folded resonance exhibits a persistent high- characteristic in momentum space, which makes it possible to achieve angular insensitive nonlinear enhancement. The angular robustness of the proposed metasurface ensures consistent high nonlinear performance, making it a viable candidate for practical applications in nonlinear optics, such as frequency conversion and photonic signal processing.},

Furthermore, particular emphasis is placed on the impact of Kerr nonlinearity strength on the propagation and self-healing properties of EABs. By varying the input power, it is found that EABs within a moderate power range can propagate longer distances while maintaining higher intensity and exhibit improved robustness after being blocked, indicating better self-healing performance. Based on this analysis, an explanation of the physical mechanism related to the enhanced self-healing capability by Kerr nonlinearity is proposed.

The theoretical claims of strong spin-dependent absorption in subwavelength elements is validated by experimentally demonstrating nonreciprocal absorption and transmission from a single gyromagnetic rod placed in a substrate integrated waveguide.},

  abstract     = {We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When decoupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions—one for each coupled state—which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust interstate transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multiphase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.},

  abstract     = {The paradigmatic Lugiato-Lefever model describes the electric field envelope in a ring cavity filled with a Kerr medium and driven by a coherent injected laser beam. This model is applied to the formation of frequency combs associated with localized structures in micro and macroresonators. Including temporal filtering, we derive a generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation. This equation includes diffusion, linear, and nonlinear convection, and third-order dispersion with purely imaginary coefficients. Multiscale analysis enables us to disregard higher-order terms, such as nonlinear convection and third-order dispersion. We investigate the formation of periodic and localized structures resulting from the combined action of temporal spectral filtering effect together with Kerr nonlinearity, pumping, dissipation, and frequency detuning. We show that spectral filtering reduces the intensity of the output field and increases the period of traveling solutions. Similarly, the maximum intensity of moving localized structures, often called dissipative solitons, is reduced. In addition, we show that the threshold associated with breathers is shifted toward large input intensities and that the associated domain of existence is significatively reduced. We show that, when the drift is absent, dissipative solitons exhibit a homoclinic snaking bifurcation. Increasing the strength of the temporal filter reduces the pinning range. The presence of the drift breaks the homoclinic snaking and transforms it into isolas of solutions.},

Such solitonic structures formed in normal-dispersion resonators typically manifest as flat-top solitonic pulses, known as platicons. The two orthogonally polarized modes inside the fiber resonator are pumped with the same conditions and the generation of vector platicons (VPs) is achieved via a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the intracavity structures in a process when scanning the pump frequency from the blue-shift to the red-shift detuning side. The characteristics of the SSB are studied in detail. Also, the impact of the third-order dispersion (TOD) and the desynchronization on the VP dynamics are studied, revealing that the oscillating structure on the leading edge of VPs can be alleviated by introducing a desynchronization effect. What's interesting is that desynchronization can be used as an additional degree of freedom to control VP behaviors. For a small desynchronization, we observe the energy exchange between the two orthogonally polarized modes. For a large desynchronization, periodic and deterministic switching dynamics between the two orthogonally polarized modes can be obtained.},

A clear hierarchy emerges in the pairing behavior, shaped by the competition between the local density of states and the Fermi-momentum mismatch. A fidelity-based analysis of the density further distinguishes smooth crossovers from sharp spatial reorganizations.

Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases.},

In this study we propose a method to verify quantum interference within the two-body loss rate that arises from multiple inelastic-scattering channels, where the colliding particles are initially prepared in their individual hyperfine states. Our approach employs a ring-coupling configuration, accomplished by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. To validate our proposal, we perform close-coupling calculations for collisions at the ultracold limit. The results reveal that the interference profile, as manifested in the two-body loss rate, can be verified with optimized external field parameters. Notably, our findings indicate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits a distinct pattern of constructive or destructive interference when crossing a magnetically induced -wave resonance in the incoming channel. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced as the intensities of the external fields increase.

Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density trench region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem and recovers the desired cosmological behavior.

We calculate the contact, a quantity which measures the strength of the short-range correlations, as a function of temperature at unitarity and as a function of the coupling strength at fixed temperature and find good agreement with a variational approach based on a single particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We compare our results for the contact with recent experiments and find good agreement at unitarity (within error bars) but we observe discrepancies away from unitarity on the BEC side of the crossover.

Our analysis includes the definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and an additional phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows.

When one of the rings is cut with a barrier, we find that phase fluctuations around that ring can be large enough to degrade the reliability of protocols for control of quantized circulation states. The effect is greatest when the one-dimensional density is low and the coupling between rings is negligible. In this limit, our measurements are consistent with a correlation length smaller than the system size, as expected from theory.

  abstract     = {Interaction plays a key role in the mixing properties of a multicomponent system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra- and intercomponent two-body contact interactions. However, in the strongly interacting regime interaction-induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction-induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the MIT condition when both the components are in superfluid, one-body staggered superfluid, or supersolid phases. Our study uncovers that MIT condition is significantly shaped by the interplay of competing nonlocal intra- and intercomponent density-induced tunneling effects, as well as off-site interactions. Notably, we demonstrate that the MIT condition for the staggered superfluid phase exhibits an inequality that is inverted compared to the conventional MIT condition associated with superfluid or supersolid phases driven by local contact interactions. In addition, we present the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model incorporating nonlocal processes, derived using a site-decoupling mean-field approach with the Gutzwiller ansatz. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multicomponent systems in the strongly interacting regime.},

Our study reveals distinct dynamical regimes: first, vortex distortion accompanied by density cloud fragmentation, matching the initial vortex number, and second, vortex revival, where fragmented densities interact and merge. Notably, we observe complete vortex revival dynamics in the single-vortex case, pseudorevival in double- and triple-vortex configurations, and irregular many-body dynamics in systems with multiple vortices.

If these devices are additionally subjected to an optical lattice potential, then they can incorporate strong-coupling Mott physics within the design, which can modify the behavior and can allow for interesting new configurations of barriers and of superfluid flow patterns. We examine theoretically the behavior of a Bose superfluid in an optical lattice in the presence of an annular trap and a barrier across the annular region which acts as a Josephson junction. As the superfluid is rotated, circulating supercurrents appear. Beyond a threshold superfluid velocity, phase slips develop, which generate vortices. We use a finite-temperature strong-coupling expansion about the mean-field solution of the Bose-Hubbard model to calculate various properties of such devices. In addition, we discuss some of the rich behavior that can result when there are Mott regions within the system.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the localization transition and quantum criticality in the ground state of the disordered Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, where a quasiperiodic potential is hybridized with a disordered potential. In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization transition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate critical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While the staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value, Fibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This contrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural complexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with the sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy defined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the typical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the localization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent. We focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal finite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with the Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those of the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite differences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models with the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same correlation-length critical exponent. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems and are amenable to experimental validation using emerging techniques.},

Here, we report the experimental observation of asymmetric chiral currents induced by interactions in a synthetic zigzag ladder with tunable staggered flux, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. We observe that the staggered flux induces the symmetric chiral dynamics along two legs of the zigzag ladder in a noninteracting regime. However, the flux-dependent chiral currents along the two legs become asymmetric with increasing interactions, and the chiral trajectory is changed dramatically under strong interactions. Our finding opens the way for future exploration of exotic dynamics dictated by an interplay of inhomogeneous gauge fields and interactions in synthetic lattices.},

Additionally, we investigate the second-order EP (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system in the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the non-Hermitian system.

A central longstanding problem concerns the development of a theory of coarsening that rests on the microscopic properties of the system and allows identifying the interaction mechanisms underlying a possible overarching universality class of the associated scaling dynamics. In quantum systems, this is complicated by the existence of nonlinear and topological excitations due to the compact nature of phase degrees of freedom. We show that the double sine-Gordon model as a noncompact low-energy effective model of the spin-1 Bose gas accounts for subdiffusive coarsening dynamics, identifying field configurations spread over multiple wells of the sinusoidal potential as a precondition for the slow scaling. This is in contrast to diffusion-type scaling, which the model is known to exhibit as well, where field configurations are seen to not extend over more than two wells. Experimental observations of a spinor BEC support these characteristics, thus constituting a platform for the investigation of sine-Gordon dynamics. Our results point to a path towards a classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems on the basis of microscopic models.},

We efficiently obtain the quasimomentum distribution numerically by solving the integral equations that characterize the ground state of the integrable system within the local density approximation. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for both weakly and strongly interacting regimes. Unlike in bosonic gases, where rapidity distributions and density profiles vary significantly across interaction regimes, fermionic gases maintain similar profiles in both weakly and strongly interacting limits. Notably, the gas expands self-similarly only when released from a harmonic trap.

  abstract     = {Optical lattice clocks based on the narrow transition in neutral strontium (Sr) are among the most precise and accurate measurement devices in existence. Although this transition is completely forbidden by selection rules, state mixing from the hyperfine interaction in provides a weakly allowed transition that can be coherently driven with practical clock laser intensities. While the coherent interrogation times of optical clocks are typically set by the linewidth of the probe laser, this limitation can be overcome in synchronous differential comparisons between ensembles. In such measurements the natural lifetime of the clock transition becomes the fundamental limiting factor to the duration of a single run of the experiment. However, a direct measurement of the decay rate of the clock excited state is quite challenging due to the competing effects of other loss channels such as Raman scattering, inelastic collisions, and atom loss due to background gas. In this work, we monitor the decay of Sr atoms trapped in an optical lattice and initialized in the state. By making measurements of high and low density ensembles of both and across varying lattice trap depths, we isolate radiative decay, which accounts for a significant fraction of the observed decays at low depths. We obtain a natural radiative decay lifetime of s for the clock state in , a value that is consistent with previously reported measurements and theoretical predictions. We also introduce an additional measurement scheme that involves repeated measurements of the ground-state population within a single experimental sequence, validating our model and the consistency of the measured rates. We expect that the techniques introduced in this work are applicable to lifetime measurements of long-lived metastable states in other atoms and ions used for clocks and quantum computing.

The approach utilizes composite pulse sequences by effectively mapping the three-state system onto an equivalent two-level system. This transformation allows the use of broadband composite pulses designed initially for conventional two-state quantum systems. Unlike traditional implementations, the composite pulses in the three-level system are not controlled through phase adjustments; instead, they are realized via the amplitude ratio of the Rabi frequencies.},

We generalize and elaborate several analytic interference conditions for RESI in arbitrary driving fields, with a focus on the interference arising from the specific symmetries of bichromatic fields. For example, for waves of comparable strengths, multiple events per half-cycle for the direct electron must be considered. Furthermore, interference breaks some of the symmetries arising from the field. We detangle the superimposed interference fringes originating from phase differences related to symmetrization due to electron exchange, temporal shifts, and a combination of exchange and event interference. We show that the hierarchy between exchange-only and exchange-temporal interference is fluid and can be manipulated by an appropriate choice of driving-field parameters. This is enabled by different types of interference occupying specific regions of the plane spanned by the electron momentum components parallel to the driving-field polarization.},

One valuable tool for this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, this fit demands numerical simulations of the coupled electronic-motional dynamics which usually involve a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion that undergoes thermal motion, identifying the advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved, and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient, but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. Nevertheless, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.},

We assume the same control bound for the two Raman fields (pump and Stokes) and a different bound for the field directly connecting the two lower-energy states. Using control theory, we show that the optimal fields can only take the boundary values or be zero, with the latter corresponding to singular control. Subsequently, using numerical optimal control and intuitive arguments, we identify some three-stage symmetric optimal pulse sequences for relatively large values of the ratio between the two control bounds and analytically calculate the corresponding pulse timings as a function of this ratio. For smaller values of the bound ratio, numerical optimal control indicates that the optimal pulse sequence loses its symmetry and the number of stages increases in general. In all cases, the analytical or numerical optimal protocol achieves a faster perfect chiral resolution than other pulsed protocols, mainly because of the simultaneous action of the control fields. The present work is expected to be useful in the wide spectrum of applications across the natural sciences in which enantiomer separation is a crucial task.},

Thus, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) is widely used as an important experimental tool in both fundamental and applied research. In a dense plasma environment, however, the kinetic energies of Auger electrons are significantly modified and therefore AES shows new features compared with that of the isolated species. Here, we theoretically investigated the AES of K- and -vacancy states for different charge states of iron ions embedded in dense plasma. It is found that the kinetic energy of the Auger electron is evidently shifted toward higher energy compared with the isolated ion; The higher the mass density and ionization stage, the larger shift the kinetic energy of the Auger electron. The shift of kinetic energy of the Auger electron is also weakly temperature dependent with a lower shift at a higher temperature of the plasma. The Auger widths of the -vacancy states are more evidently affected by the plasma environment than the K-vacancy states, especially at a higher plasma density. The findings of the present work are helpful for the study of Auger processes and radiative properties in dense plasmas such as astrophysical plasmas in the interior of stars and laboratory plasmas produced in interaction of x-ray free-electron lasers with solids, liquids, nanoplasmas, and clusters.},

The measured anisotropic momentum distributions of the fragments reveal a preferential emission direction aligned with the laser polarization. Analysis of molecular orbitals and potential energy surfaces indicates that both electrons involved in the proton transfer process predominantly originate from the HCOOH moiety. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that proton transfer is initiated promptly after ionization and completes within 100 fs. Furthermore, by tuning the relative phase of the two-color laser field, we demonstrate control over the emission direction of the fragments. This directional emission is attributed to orientation-dependent tunneling ionization, as supported by simulations based on weak-field asymptotic theory.},

The orientation and alignment parameters of the autoionizing level and the intrinsic anisotropy and spin polarization parameters of the Auger decay are calculated for boronlike , and ions. The transferred spin-polarization components and and the dynamic one of the Auger electrons are then obtained. The dynamic polarization is found to be much smaller than the transferred ones due to weak alignment of the autoionizing level. It is found that the Breit interaction hardly contributes to , whereas the situation is much different for . For medium- and high- ions, for example, the transferred polarization is significantly enhanced by the Breit interaction for the Auger electrons emitted perpendicularly to the ionizing light beam but is weakened for those along the beam. Moreover, a quite strong circular polarization transfer of the ionizing light to the Auger electrons is found, which is comparable to the polarization transfer in the linear polarization of characteristic photons [Sharma et al. , Phys. Rev. A 81 , 023419 (2010) ] but reveals evidence of the spin polarization of Auger electrons emitted from highly charged ions.

By including quantized vibrational excitations, we examine the effects of finite trap strength and light-mediated forces on highly subradiant singly excited states for two, three, and many atoms in a one-dimensional waveguide or free space. For waveguide-coupled and tightly trapped atoms, the recoil energy from photon emission can reach a vibrational quantum, even in the Lamb-Dicke regime. For weakly trapped atoms, the vibrational wave packets are shifted or distorted due to induced forces and uneven decay. These effects lead to a time-dependent decay rate, extra vibrational energy transfer, and mixing of different electronic and vibrational states. The resulting entanglement entropy and infidelity can be mitigated by decreasing the induced forces or increasing trap strength. For quantum information storage, these findings suggest optimal array configurations in geometry and polarization. Our results provide insights for quantum memories and atom array experiments.},

  abstract     = {We present the results of theoretical and experimental investigation of optical linear dichroism signals caused by alignment, and arising under the action of pumping with linearly polarized light in a magnetic field transverse to the pumping in an ensemble of hydrogenlike (including alkali) atoms. Several simple models implying mixing of Zeeman sublevels of the excited state are considered, and common patterns among them are identified. It is shown that in the general case the properties of the medium causing dichroism can be characterized by only two parameters of the longitudinal and transverse linear polarizability, while in the case of complete mixing, by a single linear polarizability parameter. Expressions that relate these parameters to the transition probabilities are provided, as is an extension of the theory for the case of incomplete mixing of sublevels of the excited state. The single-beam scheme for recording linear dichroism signals, which is of greatest interest from a practical point of view, is investigated. It is shown that incomplete mixing can lead to inversion of dichroism signals in systems including more than one optical transition. A comparison with the results of an experimental study of dichroism in alkali-metal (cesium) vapors is made.},

  abstract     = {We propose a multilevel scheme to coherently transfer the population of a diatomic molecule, either polar or nonpolar, from a rovibrational level to a target rovibrational level of the same electronic state or another. It involves a linear chain of rovibrational levels alternating between the initial electronic state and a second electronic state, conveniently selected according to the dipole couplings between consecutive levels. A set of simultaneous weak ( ) laser pulses, with simple analytical shapes, each in resonance between two neighbors of the chain, transfers the population from the initial rovibronic state gradually and consecutively through the chain, until at the end of the process it resides in the target rovibronic state, as in a kind of ping-pong game between the two electronic states. Using the partial-wave expansion of the molecular wave function, vibrational bases within the manifolds of each electronic state, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we map the radial Hamiltonian to the one of a spin under a static magnetic field, providing an analytical formula for the populations of the linked states. As an illustration, we apply this pseudospin representation to the stabilization into the absolute ground state of a KRb molecule initially in the high-lying level of the ground electronic state . With a chain of seven rovibronic states, three of them belonging to the excited electronic state, and pulses of 0.4 ns of duration, the population is fully transferred into the target state in about 1 ns. In addition, we perform a numerical simulation of the ping-pong process, taking into account the entire rovibrational space of both electronic states and without invoking the RWA, finding a good agreement with the results of the pseudospin model.},

For this purpose, we solve numerically a two-dimensional Schrödinger equation treating a propagating laser pulse exactly. The resulting distributions are then compared to those calculated in the dipole approximation. By investigating the energy-angular photoelectron distributions, we demonstrate that the multiphoton peaks shift toward either smaller or larger energies depending on the photoelectron emission angle. This is analytically interpreted based on the leading-order relativistic expansion of the electron Volkov state, showing a significant contribution of the electron recoil to that behavior. In contrast, the retardation correction originating from the space- and time dependence of the laser field leads to a tiny redshift of the photoelectron energy spectra. Other features of ionization distributions are also analyzed, including the sidelobes and the double-hump structures of multiphoton peaks, or their disappearance for intense propagating laser pulses.},

  abstract     = {Shaped free electron vortices (SEVs) have recently been studied using atomic ( ) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized (OC-CRCP) femtosecond laser pulses. By transitioning from the perturbative to the nonperturbative REMPI regime, we identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP). Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured three-dimensional (3D) photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD), which we trace back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in antiphase, leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of the -symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.},

Our study is based on a fully relativistic approach in which we seek a numerical solution of the time-dependent Dirac equation. We find that spin flip during strong field ionization significantly increases the attoclock offset angle, indicating longer tunneling delay relative to electrons with no spin flip. To interpret our numerical findings, we conduct additional modeling within the perturbative Breit-Pauli approach, which allows us to elucidate the role of different relativistic mechanisms. We show that the spin-orbit interaction is mainly responsible for the spin flip, rather than interaction with the magnetic component of the laser field. We further discuss the dynamic mechanisms of the spin-flip effect, suggesting that it takes place while the electron is still bound. Our findings indicate that the attoclock can be used to investigate electron spin-flip dynamics during the tunnel ionization process.},

This method effectively mitigates Doppler broadening and common-mode optical noise by addressing disturbances such as nonuniform background absorption and environmental noise, thereby offering enhanced accuracy and robustness. Using this technique, we measured the transition frequency of isotopes in the transition. By employing an error signal derived from the dispersive signal of , we achieved efficient stabilization of a 369.5-nm ultraviolet diode laser, demonstrating a frequency stability of (26 kHz) over a 1500-s averaging period and a locking point standard deviation of 850 kHz sustained over 10 days.

The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in condensed media are the screening of Coulombic interactions and scattering of the electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a previously reported semiclassical PCI theory modified to account for screening and scattering. We show that a better agreement with experiment can be obtained by instead modeling scattering using electron transport Monte Carlo simulations.

Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when the nuclear spin is . We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity-doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments.

  abstract     = {In the theoretical study of electron-molecule collisions, resonant processes such as vibrational excitation and dissociative electron attachment and recombination are difficult to model due to the breakdown of common techniques such as the adiabatic-nuclei approximation. For this reason, it is useful to have an exactly solvable model so that the validity of different theories can be tested, such as the two-dimensional model introduced by Houfek et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 73 , 032721 (2006) ] and extended to charged targets by Hvizdoš et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 97 , 022704 (2018) ]. We have applied the convergent close-coupling method, a well-established approach for solving a variety of scattering problems, to this two-dimensional model problem. Dissociative attachment and recombination are treated within the same formalism, and the direct and resonant contributions to vibrational excitation are both fully accounted for as a result of solving the close-coupling equations. To accurately model these processes at all energies, the two-center approach is used, in which the states of the dissociated fragments are explicitly included in the expansion of the wave function of the scattering system. Cross sections for vibrational excitation, dissociative attachment, and direct dissociation are calculated for NO-like and -like targets, and excellent agreement is found with existing results. Cross sections for vibrational excitation and dissociative recombination are calculated for a -like target, and despite challenges with modeling the many resonances of the cross section, we find reasonably good agreement with existing results.},

With the help of the Dalitz plot, Newton diagram, and native-frame method, we investigated the fragmentation mechanisms of the three-body fragmentation channels. It is found that the channel only dissociates via the concerted mechanism, while channel presents two sequential fragmentation processes with and as intermediate moieties in addition to the concerted fragmentation.},

  abstract     = {Excluding the very shallow potential minimum of the electronic ground state, all bound electronic states of He 2 have Rydberg character. Their potential-energy functions are very similar to the potential-energy functions of the He 2 + states to which the Rydberg series converge. Photoionization and electron-impact ionization of the metastable a 3 Σ u + state of He 2 are thus characterized by diagonal Franck-Condon factors and only provide access to low vibrational levels of the He 2 + X + 2 Σ u + electronic ground state. For this reason, hardly any experimental information is available on the excited vibrational levels of He 2 + . We report on a measurement, by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy, of 17 vibrational levels of the X + 2 Σ u + state of 4 He 2 + , with vibrational quantum number v + ranging from 3 to 19 and covering more than 95% of the potential well. To access these states, we exploit a hump in the potential-energy function of the c 3 Σ g + state, which has vibrational wave functions extending to large internuclear distance by quantum-mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier. Combining these new results with data available on the lowest ( v + = 0 – 2 ) and highest ( v + = 22 , 23 ) vibrational levels of 4 He 2 + , we derive a full map of the rovibrational level structure of He 2 + and use it to determine, in a least-squares fit, an empirical effective potential-energy function that describes all experimental data within their uncertainties. This potential-energy function is used to calculate the positions of the 409 bound rovibrational levels and the positions and widths of the 74 shape resonances of the X + 2 Σ u + electronic ground state of 4 He 2 + . The dissociation energy of He 2 + is determined to be D e = 19 956.10 ( 10 ) cm − 1 [ D 0 ( 4 He 2 + ) = 19 101.29 ( 10 ) cm − 1 ] .},

We present absolute frequency measurements of the | 6 S 1 / 2 , F = 3 〉 → n F 5 / 2 , 7 / 2 ( n = 28 – 68 ) Rydberg series to measure the spectrum of Cs 133 . Atomic spectra are obtained using a three-photon excitation scheme referenced to an optical frequency comb in a sample of ultracold Cs 133 . By globally fitting the absolute-frequency measurements to the modified Ritz formula, we determine the quantum defects of the n F 5 / 2 and n F 7 / 2 series. The ionization potential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with our measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are calculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from the quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find agreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the n S 1 / 2 , n P J , n D J , and n F J series are calculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we report the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal quantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion. The results will be useful for calculating properties of Cs 133 such as collision and decay rates, polarizabilities, and magic wavelengths.},

We have performed a theoretical analysis of the capabilities of this method as applied to Compton ionization of an atom by a twisted x-ray photon. Our analysis uses the nonstationary formalism of quantum scattering theory, which, unlike the generally accepted stationary formalism, allows one to take into account the specifics of real initial states (wave packets) of a photon and an atom. We have shown that the energy and angular distribution of ionized electrons measured in coincidence with recoil ions does not depend on the orbital angular momentum of the twisted photon, but depends on its cone angle (opening angle), which determines the characteristic angular shift in the distribution.},

Among these, the nuclear clock based on nuclear transition stands out due to its high sensitivity. Previous studies on the variation in atomic clocks have typically focused purely either on a nuclear or electronic transition but not on the hyperfine electronic bridge (HEB) transitions, which involve simultaneous changes in both nuclear and electronic structures. In this work, we propose to search for the variation by measuring the 3.14-eV HEB transition between the hyperfine levels and of ions, and the 2.39-eV HEB transition between and of ions. These two HEB transitions exhibit remarkably large sensitivity factors of about and , respectively. Compared to the nuclear-clock transition in bare ions, the sensitivity factors are significantly enhanced by factors of 2.7 and 3.5. Moreover, both the 3.14- and 2.39-eV HEB transitions are well supported by current high-precision laser technology, making our approach promising for improving the precision of variation detection.},

Interpreting the data requires many isotope pairs, but sufficient stable spin-zero nuclei are not always available. In this paper we consider the use of isotopes with nonzero nuclear spin for these studies. We confirm that observed King plot nonlinearity in strontium is explained by a second-order hyperfine shift in the fermionic nucleus, and we discuss the limitations of using Yb isotopes with nonzero spin in King plot studies. By introducing a specific difference of two isotopes with nuclear spin, we allow for a promising addition to future experimental schemes.},

This results in a population spread over dozens of rotational and hyperfine sublevels of TlF, although only a single level is useful for the Schiff-moment measurement. Here, we present a protocol for cooling the rotational and hyperfine degrees of freedom in the CeNTREX beam, transferring the majority of the Boltzmann distribution into a single rotational and hyperfine sublevel by using a single ultraviolet laser and a pair of microwave beams. We achieve a factor of 20.1(4) gain in the population of the hyperfine sublevel of the TlF ground state.},

These corrections were then explored for numerical simulation of the He-Ar moments over the temperature range 50–500 K. The accuracy of the obtained temperature dependencies is validated through the comparison with direct quantum solution of the scattering and bound-state problems as well as with the results obtained using the path-integral (PI) approach. Close agreement was achieved as a result of the application of the two independent ways of approximate accounting for the quantum nature of absorption. The robustness of the Wigner expansion and PI corrections was thus demonstrated, both of which can be used to obviate direct quantum simulation of the CIA spectral moments. The approximate method is suggested for an accurate simulation of the CIA spectral profile on the basis of the obtained quantum-corrected moments and the classical trajectory-based formalism.},

  abstract     = {The two-body Dirac equation for positronium is studied with the Coulomb and Breit interactions. When adding an annihilation correction, its energies agree with experiment up to fourth order in powers of the fine structure constant if the Breit term is treated perturbatively. We analyze why this is not true if the Dirac equation is solved numerically. Symmetries of the 16-component Dirac spinors are first detailed. For each symmetry, coupled differential equations verified by their radial components are established in a self-adjoint form convenient for numerical calculations. Nondifferential relations between these components are derived. The coupled equations are first solved in the Coulomb case with the Lagrange-mesh method. With only four mesh points, accurate binding energies are obtained which match the best published results except for the and states. A detailed study of the radial spinor components of the ground states of para- and orthopositronium explains why the convergence of their energies stops at an accuracy of about atomic units. A curious property of the Lagrange-mesh method is emphasized. Analytical approximations of these radial components are derived and compared with numerical solutions. The obtained Coulomb-Dirac spinors provide an original variant of first-order perturbation treatment of the Breit operator. The Coulomb-Breit-Dirac coupled equations are then solved under the numerical conditions tested with the Coulomb case. The differences between these numerical energies and the correct perturbation results at fourth order are analyzed. The unphysical numerical values of energies are shown to be due to couplings with the negative continua.},

  abstract     = {For the post-processing of the quantum-key-distribution (QKD) system, the error correction is the most important step, whose efficiency significantly influences the final key generation rate. Traditionally, the error-correction algorithm is developed based on the binary symmetrical channel model. However, this may not comply with the actual channel status. For example, for the fiber-based QKD system, differentiable statuses of the fiber (unstable or steady) should exist for some time and cause different bit error rates. If this channel feature can be exploited, it may considerably improve the error-correction efficiency. This paper proposes to introduce the Gilbert-Elliott (GE) model to analyze the QKD channel. The error-correction algorithm adopts the low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The GE nodes are added into the traditional belief propagation (BP) algorithm of the LDPC decoder. Simulation results showed that the remaining frame error rate could be improved from (or ) to . An actual QKD system with the quantum channel state under manual control was adopted to collect the key bit string. By analyzing the occurrence probability of the consecutive "1," the key bit string showed closely matched distribution with the GE model prediction. After the error correction, the remaining bit error rate of the modified BP algorithm was significantly smaller than that of the standard BP algorithm with an improvement of more than 2 orders of magnitude. Both simulation and actual experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can greatly improve the error-correction efficiency if the channel characteristic of the QKD system is accurately exploited, which provides an efficient way to generate a higher key rate.},

  abstract     = {The manipulation of quantum information in large systems requires precise control of quantum systems that are out of equilibrium. As the size of the system increases, its fragility in response to external perturbations and intrinsic decoherence processes also increases. The degradation of the system response makes accurate measurements a challenging and time-consuming task. However, quantum information lifetime enhancement can be achieved by dynamical decoupling techniques, where an external drive with a frequency much higher than the system's internal evolution renders signal acquisition with decay times greater than 1000-fold. In this study, we demonstrate that the system response during a prethermal period, subject to Floquet control, can be utilized to probe the multiple quantum evolution of dense and highly connected spin systems. This approach exhibits an enhanced sensitivity at a reduced experimental time. The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved enabled the use of numerical inversion strategies to model the evolution of the excited multiple quantum coherences, which describe the number of correlated spins within a cluster. We observed that the increase in the number of correlated spins with multiple quantum evolution is accompanied by an increase in the distribution of spin cluster sizes, which follows a quadratic law.},

We find that the gate time is inversely proportional to the qubit-boson interaction strength, and by tuning the qubit-boson interaction strength, one can prepare a maximally entangled state or a squeezed state. Applying the quantum gate to multiple qubit ensembles, we show that the quantum gate prepares a Schrödinger cat state.

The advantage of this manipulation is pronounced with an increasing number of atoms in the QB. A significant atom number discrepancy between the two cavities results in the simultaneous optimization of charging power and battery capacity, thereby enhancing charging efficiency without compromising energy storage capacity. Additionally, by modulating the number of atoms within each cavity, the QB is theoretically capable of transitioning between “fast charging” and “slow charging” modes. Notably, in an open system environment, the superiority of the QB is even more pronounced, with negligible energy loss at the final steady state relative to the maximum energy storage of an isolated system.},

Our analysis includes simulations under both idealized noise-free conditions and realistic noisy environments based on calibration data from actual devices. Results demonstrate that QNG consistently outperforms vanilla gradient descent, exhibiting faster convergence on average and greater robustness against random initializations of parameters. This robustness is attributed to the distance regularization in parameter space inherent to QNG. Additionally, QNG achieves a higher convergence rate to the solution, effectively avoiding certain local minima.

  abstract     = {Future quantum networks will enable the interconnection of multiple users distributed across vast geographic distances. Due to these large separations and limited physical resources, communication will often rely on multipath routing strategies, where physical resources are distributed across channels of varying lengths and delivered to end users. Efficient long-distance quantum communication therefore requires optimizing the allocation of these resources across available paths. In this work we introduce a performance-oriented approach to quantum network routing by extending the classical concept of quality of service (QOS) to the context of multipath quantum resource distribution. Unlike prior models that consider entanglement generation or quantum memory coherence in isolation, we investigate the interplay between path assignment strategies, coherence time constraints, and quantum error correction (QEC) and how they jointly impact end-to-end communication fidelity. We analyze both unencoded and encoded transmissions over aggregated network paths, quantifying the effects of resource allocation on transmission success. Our findings show that fidelity cannot be optimized independently of memory lifetimes and that while QEC can enhance performance under specific conditions, it also imposes additional constraints depending on network topology and path-length asymmetries. This work provides a foundation for developing QOS-aware quantum routing protocols that balance fidelity, throughput, and memory utilization, key considerations for near-term quantum repeater networks.},

  abstract     = {Multidimensional rotation serves as a powerful tool for enhancing information reconciliation and extending the transmission distance in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, the lack of closed-form orthogonal transformations for high-dimensional rotations has limited the maximum reconciliation efficiency to channels with eight dimensions over the past decade. This paper presents a cross-rotation scheme to overcome this limitation and enable reconciliation in arbitrarily high dimensions, constrained to even multiples of eight. The key treatment involves reshaping the string vector into matrix form and applying orthogonal transformations to its columns and rows in a cross manner, thereby increasing the reconciliation dimension by one order per cross rotation while significantly reducing the communication overhead over the classical channel. A rigorous performance analysis is also presented from the perspective of achievable sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that 64-dimensional cross rotation nearly approaches the upper bound, making it a recommended choice for practical implementations.},

  abstract     = {While abstract models of quantum computation assume a closed system of two-level states, practical quantum devices inevitably couple to the environment in some way, creating sources of noise. Understanding the tolerance to noise of specific quantum algorithms run on specific devices is important for determining the feasibility of quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Of particular interest is understanding the noise sensitivity of these devices as more qubits are added to the system. Classical simulations are a useful tool to understand the effects of this noise, but direct classical simulations of open quantum systems are burdened by an exponentially growing cost in the number of qubits and a large local Hilbert space dimension. For one-dimensional, shallow circuits, using tensor networks can replace this exponential cost with a linear one and simulate far wider systems than what would normally be available. In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multiqubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.},

This paper numerically explores the path-connectedness of globally optimal control solutions forming the top manifold of the landscape. We randomly sample a plethora of optimal controls on the top manifold to assess the existence of a continuous path at the top of the landscape that connects two arbitrary optimal solutions. It is shown that for different quantum control objectives, including state-to-state transition probabilities, observable expectation values, and unitary transformations, such a continuous path can be readily found, implying that these top manifolds are fundamentally path-connected. The significance of the latter conjecture lies in seeking locations on the top manifold where an ancillary objective can also be optimized while maintaining the full optimality of the original objective that defined the landscape.},

  abstract     = {Solving optimization problems is a key task for which quantum computers could possibly provide a speedup over the best known classical algorithms. Particular classes of optimization problems including semidefinite programming (SDP) and linear programming (LP) have wide applicability in many domains of computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Here we focus on semidefinite and linear programs for which the dimensions of the variables involved are exponentially large, so that standard classical SDP and LP solvers are not helpful for such large-scale problems. We propose the QSlack and CSlack methods for estimating their optimal values, respectively, which work by (1) introducing slack variables to transform inequality constraints to equality constraints, (2) transforming a constrained optimization to an unconstrained one via the penalty method, and (3) replacing the optimizations over all possible nonnegative variables by optimizations over parameterized quantum states and parameterized probability distributions. Under the assumption that the SDP and LP inputs are efficiently measurable observables, it follows that all terms in the resulting objective functions are efficiently estimable by either a quantum computer in the SDP case or a quantum or probabilistic computer in the LP case. Furthermore, by making use of SDP and LP duality theory, we prove that these methods provide a theoretical guarantee that, if one could find global optima of the objective functions, then the resulting values sandwich the true optimal values from both above and below. Finally, we showcase the QSlack and CSlack methods on a variety of example optimization problems and discuss details of our implementation, as well as the resulting performance. We find that our implementations of both the primal and dual for these problems approach the ground truth, typically achieving errors of the order .},

In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the trade-off between readout fidelity and atomic retention. Moreover, we introduce a metric of quantum circuit iteration rate (qCIR) and employ normalized quantum Fisher information to characterize system overall performance. Further, by carefully balancing fidelity and retention, we demonstrate a readout strategy for optimizing information acquisition efficiency.

We propose a classical simulation tool for general continuous variable sampling problems, including Gaussian boson sampling and beyond. We reformulate the sampling problem as that of finding the ground state of a simple few-body Hamiltonian. This allows us to employ powerful variational methods based on tensor networks and to read off the simulation error directly from the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. We validate our method by simulating Gaussian boson sampling, where we achieve results comparable to the state of the art. We also consider a non-Gaussian sampling problem, for which we develop alternative local basis optimization techniques based on a nonlinear parametrization of the implicit basis, resulting in high effective cutoffs with diminished computational overhead.},

We show that non-Gaussian entangled resources can be transmitted covertly while mimicking a Gaussian thermal state and still retain sufficient entanglement to violate a qubit Bell inequality, even with an eavesdropper present. We also examine the performance of other quantum protocols that utilize entanglement, such as dense coding and teleportation of unentangled but nonclassical states, to determine the effectiveness of the steganographic entanglement sharing under a variety of active and passive eavesdropper conditions.},

The quantum Fisher information (QFI) for phase estimation in each feedback scheme increases with each feedback loop, and similar to the standard SU(1,1) nonlinear interferometer, phase estimation in this scheme is sensitive to photon loss when the inputs are vacuum state. In terms of resources, we show that, in the low-loss regime, our scheme performs better than the standard nonlinear interferometer.

We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography.

Specifically, we identify a period-4 measurement schedule of the check operators that preserves logical information between the instantaneous stabilizer groups. Such a schedule not only measures the usual stabilizers of the Bacon-Shor code, but also measures and promotes gauge operators of the parent subsystem code to additional temporary stabilizers that protect the dynamical logical qubits against errors. We show that the code distance of these Floquet-Bacon-Shor codes scales as on an lattice with dynamical logical qubits, along with the logical qubit of the parent subsystem code. Unlike the usual Bacon-Shor code, the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code family introduced here can therefore saturate the subsystem bound .

Numerical simulations of noisy random evolution show excellent agreement with the theoretical models. In quantum memory applications, our method substantially extends the decay time of two-qubit fidelity and eliminates fidelity oscillations caused by the ZZ crosstalk.

We derive the shadow ansatz—a product of transformations applied to the mean-field wave function—by exploiting a critical link between measurement and preparation. Each transformation is obtained by measuring a classical shadow of the residual of the contracted Schrödinger equation (CSE), the many-electron Schrödinger equation (SE) projected onto the space of two electrons. We show that the classical shadows of the CSE vanish if and only if the wave function satisfies the SE and, hence, that randomly sampling only the two-electron space yields an exact ansatz regardless of the total number of electrons. We demonstrate the ansatz's advantages for scalable simulations—fewer measurements and shallower circuits—by computing on simulators and a quantum device.},

Although we predictably find that neural networks yield better accuracy, we also find that the way the two methods reach their prediction is starkly different. This is seen by the measurements which are the most important for the classification. Neural networks follow the intuitive prediction that measurements containing information about nonlocal coherences are most important for entanglement, but random forests signify the dominance of information contained in occupation measurements. This is because occupation measurements are necessary for the extraction of data about all other density matrix elements from the remaining measurements. The same discrepancy does not occur when the models are used to learn entanglement directly from the elements of the density matrix, so it is the result of the scattering of information and interdependence of measurement data. As a result, the models behave differently when noise is introduced to various measurements, which can be harnessed to obtain more reliable information about entanglement from noisy tomography data.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing (QC) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) represent state-of-the-art quantum and classical computing methods, respectively, for understanding many-body quantum systems. However, straightforward integration of the two methods may encounter significant challenges, such as exponential sampling cost and inefficient walker propagation. Here, we propose an efficient hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that integrates the two methods, overcoming these limitations while leveraging their strengths in representing and manipulating quantum states. To measure the effectiveness of the hybrid approach, we first introduce nonstoquasticity indicators (NSIs) and their theoretical upper bounds, which quantify the severity of the sign problem, a major limitation of QMC. Next, we present a hybrid QC-QMC method where the walkers are represented by quantum states prepared by a shallow quantum circuit. Although the Hamiltonian in the quantum state walker basis is not sparse, we offer an efficient and scalable approach to implement walker propagation using a quantum computer. From the QMC perspective, our algorithm significantly mitigates the sign problem in the quantum state walker basis. From the QC perspective, integrating QMC increases the expressivity of shallow quantum circuits, enabling more accurate computations that are traditionally achievable only with much deeper quantum circuits. Our method has immediate applications in tackling complex quantum many-body problems. We numerically test and verify it for the molecule (12 qubits) and the Hubbard model (16 qubits), observing a significant suppression of the sign problem (which exponentially decreases with circuit depth) and a notable improvement in calculation accuracy (which is about two to three orders compared to variational quantum algorithms). Our work paves the way to solving practical problems with intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers, with broad applications in chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials.},

We provide here a universal and real-time control strategy to dynamically correct the arbitrary type of errors in the system Hamiltonian. It yields multiple error-resilient paths for the interested system which are activated by the von Neumann equation for ancillary projection operators. With no extra control fields and precise designs, the path-dependent global phase alone suffices to mitigate the error-induced transitions among distinct paths as long as it varies faster than the other parameters. The corrected paths can also be regarded as the approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation perturbed by errors. Our dynamical-correction strategy is practiced with the cyclic transfer of populations in a three-level system, showing a superior error resilience to the parallel-transport condition. It provides a promising idea for advancing control methodologies in imprecise quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of the total (system, bath, and interaction) Hamiltonian and intermittent tracing out the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers: we do not assume access to specialized oracles such as block encodings and minimize the number of ancilla qubits needed. In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. For a system of -qubits, we exhaustively compare the circuit depth needed to estimate the expectation value of an observable with respect to the reduced state of the system after time while employing different near-term Hamiltonian simulation techniques, requiring at most qubits in all. We compare the cnot gate counts of the various approaches for estimating the transverse field magnetization of a 10-qubit XX -Heisenberg spin chain under amplitude damping. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory-retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of simulating open systems dynamics using this framework.},

Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parametrized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed by Stokes et al. , Quantum 4 , 269 (2020) , by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix—the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices—for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.},

Ideally, any correlation can be captured by a joint (system and bath) Hamiltonian. However, an arbitrary joint Hamiltonian is often intractable, and hence, the joint Hamiltonian model with pairwise terms was introduced and developed in a seminal series of papers by Terhal and Burkard [ Phys. Rev. A 71 , 012336 (2005) ], Aliferis, Gottesman, and Preskill [ Quantum Inf. Comput. 6 , 97 (2005) ], and Aharonov, Kitaev, and Preskill [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 , 050504 (2006) ]. However, the analysis of the new constant overhead codes in that error model appears to be quite challenging. In this paper, to model correlated errors in quantum memory, we introduce a correlation model which is a generalization of the well-known hidden random fields. This proposed model, which includes stationary and ergodic (and possibly non-Markov) error distributions, is shown to capture correlations not captured by the joint Hamiltonian model with pairwise terms. On the other hand, building on non-i.i.d. measure concentration, we show that for a broad class of (possibly) non-Markov and nonstationary error distributions, quantum Tanner codes ensure an exponential retention time (in the number of physical qubits), when the error rate is below a threshold. An implication of this work is that the rate of decay of the correlation with distance does not necessarily differentiate between good and bad correlations.},

  abstract     = {Improving the performance of quantum algorithms is a fundamental task to achieve quantum advantage. In many cases, extracting information from quantum systems poses an important challenge for practical implementations of real-world quantum computers, given the high resource cost of performing state tomography. In this scenario, randomized measurements have emerged as a promising tool. In particular, the classical shadow protocol allows one to retrieve expected values of low-weight Pauli observables by performing only local measurements. In this paper, we present an implementation of the recently introduced feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization using the Ket quantum programming platform to solve the MaxCut optimization problem. We employ classical shadows for the feedback routine of parameter estimation and compare this approach with the direct estimation of observables. Our results show that depending on the graph geometry of the MaxCut problem, the number of measurements required to estimate expected values of observables with classical shadows can be up to 16 times lower than with direct-observable estimation. Furthermore, by analyzing complete graphs, we numerically confirm logarithmic growth in the required number of measurements relative to the number of observables, reinforcing that classical shadows can be a useful tool for estimating low-locality Pauli observables in quantum algorithms.},

We present a quantitative analysis of the performance of a spin-qudit-based error-correctable quantum memory, with reference to the actual Hamiltonians of several potential candidate systems. First, the ideal code-word implemented on a spin-7/2 nucleus, which provides first-order Pauli- and error correction, has intrinsic infidelity due to mixed eigenstates under realistic conditions. We confirm that expansion to a spin-9/2 system with tailored code words can compensate for this infidelity. Second, we claim that electric field fluctuations, which are inevitable in real systems, should also be considered as a noise source, and we illustrate an encoding and decoding scheme for a multi-spin-qudit-based error correction code that can simultaneously compensate for both electric- and magnetic-field perturbations. Such strategies are important as we move beyond the current noisy-intermediate quantum era, and fidelities above two or three nines become crucial for the implementation of quantum technologies.},

Given that the lock-in amplification technique has been successfully applied to facilitate sensitive detection of various unknown weak signals, in this study, we investigate the extension of this technique, termed quantum lock-in amplification, for precise detection of an unknown alternating signal. With a generalized spin-oscillator hybrid quantum system, we show that the target signal driving the oscillator can be precisely locked in by modulating the pulses that drive the spin, while the amplification of the signal is simultaneously achieved by alternatively driving the probe (i.e., oscillator), similar to its classical counterpart. Unlike previous methods that utilize pulses solely for signal accumulation and amplification, the quantum lock-in amplification scheme proposed here simultaneously harnesses both the spin-oscillator entanglement resources and the quantum squeezing of the oscillator. Notably, the simultaneous use of entanglement and squeezing can achieve greater noise compression compared to the case using entanglement only. Consequently, the spin state, characterized by large phase accumulation, can be measured with significantly high sensitivity even under the noisy environment, allowing for precise locking and amplification of the unknown weak signal.},

Such matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, adjacent matter-wave interferometers can use entanglement features to test physics beyond the standard model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of space-time in a laboratory. In particular, we study how white and flicker noise induces decoherence for a setup involving superconducting wires embedded in a chip. We show that to obtain a tiny spatial superposition of a nanometer separation, and to minimize decoherence, where is the dephasing rate and is the frequency of the oscillator, we will need current fluctuations to be , which is not impossible to obtain in superconducting wire arrangements.

We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the entangled states detected by REWs and give a specific example implying the detection limitations of REWs. From an operational perspective, we investigate whether all entangled states are detected by the EWs locally equivalent to some REWs. We prove the validity for all nonpositive partial transpose states. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition of the validity for the positive partial transpose (PPT) entangled states of complex density matrices. By this condition we show the validity for a family of two-qutrit PPT entangled states of rank four. Another way to figure out the problem is to check whether a counterexample exists. We propose a method to examine the existence from a set-theoretic perspective and provide some supporting evidence of nonexistence.

We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in , while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in qubits. We describe cat-qubit-inspired bias-preserving and gates for fluxonium.

We study contracted graphs for stabilizer states, as well as states and Dicke states, discussing how the diameter of a state's contracted graph constrains the entropic diversity of its two-qubit Clifford orbit. We derive an upper bound on the number of entropy vectors that can be generated using any -qubit Clifford circuit, for any quantum state. We speculate on the holographic implications for the relative proximity of gravitational duals of states within the same Clifford orbit.

Current hardware suffers from uncontrolled noise that can alter the expected results of one calculation. The nature of this noise is different from one technology to another. In this work, we choose to investigate a technology that is intrinsically resilient to bit-flips: cat-state qubits. To this end, we implement two noise models. The first one is uniformly depolarizing in the sense that it is used in the literature to cover different hardware types. The second one is specific to cat-state qubits. We perform simulations on two types of problems that can be formulated with VQAs [the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS)], study the impact of noise on the evolution of the cost function, and extract noise-level thresholds from which a noise-resilient regime can be considered. By tackling compilation issues, we discuss the need for implementing hardware-specific noise models as uniformly depolarizing ones can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the regime of noise that is acceptable for an algorithm to run.},

The SWV state is a pseudostate (Hermitian but not necessarily positive) that gives, by the usual trace formula, the correct value for a weak measurement preformed at time , i.e., its weak value. The Wigner function is a pseudo probability distribution (real but not necessarily positive) over phase space. A smoothed (in this estimation sense) Wigner distribution at time can also be defined by applying classical smoothing for probability distributions to the Wigner functions. The smoothed Wigner distribution gives identical means for the canonical phase-space variables as does the SWV state.

  abstract     = {Adiabatic control is a fundamental technique for manipulating quantum systems, guided by the quantum adiabatic theorem, which ensures suppressed nonadiabatic transitions under slow parameter variations. Quantum annealing, a heuristic algorithm leveraging adiabatic control, seeks the ground states of Ising spin-glass models and has drawn attention for addressing combinatorial optimization problems. However, exponentially small energy gaps in such models often necessitate impractically long runtime to satisfy the adiabatic condition. Despite this limitation, improving the quality of approximate solutions remains crucial for practical applications. The quantum adiabatic brachistochrone provides a method to enhance adiabaticity by minimizing an action representing nonadiabaticity via the variational principle. While effective, its implementation requires detailed energy spectra, complicating its use in quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counterdiabatic driving offer alternative approaches for accelerating adiabatic processes. However, the theory of shortcuts to adiabaticity often faces challenges such as nonlocal control requirements, high computational cost, and trade-offs between speed and energy efficiency. In this work we propose a quantum adiabatic brachistochrone protocol tailored for quantum annealing that eliminates the need for energy spectrum information. Our approach builds on advancements in counterdiabatic driving to design efficient parameter schedules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations on the transverse-field Ising chain and axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising models.},

It quantifies the minimal amount by which a state needs to mix with other states such that the overall state is absolutely separable. We show that the robustness satisfies positivity, invariance under unitary transformation, monotonicity, and convexity, so it is a good measure within the resource theory of nonabsolute separability. Analytical expressions for this measure are given for pure states in an arbitrary system and rank-two mixed states in a two-qubit system. Furthermore, we extend the study of absolutely separable and PPT states to multipartite systems, proving that three-qubit absolutely separable states form a proper subset of three-qubit absolutely PPT states, with symmetry under subsystem permutations and stricter spectral constraints.},

To substantiate this assertion, we develop a general framework for tripartite correlations by extending the notion of Settings Independence and Outcome Independence beyond their bipartite formulation. This framework highlights the pivotal role of Hardy-type reasoning in detecting genuine multipartite nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the tripartite Hardy-nonlocality enables self-testing of a broad class of pure nonmaximally genuine entangled tripartite states, offering a key advantage over Bell inequality-based methods by allowing certification even under nonmaximal violations. Unlike Bell functionals, which typically self-test only a single extremal point, the Hardy relation self-tests a set of extremal correlations for any nonzero Hardy probability. This, in turn, facilitates the device-independent certification of randomness from Hardy-type correlations. We find that the maximum certifiable randomness is -bits, highlighting both the practical and foundational significance of Hardy-based techniques for quantum randomness generation.},

Lett. 125 , 030502 (2020) ] that the time evolution of operator entanglement for a large class of many-body operators can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, including for operators with volume-law entanglement. Here we extend the scope of this formalism in two key ways. First we provide evidence that these classically simulable circuits include examples of fast scramblers, by constructing a circuit for which operator entanglement is numerically found to saturate in a time (with the number of qubits). Second we demonstrate that, in addition to operator entanglement, certain out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) can be classically simulated within the same formalism. As a consequence such OTOCs can be computed numerically in super-Clifford circuits with thousands of qubits and we study several explicit examples in the aforementioned fast scrambling circuits.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of reproducing one quantum measurement given the ability to perform another. We give a general framework and specific protocols for this problem. For example, we show how to use available “imperfect” devices a small number of times to implement a target measurement with average error that drops off exponentially with the number of imperfect measurements used. We hope that could be useful in near-term applications as a type of lightweight error mitigation of the measuring devices. As well as the view to practical applications, we consider the question from a general theoretical perspective in the most general setting where both the available and target measurements are arbitrary generalized quantum measurements. We show that this general problem in fact reduces to the ability to reproduce the statistics of (complete) von Neumann measurements, and that in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many uses of the available measurement, a simple protocol based upon “classical cloning” can perfectly achieve this task. We show that asymptotically any nontrivial quantum measurement can reproduce any other. We also study optimal protocols for a fixed number of uses of the available measurement. This includes, but is not limited to, improving both noisy and lossy quantum measurements. Furthermore, we show that, in a setting where we perform multiple measurements in parallel, we can achieve finite-rate measurement reproduction, by using block-coding techniques from classical information theory. Finally, we show that advantages can also be gained by making use of probabilistic protocols.},

While the complexity of the wave function can be reduced through conventional Ansätze (e.g., the coupled-cluster Ansatz ), it can still grow rapidly with system size even on quantum devices. An exact, universal two-body exponential Ansatz for the many-body wave function has been shown to be generated from the solution of the contracted Schrödinger equation (CSE), and recently this Ansatz has been implemented without classical approximation on quantum simulators and devices for the scalable simulation of many-body quantum systems. Here we combine the solution of the CSE with a form of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning to generate highly compact circuits that implement this Ansatz without sacrificing accuracy. As a natural extension of the CSE, we reformulate the wave-function update as a Markovian decision process and train the agent to select the optimal actions at each iteration based upon only the current CSE residual. Compact circuits with high accuracy are achieved for and molecules over a range of molecular geometries.},

For arbitrary dimensions, the formalism remains applicable, though restricted to a subset of stabilizer states and operations. The computational complexity scales linearly with the number of qudits in the initial state and exponentially with the number of qudits in the final state. This ensures that when noisy qudit stabilizer states evolve via generalized Pauli measurements and Clifford operations to generate multipartite entangled states of a few qudits, their description remains efficient.

Our results demonstrate that the transverse magnetic field serves as a tunable parameter for controlling thermal entanglement and quantum coherence.

In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a formalism of the nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric phase in non-Hermitian quantum systems.

This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities—termed local information—and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice, we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.},

While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved quantities—dubbed charges—other than energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of nonenergy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.},

By comparing global and local noise scenarios, we quantify entanglement degradation using the positive partial transpose time (PPTT) metric, which measures how long entanglement persists under noise. When the sampling of different noise scenarios is performed under controlled and homogeneous conditions, our analysis reveals that systems subjected to global noise tend to exhibit longer PPTTs, whereas those influenced by independent local noise models display the shortest entanglement persistence. To carry out this analysis, we employ a computational method proposed by Cao and Lu, which accelerates the simulation of PPTT distributions and enables efficient analysis of systems with dimensions up to .

Key advantages of our approach include the ability to access exact analytic results for any , the ability to tune to the noise-free limit (in contrast, e.g., to the Haar ensemble), and analytic access to moments beyond the variance.

However, constrained by the weak interaction between the quantum nodes, the implementations of QB networks exhibit limited charging performance. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to improving charging in multibattery systems by capitalizing on nonreciprocity. By constructing non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm triangles to establish unidirectional energy transfer in both cascaded and parallel configurations, we can achieve a significant enhancement of the stored energy in QBs under weak interaction. Remarkably, the nonreciprocal cascaded setups display an exponentially increasing gain in the battery energy as the charging distance lengthens compared to the reciprocal counterparts.

  abstract     = {The topological properties of open quantum lattice systems have attracted much attention, due to their fundamental significance and potential applications. However, experimental demonstrations with large-scale lattice models remain challenging. On top of that, formulations of topology in terms of quantum trajectories require monitoring along with the detection of quantum jumps. This is particularly the case for the dark-state-induced topology that relies on averaging quantum trajectories at their jump times. Here we propose two significant simplifications to ease the experimental burden to demonstrate dark state-induced topological phase transitions: First, we emulate the topology in the phase space of small systems, where the effective size of the system is reflected by the accessible parameter range. Second, we develop a method how to, by augmenting the system with an auxiliary system, access the jump-time-averaged state through standard wall-time averaging, which effectively substitutes the monitoring along with the counting of quantum jumps. While these simplifications are applicable to general lattice systems, we demonstrate them with a one-dimensional Su-Schrieeffer-Heeger model. In this case, the lattice system is emulated by a four-level system, while the jump-time-averaged state up to the second jump is accessed through a three-level auxiliary system.},

Most such no-go theorems studied to date, such as the Frauchiger-Renner argument and the Local Friendliness argument, are explicitly constructed using quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities. In this work, we show that such correlations are not necessary for having extended Wigner's friend paradoxes, by constructing a no-go theorem utilizing a proof of the failure of noncontextuality.

In this work, we introduce a communication game to show that there are states and effects within both extreme compositions for which the success probability of the game surpasses the maximum achievable quantum bound. However, the IC principle remains satisfied, meaning that it cannot rule out all beyond-quantum correlations resulting from the extreme compositions.

Within local approaches, thermodynamic quantities only refer to the open system's degrees of freedom, while in the global approaches, certain quantities are defined by referring explicitly to the reservoir degrees of freedom. Employing a microscopic, analytically solvable model, we perform a comparison of these two perspectives, revealing substantial differences in the thermodynamic quantities and in the formulations of the first and second laws. The main reason for these discrepancies is the fact that the global approaches involve the system-reservoir interaction which exchanges a large amount of energy with the environment, while the average open system energy is constant in time because the dynamics represents pure decoherence and does not affect the open system populations.},

In this work, we investigate the decoherence dynamics of systems coupled to multiple baths through noncommuting systems' operators and beyond the weak system-bath coupling limit. By building on cooperative effects between baths, we propose a strategy to mitigate rapid decoherence. Concretely, we study the dynamics of a qubit coupled to multiple environments with arbitrary interaction strengths and along different coordinates. Based on insights gained on the decoherence dynamics from the analytical effective Hamiltonian method, we carry out numerical simulations using the reaction coordinate quantum master equation method. We show that when the system strongly interacts with a decohering bath, increasing its coupling to a second, dissipative bath can slow down the decoherence dynamics in a certain parameter regime. Our work offers insights into the preservation of quantum coherence in open quantum systems based on frustration effects, by utilizing cooperative effects between different heat baths.},

The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.},

We analyze the reliability loss of the harmonic oscillators in a squeezed thermal reservoir, where the quantum states under consideration have garnered significant interest in recent experiments, such as the coherent state, the squeezed coherent state, and the cat state. We explore the optimal protocol to extend the lifetime of these quantum states by adjusting the squeezed parameters of the squeezed thermal reservoir in both the high-damping and low-damping regimes. In the low-damping regime, our findings suggest that the unique optimal protocol follows the phase-matching condition and is insensitive to the reservoir's temperature. We also evaluate the optimal condition for the large damping regime. Furthermore, we show that when the state parameters satisfy a specific condition, there exists an interval for the damping rate, within which a bifurcation of the optimal protocol occurs.},

We show that compared to the independent noise channels, the correlated noise channels provide varying degrees of protection for the global and local performances of the Ising battery. The correlated depolarizing channel not only protects the global energy, ergotropy, and capacity of the Ising battery, but also protects the local ergotropy and capacity, whereas the correlated bit-flip channel provides protection only for the global ergotropy and capacity of the Ising battery. In both the correlated depolarizing and bit-flip channels, the greater the correlation strength, the greater the protective effect.

This construction could suggest that statistical quantifiers are a derived concept, while the only fundamental objects are the physical evolutions. The aim of this work is to disprove this belief. To this end, we prove a statement dual to the Chentsov-Petz theorem, showing that among all possible linear maps, the only ones that contract the Fisher information (including, in the quantum case, any idle ancilla) are exactly the physical ones. This result proves that, contrary to the common opinion, there is no fundamental hierarchy between physical maps and canonical statistical quantifiers, as either of them can be defined in terms of the other.},

  abstract     = {The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is a fundamental principle in nonequilibrium thermodynamics that relates entropy production to fluctuations in a system, establishing a trade-off between the precision of an observable and the thermodynamic cost. Investigating TUR violations challenges classical thermodynamic limits, offering the potential for improved precision-entropy trade-offs, which is crucial for enhancing performance and optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relation within a quantum collisional model, which offers the advantage of discretizing interactions into successive collisions with auxiliaries, allowing for precise tracking of dynamics and the incorporation of memory effects and non-Markovian behavior. We consider three types of dynamics in the collisional model: one is Markovian evolution, achieved by taking the continuous-time limit and imposing the stability condition, while the other two are non-Markovian dynamics—one arising from increasing the collision time between the system and the auxiliaries, and the other from incorporating interactions between the auxiliaries. For the Markovian dynamics, we examine the classical and quantum TUR bounds in the nonequilibrium steady-state regime, and also the finite-time TUR bound. We identify two distinct regimes of classical TUR violation: in some cases, the maximum violation occurs in the steady state, while in others, it is necessarily transient—appearing only at early times and vanishing with further evolution. For the two non-Markovian approaches, we find that both the degree and type of non-Markovianity crucially affect TUR violations. The second approach shows more pronounced violations during transient times, while the first approach has much stronger violations in the steady-state regime for a certain parameter window.},

A revival oscillation of the purity with lifetime e 2 / s occurs in the deep sub-Ohmic regime ( s < 0.1 ), which we call the Caldeira-Leggett quantum time crystal. We reveal that such oscillations originate from the fact that an environment in the deep sub-Ohmic regime behaves as a gel-like fractal medium with viscosity and elasticity, suggesting the significance of fractal gel-like environments in vivo and in information processing.},

  abstract     = {We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap for cesium that allows us to generate two diametral periodic one-dimensional arrays of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half the resonant free-space wavelength of the cesium transition. This is achieved by launching a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We trap and optically interface the atoms in the resulting periodic optical potential and characterize the trap by measuring the lifetime of the trapped atoms, the atom-light coupling strength, the filling factor, and the trap frequencies in the radial and axial directions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub- spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects, such as selective radiance.},

  abstract     = {The large majority of topological phases in one-dimensional many-body systems are known to be inherited from the corresponding single-particle Hamiltonian. In this work, we go beyond this assumption and find a new example of topological order induced through specific interaction couplings. Specifically, we consider a fermionic mixture where one component experiences a staggered on-site potential and it is coupled through density-dependent hopping interactions to the other fermionic component. Crucially, by varying the sign of the staggered potential, we show that this latter fermionic component can acquire topological properties. Due to matrix product state simulations, we prove this result both at equilibrium by extracting the behavior of correlation functions and in an out-of-equilibrium scheme by employing a Thouless charge pumping. Notably, we further discuss how our results can be probed in quantum simulators made up of ultracold atoms. Our results reveal an important and alternative mechanism that can give rise to topological order.},

Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.},

Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture many features of their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the postquench dynamics of a multiwell spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased k -nearest-neighbor method. We observe the dynamical buildup of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without reconstructing the underlying state or measurement distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.},

We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit rung filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar spin ladders can be investigated in ongoing experiments.},

However, due to complex electron dynamics in the atom, usually only a part of the HHG can be used for the synthesis of the attosecond pulse, which significantly limits the attosecond pulse width. In this work we theoretically study the synthesis of attosecond pulses from high-order harmonics generated by intense squeezed light. It is found that, unlike the coherent light, the whole HHG spectrum can be effectively used to synthesize attosecond pulses. By developing strong-field approximation theory in squeezed light, this is attributed to substantial suppression of long and multireturn electron trajectories at the single-atom level. Based on this novel scheme using intense squeezed light, we show that an isolated attosecond pulse can be synthesized from the entire HHG spectrum, and the pulse width is much shorter than that from the coherent light with the same laser parameters.},

Here we apply these techniques to polarons in polar liquids. Such quasiparticles describe solvated electrons interacting with many-body degrees of freedom of their environment. The polaron frequency, which depends on the electron concentration in the liquid, is controlled with a pump field. Using this field as a control, we demonstrate the aforementioned dynamical mimicry experimentally, rendering the polaron frequency of three different liquids identical.},

Energy consumption and heat generation in computers is now a pressing issue, but real electronic devices operate out of equilibrium and are subject to other noise sources besides temperature. Considering a quantum dot charge bit as a concrete model, we here derive a tighter bound, rigorously quantifying the dissipative impact of lifetime broadening and potential difference, in terms of a few experimentally measurable parameters. In practical contexts, these additional contributions may significantly outweigh the cost due to temperature alone. The results shed light not only on theoretical limits of erasure but also on constraints in realistic devices.},

Utilizing the spatial symmetries of the problem and identifying the relevant range of energies of the bath, we achieve a more efficient simulation, which we perform using tensor network techniques. As a demonstration, we study the collective emission from multiple emitters coupled to a square lattice of bosons and observe how the departure from Markovianity as coupling strength and emitter number is increased prevents collective radiation. We also simulate the dynamic preparation of an excitation in a bound state from a multiexcitation initial state.

By introducing a Stark coupling term, we significantly reduce the critical Rabi coupling strength required to achieve the SPT, enabling it to occur even in non-ultrastrong-coupling regimes. Using mean-field theory, we derive the conditions for the SPT and show that it exhibits a second-order phase transition. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the transition point can be widely tuned by the Stark coupling strength. The signatures of these Stark-tunable SPT points manifest through atomic pseudospin mean values. When quantum fluctuations are included, the spin-squeezing distributions also reveal the effects of Stark-tunable SPT points. In addition, we propose an experimentally feasible realization using an ion-trap system driven by three lasers. Our scheme enables optical switching between normal and superradiant phases through pump field intensity modulation, where the Stark coupling coefficient serves as the optically tunable parameter. Our results offer an alternative approach to engineer the SPT, extending superradiance-based quantum technologies beyond the ultrastrong-coupling regime.},

  abstract     = {We present a theoretical investigation of the Goos-Hänchen shift in an optical cavity containing a three-level atomic medium. Unlike conventional approaches that require external control or pump fields, transparency in our system is induced by the vacuum field itself through a phenomenon known as vacuum-induced transparency, distinguishing it from the traditional electromagnetically induced transparency. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce the concept of the vacuum-induced Goos-Hänchen (VIGH) shift, where the lateral displacement of the reflected beam is governed by vacuum field interactions. Additionally, we explore the influence of a microwave field on the atomic medium, demonstrating its ability to modulate both the magnitude and direction of the VIGH shift. Notably, we establish a tunable control over positive and negative VIGH shifts through the microwave field, with the shifts in magnitude further influenced by the photon number inside the cavity. Moreover, we examine the impact of Doppler broadening, revealing a unique deviation in VIGH shift behavior. In contrast to the Doppler-free case, where the microwave field can transition the VIGH shift between positive and negative regimes, Doppler broadening suppresses this transition, enhancing only the magnitude of the negative VIGH shift as microwave strength increases. Our findings provide deeper insights into light-matter interactions at the quantum level and open pathways for precision control of optical shifts in cavity-based quantum systems.},

Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing.

  abstract     = {Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit entanglement in the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode basis, which enables high-dimensional free-space quantum communication by exploiting the high-dimensional space spanned by the LG modes. For such free-space quantum communication, the brightness of the quantum light source plays an important role due to the atmospheric turbulence and photon loss. A variety of studies have analyzed the SPDC brightness by decomposing biphoton states into LG modes, but they have often relied on a degenerate state, a narrow-spectral-bandwidth approximation, or a thin-crystal approximation. However, these approaches are unsuitable for nondegenerate type-0 SPDC with a periodically poled nonlinear crystal, which offers higher brightness due to its superior nonlinear coefficients. In this study, we examine the spectrum of photon pairs in specific LG modes generated by a type-0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal while avoiding the constraints imposed by the aforementioned assumptions. In addition, we investigate the optimal focal parameters of the pump, signal, and idler to maximize the brightness for a given LG mode. Our findings show that it is not feasible to simultaneously optimize the brightness for different LG modes with a single pump focal parameter. The results of this study provide a comprehensive framework for developing high-brightness quantum light sources and contribute to the advancement of high-dimensional free-space quantum communication.},

Optimal negativity is obtained for a squeezing bandwidth similar to the linewidth of the transition of the two-level system.

  abstract     = {Multiple-phase estimation exploiting quantum states has broad applications in novel sensing and imaging technologies. However, the unavoidable presence of lossy environments in practical settings often diminishes the precision of phase estimations. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal multiple-phase estimation scheme that is inherently robust against photon loss, ensuring a persistent quantum advantage across all levels of photon loss. The scheme employs a multimode definite photon-number (DPN) state with weights optimized for given levels of photon loss. We theoretically demonstrate that the DPN state can sustain quantum enhancement in estimation precision under all levels of photon loss, compared to the classical benchmark that employs a coherent state input. The proposed scheme using DPN states generalizes earlier studies employing NOON states, which are only optimal when photon loss is small. We believe that our study, demonstrating persistent robustness to photon loss, paves the way for significant advancements in quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, enabling practical applications and quantum advantages in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Molecular polaritons are becoming one of the leading directions to control a multitude of chemical and physical processes, such as charge transfer, selective bond breaking, and excited-state dynamics. Accurately and efficiently simulating polariton properties under the collective-coupling regimes (between molecules and the cavity mode) remains a central theoretical challenge. In this work, we use a stochastic resolution of the identity approach coupled with a Chebyshev expansion to compute various polariton photophysical properties, with a substantially reduced computational effort than would be needed for a direct diagonalization of the same Hamiltonian, which is often the bottleneck for such large dimensionality. Such quantities of interest are the total density of states (the eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian) and the transmission spectrum (a probe of the photonic degrees of freedom), the latter of which is a direct observable in the experiment. We simulate the linear spectroscopy of molecule-cavity hybrid systems, specifically exploring the effects of the distribution and magnitude of molecular disorder for one, few, and many coupled molecules. We compare our numerical results to recent work, which formulated analytic expressions in the large- limit for the spectroscopic signals. We find that our results match those of the analytic results when , at which point we find that the collective effects for linear spectroscopy are converged.},

By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and spin qubit of nitrogen-vacancy center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach , about five orders of magnitude lower than that of the single conventional or unconventional magnon blockade. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.},

Our approach first uses the semianalytic evolution of the density matrix inside the ring up to the time where the squeezing is maximized. Then noting that a conservative approximate result for the squeezing can be obtained by ignoring the effect of the pump at later times, we calculate the free evolution of the field operators in the channel waveguide at all later times. We then calculate the quadrature squeezing spectrum in the waveguide, assuming that the measurement starts at the time when the squeezing in the ring is maximized. Using these results, we determine the optimum values for the pump pulse duration and amplitude and the ring-channel coupling for the pump and signal. We find that squeezing above 10 dB can be easily achieved in the channel for antisqueezing levels of less than 22 dB.},

  abstract     = {Quantum physics can be extended into the complex domain by considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that are parity-time ( ) symmetric. These exhibit exceptional points (EPs) where the eigenspectrum changes from purely real to purely imaginary values and have useful properties enabling applications such as accelerated entanglement generation and the delay of the sudden death of entanglement in noisy systems. An interesting question is whether similar beneficial effects can be achieved away from EPs, since this would extend the available parameter space and make experiments more accessible. We investigate this by considering a -symmetric optomechanical system but also consider what happens when two-mode squeezing interactions are included, taking us into the pseudo-Hermitian regime. The addition of squeezing is motivated by an attempt to extend the lifetime of the system's entanglement. While this does not prove to be the case, rich dynamics are nonetheless observed in both the pseudo-Hermitian and -symmetric systems, including the sudden death and revival of entanglement under certain conditions. In both cases, we find that the sudden disappearance of entanglement can be mitigated at EPs and also show that the revival of entanglement is quite robust to thermal noise in a group of parameters away from the EPs. This investigation extends our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and opens a new perspective for the development of quantum devices in non-Hermitian systems even away from EPs.},

We suggest to combine the (intrinsic) nonlinearities of a coherent multilevel medium with a tailored driving geometry that relies on two phase-mismatched standing-wave (SW) beams. This combination is essential for creating extra scattering channels over which, in addition, fully tunable optical nonreciprocal reflection can be attained. Our general approach is adapted here to four-level double- Λ atoms that are found to exhibit distinct forms of nonreciprocal multichannel scattering and to be quite sensitive to easily tunable parameters of two SW driving beams. The numerical results we present offer valuable insights into the field of non-Hermitian optical scattering and arise indeed from the interplay of interference among scattering processes and Bragg reflection.},

  abstract     = {We develop a general approach to describe the scattering of quantum light by a lossy macroscopic object placed in vacuum with no restrictions on both its dispersive optical response and its spatially inhomogeneous composition. Our analysis is based on the modified Langevin noise formalism, a recently introduced version of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics where scattering modes are explicitly separated from electric and magnetic medium excitations; accordingly the formalism involves three kinds of noninteracting boson polaritons such that, in the lossless limit, polaritons reduce to standard photons whereas and polaritons disappear. We analytically derive the input-output unitary relation joining the boson operators of the ingoing and outgoing polaritons, a nontrivial result hinging upon original relations which comprehensively describe the transmission-emission-absorption interplay pertaining the classical radiation scattering, relations we here deduce by resorting to properties of the dyadic Green's function. Besides we exploit the input-output relation to connect the output state of the field to the input one, this unveiling the role played by various classical electromagnetic dyadics in quantum optical scattering. We specialize the discussion to the most common situation where the object is initially not electromagnetically excited, with the ingoing electromagnetic state only containing polaritons, and we analyze the impact of the classical transmission and absorption dyadics on the transitions from ingoing to outgoing polaritons and on the creation of outgoing and polaritons, respectively. Since the scattered radiation is collected in the far-field and the object is usually left unmeasured, we analytically derive the reduced density operator of the outgoing polaritons revealing, in particular, how object losses both produce quantum decoherence of the scattered radiation and enable to exploit the possible entanglement among ingoing polaritons to dramatically manipulate the statistical mixture of the quantum states pertaining to the scattered radiation.},

  abstract     = {Arrays of nonlinear waveguides are a powerful integrated photonics platform for studying and manipulating quantum states of light. Also, they are a valuable resource for various quantum technologies. In this work, we employed a supermode approach to obtain an analytic solution to the evolution of degenerate biphoton states in arrays of nonlinear waveguides. The solution accounts for arrays of an arbitrary number of waveguides and coupling profiles. In addition, it provides an explicit analytic expression without the need of computationally expensive steps. Actually, it only relies on the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. In general, this needs to be performed numerically, but there are relevant instances in which analytic expressions are available. Thus, in certain cases, the procedure proposed here does not require the use of any numerical method. We analyze the general properties of the solution and show some application examples. Particularly, simple solutions that can be obtained by special symmetric injection profiles, the results for small arrays, and the properties of the propagation when only the center waveguide is pumped in a symmetric odd array. In addition, we present a proof-of-principle example on how to use the analytic solution to tackle inversion problems. That is, obtaining the initial conditions required to achieve a desired quantum state—which is a valuable technological application. A relevant aspect of the method presented here is its scalability for large arrays due to the lack of resource-intensive steps—both for the direct and inverse problems.},

The study demonstrates how a single laser field, combined with a steady static electric field, enables dynamic control of absorption and dispersion profiles of the system, offering precise control of the group velocity of the applied field. The multiple-quantum-well system exhibits a large Kerr nonlinearity (approximately ), which enhances the SPM effect under the TIT window. Our exploration of SPM using cosh-Gaussian pulses demonstrates that higher probe laser powers result in broader spectral widths and increased internal oscillations, especially under strong tunneling strengths. These results suggest promising applications for fine-tuning light propagation in quantum-well systems and offer a more economical approach for optical light-matter interaction experiments, minimizing the need for extensive optics and optomechanical components.},

Here we present how to generate and manipulate a tripartite entangled state of photons, phonons, and magnons within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. It is shown that simultaneously applying two coherent driving fields to this system in opposite input directions enables a coherent and effective way to regulate the magnomechanical interaction by tuning the phase difference of the driving fields. Based on this feature, it is found that the tripartite entanglement also becomes phase dependent and can be enhanced for certain phase differences. More interestingly, it is shown that the robustness of tripartite entanglement against environmental thermal noises can also be improved by choosing a proper phase difference of the driving fields. Our findings offer a promising way to manipulate and protect fragile tripartite entanglement, which is applicable to a wide range of quantum protocols that require multipartite entangled resources such as quantum communication and quantum metrology.},

Our analysis reveals that both the cross-Kerr nonlinearities and associated FWMs exhibit significant enhancement accompanied by compressed linewidths with increasing the detuning of the third field, though their enhancement behaviors differ remarkably. For the cross-Kerr nonlinearity and the associated FWM arising from the probe-coupling Λ -type EIT, the positions of the enhanced nonlinearities remain essentially unchanged with increasing signal detuning, and their magnitudes grow monotonically with the signal detuning. In contrast, for those from the probe-signal V -type EIT, the positions of the nonlinearities shift with the increasing coupling detuning, forming a two-photon resonance between the probe and coupling fields, while their magnitudes first increase and then decrease with the coupling detuning.},

We then present Bloch equations in the bare state basis as well as a dressed-state basis (using superradiant and subradiant states). As an application of the theory, we show calculations for a fully three-dimensional metal dimer in a gain-compensated medium containing two quantum emitters and show explicit solutions in terms of the quasinormal modes, which easily allows one to obtain all the relevant decay rates. We study the modified decay dynamics, gain excited pumping, as well as the entanglement entropy and spectral emission.

  abstract     = {Nanoscale lasers that generate short pulses at high repetition rates have exciting applications in various fields. However, creating short pulses as well as broad frequency combs in nanoscale lasers is complex and remains a relatively unexplored area. Research has focused on materials with two or more types of resonantly coupled dyes for applications in energy harvesting, biocentered uses, and expanding the tuning range of lasers. We propose that a gain medium composed of two types of coupled dye molecules can produce the saturable gain and absorption necessary for short-pulse generation. We present a mathematical model for this proposed two-dye gain material and integrate it with a finite-difference time-domain method. This developed model is used to assess the effectiveness of the two-dye material for pulse shortening in miniature lasers and to explore the role of a simple one-dimensional photonic cavity in pulsed laser operation. Additionally, we investigate various possible modes of laser operation by varying key design parameters of the dye molecules and the cavity. The findings indicate that the proposed laser can emit a train of short pulses and frequency combs with appropriate tuning of both the laser medium and the cavity. When the parameters of the material and cavity are optimally adjusted, the two-dye gain-medium-based laser is capable of emitting subpicosecond pulses at repetition rates in the hundreds of gigahertz.},

Unlike the artificial gauge field constructed through linear coupling in other settings, the gauge field in this system is realized by nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that this gauge field can generate stable chiral solitons with chiral energy flow rotating around the solitons. In contrast to conventional chiral currents generated with the same species or frequency, the chiral currents in the present system are formed by mutual coupling between fundamental-frequency and second-harmonic components. We derive the semianalytical solution for the chiral energy flow in this system. It is found that an optimal inclination angle that can maximize the chiral energy flow under different parameters exists, and this optimal inclination shows a positive correlation with the power and detuning. The mobility and collisions of the chiral solitons are also discussed. The results show that chiral solitons move in response to kicking and undergo fully elastic collisions with each other.

Although MEs are well-understood in single-photon systems, their manifestation in many-body contexts remains an active area of research. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain with a quasiperiodic potential modulating photon-photon interactions, effectively creating a mosaic lattice. We identify MEs for doublon states (i.e, bound photon pairs resulting from strong interactions) within the two-photon subspace. Our analytical solutions and numerical simulations confirm the existence of these MEs, extending single-photon MEs theories to the two-photon regime. Additionally, we analyze the dynamics of two emitters coupled to the waveguide, enabling the emission of supercorrelated photon pairs into the waveguide. Our findings reveal that coupling to extended states results in Markovian dynamics, characterized by exponentially supercorrelated decay, while coupling to localized states gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, marked by suppressed decay and persistent oscillations. Here, a transition from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior occurs around the MEs of the doublons. Finally, we propose a feasible experimental implementation using superconducting circuits, providing a platform to observe the interplay between interactions and disorder in quantum systems.},

By considering the multiple scattering process of the azimuthally propagating modes (APMs) at the nanoscatterers with a first-principles-based model, the local perfect chirality is predicted to result from the unidirectional reflectionlessness, i.e., the reflection-zero ( -zero) of the APMs at the two nanoscatterers. Numerical results and model predictions consistently show that the structural parameters of the -zero typically deviate from those of the EP, which means that the pair of split resonant eigenmodes at the -zero have different complex resonance frequencies and electromagnetic fields. In general, only one of the pair of split eigenmodes exhibits a local perfect chirality within the local azimuthal range divided by the two nanoscatterers. With the decrease of the two nanoscatterers' sizes or their relative azimuthal angle, the -zero tends to coincide with the EP.},

Specifically, our model captures the cantilever interaction with a surface via long-range attractive van der Waals forces and short-range repulsive-adhesive interactions described by the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov model. We find that when the probe resides within the attractive interaction regime, a coherent state emerges, whereas, in the repulsive regime, a squeezed state forms for the cantilever's deformation state.

  abstract     = {As the flow of time governs all evolutions, the reversal of time evolution has garnered intense research in many fields. The phenomenon of Landau-Zener (LZ) tunneling is one of the most remarkable time evolution processes in quantum mechanics. In this work, we study LZ tunneling with time-reversal operation in a Floquet system of synthetic temporal lattices, which is formed by the evolution of optical pulses in coupled fiber loops. With an abrupt change of gauge potential and the splitting parameter imposed on the lattices, the two eigenstates of the system are exchanged so that the time-reversal operation is realized. In the experiment, we demonstrate that time-reversal operations eliminate path degeneracy through propagation path reconstruction. The measurement of the dynamics of LZ tunneling and that with time-reversal operation is shown by applying the quenching dynamics. The study provides an effective approach to perform the LZ tunneling with time-reversal operation and expands our capability of measuring various tunneling processes. These methods can also be applied to optical interferometers, fiber communications, and quantum control.},

  abstract     = {Photon avalanche (PA) is a nonlinear process that presents a large growth of the upconversion fluorescence intensity signal and a strong absorption of the excitation light source occurring in lanthanide-doped systems. Conventional excitation schemes may introduce unwanted detrimental effects such as linear transmission losses and thermal effects. Here, a model is proposed in which the triggering mechanism for the PA effect is the absorption of a single photon by a pair of neighboring ions. The proposed model was studied using a rate equation system that describes the population dynamics of the electronic states of praseodymium ions in a silica fiber. The theoretical simulations confirm the presence of transmission attenuation and PA upconversion fluorescence when the lanthanide ions are at a short distance (a few angstroms), which guarantees the necessary PA positive feedback condition: a large cross-relaxation energy transfer rate among the lanthanide ions.},

It is found that the resonance wavelength of the CTP depends sensitively on the length of the conductive bridge connecting the nanorods, showing factor 10 enhancement of measurement (of the interparticle gap size) sensitivity as a nanoruler compared with that based on the BDP, while with changing the bridge width there is a switch of the mode nature with associated change of far-field scattering patterns. In addition, interparticle coupling induced Rabi splitting, Fano effect, and dual CTPs have been found.

Nonreciprocal metasurfaces can enable one-way light transmission and reflection with essential applications in optical communication. Conventional nonreciprocal metasurfaces rely on using magneto-optic or nonlinear materials to induce nonreciprocal optical properties. Here we propose and demonstrate an alternative mechanism for realizing nonreciprocal metasurfaces based on the relativistic effect of a moving medium. The metasurface is composed of periodic spinning dielectric cylinders located above a dielectric substrate. The spinning motion breaks the time-reversal symmetry and induces bi-anisotropic Tellegen-type response of the meta-atoms. We show that the metasurface can realize both asymmetric and nonreciprocal manipulations of the incident plane wave. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the Sagnac effect associated with the chiral multipole modes of the coupled spinning cylinders. By introducing dielectric pillars to modulate the phase profile, the metasurface can enable nonreciprocal wavefront manipulations. Our work offers a mechanism for realizing nonreciprocal light manipulation in free space. The proposed metasurface can serve as a platform to explore the interesting physics of nonreciprocal optics, non-Hermitian optics, and topological photonics.},

Our approach reformulates light propagation along helical paths as solving the Maxwell equations in a ray-based curvilinear coordinate system. This system can alternatively be interpreted as a spin-degenerate medium with antisymmetric elements in the dielectric tensor, corresponding to the spin-1 excitation mode characterized by a rotational dipole vector. We show that, at leading order, the resulting effective Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Maxwell theory in a uniformly rotating frame, incorporating both spin-rotation and orbit-rotation coupling. This rotation arises from the torsion of helical paths, manifesting as extrinsic orbital angular momentum (EOAM) of photons. Notably, the spin angular momentum of the photon and its intrinsic orbital angular momentum contribute jointly to the geometric phase. In the Heisenberg picture, the spin and orbital Hall effects naturally emerge from interaction terms in the ray equations. Furthermore, we find that the transverse spin of evanescent waves couples with EOAM, revealing that the geometric phase of elliptically polarized light differs from that of circularly polarized light. This distinction underscores the role of spin-orbit coupling in modifying phase accumulation.},

Quantitatively, based on a deep-subwavelength-confined 0.4-THz 1-ps pulsed driving field, we obtain a 0.095-cycle 3.6-fs-width mid-infrared femtosecond pulse with a peak frequency of ∼26 THz (∼38 fs in optical cycle) by using a 3-MeV 1-fs electron bunch, and a 0.091-cycle 180-as-width visible attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of ∼0.49 PHz (∼2.0 fs in optical cycle) by using a 15-MeV 50-as electron bunch, respectively. Below the optical damage threshold of the sapphire prisms used for field confinement, the single-pulse photon number can exceed 10 5 .

Here we investigate the generation of room-temperature quantum entanglement in a polariton optomechanical system consisting of an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and excitonic modes. The excitons and vibration are coupled via conditional displacement interactions, while the photon-exciton couplings occur via electric dipole interactions. We find that, mediated by exciton-vibration interaction, strong entanglement is established between the photon and the exciton, as well as between the photon and the vibration. Notably, the photon-vibration entanglement exhibits an astonishing enhancement with an increasing number of excitons, even far surpassing the entanglement generated from direct coupling between the exciton and vibration. Moreover, we demonstrate that these entanglements not only can be generated in a room-temperature environment ( K) but also exhibit considerable robustness against thermal noise. Furthermore, we achieve tripartite entanglement in this system under both room- and ultrahigh-temperature conditions.

  abstract     = {We investigate the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) and the Goos-Hänchen shift (GH shift) in semi-Dirac materials. Through theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the anisotropic dielectric function in semi-Dirac materials plays a critical role in determining the magnitude and polarity of these optical displacements. Furthermore, by utilizing the unidirectional drift of massless Dirac electrons in semi-Dirac materials, we systematically reveal how the drift velocity and direction modulate the behavior of optical displacements. The results indicate that the unique electronic properties of semi-Dirac materials—particularly their anisotropic dielectric response and carrier drift dynamics—establish mechanisms for controlling optical displacements and polarization-dependent phenomena. This work opens a new avenue for designing advanced photonic devices with tunable optical responses, particularly with significant application potential in quantum information processing and topological photonics.},

Based on geometric optics, design formulas are derived for the focal length and general spherical aberration coefficients of specifically crossed ponderomotive lenses. Numerical calculations demonstrate that a pair of these crossed ponderomotive lenses can effectively correct spherical aberration in the objective lens of an electron microscope. Unlike rotationally symmetric ponderomotive lenses, which require the optical beam to be coaxially aligned with the electron beam, the crossed ponderomotive lens avoids the need to place optical mirrors and lenses directly on the beam axis. Thus, it offers practical advantages in designing and building electron optical instruments and contributes to system miniaturization. With lens properties similar to multipole lenses, the proposed crossed ponderomotive lens is expected to facilitate diverse developments in electron optical systems incorporating ponderomotive potentials.},

Here, we present an observation of distinct first-order and second-order topological insulators in photonic martini lattices fabricated by femtosecond laser writing technology. By using direct femtosecond laser writing techniques, we experimentally construct two types of photonic nontrivial martini lattices with tailored boundary conditions (i.e., the martini-up lattice and the martini-down lattice), enabling direct experimental observation of topological edge states and corner states with distinct phase structures. Remarkably, these lattices support different second-order topological phases, each giving rise to distinct classes of topological corner states under varying phase transition conditions. Furthermore, we uncover striking differences in their edge state behavior: while the martini-down lattice sustains only in-phase topological edge states, the martini-up lattice hosts both in-phase and out-of-phase configurations. This work not only introduces a novel framework for exploring higher-order topology, but also provides the possibility for innovative approaches to light manipulation and the development of advanced photonic devices.},

In this study, we introduce a method employing radially chirped annular (RCA) beams to significantly enhance HHG efficiency and coherence. RCA beams, which enable symmetric simultaneous spatio-temporal focusing with precise control, satisfy the essential requirements for efficient HHG: they can maximize laser intensity at the target while spatially separating the driving field from the harmonics in the far field. The 2D 1 carrier-resolved pulse propagation simulations demonstrate that, in the presence of plasma-induced defocusing, the RCA beam resists lateral spreading and maintains a more consistent phase front across the beam due to its spatio-spectral structure. Interestingly, the beam profile also exhibits dual chirp behavior, with positive chirping observed on axis and negative chirping off axis. RCA-driven harmonics demonstrate position-independent yield stability relative to the focal point, while remaining highly structured, broader in spectrum, more intense, and less divergent than those generated with conventional Gaussian beams. Moreover, harmonics achieve more spectral extension in the cutoff region and can generate attosecond pulses with durations nearly twice as short and intensities 1.5 times higher than conventional methods, along with enhanced phase stability across the generated harmonics. These findings suggest RCA beams hold strong potential for applications requiring high-flux coherent extreme ultraviolet and soft-x-ray radiation, opening transformative possibilities for advancing attosecond science and ultrafast spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Two-color laser induced plasma filamentation in air could serve as tabletop sources of broadband terahertz (THz) pulses. Ubiquitous air in the earth facilitates its widespread utilities, particularly, in wireless communication and remote sensing, exploiting the unique advantage of the air-based scheme that the THz sources can be delivered over standoff distances via the pump laser propagation in air. However, the THz emission pattern inevitably has a conical angular profile with a dip in the propagation axis. Therefore, THz energy concentration, propagation directionality, and accuracy of signal demodulation are significantly impaired, greatly limiting its direct applications. Here, we successfully eliminate the unfavorable conical profile by experiments and meanwhile enhance THz directionality and intensity by 17 folds at the focus by use of abruptly autofocusing laser beams. Our simulations with a far-field model well reproduce the experimental observations, when the air filament length is read from the experimentally recorded fluorescence images. More importantly, we find that because the Gouy phase of Gaussian beam is ignored, the widely adopted dephasing length is significantly overestimated by 30 folds, which cannot explain the observed conical THz emission even when the filament length is shorter than the dephasing length. While the abruptly autofocusing beams are employed, the dephasing length is increased by five folds and the dephasing effect can be well overcome, which causes elimination of the unfavorable conical profile and enhancement of the THz intensity. This scheme is easily accessible since the abruptly autofocusing beam can be achieved by imposing a spatial light modulator on the input Gaussian beam.},

  abstract     = {Abrupt time variations of the properties of optical materials have been at the center of intense research efforts in recent years, with the prospect of enabling extreme wave transformations and of leveraging time as a degree of freedom for wave control. While the most viable approach to yield ultrafast variations of the optical material response is through optical pumping of nonlinear media, the complex dynamics in these systems are not yet fully understood. Here, as a relevant case study of recent experimental observations, we rigorously investigate the pump-probe dynamics in a 310-nm-thick transparent conductive oxide etalon, using a weak 40-fs probe and a pump that displays peak power densities in the range with a duration of a few femtoseconds. We examine the pump-probe interaction using a hydrodynamic Maxwell approach that accounts for diffraction, self-focusing and self-defocusing, self- and cross-phase modulation, probe gain, and linear and nonlinear material dispersion expanded in the perturbative regime up to ninth order for both pump and probe. By allowing the intricacies of the pump-probe interaction to proceed in time, we can also define an effective spatiotemporal permittivity for a more direct evaluation of the material ultrabroadband optical behavior. The reported results challenge the conventional modeling of this kind of problem, which has so far overlooked pump dynamics, simplistically assigning a local time-dependent refractive index to the probe that may be designed to fit the experimental data but has no physical connection to the complex pump-probe interaction. Our approach unveils new dynamics, pointing toward the possibility to achieve extreme pulse compression into the attosecond range and nonlinear diffraction over deeply subwavelength propagation distances, thus opening a possible new path toward novel and cost-effective tools for integrated photonics and attosecond science.},

We elaborate a scenario for the formation of dissipative multispot excitations (MSEs) in Kerr cavities, modeled by the one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Lugiato-Lefever (LL) equations, which include a spatially periodic pump (SPP). First, we demonstrate that the SPP produces three alternative exact periodic solutions of the LL equation, expressed in terms of the , and elliptic functions. By means of numerical methods, we explore the modulational instability (MI) and transverse instability (TI) of the periodic states in 1D and 2D settings, respectively. In the case of the defocusing nonlinearity, the 1D MI breaks the periodic states into an array of spatiotemporal crescents. In the case of self-focusing, the 1D MI, initiated by small random perturbations, leads to the establishment of a chaotic state, with the amplitude statistics featuring a long-tail probability distribution, that represents the presence of dissipative rogue waves. On the other hand, spatially periodic perturbations initiate the formation of breather chains, which periodically disappear and reappear, resembling the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence. In the 2D regime, the TI results in the formation of an array of 2D lumps. For a given SPP strength, the exact solutions for the periodic structures are stable if the loss constant exceeds a critical value. The findings reported here provide a contribution to nonequilibrium physics in general and may find direct applications in laser physics.},

We systematically analyze effects of the amplitude and width of the Gaussian modulation, as well as the total number of atoms, on the shape and stability of the QDs, some effects being explained analytically. Collisions between identical QDs with moving in opposite directions along the central axis leads to their merger into still more elongated breathing QDs with the same vorticity, while collisions between QDs with are quasielastic. Moving modulation profiles are able to adiabatically rotate the trapped elongated QDs.

However, topological enhancement and protection could play a crucial role within coherence time, out of which decoherence mostly washes out the quantum feature. It motivates us to accelerate topological effects to achieve effective protection and optimal control of quantum information. Taking the prototypical Thouless pumping as an example, quantized transport of particles in a cyclic adiabatic evolution faces a challenge: slow driving may exceed the coherent time, while fast driving may break quantization. To address this dilemma, we propose to add a control Hamiltonian to speed up Thouless pumping using shortcuts to adiabaticity. Compared to traditional Thouless pumping, our fast quantum pumping scheme not only enables a substantial reduction of pumping time, but also effectively suppresses wave-packet diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the resilience of our protocol to moderate noise levels in both momentum and real space. Our study settles the notoriously critical problem of practical quantum pumping.},

  abstract     = {There is a severe impediment in Stern-Gerlach interferometry with a spin-embedded nanoparticle. This is because particle rotation creates a significant mismatch of the wave function of angular degrees of freedom during the creation and recombination of the spatial superposition, resulting in an inferior visibility contrast. We show that imparting angular momentum along the direction of a defect, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, during the Stern-Gerlach interferometry provides excellent gyroscopic quantum stability to a nanodiamond, which opens up a way to maintain significant visibility in the quantum interference. The spin contrast improves by many folds for a wide-ranging value of the initial angular momentum, e.g., Hz for a mass of order -kg nanodiamond. Our scheme is independent of the material and is pertinent to any nanoparticle that can be used to create massive and large spatial superpositions with an embedded spin defect.},

  abstract     = {We explore the paired superfluid phases of a Fermi gas in the presence of a continuous Rabi drive. We focus on the case where two components are Rabi coupled strongly enough that they form hybrid superpositions, which in turn interact with an uncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we obtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We find that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and BEC-BEC crossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare transition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying interactions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore identify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid transitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized Thouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical temperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also possesses additional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled components, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body system. The Rabi-driven Fermi gas thus emerges as a unique platform for engineering and probing a rich array of multiband superfluid phases.},

We find that our dissipative point vortex model is well approximated by Fokker-Planck evolution only for very low initial energies per vortex, when almost all vortices and antivortices are closely bound into dipoles. We observe that the dynamical critical exponent in the dissipative point vortex model undergoes a crossover, from a roughly constant value close to 2 for , to a value which depends explicitly on the initial conditions for .},

This phase emerges in two separate models, both featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction that induces negative binding energy for the composite trions. The first is the pair-hopping model, in which spinless fermions undergo pair hopping to form preformed pairs. The second is the extended Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model, describing dipolar bosons and fermions with density-density interactions. Notably, the formation of composite trions is independent of the specific pairing interactions of fermions. Extensive density-matrix renormalization-group calculations demonstrate the quasicondensation of the composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single-particle excitations, and suppressed fermion pair correlations.

We predict not only the emergence of edge and corner states, which characterize topological insulators, but also the appearance of pairs of topologically charged Dirac points and cones in gapless semimetallic phases. Moreover, the position, tilt, and degree of anisotropy of the cones, which may determine the transport properties in the system, are tunable via the lattice parameters. This establishes Rydberg lattice gases, which are already at the forefront of quantum simulation platforms, as the ideal setup for the exploration of topological phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in ultraweak magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (spin-exchange relaxation free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.},

The correlation between the two electrons, ionized at two atomic sites, is revealed through analysis of the joint kinetic energy spectra and the momentum distributions. Notably, one of the two electrons exhibits a pronounced redshift in the low-kinetic-energy region, in contrast to the electron energy spectrum observed in single ionization of argon dimers. This distinctive spectral feature is corroborated by theoretical simulations, which attribute the redshift to the differing intensity dependence of the kinetic energy distributions of the two electrons, as well as to the influence of electron-electron correlation during the ionization process.},

The study focuses on elucidating the influence of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) difference between the two laser beams on key dynamical properties, including the alignment of neutral molecules, ionization probability, dissociation probability, proton angular distribution, and kinetic energy release (KER). Our study shows that two-color fields can simultaneously provide coherent and incoherent modulations of molecular dynamics. For neutral molecular alignment, two-color modulation proves ineffective as it depends quadratically on intensity rather than wave properties. However, strong-field ionization's inherent nonlinearity enables coherent control through intensity-dependent angular distributions and ionization probabilities. Examining fragmentation dynamics, we observe coexisting first-, second-, and third-order processes under two-color irradiation. First-order transitions exhibit incoherent modulation via laser component competition, altering vibrational distributions and KER spectra phase independently. The second-order process repopulates bound states but minimally affects fragmentation. Crucially, at high intensities, the dominant third-order process enables phase-dependent coherent control through reexcitation of second-order-created bound states, revealing fundamental insights into multiorder process interplay in strong-field molecular dynamics.},

Interpretation of RABBITT spectra is limited to a lowest-order description, while new variants of the technique necessitate higher intensity infrared fields where this description breaks down. Here, we present an extension of RABBITT theory which can account for higher-order processes (RABBITT-HOP), and demonstrate RABBITT-HOP's ability to predict and describe higher-order processes through ab initio simulation of a RABBITT experiment targeting the high-lying Rydberg series of helium. We demonstrate that the signature line shape imparted by the resonances in the phase of the lowest sideband can also be observed in the phase of the next mainband, as well as in the phases of the next sideband and mainband—each with additional phase shifts predicted under RABBITT-HOP. Repeating this analysis for a range of infrared intensities, we determine the lower limits of intensities required for these higher-order processes to become observable and upper limits beyond which nonperturbative effects begin to dominate. This new theoretical framework forms a much-needed basis for accurate interpretation of RABBITT spectra in experiments involving more intense fields, and paves the way for the development of new RABBITT-like techniques which take advantage of this new understanding of how atomic resonance effects may be propagated beyond their nearest sideband.},

  abstract     = {Ionization of a target gas by a strong laser field, which is the first step for many processes studied in strong-field physics, results in the appearance of free electrons. Recently, we showed that the interaction of the laser field with these electrons affects the quantum state of the field, leading to the formation of nonclassical and non-Gaussian field states [ Phys. Rev. A 110 , 023115 (2024) ]. In this paper we generalize our model to the multimode case, which allows us to consider Thomson scattering (TS) of the laser field by the electrons. We show that for sufficiently long pulses under typical experimental conditions TS causes coherent transfer of photons from the strong laser mode to weak modes with close frequencies and wave vectors. This results in a displacement of the initial coherent state of the laser field similar to that recently discovered and caused by the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) process [M. Lewenstein et al. , Nat. Phys. 17 , 1104 (2021) ]. The similarity with HHG suggests that, by conditioning on TS, multiphoton Schrödinger cat states of the laser field can be generated. The TS mechanism has a different dependence on the pulse parameters compared with the HHG mechanism, which may facilitate more efficient and robust generation of cat states. In particular, it also works for circularly polarized fields, in which case HHG does not occur.},

Here, we demonstrate that inherent atomic dissipation, traditionally detrimental, serves as a flexible tool for nonreciprocity control. It is shown that the dissipation-dependent atomic population and coherence effects exhibit competitive yet distinct characteristics in breaking Lorentz reciprocity, enabling the coexistence and interconversion of reciprocal and nonreciprocal states within a V-type atomic system. By implementing a dissipation-engineered switching framework, a nontrivial transition between reciprocity and nonreciprocity is achieved. These findings establish the direct link between microscopic dissipation and dynamic nonreciprocity control, paving a way for all-optical reconfigurable nonreciprocity.},

In this work, we report on the emergence of the rf pseudonull, a locus of points where the ion responds to light as if it were at the true rf null, despite being displaced from it. The phenomenon is fully explained by accounting for the general two-dimensional structure of micromotion and is experimentally verified under various potential configurations, with observations in great agreement with numerical simulations. The rf pseudonull manifests as a line in a two-dimensional parameter space, determined by the geometry of the incident light and its overlap with the motional structure of the ion.

In this work, we investigate a new technique to calculate the frequency shifts arising from magnetic field inhomogeneities and motional magnetic fields, particularly in the case where the spins in question are subjected to a time-periodic magnetic field. The method is based on Floquet theory, a general framework for analyzing periodic linear differential equations, and Redfield theory, which governs the time evolution of the density matrix in the presence of weak couplings to an environment. We benchmark this method against the analytical results derived both with and without dressing field, as well as against the results of a conventional Runge-Kutta integrator, and find agreement in all cases.

The other semiclassical model is the Heisenberg one, which effectively accounts for the interaction of each electron with the core via a soft-core potential. We identify and compare the signatures of correlated three-electron escape for both quantum and semiclassical models on Dalitz plots and find a better agreement between the quantum and the ECBB model. We also show that a central “spot” on the Dalitz plots is reproduced by all models. Using the ECBB model we associate this spot with the direct triple ionization pathway and argue this to be the case also for the quantum model. Devising a simple classical model that accounts for the direct pathway of triple ionization, we show that the width of this spot in the Dalitz plots solely depends on the time of tunnel ionization.},

Recently, we demonstrated that state engineering approaches can be applied in intense laser-atom interactions to obtain measurement statistics which resemble optical “cat” states by using intensity measurements and classical postselection of the measurement data. Postprocessing of a finite-size sampled data set allows one to select specific events, here the processes that are energy conserving, corresponding to measurement statistics of nonclassical states of light. However, to fully realize the potential of this method for quantum state engineering, it is crucial to thoroughly investigate the role of the involved measurements and the finite-size nature of the postselection scheme. We illustrate this by analyzing the postselection approach recently developed for high harmonic generation, which enables the generation of optical cat states bright enough to induce nonlinear phenomena. These findings provide significant guidance for quantum light engineering and the generation of intense optical cat states with potential applications in nonlinear optics and quantum science.},

In this work, we shed light on the dependencies and magnitude of this effect for chiral materials. Using the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and Fermi's Golden Rule, we study a chiral bulk medium with and without local-field corrections, an idealized chiral mirror and a chiral surface. The results imply that the chiral effect is greatest for large transition frequencies, molecules with large optical rotatory strength and media with a strong cross-susceptibility. In the case of a half space, short distances from the molecule to the interface additionally enhance the effect.},

  abstract     = {We develop a pulse-driven jump protocol to achieve all-optical Raman control of ultracold atomic hyperfine states. By establishing general conditions for adiabatic evolution between quantum states in parameter space, we derive the essential pulse area and phase conditions necessary for quantum state transfer in a resonant single- three-level system. We extend this approach to a double- four-level system by incorporating a neighboring intermediate state, which leads to a single-photon detuned three-level system. Through numerical simulations of the ultracold atomic system, we demonstrate that high-fidelity and robust control of quantum state transfer can be achieved in the single- three-level system using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and the pulsed jump protocol. Furthermore, we show that the destructive quantum interference effects between resonant and detuned Raman pathways in the double- four-level system can be mitigated by optimizing the pulse area and two-photon detuning parameters within the pulsed jump protocol.

Sequential absorption of an extreme ultraviolet photon and an IR photon from the collinear beams excites the bright state and the dark states. The subsequent absorption of an IR photon from the noncollinear beam then leads to an angled extreme ultraviolet emission, whose variation with delay encodes the coupling between autoionizing states, the lifetimes of dark states, and nonperturbative effects. Both our measurements and ab initio simulations of the angled four-wave-mixing signal reveal a double-peak structure in the delay dependence, in good agreement with each other. We attribute the central minimum between the two peaks to rapid Rabi cycling, driven by the collinear IR dressing pulse, between the dark states and the resonance, which leads to destructive interference in the final transition amplitude.},

At small interpulse delays ( fs), this enhancement occurs when the molecule is aligned to the probe pulse.

For this reason, many proof-of-principle and method studies replace three-dimensional atoms by suitable one-dimensional soft-core models. Soft-core potentials may be classified by their curvature at the nucleus that can be either infinite, finite, or vanishing. Within each class, models with analytical ground states and correct binding energy exist. In this work we examine if the agreement with real atoms extends to perturbations by electric fields for such models. We demonstrate that the static polarizability is generally overestimated. Accordingly, we construct an improved soft-core potential, for which both binding energy and polarizability agree with three-dimensional values. Additionally, the hyperpolarizability of this model deviates by as little as 3% from three-dimensional hydrogen, and field-induced ionization is correctly captured. Finally, we show that the new potential leads to significantly improved response to time-dependent fields.},

  abstract     = {Creating a soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted while varying the H-CN distance. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other theoretical and experimental studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct a molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.},

It is found that the transmission of electrons with incident energy occurs mostly within the geometrically allowed angle and they exit along the incident direction. The rate of the directly transmitted electrons decreases with time and their angular distributions broaden as the incident charge increases. A tentative simulation is performed to explain the experimental results by taking into account the deposited charges on the capillary walls, the image force, and electron scattering processes. The blocking of the transmission of the electrons with the incident energy is explained to be from the formation of the attractive Coulomb field, from the opposite (positive) charge to the incident electron inside the capillaries due to the impact of the projectiles and the production of secondary electrons. The broadening of the full angular distribution for the directly transmitted electrons is attributed to the charging of the bulk of the capillary membrane. This provides evidence for the controversial issue of the production of charge patches and their role in transmitting electrons through insulating nanocapillaries.},

Our study introduces an effective, compact source of thorium atomic and molecular ions produced via laser ablation of microgram-scale, salt-based samples. We thoroughly analyze the variety of ion species and charge states generated at varying laser fluences. Utilizing 10 µ g of thorium fluoride crystals and laser fluences between 1.00(5) and 6.75(35) J/ cm 2 , we produce thorium molecular ions ThF x 232 n + (with x = 0 – 3 and charge states up to n = 3 ), including ThF 2 + and ThF 3 + . These species are particularly relevant for spectroscopy; ThF 3 + is valuable due to its stable closed-shell configuration, while ThF 2 + , which is isoelectronic to RaF, offers a unique probe for studying nuclear structure and fundamental symmetries due to its simple electronic structure with a single unpaired electron. Density-functional-theory-based calculations of the electric charge distribution aid in understanding the formation of the observed species. Positive charges are found to be mainly located on the thorium atom, which points to an inhibition of immediate Coulomb explosion, thus supporting the existence of the observed ion species.

  abstract     = {We continue our investigation of multipartite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I [J.-T. Hsiang and B. L. Hu, Phys. Rev. A 110 , 062807 (2024) ] we consider a system of N harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of N neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the N system atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the nonmonotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schrödinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a method for determining the atom number distribution of few atoms in a tight optical tweezer from their fluorescence distributions. In the tight tweezer regime, the detection light causes rapid atom loss due to light-assisted collisions. This in turn leads to non-Poissonian and overlapping fluorescence distributions for different initial atom numbers, and commonly used threshold techniques fail. We use maximum likelihood estimation algorithms to fit model distributions that account for the atom loss. This gives accurate atom number distributions for relatively few experimental runs (about 600 is sufficient) to sample a photon number distribution. We show that the method can be extended to situations when the photon number distributions for known initial atom numbers cannot be modeled, at the cost of requiring a higher number of experimental runs.},

It is a sensitive technique for measuring interactions between excited atoms and surfaces, thus providing a unique tool to probe resonant effects in Casimir-Polder physics. The theoretical modeling of selective reflection spectra has thus far employed the infinite Doppler approximation which assumes that the Doppler shift dominates over the atom-surface interactions as well as the homogeneous transition linewidth. Here we extend the theoretical treatment of selective reflection spectra to include the effects of finite Doppler width. This allows us to analyze the regime of very large Casimir-Polder interactions, relevant for Rydberg atom spectroscopy, and revisit previous analyses of experiments with low-lying excited states. Further, this will aid in determining the signatures of quantum friction in vapor cell spectroscopy.},

An unexpected polarization behavior of dielectronic and trielectronic recombination has been shown, suggesting a promising opportunity for further study of the HO electronic recombination process.},

The algorithm uses a transform to convert the molecular orientation distribution, which is a function of three Euler angles, to the atom-pair distribution functions which depend on the polar and azimuthal angles. The diffraction signal can then be calculated from the atom-pair distributions. We demonstrate the computation method numerically by calculating electron diffraction patterns for a symmetric top molecule (trifluoroiodomethane) and an asymmetric top molecule (formaldehyde) and show that it reduces the calculation time by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to the standard brute-force method. The method can also be applied to the calculation of x-ray diffraction patterns.},

  abstract     = {Between the absorption and the emission spectral line shapes of dense atomic and molecular media, such as dye solutions and alkali-noble buffer gas mixtures at high pressure, in many cases there exists a universal scaling, the Kennard-Stepanov relation, which is a manifestation of detailed balance. This relation plays a crucial role in recent Bose-Einstein condensation experiments of visible-spectral photons in, e.g., dye-solution-filled optical microcavities. It has recently been proposed to use high-pressure xenon–noble-gas mixtures as a thermalization medium for vacuum-ultraviolet regime photons, so as to extend the achievable wavelength range of such Bose-Einstein-condensed optical sources from the visible to the vacuum-ultraviolet regime. In this work, we report two-photon excitation spectroscopy measurements of ground-state ( ) xenon atoms subject to up to of helium or krypton buffer gas pressure, respectively, in the 220–260 nm wavelength range. The study of such two-photon spectra is of interest, e.g., for the exploration of possible pumping schemes of a future vacuum-ultraviolet photon Bose-Einstein condensate. We have also recorded absorption and emission spectra of the single-photon transition near 147 nm wavelength of xenon atoms subject to of krypton buffer gas pressure. We find that the ratio of absorption and emission shows a Kennard-Stepanov scaling, which suggests that such gas mixtures are promising candidates as a thermalization medium for a Bose-Einstein condensate of vacuum-ultraviolet photons.},

Our results confirm that the total threshold behavior follows the expected power-law dependence: for exothermic reactions and for endothermic reactions, where .

  abstract     = {The wave-packet convergent close-coupling approach has been used to model electron-capture and ionization processes occurring in collisions of and ions with atomic hydrogen. We use a model potential approach to represent the interactions with the hydrogenlike oxygen ion. We outline a method to obtain model potential parameters which provide significantly more accurate ground- and excited-state energies for the projectiles formed through electron capture than what is currently available in the literature. For both collision systems, our results for the total electron-capture cross section agree very well with one set of experimental measurements, but disagree with the other set. For the total ionization cross section, our results disagree with the classical trajectory Monte Carlo calculations. This difference is likely due to the choice of distribution used to describe the initial electron cloud in the classical calculations. We also calculate state-selective electron-capture cross sections, important for fusion plasma diagnostics and astrophysical research, resolved in terms of the final-state principal and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. For the projectile, slight differences are observed in some of the partial cross sections when compared with other theoretical calculations, but the present results are generally in good agreement with the existing literature. At energies relevant to fusion plasma modeling, there is no state-selective data available in the literature for the collision system. The presented results fill this gap.},

Using a high-voltage cylindrical mirror analyzer, we analyzed scattered ions at a fixed large scattering angle of 14°, achieving sub- -shell penetration where projectile-target separations fall below the -shell radius of the target atoms. This work bridges the gap between low-velocity quasimolecular-orbital models and high-velocity perturbative approaches. The measured ratios exhibit a strong dependence on both velocity and target species, which are quantitatively reproduced by a modified classical overbarrier model incorporating empirical corrections for screening effects. Our analysis reveals that -shell electrons dominate charge exchange at intermediate velocities due to their ultrashort orbital periods, particularly in heavy targets like Ar. Our study advances the understanding of electron dynamics in deeply penetrating ion-atom collisions and provides a valuable reference for modeling charge transfer in asymmetric systems.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how the quantum friction experienced by a polarizable atom moving with constant velocity parallel to a planar interface is modified when the latter consists of chiral or nonreciprocal media, with special focus on topological insulators. Macroscopic quantum electrodynamics is used to obtain the velocity-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift and decay rate. These results are a generalization to matter with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our findings are illustrated by examining the nonretarded and retarded limits for five examples: a perfectly conducting mirror, a perfectly reflecting nonreciprocal mirror, a three-dimensional topological insulator, a perfectly reflecting chiral mirror, and an isotropic chiral medium. Different asymptotic power laws are found for all these materials. Interestingly, two bridges exist between chirality and nonreciprocity through the frequency shift, which arise as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling. Specifically, the position-dependent Casimir-Polder frequency shift for the nonreciprocal case depends on a geometric magnetic field associated with photoionization of chiral molecules, while the Casimir-Polder frequency shift depending on the velocity for the chiral case has the optical rotatory strength as the atomic response, and those for the nonreciprocal case depend on an analog of the optical rotatory strength.},

We introduce a method to optimize the fictitious mean configuration used in the Flexible Atomic Code, significantly improving the accuracy of calculated energy levels and transition properties for lanthanide and actinide ions. Our approach employs a sequential model-based optimization algorithm to refine the fictitious mean configuration, iteratively minimizing the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined energy levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through detailed analyses of Au ii , Pt ii , Pr ii , Pr iii , Er ii , and Er iii , representing a broad range of atomic configurations. The results show substantial improvements in the accuracy of the calculated energy levels, with average relative differences to the NIST data reduced from 20–60% to 10% or less for the studied ions. Transition wavelength calculations exhibit good agreement with experimental data, with about 90% of the calculated values falling within 10% of measurements for Pr and Er ions. While improvements in the transition probability calculations are observed, the calculated radiative transition probabilities. ) values] still show significant discrepancies compared to the experimental data, with root-mean-square deviations of approximately 1.1–1.4 dex for Pr and Er ions. We extend our optimization technique to systematic calculations of singly and doubly ionised lanthanides, achieving accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of ab initio atomic structure codes. The method's broad applicability across the lanthanide series demonstrates its potential for enhancing opacity calculations and spectral modeling in astrophysical contexts.},

Like other atomic sensors, including atomic clocks and atom interferometers, the atomic magnetometer could, in principle, be augmented with spin squeezing for further sensitivity enhancement. However, existing atomic magnetometers are not compatible with spin squeezing because the atoms can hardly be in a pure quantum state during operation. Moreover, a natural challenge faced by an atomic magnetometer is the arbitrary direction of the magnetic field. In this paper, we propose a cold-atom-based magnetometer with spin squeezing that can measure both the magnitude and the direction of an arbitrary magnetic field. For experimentally accessible parameters, we show that the technique described above could potentially achieve a sensitivity nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the best existing magnetometers.},

To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance.

Boson sampling seems to be a very promising platform in this regard, but to be confident of attaining the advantage regime, one must provide evidence of operating with the correct boson sampling distribution, and not with any of the distributions that admit efficient classical simulation. This problem is often called the validation problem, and it poses a major challenge to demonstrating unambiguous quantum advantage. In this work, using the recently proposed wave-function network approach, we study the sample space filling behavior with increasing the number of collected samples. We show that this allows for black-box data to exclude several undesired hypotheses, especially the distinguishable particles sampling. At this point, reference values corresponding to the true distribution are still required for the presented approach to be considered a complete validation protocol. Nevertheless, we show that it can instead be used for simple and efficient validation against a trusted sampling device. We also study the scaling of our approach with system size and under imperfections such as losses.

  abstract     = {We consider entanglement-assisted private communication over a classical-quantum multiple-access channel with two senders and a single receiver. We initially determine the capacity region where senders and receiver share unlimited entanglement resources. In this setting, each sender performs an encoding measurement on their share of the entangled state to transmit a measurement outcome via the classical-quantum multiple-access channel. Meanwhile, the receiver applies a decoding operation to both the channel's output state and their share of the entangled state. We further derive the private capacity. Moreover, we consider the capacity region and private capacity when entanglement is shared between only the two senders. This corresponds to a quantum extension of the classical multiple-access channel with entanglement. Significantly, we show that the capacity region when both senders share entanglement with the receiver is strictly larger than when only the two senders share the entanglement.},

This model leverages spin-dependent boson displacement and dissipation controlled by sympathetic cooling. We show that, when coupled to external degrees of freedom, the ET model can be used as a dissipative quantum control mechanism, enabling the precise tailoring of both spin and boson steady states of a target subsystem. We derive simplified analytical formalisms that offer intuitive insights into the dissipative dynamics. Using realistic interactions in a trapped-ion system, we develop a protocol for generating N -qubit and N -boson W states. Additionally, we generalize this protocol to realize generic N -qubit Dicke states with tunable excitation numbers. Finally, we outline a realistic experimental setup to implement our schemes in the presence of noise sources.},

  abstract     = {Bell measurements, which allow entanglement between uncorrelated distant particles, play a central role in quantum communication. Indeed, sharing, measuring, and creating entanglement lie at the core of various protocols, such as entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. While for optical qubit systems a Bell measurement can be implemented using only linear components, the same result is no longer true for high-dimensional states, where one has to consider either auxiliary photons or nonlinear processes. Here, inspired by the latter approach, we propose a protocol for high-dimensional quantum teleportation based on nonlinear techniques. Moreover, we discuss the practical implementation of our proposed setup in the case of path-encoded qutrits, where nonlinear effects arise from sum-frequency generation. Finally, we compute the fidelity between quantum states to benchmark the validity of our model under the presence of crosstalk noise. Our approach is deterministic, versatile, and does not rely on the use of auxiliary photons, thus paving the way towards the practical implementation of quantum networks based on nonlinear effects.},

Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions.

These massive matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, macroscopic quantum superposition can use entanglement features to, e.g., test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a laboratory. We will consider a Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus to create macroscopic quantum superposition in a harmonic oscillator trap, and figure out the spin contrast loss due to linear spin-independent and spin-dependent noise in a single interferometer. We will show that spin contrast loss due to spin-independent noise does not depend on the initial thermal state of the matter wave function. However, spin contrast loss due to spin-dependent fluctuations is dependent on the initial thermal occupation of the quantum state.

However, such an optimization is often nontrivial. In this work, we present an analytical bound on the Rényi entropy in terms of the Rényi divergence and derive the analytical gradient of the Rényi divergence. This enables us to generalize existing state-of-the-art numerical frameworks for the optimization of key rates.

We first analyze the nonclassical attribute of quadrature squeezing in these generated non-Gaussian states using the -invariant squeezing approach, which allows us to account for all possible quadratures. We then show that the presence of such nonclassicality in non-Gaussian resource states is not necessary for successful quantum teleportation, a finding which is at variance with an earlier proposition in this direction. This result is important since it demonstrates how nonclassicality other than quadrature squeezing present in the resource can be utilized for quantum teleportation.},

The classical intractability of the sampling task makes validating these experiments a challenging and essential undertaking. In this paper, we propose binned-detector probability distributions as a suitable quantity to statistically validate GBS experiments employing photon-number-resolving detectors. We develop the theoretical framework to compute such distributions by leveraging their connection with their respective characteristic function. The latter may be efficiently and analytically computed for squeezed input states as well as for relevant classical hypothesis like squashed states. Our theoretical framework encompasses other validation methods based on marginal distributions and correlation functions. Additionally, it can analytically accommodate various sources of noise, such as losses and partial distinguishability, a feature that has received limited attention within the GBS framework so far. We also derive how binned-detector probability distributions behave when Haar averaged over all possible interferometric networks, extending known results for Fock boson sampling.},

This paper analyzes existing entanglement distribution protocols in the context of distributed quantum circuit execution, focusing on the on-demand distribution of entanglement (on-demand protocols) and the continuous distribution of entanglement (CD protocols). We define the min-depth qubit mapping and scheduling problem within the CD protocols, and we propose a systematic solution that encompasses protocol analysis, circuit partitioning and mapping, and remote operation scheduling. Furthermore, we introduce a connectivity-first swapping (CFS) scheme that outperforms the single random swap (SRS) scheme in the execution of distributed quantum circuits in most cases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms, achieving significant reductions in circuit execution times of 52.4%, 49.9%, and 53.1% in clusters with average bandwidths of 1, 3, and 5, respectively. The CFS protocol further enhances performance, reducing execution time by 24.5%, 19.7%, and 17.8% compared to the SRS protocol. Our method also reduces entanglement costs, decreasing consumption by an average of 20.3% compared to the baseline method at an average bandwidth of 3, while the CFS protocol further reduces costs by 11.5% compared to the SRS protocol.},

It effectively captures the nonequilibrium entanglement dynamics, as well as the transition in steady states from the critical phase with subextensive growth law to the area-law phase. By performing finite-size scaling analysis, we identify the critical measurement strength and demonstrate that the fluctuation can serve as a reliable indicator of the MIET. The results are consistent with previous entanglement entropy studies and reveal that the MIET belongs to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class. Even when there are long-range hoppings or disorders, the fluctuation still acts as a reliable probe for the MIET. This approach offers a practical alternative to directly measuring entanglement entropy in monitored free-fermion chains, particularly for larger systems.},

  abstract     = {The quantum Monte Carlo technique known as the stochastic series expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the transverse-field Ising model.},

A recently proposed sampling-based solver for QA significantly reduces the required number of qubits, being capable of large COPs. In relation to this, a trainable sampling-based COP solver has been proposed that optimizes its internal parameters from a dataset by using a deep-learning technique called deep unfolding. Although learning the internal parameters accelerates the convergence speed, the sampler in the trainable solver is restricted to using a classical sampler owing to the training cost. In this study, to utilize QA in the trainable solver, we propose classical-quantum transfer learning, in which parameters are trained classically, and the learned parameters are used in the solver with QA. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the trainable quantum COP solver using classical-quantum transfer learning improves convergence speed and execution time compared with the original solver.},

We present an optimized nonreciprocal quantum battery architecture incorporating a quantum mediator between the battery and the charger to catalyze energy transfer. This mediator-enabled design significantly improves upon conventional direct-coupling configurations. Through comparative analysis of two distinct driving protocols (classical coherent driving versus quadratic temporal pulse excitation), we establish fundamental performance criteria for mediator-enhanced nonreciprocal quantum battery. Our results indicate that this proposed model expresses superior advantages over the previous conventional battery models without adding a mediator between the battery and the charger. Furthermore, we observe that under the classical driving, the decay rates of the charger and the battery could influence the relationship between the battery performance and the spectral width of the shared reservoir. Specifically, when the decay rates are weak, the battery performance and the spectral width of the shared reservoir would show a negative correlation. However, as the decay rates increase, this relationship would shift to a positive correlation. In contrast, under quadratic temporal pulse, the spectral width and the battery performance could represent a consistent positive correlation regardless of the decay rates of the charger and the battery.},

We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of stochastic local operations and classiccal communication (SLOCC)-stable subsets that cover the separable set.

However, stabilizer states formed solely by Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated with the tableau algorithm according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem, although they can host large entanglement entropy. In this work, we introduce the concept of nonstabilizerness entanglement entropy which is basically the minimum residual entanglement entropy for a quantum state by excluding the contribution from Clifford circuits. It can serve as a new practical measure of difficulty in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems, which takes both entanglement and nonstabilizerness into consideration. We discuss why it is a better criterion than previously proposed metrics such as stabilizer Rényi entropy when measuring the difficulty in the classical simulation with tensor network states related method. We also show numerical results of nonstabilizerness entanglement entropy with concrete quantum many-body models.

  abstract     = {In the search for quantum advantage in real-world problems, one promising avenue is to use a quantum algorithm to improve on the solution found using an efficient classical algorithm. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is particularly well adapted for such a “warm start” approach and can be combined with the powerful classical Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithms based on semidefinite programing. Nonetheless, the best way to leverage the power of the QAOA remains an open question. Here we propose a general model that describes a class of QAOA variants and use it to explore routes to quantum advantages in a canonical optimization problem, MaxCut. For these algorithms we derive analytic expectation values of the cost Hamiltonian for the MaxCut problem in the level-1 case. Using these analytic results we obtain reliable averages over many instances for fairly large numbers of qubits. We find that the warm start adaptive-bias QAOA (WS-ab-QAOA) initialized by the GW algorithm outperforms previously proposed warm start variants on problems with 40 to 180 qubits. To assess whether a quantum advantage exists with this algorithm, we did numerical simulations with up to 1000 qubits to see whether the level-1 WS-ab-QAOA can improve the GW solution for three-regular graphs. In fact the improvement in the 1000-qubit case even in level 1 can only be matched by the GW algorithm after about random projections performed after the semidefinite program stage. Thus this work gives numerical evidence that the final stage of optimization after an efficient classical algorithm has produced an approximate solution may be a place where quantum advantages can be realized.},

  abstract     = {The generation and manipulation of multipartite entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering in macroscopic systems not only play a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics, but are also at the core of current developments of various nascent quantum technologies. Here we report a theoretical method using squeezing-phase-controlled quantum noise flows to selectively generate and manipulate quantum entanglement and asymmetric EPR steering in a nonlinear whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optomechanical resonator. We show that by pumping the nonlinear medium with two-photon optical fields and broadband squeezed lights, a pair of counterpropagating squeezed optical modes could be introduced to the WGM resonator, each coupled with an independent squeezed vacuum reservoir. This configuration could enable squeezing-phase-controlled light-reservoir interaction for each squeezed optical mode, providing a flexible tool for tailoring asymmetric optical noise flows in the counterpropagating modes. Based on this unique feature, it is found that with the injection of asymmetric noise flows, the generation of various types of bipartite and tripartite entanglement become phase-dependent, and thus they can be produced in an asymmetric way. More excitingly, it is also found that by further properly adjusting the squeezing parameters, the overall asymmetry of EPR steering can also be stepwise driven from a no-way regime, to a one-way regime, to a two-way regime. These findings, holding promise for preparing rich types of entangled quantum resources with asymmetric features, may have potential applications in the area of secure quantum information processing such as quantum secure direct communication and one-way quantum computing.},

  abstract     = {The inherent limitations of physical processes prevent the copying of arbitrary quantum states. Furthermore, even if we only aim to clone two distinct quantum states, it remains impossible unless they are mutually orthogonal. To overcome this limitation, we propose a virtual-cloning protocol that bypasses the restrictions imposed by the quantum no-cloning theorem. Specifically, we begin by outlining the general framework for virtual cloning and deriving a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of a virtual operation capable of simultaneously cloning a set of states. Subsequently, through an analysis of the simulation cost of the virtual-cloning process, we demonstrate that the problem of identifying an optimal virtual-cloning protocol can be cast as a semidefinite programming problem. Finally, we establish a connection between virtual cloning and state discrimination, from which universal bounds on the optimal cloning cost are derived.},

  abstract     = {The fermionic partial transpose introduced by Shapourian et al . [ Phys. Rev. B 95 , 165101 (2017) ] has received widespread attention. A fundamental application of the partial transpose lies in the construction of entanglement witnesses. However, it is a notable characteristic that the fermionic partial transpose does not preserve Hermiticity. Instead, the fermionic partial transpose of a fermionic state yields a pseudo-Hermitian operator with respect to the local parity operators. This suggests that the suitable version of entanglement witness criterion for fermions is pseudo-Hermitian. Inspired by this, we systematically investigate whether the pseudo-Hermitian operators with respect to the local parity operators can serve as valid entanglement witnesses for fermions. These contents encompass completeness, comparison, intersection, and optimal conditions. Our answer is positive. We have provided some reasons why such pseudo-Hermitian operators are more suitable as entanglement witnesses than the Hermitian ones. As a byproduct, we observe that pseudo-Hermitian witnesses can reveal more information about entanglement contained in fermionic states.},

Here we address the problem of how the imperfections in unitaries and noise present in the input states affect the entanglement-generating power of a given quantum gate—we refer to it as imperfect (noisy) entangling power. We observe that, when the parameters of a given unitary are chosen randomly from a Gaussian distribution centered around the desired mean, the quenched average entangling power—averaged across multiple random samplings—exhibits intriguing behavior like it may increase or show nonmonotonic behavior with the increase of disorder strength for certain classes of diagonal unitary operators. For arbitrary unitary operators, the quenched average power tends to stabilize, showing almost constant behavior with variation in the parameters instead of oscillating. Our observations also reveal that, in the presence of a local noise model, the input states that maximize the entangling power of a given unitary operator differ considerably from the noiseless scenario. Additionally, we report that the rankings among unitary operators according to their entangling power in the noiseless case change depending on the noise model and noise strength.},

  abstract     = {Embezzlement of entanglement is the counterintuitive process in which entanglement is extracted from a resource system using local unitary operations, with almost no detectable change in the resource's state. It was recently argued that any state of a relativistic quantum field theory can serve as a resource for perfect embezzlement. We study the circuit complexity of embezzlement using sequences of states that enable arbitrary precision for the process, commonly called universal embezzling families. In addition, we argue that this approach provides a well-defined model for the complexity of embezzlement from quantum field theories. Under fairly general assumptions, we establish a generic lower bound on the complexity, which increases with the precision of the process or the amount of embezzled entanglement, and diverges as either becomes infinite. As an example, we consider a one-dimensional critical system as the resource and derive an exponentially growing lower bound on the complexity. Consequently, the findings imply that circuit complexity acts as a physical obstruction to perfect embezzlement. Supplementary to the main results, we derive lower bounds for common models of circuit complexity for state preparation based on the difference between the Schatten norms of the initial and final states.},

  abstract     = {Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum networks, and quantum sensors. Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map QPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample complexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT relies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the optimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key factor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a generalized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary operators with generalized measurements [positive operator-valued measures (POVMs)]. This approach, termed shadow process tomography with POVMs (POVM-SPT), uses convex optimization to identify the optimal POVM for minimizing the shadow norm, thereby further reducing sample complexity. We demonstrate the identification of the optimal POVM through numerical simulations and provide the corresponding optimization algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that POVM-SPT achieves a substantial reduction in the shadow norm compared to conventional SPT, with an approximate sevenfold improvement for single-qubit input states and a remarkable -fold enhancement for 64-qubit input states. These results reveal that POVM-SPT offers significant advantages in simplifying SPT tasks, particularly for large-scale quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Many quantum communication protocols rely on the distribution of entanglement between the different participating parties. One example is quantum key distribution (QKD), an application that has matured to commercial use in recent years. However, difficulties remain, especially with noise resilience and channel capacity in long-distance communication. One way to overcome these problems is to use high-dimensional entanglement, which has been shown to be more robust to noise and enables higher secret-key rates. It is therefore important to have access to certifiable high-dimensional entanglement sources to confidently implement these advanced QKD protocols. Here we develop a method for certifying high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop systems. In these systems, entanglement creation and detection can utilize the same physical components, and the number of time bins, and thus the entanglement dimension, can be adapted without making physical changes to the setup. Our certification method builds on previous proposals for the certification of angular-momentum entanglement in photon pairs. In particular, measurements in only two experimentally accessible bases are sufficient to obtain a lower bound on the entanglement dimension for both two- and multiphoton quantum states. Numerical simulations show that the method is robust against typical experimental noise effects and works well even with limited measurement statistics, thus establishing time-bin encoded photons as a promising platform for high-dimensional quantum-communication protocols.},

  abstract     = {Quantum machine learning (QML), as an extension of classical machine learning that harnesses quantum mechanics, facilitates efficient learning from data encoded in quantum states. Training a quantum neural network (QNN) typically demands a substantial labeled training set for supervised learning. Human annotators, often experts, provide labels for samples through additional experiments, adding to the training cost. To mitigate this expense, there is a quest for methods that maintain model performance over fully labeled data sets while requiring fewer labeled samples in practice, thereby extending few-shot learning to the quantum realm. Quantum active learning (QAL) estimates the uncertainty of quantum data to select the most informative samples from a pool for labeling. Consequently, a QML model is supposed to accumulate maximal knowledge as the training set comprises labeled samples selected via sampling strategies. Notably, the QML models trained within the QAL framework are not restricted to specific types, allowing performance enhancement from the model architecture's perspective towards few-shot learning. Recognizing symmetry as a fundamental concept in physics ubiquitous across various domains, we leverage the symmetry inherent in quantum states induced by the embedding of classical data for model design. We employ an equivariant QNN capable of generalizing from fewer data with geometric priors. We benchmark the performance of QAL on two classification problems, observing both positive and negative results. QAL effectively trains the model, achieving performance comparable to that on fully labeled data sets by labeling less than 7% of the samples in the pool with unbiased sampling behavior. Furthermore, we elucidate the negative result of QAL being overtaken by random sampling baseline through miscellaneous numerical experiments. Our work lays the groundwork for real-world applications of QML by addressing realistic experimental costs.},

  abstract     = {As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, reducing errors remains a crucial frontier for developing near-term devices. Errors in the quantum gates and quantum state readout result in noisy circuits, which would prevent the acquisition of the exact expectation values of the observables. Although ultimate robustness to errors is known to be achievable by quantum error correction-based fault-tolerant quantum computing, its successful implementation demands large-scale quantum processors with low average error rates that are not yet widely available. In contrast, quantum error mitigation offers more immediate and practical techniques, which do not require extensive resources and can be readily applied to existing quantum devices to improve the accuracy of the expectation values. Here, we report the implementation of a zero-noise extrapolation-based error mitigation technique on a silicon spin qubit platform. This technique has recently been successfully demonstrated for other platforms such as superconducting qubits, trapped-ion qubits, and photonic processors. We first explore three methods for amplifying noise on a silicon spin qubit: global folding, local folding, and pulse stretching, using a standard randomized benchmarking protocol. We then apply global folding-based zero-noise extrapolation to the state tomography and achieve a state fidelity of 99.96% (98.52%), compared to the unmitigated fidelity of 75.82% (82.16%) for different preparation states. These results show that the zero-noise extrapolation technique is a versatile approach that is generally adaptable to quantum computing platforms with different noise characteristics through appropriate noise amplification methods.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM), an error suppression strategy without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise, which only occurs when the separation between the system and environment is sufficiently large. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian noise mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the incoherent coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions (BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environment aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.},

To this end, we use both the standard quantum annealing and reverse annealing protocols in both our simulations and on the D-Wave quantum annealer.

In particular, we identify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce inseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state. Thus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition robust, and we refer to this phenomenon as “unconditional inseparability of superposition” in multipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of unconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for bipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a pure biseparable state. However, the present analysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz., there exists at least one pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its superposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an entangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if at least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a suitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and the product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of multipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite ones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be useful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local unambiguous state discrimination problem.},

Moreover, we propose a feasible protocol for measuring Holevo information of operators on digital quantum simulators based on random states. For the mixed-field Ising model, our numerical simulations show that the integrable system can be told apart from the chaotic system by measuring the spatial-temporal patterns of Holevo information. Furthermore, we find that error mitigation is required to restore the time-oscillation behavior of Holevo information for the integrable system, a crucial feature distinct from the chaotic one.

We exploit fully decoupled belief propagation combined with ordered statistics decoding (FDBP-OSD) and Tesseract decoder (TD) to explore the error-correcting performance of the codes. Our simulation results show that the quantum cyclic codes have code-capacity thresholds for all three types of pure Pauli noise. Under depolarizing noise, we observe code-capacity threshold obtained by FDBP-OSD, while the results obtained by TD indicates that the optimal code-capacity threshold may be approximately . In the finite-bias regime, when the noise is biased towards Pauli errors with noise bias ratios , the results obtained by FDBP-OSD and TD both indicate the quantum cyclic codes have around code-capacity threshold. When and 100, TD indicates that the corresponding code-capacity thresholds may be around and , respectively.

We further extend this protocol to demonstrate the creation of GKP cluster states by avoiding the requirement of ancillary optical quadrature-squeezed light. Utilizing postselected entanglement swapping operations for GKP qubits, we demonstrate the utility of our protocol for high-rate entanglement generation between quantum memories.

Several methods to detect and characterize DPTs have been suggested in the literature, the most famous of which, the Liouvillian gap, can be derived from a spectral analysis of the Liouvillian superoperator that governs the complex interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics. Here we consider the output current, defined as the average total quantum jumps per unit time between the open quantum system and the environment. We propose that output current fluctuations and in particular their dynamical correlations, their power spectrum, and their characteristic timescale can provide valuable information about DPTs, confirming a dramatic change of behavior at the critical point. We validate our proposal using the dissipative model and the nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr model, showing good agreement with previous estimates of the location of the critical point. Compared to previous approaches, our proposal could already be experimentally tested in optical systems, providing a practical method to detect criticality in quantum open systems.},

All these probabilities (classical and quantum) are determined by knowing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix. For our networks the complete eigenvalue spectrum is determined iteratively, a process that facilitates the analysis of very large networks. The classical return probability can be separated into two distinct components which depend on the underlying topologies: the dual Sierpinski gasket and the dendrimer. The quantum walks show strong localization effects, which are more accentuated when the starting node is peripheral. The quantum long-time average probability is determined analytically, depending solely on the generation numbers of our fractal and dendrimer.

In particular, a tensor network Ansatz known as the locally purified density operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in nonphysical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified Ansatz .},

In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally, which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to antiphase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Effective unidirectional interactions lead to synchronization blockades between the undriven oscillator and the external drive as well as between both oscillators.

Among the quantum features that can be exploited in quantum metrology, those related to non-Hermitian systems have received much attention in recent times. Here, we consider a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system, the quantum Swanson oscillator, as a probe system in order to investigate how the non-Hermitian contribution affects the frequency and temperature estimation. We use the quantum Fisher information to compute the main results. Furthermore, to perform a fair comparison, we define a gain function which is the ratio between the quantum Fisher information with the non-Hermitian contribution and the quantum Fisher information when this term becomes Hermitian. In addition, the quantum Fisher information is discussed in terms of the energetic cost to include the non-Hermitian contribution. Dissipative effects are also considered by interacting different probe systems with a Markovian thermal reservoir. Given that we obtain the Hermitian counterpart of the Hamiltonian by applying the Dyson map, we also study the estimation of the parameters characterizing this mapping.

For the two-input n -layer ( n ≥ 2 ) scenario, the number of sequential observers in existing schemes is constrained by the layer n and the number of sequential sides. Here we achieve unbounded sharing of network nonlocality for arbitrary n by introducing sharpness parameters into Bell state measurements and allowing sequential observers to perform measurements with different sharpness parameters. An unbounded number of independent observers on each of the m ( m = 1 , ⋯ , 2 n − 2 ) sequential sides can simultaneously share non- ( 2 n − 2 ) -locality by violating the two-input ( 2 n − 2 ) -local inequality with all other nonsequential observers. Furthermore, we extend the two-input scenario to a generalized d -input ( d ≥ 2 ) case, investigating how the input number d affects network nonlocality sharing. A general model for sequential measurement scenarios in d -input two-forked n -layer tree-shaped networks is established. Using the simplest case ( n = 3 ) as an example, we investigate non-six-locality sharing based on the d -input six-local inequality and establish the relationship between the number of sequential observers, the number of sequential sides, and the input d . Based on the results, we conjecture that the two-input configuration is optimal for nonlocality sharing in two-forked tree-shaped networks.},

We describe the dynamics of the clock as a “biased random walk.” The bias level is directly related to the negativity of the steady-state response function. Using experimentally relevant examples of quantum spin chains, we suggest that crossing a phase transition point is crucial for the clock's operation. The coupling takes place through a global observable and, in this case, the battery lifespan is found to be extensive in its size.},

Here we describe switching induced by quantum fluctuations and illustrate that an instanton approach within Keldysh field theory can provide a deep insight into such phenomena. We provide a practical recipe to compute the switching rates semi-analytically, which agrees remarkably well with exact solutions across a wide domain of drive amplitudes spanning many orders of magnitude. Being set up in the framework of Keldysh coherent states path integrals, our approach opens the possibility of studying quantum activation in many-body systems where other approaches are inapplicable.},

Despite this asymmetry, the game is deterministically winnable using the GHZ correlation that yields perfect success in the original GHZ pseudotelepathy game. The introduced randomization, however, reveals a higher operational advantage in a class of multipartite communication complexity tasks, where inputs are distributed among distant parties and a designated function must be computed by one of them. Classical strategies require two bits of communication to the computing node from each of the other parties, while preshared GHZ states enable the same task with only one bit per party. This separation demonstrates a superior utility of GHZ correlations in multipartite protocols and showcases an enhanced operational power of genuine entanglement in multipartite quantum communication complexity tasks.},

These collapses occur randomly in space, bridging the gap between quantum and classical behavior. A central feature of these models is their dependence on mass density, which directly influences how and when collapse events occur. In this work, we explore a generalized framework in which the collapse dynamics depend on arbitrary functions of the mass density, extending previous models. We analyze the theoretical consistency of these generalizations, investigate their predictions, and compare them with experimental data. Our findings show that only a limited range of mass-dependence functions are viable, with significant implications for the future development and empirical testability of collapse-based models. Importantly, they also indicate that a well-justified model denoted here as PSL shows much more resilience to experimental falsification than standard collapse models.},

While spectral assumptions analogous to those used in the regular HEOM are imposed to compute dynamical output bath observables, they are not required to model input states or output observables at a fixed time, in this case leading to time-dependent contributions to the equations. In the Markovian limit, we use this formalism to derive an input-output Lindblad equation which can be used to extend the applicability of the regular version. For a given desired input state and output observable, the range of the indexes extending the regular HEOM is, by construction, bounded. Overall, the aim of this formalism is to take advantage of the efficiency and generality of the HEOM framework to model non-Gaussian input states and the dynamics of environmental observables in bosonic, non-Markovian open quantum systems.},

Here, we study how the coupling of a quantum system to a non-Markovian environment, i.e., an environment with a frequency-dependent spectral density inducing memory effects, can be used to generate and reshape phase transitions and squeezing in matter phases. Focusing on a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we demonstrate that non-Markovian dissipation can be leveraged to engineer tricriticality via the fusion of second-order and first-order critical points. We identify phases that arise from different ways of breaking the single weak symmetry of our model, which led us to examine an alternative concept of directional spontaneous symmetry breaking (DSSB) as a general framework to understand this phenomenon. We show that signatures of DSSB can be seen in the emergence of spin squeezing along different directions, and that the latter is controllable via non-Markovian effects, opening up possibilities for applications in quantum metrology. Finally, we propose an experimental implementation of our non-Markovian model in cavity QED. Our work features non-Markovianity as a resource for controlling phase transitions in general systems, and highlights shortcomings of the Markovian limit in this context.},

We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure.

  abstract     = {Quantum batteries represent one of the most promising applications of quantum thermodynamics, whose goal is not only to store energy inside small quantum systems but also to potentially leverage genuine quantum effects to outperform classical counterparts. In this context, however, energy fluctuations become extremely relevant and have a significant impact on the charging efficiency. In our work, we consider a simple yet paradigmatic model in which a flying qubit (the battery) coherently interacts with a single-mode optical cavity (the charger) through a number conserving Jaynes-Cummings interaction. By making use of full-counting statistics techniques, we fully characterize the average charging power, its fluctuations, and the associated charging efficiency for several different choices of initial states of the optical cavity, demonstrating that preparing the latter in a genuinely quantum non-Gaussian Fock state (rather than a classical or even nonclassical Gaussian state) leads to a definite and in principle measurable advantage in all these figures of merit.},

  abstract     = {Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate the dynamics of the trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by the trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.},

  abstract     = {We present a class of generalized entropic quantum speed limits based on -Rényi relative entropy, a real-valued, contractive, two-parameter family of distinguishability measures. The quantum speed limit (QSL) falls into the class of Mandelstam-Tamm bounds, and it applies to finite-dimensional quantum systems that undergo a general physical process, i.e., their effective dynamics can be modeled by unitary or nonunitary evolutions. The results cover pure or mixed, separable, and entangled probe quantum states. The QSL time depends on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the probe and instantaneous states of the system, and its evaluation requires low computational cost. In addition, it is inversely proportional to the time-average of the Schatten speed of the instantaneous state, which in turn is fully characterized by the considered dynamics. We specialize our results to the case of unitary and nonunitary evolutions. In the former case, the QSL scales with the inverse of the energy fluctuations, while the latter depends on the Schatten 1-norm of the rate of change of the quantum channel Kraus operators. We illustrate our findings for single-qubit and two-qubit states, and unitary and nonunitary evolutions. Our results may find applications in the study of entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, and also entanglement entropies signaled by generalized entropies.},

During that time, several quantum approaches to this multifaceted classical problem have been introduced. In the present work, we unify, extend, and interpret several such approaches through a classical large-deviations perspective. To this end, we consider time-symmetric ensembles that are pre- and postselected before and after a Markovian experiment is performed. Then, the Schrödinger bridge problem is that of finding the most likely joint distribution of initial and final outcomes that is consistent with obtained endpoint results. The derived distribution provides quantum Markovian dynamics that bridge the observed endpoint states in the form of density matrices. The solution retains its classical structure in that density matrices can be expressed as the product of forward-evolving and backward-evolving matrices. In addition, the quantum Schrödinger bridge allows inference of the most likely distribution of outcomes of an intervening measurement with unknown results. This distribution may be written as a product of forward- and backward-evolving expressions, in close analogy to the classical setting, and in a time-symmetric way. The derived results are illustrated through a two-level amplitude-damping example.},

  abstract     = {Classical chaos is usually characterized by the sensitive dependence of trajectories on initial conditions. However, in quantum mechanics, the unitarity of time evolution ensures that the distances between quantum states are preserved in time. It has, therefore, been a challenge in quantum chaos to reconcile the lack of sensitive dependence on initial conditions with classical chaos. Ballentine [Fundamental Problems in Quantum Physics, edited by M. Ferrero and A. van der Merwe (Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht, 1995), pp. 15–28] has suggested a way out by constructing a parallel argument in classical mechanics based on the preservation of the inner product of phase-space densities. He has argued that the exponential separation of nearby states is a good identifier of chaos only at the level of individual trajectories. For statistical states such as quantum states and classical phase-space densities, chaos must instead be identified by some fundamentally statistical signatures. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum chaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search for classical analogs of these signatures to reveal the inner machinery of chaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum systems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical system is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the corresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is the kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analog of bipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase-space distributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos as those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.},

Here we predict unconventional quantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian topological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain subjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral bound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states inside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended photon-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of topological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in combination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Strikingly, dissipation can shape the wave-function profile of the dressed state. Furthermore, when two emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can mediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the interaction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath. Our work opens the door to further study rich quantum optical phenomena and exotic many-body physics utilizing quantum emitters coupled to non-Hermitian baths.},

Various methods for direct producing twisted photons have been explored, leveraging the rotational (spiral) motion of relativistic electrons in phenomena such as undulator radiation. In the present study, transition radiation carrying orbital angular momentum is observed. This radiation was generated by 220 MeV electrons incident on an Au-coated Si wafer. The orbital angular momentum was measured by analyzing the diffraction patterns produced as the radiation passed through a triangular aperture and a double slit. These results demonstrate that twisted photons can also be generated through the interaction of rectilinearly moving electrons with a solid target.},

The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are modeled as pointlike objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.},

Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) and quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map the bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the consequences of nuclear motion for the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation.

In this work, we report an experimental implementation of a quantum circuit based on the linear combination of unitaries, integrated with a postprocessing protocol, to realize VQB in a nuclear magnetic resonance system. VQB can be expressed as a linear combination of two channels: the universal cloner, which broadcasts the target quantum state, and the universal antisymmetrizer, which reduces broadcasting error. We implement both channels within the same circuit and demonstrate that the universal cloner is the closest physical map to VQB. In addition, we show how the universal antisymmetrizer can be utilized to mitigate imperfections in the cloner, enabling near-ideal fidelity.

Under circuit level noise, we find substantially better encoding rates than comparable surface codes while offering similar error suppression capabilities. For example, we can encode four logical qubits with distance 5 into 60 physical qubits using weight-5 check measurements of circuit depth 7, while a surface code with these parameters requires 200 physical qubits.

Although both wave functions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation), they lead to different dynamics and properties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this work we investigate wave-packet dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which displays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a setting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential barriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain solutions to the wave-packet dynamics indicating that the density based on a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wave function can be locally amplified outside the light cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge due to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification over macroscopic distances. These results question the interpretation of the Foldy-Wouthuysen density as a fundamentally correct probability or charge density.},

We introduce the QRF as a covariant phase space observable, show that when described relative to it, position and momentum appear compatible, and derive novel, frame-relative uncertainty relations. This is achieved by constructing a joint observable for position and momentum, and calculating the variances of its margins. We then verify that in the classical limit of the QRF, the standard uncertainty relations are recovered, fortifying claims that standard quantum theory must be understood relative to an external, classical frame. These results may open up new research directions at the interface between QRFs and incompatibility.},

We explain why the gauging procedure used in the Comment leads to inconsistencies and show that, when applied similarly to the well-established magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect, it would yield demonstrably incorrect conclusions. Moreover, we highlight the consistency of our results with canonical treatments of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, and we reaffirm the physicality of energy shifts in field-free regions, an effect observed in the magnetic and predicted in the electric Aharonov-Bohm contexts.

Nonlinear SU(1,1) interferometers prepare entangled states that have been shown to enable Heisenberg-limit precision. In previous work, we developed the optimal measurement scheme, which saturates the ultimate limit in ab initio phase estimation, avoiding the issue of ambiguity. However, realizing this scheme is highly nontrivial and involves measurements beyond the photon-number operator. In this study, we propose a probabilistic measurement scheme capable of realizing the optimal measurement scheme with a success rate of 50% through postselection. This method allows us to achieve Heisenberg-scaling precision but it is suboptimal with respect to saturation of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. It utilizes projection synthesis by introducing an ancillary optical mode prepared in a superposition state, combined with standard photon-number-resolving detection. This approach provides insights into the physical realization of optimal measurement strategies in nonlinear interferometers, with implications for quantum precision measurement in general.},

However, in studying the underlying mechanism for this loss- and dephasing-insensitive biphoton coherence time, the previous article did not take quantum noise into account.

Outside these areas, the system does not retain the memory of the initial state of the atom, and the sensitivity scales linearly with the observation time.

We also noticed that in the weak coupling regime it is possible to get perfect quadrature squeezing of our output state with anomalous WVs.

Traditional schemes struggle to reduce magnonic probe noise but lack directional sensing capabilities. We exploit an innovative and intrinsic squeezing mechanism by leveraging the geometric configuration of an anisotropic ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and its interaction with internal demagnetization fields. This mechanism can enhance magnetic field signals and suppress noise in the target direction while suppressing sensitivity in nontarget directions to avoid disturbing the target direction, thus generating a directionally selective sensing scheme realizing high-precision detection in complex environments. In particular, the target-direction sensor performance can be optimized by adjusting the YIG sphere's geometry (e.g., aspect ratio) without complex setups, ensuring high feasibility and scalability. Our approach offers greater flexibility and directionality by tuning the YIG sphere's geometry than existing methods. This innovation provides an alternative approach for weak magnetic field detection in cavity magnonics systems, with potential applications in biomedical imaging, quantum sensing, precision measurement, and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Magnonic frequency combs play a significant role in magnonic dynamics and spectroscopy analysis. Here we investigate the generation of magnonic frequency combs in a magnomechanical system in which the magnon mode is driven by a microwave field and the phonon mode is driven by a mechanical field. Using experimentally achievable parameters, we demonstrate that the magnonic frequency combs can be generated even if the amplitude of the microwave driving field is comparatively low, and the bandwidth and sideband plateau of magnonic frequency combs can be extended remarkably with the amplitude of the mechanical driving field increasing. The results show that magnonic frequency combs can be enhanced by the time-varying driving force via the magnetostrictive effect. The proposed method provides a promising route for the generation of low-power and wide-bandwidth magnonic frequency combs. Potential applications range from realizing high-precision microwave frequency metrology to designing new magnonic information processing devices.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, extensive research has been dedicated to the study of parity-time ( ) symmetry, which involves the engineered balance of gain and loss in non-Hermitian optics. Complementary to symmetry, the concept of anti- symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this work, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we show that by precisely controlling the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues (or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti- symmetry can transit to that of a quasiclosed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasiclosed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasiclosed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our findings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices under realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external perturbations.},

However, optical losses are ubiquitous, which hampers the enhancement of photonic spin Hall shift (PSHS). In this work, we consider an atomic medium that exhibits both absorption and transparency to investigate and mitigate the effects of loss on PSHS. We demonstrate that laser-induced coherence in an atomic medium, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) at resonance, counteracts the detrimental effects of losses on the PSHS. Upon EIT at resonance in a coherent medium enclosed within dielectric slabs, zero reflectivity of the incident polarized state is restored at an incident angle defined by the conventional Brewster's angle to enhance PSHS. Moreover, the tunable refractive index of the atomic medium enables manipulation of PSHS without structural modifications with a tiny loss. Our proposed loss-free approach to PSHS may enable advanced optical sensing and other spin-based applications.},

Despite its low index of refraction at visible wavelengths, water exhibits an index approaching 9 at 2.5 GHz, making it a promising model material for studying morphology-dependent resonances in centimeter-scale objects. Such Mie scattering resonances are well characterized in spheres but are much less understood in spheroids because of the mathematical complexity of multipolar expansions in spheroidal geometries. In this work we combine analytical, numerical, and finite-element methods to study microwave resonances in aqueous spheroids. We obtain three-dimensional standing-wave solutions in aqueous spheroids and show that this conceptually simple description of electromagnetic resonances maps surprisingly well onto the complex resonant landscape of certain spheroidal modes, as elucidated by finite-element simulations. In the process, we identify some size and shape regimes that yield uniquely intense spheroidal resonances.},

The number of generated extreme pulses shows a trend of increase at first and then decrease with the increase of ac amplitude. When the ac amplitude is sufficiently large, the laser is fully modulated and exhibits periodic oscillations. Elevated temperature also alters the locking region, leading to the vanishing of the forbidden band in the extreme pulse distribution.

  abstract     = {Quantum batteries (QBs) exhibit remarkable charging power and energy potential, suggesting quantum benefits in thermodynamics. However, they face challenges like decoherence, low efficiency, and limited saturation. In this study, we explore the nonreciprocal open quantum batteries network (NOQBN), integrated with photonic waveguide arrays. By leveraging unidirectional waveguide nonreciprocities and reservoir engineering, we achieve targeted energy transfer, where QBs' higher dissipation rates compared to optical charger modes enhance charging energy, but reduce the ergotropy of the NOQBN. Results reveal that collective charging boosts QBs' ergotropy and power output, outperforming isolated QB systems. Moreover, by challenging traditional reciprocal charger-battery paradigms, we successfully adjust environmental dissipation to enhance nonreciprocity, thereby improving energy storage efficiency. Crucially, optimizing the correlation length between QBs within the network further enhances their storage capacity. The NOQBN's nonreciprocal dynamics pioneers a new approach to quantum energy storage, paving the way for applications in driven-dissipative photonic networks and inspiring the development of advanced, integrated nonreciprocal quantum energy devices. This work advances our theoretical understanding of QB networks and provides practical design principles for highly efficient quantum energy devices.},

Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures with subwavelength thickness, have recently shown extraordinary capability in manipulating classical and quantum states of light and realizing miniaturized SPDC sources. Whereas previous studies have primarily focused on periodic metasurfaces, we uncover the potential of spatially modulated nanopatterns for further SPDC enhancement and state engineering. Specifically, we propose a nonlinear metasurface featuring a lateral guided-mode cavity formed by two distributed Bragg reflectors. With the quasinormal mode theory, we predict an SPDC rate up to 157 Hz/mW, which represents about 30 times rate enhancement when compared to the metasurface without a cavity. Furthermore, the cavity supports a continuous set of high- resonances across a broad bandwidth, allowing the all-optical tuning of the photon-pair emission directions transverse to the cavity by controlling the pump wavelength, which can find applications in quantum imaging.},

The behavior of STWPs in free space is now well established, and recently their propagation invariance was confirmed in both the normal and anomalous group-velocity dispersion (GVD) regimes. However, rich yet-to-be-observed spectral dynamics have been predicted to occur in the presence of normal GVD, which manifests itself in the reorganization of the spatiotemporal spectrum into distinct structures upon tuning the appropriate optical parameters of the STWP. Indeed, broad varieties of distinct field structures are compatible with propagation invariance in normal GVD, which can be classified in a two-dimensional space parametrized by the group velocity of the STWP and its central axial wave number. Tuning these two parameters gives rise to spatiotemporal spectral reorganization into X-shaped, hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptical, or even spatiotemporally separable spectra. Here, we observe the entire span of spectral reorganization for paraxial STWPs in normally dispersive ZnSe at a wavelength with on-axis pulse widths fs. By tuning the STWP group velocity and central axial wave number while maintaining propagation invariance, we observe transitions in the spatiotemporal spectrum and verify the associated structural changes in the spatiotemporal intensity profile. These results lay the foundations for understanding the potential uses of STWPs in phase-matched nonlinear processes in dispersive media.},

Dynamically encircling exceptional points (EPs) of self-intersecting Riemann sheets gives rise to chiral mode transfer, and recently chiral mode converters capable of directionally switching topological photonic states have been constructed in optical waveguide arrays. However, the transmission efficiencies realized in previous studies are inherently low due to path-dependent losses, which hinders their practical application. Here, we proposed to realize efficient chiral topological mode conversion by dynamically encircling the moving EP of the two topological edge modes in lossy waveguide arrays mimicking the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice via modulation of loss along the propagation direction, which enables reduced average loss in a whole cycle while maintaining the employment of topological properties around an EP. The resultant chiral topological mode converter is highly efficient due to reduced average loss during the passage of EP encirclement, with transfer efficiency as high as in theory with near unity mode purity and considerable transmission in simulation with over of the total output energy taken over by the transferred mode. It is also proven to be robust against mild perturbations of coupling strengths and mode mismatch. The efficient and robust chiral topological mode converter will promote the practical applications of topological photonic states, such as broadband optical switches and optical isolators.},

  abstract     = {Optical force can enable precise manipulations of small particles for various applications. It is well known that an isotropic lossless dielectric sphere is only subject to forward optical force under the illumination of an electromagnetic plane wave. By using rigorous full-wave simulations, we show that such a sphere can experience a lateral optical force and an optical torque besides the conventional longitudinal force, if it spins with a constant angular velocity. The emergence of the unusual optical force and torque is attributed to the breaking of mirror and cylindrical symmetries by the spinning motion. Using the multipole expansion in source representation, we illustrate how the spinning-induced effective bianisotropy generates the lateral force and torque on the sphere through the interference of electric and magnetic multipoles. We also uncover the effect of Sagnac frequency splitting on the optical force and torque. The results contribute to the understanding of the optical force and torque in moving media and can be applied to realize unconventional optical manipulations of small particles.},

The method provides an accurate and enhanced description of versatile trapping configurations, including optical conveyor belts.

  abstract     = {Terahertz nonlinear response has considerable potential for applications in fields such as high-speed communication and radar imaging. However, owing to the weakness of its nonlinear effects and the scarcity of high-power sources, its practical applications remain largely constrained. In this work, we present a way to manipulate third-harmonic generation (THG) at terahertz frequencies via the design and study of dual-resonance metagrating with a compound lattice. The compound lattice supports two photonic bands of the magnetic polariton mode and the spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) mode, whose eigenfrequencies satisfy a threefold relationship. Due to the geometric symmetry of the structure, an accidental bound state in the continuum (BIC) emerges at the SSPP band. The combined contribution of the two distinct resonant modes can significantly enhance the THG process at a lower input power. Meanwhile, the quasi-BIC mode operating at the nonlinear frequency has the capacity to confine the generated nonlinear harmonics within the metagrating, thereby suppressing the radiation channel of the third-harmonic light. Specifically, based on the nonlinear efficiency and resonance mechanisms, four different THG regimes are identified, namely, region I (dual-resonance region), region II (annihilation region due to BIC), region III (transition region), and region IV (single-resonance region). Our findings offer an alternative paradigm to control nonlinear processes through metagrating to tailor the light-matter interactions.},

They are also known as Voigt waves. Similar singular profiles also arise in the theory of surface electromagnetic waves in anisotropic media. In this work we consider surface polaritons at the interface of two generally different uniaxial media. The optic axes of both media are parallel to the interface. One of the specific solutions, called bisingular, greatly simplifies the dispersion equation for surface polaritons. In this case the analytical solution in closed form is found, and existence conditions are determined. It is shown that a bisingular surface polariton exists only for certain angles between the optic axes, which are found from two cubic equations. All the parameters of the bisingular surface polariton depend only on permittivities and this angle. If one medium is weakly anisotropic or both media are almost the same, then two angles exist. In the general case of two arbitrary media there can be from two to six such angles.},

This nonreciprocity significantly enhances the precision of the angular-velocity estimation, offering a unique advantage over conventional gyroscopic systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the operational range of this nonreciprocal gyroscope is fundamentally governed by the frequency of the pumping optical field, enabling localized sensitivity to angular velocity. Leveraging the adaptive capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL), we optimize the gyroscope's sensitivity within a targeted angular-velocity range, achieving unprecedented levels of precision.

Based on this approach, various stationary states of bound PQSs (“soliton molecules”) with distinct phase differences are predicted. Their stability is addressed via the numerical calculation of the eigenvalue spectrum of small perturbations, showing instability of the bound states. A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that the parameter space of the PQS bound states is organized as a self-similar fractal structure, composed of regions populated by robustly oscillating or splitting two-soliton states.

These oscillations are modulated by nonadiabatic transitions between Floquet states, which ultimately determines the population inversion dynamics. Furthermore, our simulations successfully reproduce the experimentally observed wavelength-dependent lasing signals and reveal that the rarely observed three-photon Rabi oscillations can be reflected in the pulse-duration dependence of the lasing intensity.

Simulation of moiré related physics in cold atom platforms is expected to outperform 2D materials thanks to its advantage of higher tunablility. Here, we demonstrate that the cold atom platform enables an alternative mechanism of moiré lattice formation, induced by interlayer interaction with intrinsic “dynamical” character, in contrast with conventional moiré lattice induced by “static” ways such as single-particle interlayer tunneling. Specifically, we consider a twisted bilayer Bose-Hubbard model with vanishing interlayer tunneling, and the bilayer is solely coupled through interlayer interactions that originate from the contact interaction of atoms. We find that this system hosts a plethora of intriguing phases unique to this dynamical lattice, including a variety of Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases either preserving or breaking moiré lattice symmetry, phases with one layer in SF and the other in MI, “interlocked” MI, and self-localized phases at commensurate twist angles, which exhibits the characteristics of Bose glass and quasi-many-body localization in the absence of (quasi)disorder or quasicrystalline lattices. Our prediction can be readily observed in current experimental setups of twisted bilayer optical lattices, opening up alternative avenues for exploring the rich physics of interaction induced moiré systems in cold atoms.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of homogeneous ultracold Bose gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules following a sudden quench of the scattering length at zero temperature. We calculate in particular the quantum depletion, the anomalous density, the condensate fluctuations, and the pair-correlation function using both the time-dependent Bogoliubov approach and the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. During their time evolution, these quantities exhibit slow or fast oscillations depending on the strength of the shielding interactions. We find that at long timescales the molecular condensate is characterized by nonequilibrium steady-state momentum distribution functions, with depletion, anomalous density, and correlations that deviate from their corresponding equilibrium values. We demonstrate that the pair correlations expand diffusively at short times while they spread ballistically at long times.},

  abstract     = {Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, three-body loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for the extraction of the three-body loss rate coefficient and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.},

In this work, we explore their impact on a spatial-temporal ordered phase in a cavity-boson system, a phase previously predicted within the mean-field framework. By incorporating higher-order quantum fluctuations of the cavity field, we derive a set of quantum kinetic equations and numerically analyze the system's dynamics. Our results show that while mean-field spatial-temporal order vanishes over time, oscillatory behavior persists at the level of quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that the phase survives in a modified form. This study underscores the importance of quantum fluctuations in nonequilibrium quantum systems and reveals the limitations of the mean-field approach in predicting the stability of complex quantum phases.},

The particle dynamics is modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides a fast and efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.},

All transition lines contain first- and second-order regions, while the phase diagram itself shows a resemblance with those displayed by quasi-one-dimensional dipolar systems. Finally, we investigate the effect of introducing an in-plane polarization on the structural properties of the phases and determine the superfluid fraction. Our results show that this process induces an axial deformation on the hexagonal and honeycomb phases, resulting in an anisotropic behavior in the long-distance properties of the system like superfluidity.

For such rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wave functions (for two and three spinful atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI results and are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability of previous Jastrow-type treatments.

For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite-range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite-range effects wash out the point of transition.},

Our analysis reveals that the -clustering state, a three-component generalization of the -pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO).

  abstract     = {In recent years, flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing topological properties, extremely slow electron velocities, and enhanced density of states. Extending twisted bilayer systems to new configurations is highly desirable, as it offers promising opportunities to explore flat bands beyond TBG. Here, we study both topological and trivial flat bands in a twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice for ultracold atoms and present the evolution of the flat bands with different interlayer coupling strength (ICS). Our results demonstrate that an isolated topological flat band can emerge at the Dirac-point energy for a specific value of weak ICS, referred to as the “critical coupling.” This occurs over a wide range of twist angles, surpassing the limits of the magic angle in TBG systems. When the ICS is slightly increased beyond the critical coupling value, the topological flat band exhibits degenerate band crossings with both the upper and lower adjacent bands at the high-symmetry point. As the ICS is further increased into the strong coupling regime, trivial flat bands arise around Dirac-point energy. Meanwhile, more trivial flat bands appear, extending from the lowest to higher energy bands, and remain flat as the ICS increases. The topological properties of the flat bands are studied through the winding pattern of the Wilson loop spectrum. Our research provides deeper insights into the formation of flat bands in ultracold atoms with highly controllable twisted bilayer optical lattices, and may contribute to the discovery of new strongly correlated states of matter.},

Determining the collective excitation spectrum through Bogoliubov–de Gennes theory, we characterize the dynamical stability regime via modulational instability. For AFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and unstable avoided crossings (UACs), with the first-excited branch undergoing a double unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions, only a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited branches, is observed. Furthermore, the eigenvectors demonstrate the transition from densitylike to spinlike behavior, as the collective excitation shows the transition from the stable to the unstable mode for both the FM and AFM interactions. In the multiband instability state, eigenvectors display spin-density mixed mode, while they show spin-flip nature in the avoided crossing regime. Our analysis suggests that spin-orbit coupling enhances the instability gain, while Rabi coupling plays the opposite role. Finally, we corroborate our analytical findings of stable and unstable regimes through numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of the condensates by introducing the perturbations upon quenching the trap strength. The dynamical phases show the formation of complex domains with AFM interaction, which may be attributed to the double unstable avoided crossings in such a system.},

  abstract     = {An important aspect in categorizing topological phases is whether the system is spinless or spinful, given that these classes exhibit distinct symmetry algebras, leading to disparate topological classifications. By utilizing the projective presentation strategy, the topological phases of spinless (or spinful) systems can be emulated using spinful (or spinless) systems augmented with gauge fields. In this study, we propose to implement the topological phases safeguarded by the unique projective space-time inversion symmetry inherent to spinful models, using synthetic spinless alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms. Employing the separation of orbital and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom, the model is configured as a rectangular tube penetrated by a uniform magnetic flux through each plaquette, which simulates a spinless ladder endowed with projective space-time inversion symmetry satisfying the algebraic properties of a spinful model. For interacting topological phases with interorbital spin-exchange interactions, which also adhere to space-time inversion symmetry, the four-fold degeneracy of edge modes is split into two pairs of edge modes with two-fold degeneracy. We map the complete phase diagram in the end and discover that these interacting topological phases ultimately evolve into distinct charge-density-wave phases via spontaneous symmetry breaking.},

  abstract     = {Tagging barium ions in double-beta decay experiments involving atoms offers a promising pathway to achieving an almost background-free environment, which is essential for addressing key unresolved questions in neutrino physics, such as the nature of neutrinos and their mass hierarchy. In this manuscript, I present a detection scheme that relies exclusively on the intrinsic energy levels of the barium ion. This method is based solely on the optical interrogation of its electronic transitions, avoiding the need for additional additives or fluorescent agents in the xenon vessel and thereby simplifying the experimental setup. Throughout the manuscript, I demonstrate the feasibility of this detection concept through numerical simulations under realistic experimental conditions inspired by the Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC experiment. The results show that the fluorescence signature of the barium ion can be reliably detected, indicating that the proposed method is a viable path toward background-free searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically demonstrate the effects of interferences and asymmetries between and valleys for pristine graphene in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) by a single-color laser pulse. It is shown that the allowed orders of the observed overall HHG spectra are attributed to the consequences of quantum interferences between and valleys. The cancellations of forbidden harmonics are caused by the destructive interferences between two different valleys due to the dynamical symmetries of the laser-solid systems. Apparent valley-contrasting and helicity-resolved harmonic signals can be observed for the -order ( ) harmonics when the polarization state of the driving laser field slightly deviates from the ideal circular polarization. The valley discriminations for these emerging -order ( ) harmonics originate from the unequal responses of the HHG from two different valleys within the perturbation regime. In addition, the valley asymmetries of the electronic excitations are also observed by using an elliptically polarized laser pulse. Our work clearly illustrates the essential intervalley interplay in the HHG process for pristine graphene, facilitating the understanding of ultrafast electron dynamics in zero-band-gap materials.},

We explore the role of both intrinsic molecular properties (transition dipole moments and involved molecular orbitals) and external field parameters to explain the efficiency and selectivity of the process towards specific classes of electronic states, and to control it towards the amplification of desired populations or superpositions. While the reported mechanism naturally applies to virtually all organic and bio-organic molecules and can straightforwardly be extended to a broader class of molecules, atoms and materials, detailed results for two molecular systems are here reported as a testbed of the proposed approach, for which experimental feasibility is eventually discussed.},

We analyze how the polarization of the pump and probe light fields, along with the external magnetic field, impact the absorption profile. To this end, we employ a density-matrix approach based on the Liouville–von Neumann equation. Our results reveal that the absorption profile exhibits an asymmetric pattern that depends on the magnetic-field strength and the mutual orientation of the pump and probe light propagation directions relative to the quantization axis. For illustration, we assume the incoming radiation drives an electric dipole transition, ( ) ( ), in rubidium atoms subjected to a magnetic field.

By analyzing the field-free electronic structure, field-induced changes in the many-electron potential, and the partitions of the high harmonic spectra, we demonstrate that these anions are valuable for understanding the role of orbital spatial distribution in HHG. Both systems feature degenerate (or near-degenerate) orbitals, with some extending along the field polarization direction. Our analysis reveals that this spatial extensiveness enhances HHG intensity by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the redistribution of electron density in under intense laser fields generates a negative potential near the nuclei, increasing the apparent ionization potential and significantly extending the high harmonic cutoff.},

  abstract     = {Reconstruction of attosecond beatings by two-photon interferences (RABBIT) has amply been used to retrieve photoionization delays from photoelectron spectra measured in atoms and, more recently, in molecules. For the latter, the molecular orientation and multicenter nature of the potential felt by the escaping electron often makes the extraction of these delays problematic. One of the complications comes from the fact that the energy separation between the states of the resulting molecular cation is of the order of the photon energy of the driving infrared (IR) field, so that, during the ionization process, the IR field may induce resonant transitions between such states. This adds a third ionization path to the standard two-path ionization scheme of RABBIT. Here we present a detailed theoretical study of RABBIT in the acetylene molecule in which we have explicitly evaluated time-resolved photoelectron spectra as those recorded in actual experiments. We do so for both random and well-defined orientations of the molecule, and for photoelectron spectra integrated over and resolved in the photoelectron emission angle. We show that the presence of this additional third path can strongly affect the values and physical meaning of photoionization delays extracted from fits based on the commonly used two-path interference scheme. This is indeed the case for acetylene molecules parallel to the light polarization direction, where the extracted delays strongly depend on the IR frequency, while for molecules perpendicular to the polarization direction the standard two-path RABBIT conditions are fulfilled.},

Here we adapt this framework to the context of solids and consider an intraband model of ZnO. We investigate the effect of the quantum optical nature of the driving field on the harmonic spectra including the cutoff and the intensity scaling of the harmonics with driving field intensity. Based on analytical calculations in the Floquet limit, we explain why driving with thermal light or bright-squeezed vacuum (BSV) produces a much higher cutoff than when driving with fields described by coherent or Fock states. Further, we derive an expression for the generated time-dependent electric field and its fluctuations and find that it inherits characteristics of the driving field.

We find that the raw TDDFT-calculated HHG yield in cyclohexane is strongly overestimated compared to those of benzene and cyclohexene, and that this can be attributed to unphysically large contributions from cyclohexane orbitals lying well below the highest-occupied molecular orbital. We demonstrate this by implementing a simple orbital-resolved scaling factor that adjusts the tunneling-ionization contribution to the harmonic yield. The rescaled yields are in much better agreement with experimental results, and in particular, reproduce the correct relative-yield ordering of the three molecules. Our results are encouraging for the use of TDDFT in systematic computations of HHG in large molecules.},

  abstract     = {Using second-order perturbation theory in the light-matter interaction, we derive an analytical approximation for the vibronic populations of a diatomic system excited by ultrabroadband frequency-entangled photons and evaluate the population dynamics for different degrees of entanglement between photon pairs. Our analytical approach makes the same predictions as previously derived via numerical solutions of the complete Schrödinger equation [H. Oka, Phys. Rev. A 97 , 063859 (2018) ], with the added advantage of providing clear physical insights into the vibronic selectivity as a function of the degree of photon correlations while requiring significantly reduced computational effort. Specifically, our analytical expression for the probability of vibronic excitation includes a factor which predicts the enhancement of vibrational selectivity as a function of the degree correlation between the entangled photon pairs, the targeted vibrational energy level, and the vibrational molecular structure encoded in the Franck-Condon factors. Our results illustrate the importance of going beyond the usual approximations in second-order perturbation theory to capture the relevance of the vibrational structure of the molecular system of interest in order to gain a deeper understanding of the possible quantum-enhancement provided by the interaction between quantum light and matter.},

It makes a difference for the behavior of collective systems having different quantum statistics but existing in the same environment. Here we show that for some specific quantum conjugation between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom the indistinguishable particles can behave similarly for either quantum statistics. In particular, a mesoscopically scaled collection of atomic qubits, mediated by optical tweezers, can model the behavior of a valent electronic shell compounded with nuclear centers in molecules. This makes possible quantum simulations of mono- and divalent bonds in quantum chemistry by manipulation of up to four bosonic atoms confined with optical microtraps.},

  abstract     = {Direct molecular simulation and the state-to-state method, as the prevailing theoretical approaches for studying thermally nonequilibrium molecular collisions, strongly rely on available high-precision potential energy surfaces and extensive trajectory calculations, and their application to polyatomic molecular systems remains a challenge. In this paper, the state-resolved deep potential molecular dynamics (SR-DPMD) method is proposed, which performs potential energy surface construction and molecular dynamics simulation based on the deep potential molecular dynamics scheme and then achieves energy state resolution during the simulation through normal mode analysis. Applying this method to the simulation of thermal nonequilibrium dynamics of the methane-nitrogen system and comparing it with the simulation of state-resolved ReaxFF, combining the energy state analysis of five-atom molecules is realized. The results demonstrate that vibration-rotation coupling and vibration-vibration coupling can directly affect the vibrational energy relaxation behavior of molecules. It is evident that the accuracy of the ReaxFF is inadequate to facilitate the energy state resolution of the molecule; however, it is capable of yielding qualitative outcomes concerning the energy relaxation of the molecule during the simulation. Overall, the SR-DPMD method provides a powerful tool for understanding the energy state evolution of polyatomic molecules under nonequilibrium conditions and is expected to provide valuable insights into energy relaxation, chemical reactions, and their coupling processes. The reaction force field is also dedicated to providing new perspectives for the study of thermal nonequilibrium dynamics.},

Special emphasis is placed on head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counterpropagating laser photons, as can be observed in ion storage ring experiments. If the collision zone for such a scenario is exposed to a moderate field of a dipole magnet, a fast-moving ion will be subjected to strong electric and magnetic fields in its rest frame due to the Lorentz transformation. To investigate the effect of these fields we performed detailed calculations for the elastic photon scattering by He-like Ca ions moving with the Lorentz factor . Such a scenario is of particular interest for the Gamma Factory project which is supported by the CERN Physics Beyond Colliders framework. Based on the results of our calculations, we argue that even moderate magnetic fields significantly modify the rate of detected photons as well as their emission pattern and polarization. This sensitivity to external fields opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.},

However, the BBR Stark shift and the BBR Zeeman shift exhibit different behaviors with respect to the principal quantum number of the Rydberg electron. Namely, the BBR Stark shift asymptotically approaches a constant value given by a universal expression, whereas the BBR Zeeman shift grows steeply with principal quantum number due to the diamagnetic contribution. We show that for transitions between Rydberg states, where only the differential shift between levels is of concern, the BBR Zeeman shift can surpass the BBR Stark shift. We exemplify this in the context of a proposed experiment targeting a precise determination of the Rydberg constant.},

Here, we apply the tool kit of density-functional theory (DFT) to analyze the characteristics of the eigenvalues of an arbitrary symmetric matrix. The latter can represent a model Hamiltonian, which is not necessarily obtained from a basis-set representation of the exact physical Hamiltonian. Based on the analogy with an exactly solvable physical model, we introduce a density functional for each eigenvalue of the matrix and show that, similar to an exactly solvable model, only the lowest and highest eigenvalues of an arbitrary symmetric matrix have well-defined single-valued functionals of density with unique convexity or concavity characteristics. All other eigenvalues lack such density functionals, as the respective quantities are multivalued density functions and lack unique convexity or concavity. The problem of the nonexistence of functionals for the excited states can be overcome by forming weighted sums of eigenvalues in analogy with the Gross-Oliveira-Kohn ensemble DFT, which results in well-defined density functionals with admissible characteristics.},

Using high-resolution Auger projectile electron spectroscopy, the normalized Auger electron yields are measured at relative to the beam direction. In addition, a three-electron atomic orbital close-coupling approach, employing full configuration interaction and antisymmetrization of the three-electron, two-center total wave function, is applied to calculate the production cross sections for these states from each of the three initial ion beam components. Thereupon, the theoretical Auger yields are computed and found to be mostly smaller than experiment by factors ranging from near 1 to about 10. Agreement, however, improves when larger fractions, not only based on spin statistics, are projected. Overall, we present a careful and sophisticated analysis with a thorough discussion of these results which show that our current understanding is still incomplete.

Modifications of the existing experimental setup to incorporate a vapor target produced from a solid sample are described. Experimental results are compared with the multicenter three-distorted-wave model. The post-collision interaction (PCI) effects are included using the Ward-Macek approximation in the multicenter three-distorted-wave Ward-Macek model. Both experimental and theoretical TDCSs include contributions from the first five valence orbitals which lead to the formation of the parent ion.

The simulations are most often based on the Placzek approximation, ignoring the dependence of energies of the excited electronic states on nuclear coordinates. Thus practical CP DFT computations do not exactly correspond to the more general sum over state (SOS) formalism. We discuss this problem, investigate the SOS convergence, and formulate a distributed origin gauge enabling us to calculate origin-independent Raman optical activity intensities. The variations of the computed spectra caused by the energy gradient terms are investigated with practical examples. The results show that although the contribution of the gradient parts to Raman intensities is rather small in the far from resonance cases, their subtraction may still occasionally improve the simulated spectra. However, the effect is much more important for Raman optical activity and in resonance conditions. The possibility to correct the computed intensities for the gradient contribution thus opens a way for systematic improvements of quantum-mechanical simulations of the spectra.},

The choice of Rydberg state has a huge impact on the strength and angular dependence of the interactions, and so a detailed understanding of the underlying processes and resulting properties of the interactions is therefore key to select the most suitable states for experiments. We study the van der Waals interactions in alkali-metal atoms in detail and highlight the structures which allow an understanding and exploitation of the various interaction properties. A particular theme is the identification of Förster resonances with , which offer interaction potentials with a wide range of properties that make them particularly interesting for experimental applications. A second theme is a focus on the underlying structures that shape the angular dependency and sign of the interactions. This understanding — instead of brute-force calculations — allows for a much simpler and more systematic search for suitable pair states. These insights can be used for the selection of tailored interaction potentials subject to experimental constraints and requirements.

The proportionality between the EE and the stopping power observed when measured using grounded conductive foils is no longer fulfilled. We perform a complementary analysis of nanoparticle charging by using Monte Carlo simulations. We emphasize the role of particle charging by taking into account the effect of the holes on the dynamics of electron emission. The resulting charging effect can be as large as two orders of magnitude for the highest stopping power. This explains rather well the experimentally observed strong sublinearity of electron emission with stopping power. As the nanoparticle size decreases, the simulation suggests that the charging effect diminishes, but remains significant for large stopping power.},

A particular regime of interest is that of high-bandwidth force detection, where an impulse is delivered to the system over a short period of time. Exceedingly sensitive impulse detection has been proposed to observe very weak signals like those due to long-range interactions with dark matter that require much higher sensitivities than current sensors can provide. Quantum resources to go beyond the traditional standard quantum limit of these sensors include squeezing of the light used to transduce the signal, backaction evasion by measuring the optimal quadrature, and quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements that reduce backaction directly. These methods have been developed in the context of gravitational wave detection for target frequencies in the audio band range. Here, we provide the theoretical limits to quantum noise reduction for higher and broader frequency targets, such as those from dark matter signals, while combining quantum-enhanced readout techniques based on squeezed light and QND measurements with optomechanical sensors. We demonstrate that backaction evasion through QND techniques dramatically reduces the technical challenges presented when using squeezed light for broadband force detection, paving the way for combining multiple quantum noise reduction techniques for enhanced sensitivity in the context of impulse metrology.},

We investigate the coherent dynamics of the resonator-induced phase gate and demonstrate the potential to achieve a controlled- gate with a high fidelity of 93.5% within a short timescale of tens of nanoseconds under realistic conditions. We also show the robustness of this scheme with respect to perturbations in the control pulse parameters. Furthermore, our scheme can be used to generate nonlocal entangled states and can be easily extended to multiqubit architectures.

The relative dipole-dipole interaction strength is estimated by the probe qubit dephasing. The ultimate precision of this estimation is quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which can be obtained by means of measuring quantum coherence of the probe qubit. Our findings indicate that, in the interval where roton excitations appear, the QFI oscillates periodically with the evolution time , and the amplitude of these oscillations increases alongside the extension of . Moreover, we analytically determine that the envelope curve formed by the local maximum points satisfies the functional relationship during long-term encoding scenarios, where , and are positive numbers. It is revealed that the highly non-Markovian effects caused by the roton softening of the excitation spectrum allow long evolution time to serve as a resource for enhancing sensing precision. We also study the effects of the reservoir's temperature on the dynamics of the QFI. It is found that lower temperatures have virtually no effect, while higher temperatures can accelerate the growth rate of the QFI with evolution time, reflecting that thermal noise can be used to enhance the quantum advantage in quantum sensing.

In this work, we employ a two-level system (qubit) as a probe, which is coupled to a structured reservoir consisting of an ancilla qubit and a Markovian environment modeled as a thermal bath. By exploiting non-Markovian dynamics, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of different interaction types between the probe and ancilla for estimating critical parameters, including temperature, ancilla frequency, and system-bath coupling strength. We quantify the precision of parameter estimation using quantum Fisher information (QFI) and analyze the system dynamics in both transient and steady-state regimes. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovianity substantially enhances parameter estimation in the transient regime, with specific interactions facilitating sustained information backflow and yielding higher QFI values. However, the performance of these interactions is contingent on the parameter under estimation and the operational regime. For instance, certain interactions become prominent in the transient regime but exhibit diminished utility in the steady state, whereas others maintain their effectiveness even at equilibrium. These results stress the importance of judiciously selecting interactions adapted to specific estimation objectives and operational regimes.},

  abstract     = {Bell-state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here, we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.},

  abstract     = {Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices have inherent limitations in terms of connectivity and hardware noise. The synthesis of controlled- ( cnot ) circuits considers the physical constraints and transforms quantum algorithms into low-level quantum circuits that can execute on physical chips correctly. In the current trend, quantum chip architectures without Hamiltonian paths are gradually replacing architectures with Hamiltonian paths due to their scalability and low-noise characteristics. To this end, this paper addresses the nearest-neighbor synthesis of cnot circuits in the architectures with and without Hamiltonian paths, aiming to enhance the fidelity of the circuits after execution. First, a key-qubit priority mapping model for general quantum architectures is proposed. Second, the initial mapping is further improved by using tabu search to reduce the number of cnot gates after circuit synthesis and enhance its fidelity. Finally, the noise-aware cnot circuit nearest-neighbor synthesis algorithm for the general architecture is proposed based on the key-qubit priority mapping model. The algorithm is demonstrated on several popular cloud quantum computing platforms and simulators, showing that it effectively optimizes the fidelity of cnot circuits compared with mainstream methods. Moreover, the method can be extended to more general circuits, thereby improving the overall performance of quantum computing on NISQ devices.},

  abstract     = {Quantum batteries, as highly efficient energy storage devices, have garnered significant research interest. A key challenge in their development is to maximize the extractable energy (ergotropy) when operating within a finite-temperature reservoir. To address this, we apply quantum feedback control to the charger and investigate the effects of fermionic and bosonic thermal reservoirs on the performance of quantum batteries, including stored energy, ergotropy, and charging efficiency, in an open environment. Our findings reveal that, regardless of the type of thermal reservoir, the system exhibits optimal charging parameters. In particular, in a fermionic thermal reservoir, increasing the environmental temperature enhances battery performance, enabling stable and efficient charging. In contrast, within a bosonic thermal reservoir, higher temperatures hinder energy storage and extraction, significantly reducing charging efficiency. Additionally, we explore the impact of battery size and find that, under a fermionic reservoir, increasing the battery size appropriately can further improve performance.},

  abstract     = {Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shifts refer to transverse tiny displacements of light beams at the interface of two media. Since the IF shifts are a reflection of the light-matter interaction, they can be applied to sense the properties of the medium or light beam. To evaluate the errors of parameters in various kinds of sensors with high precision, quantum metrology based on the SU(1,1) interferometer is expected to improve the measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL). We propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the IF shifts and incident angle sensitivity for a Laguerre-Gauss beam by introducing a surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR) sensor into the SU(1,1) interferometer. We derived the sensitivity of the IF shifts and incident angle based on the homodyne detection. Meanwhile, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound and SNL of IF shifts and incident angle are obtained in our scheme. Our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of both IF shifts and incident angle can break through the SNL around the SPR angle by injecting two coherent states with large coherent amplitude. Furthermore, it is possible to get the maximal IF shifts and the optimal IF shifts sensitivity simultaneously on the two sides of the SPR angle. Our scheme provides a method for measuring tiny beam shifts and small angular displacement in SPR sensors. The results can be helpful for the development of quantum metrology based on quantum sensors and a deep understanding of light-matter interactions.},

Using this interaction, a periodic repetition of the state encoded in the qudit, can be deterministically mapped onto the oscillator, which is initialized in a squeezed state. Based on this controlled displacement interaction, we present a full circuit that encodes quantum information in a superposition of qudit quadrature states, and successively prepares the oscillator in the corresponding superposition of approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states. This preparation scheme is found to be similar to phase estimation, with the addition of a disentanglement gate. Our protocol for GKP state preparation is efficient in the sense, that the set of qubits need only interact with the oscillator through two time-independent interactions, and in the sense that the squeeze factor (in dB) of the produced GKP state grows linearly in the number of qubits used.},

Here we consider the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code as a natural choice for a loss-correction-based quantum repeater. However, unlike existing treatments, we focus on the excitation loss that occurs in the local, stationary memory qubits as represented by, for instance, collective atomic spin modes. We analyze and assess the performance of such a GKP-based quantum repeater where, apart from the initial state generations and distributions, all operations can be performed via deterministic linear mode transformations, as opposed to other existing memory-based quantum repeater schemes.},

However, in prevalent schemes where the photonic state is encoded in polarization, cavity birefringence introduces an energy splitting of the cavity eigenmodes and alters the polarization states, thus limiting the fidelity of remote entanglement generation. To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that encodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree of freedom. The scheme relies on resonant coupling of multiple transverse cavity modes to different atomic transitions that are well separated in frequency. We numerically investigate the temporal properties of the photonic wave packet, two-photon interference visibility, and atom-atom entanglement fidelity under various cavity polarization-mode splittings and find that our scheme is less affected by cavity birefringence. Finally, we propose practical implementations in two trapped ion systems, using the fine-structure splitting in the metastable D state of 40 Ca + and the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of 225 Ra + . Our study presents an alternative approach for cavity-based quantum networks that is less sensitive to birefringent effects and is applicable to a variety of atomic and solid-state emitter-cavity interfaces.},

Amongst this excitement, analog quantum computation has become less prominent, with the expectation that circuit-model quantum computers will eventually be sufficient for emulating analog quantum computation and thus rendering analog quantum computation obsolete. In this work we explore the basic requirements for emulating a specific analog quantum computation in the circuit model: the preparation of a biased superposition of degenerate ground states of an Ising Hamiltonian using an adiabatic evolution. We show that the overhead of emulation is substantial even for this simple problem. This supports using analog quantum computation for solving time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics in the short term and midterm, assuming analog errors can be made low enough and coherence times long enough to solve problems of practical interest.},

Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a control-based symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control rather than the nonperturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain nonperturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single- and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-size) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error-reduction techniques for current qubit devices.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable devices which can implement arbitrary unitary operations are crucial for photonic quantum computation, optical neural networks, and boson sampling. Here, we address the problem of, using multiport interferometers, approximating with a given infidelity any pure-state preparation and any unitary operation. By means of numerical calculations, we show that pure states, in any dimension , can be prepared with infidelity with three layers of -dimensional Fourier transforms and three layers of configurable phase shifters. We also present numerical evidence that layers of -dimensional Fourier transforms and layers of configurable phase shifters can produce any unitary operation with infidelity . The conclusions are achieved by numerical simulations in the range from to . These results are interesting in light of the recent availability of multicore fiber-integrated multiport interferometers.},

  abstract     = {Wannier-Stark localization has been proven to be a resource for quantum-enhanced sensitivity for precise estimation of a gradient field. An extremely promising feature of such probes is their ability to showcase such enhanced scaling even dynamically with system size, on top of the quadratic scaling in time. In this paper, we address the issue of decoherence that occurs during time evolution and characterize how that affects the sensing performance. We determine the parameter domains in which the enhancement is sustained under dephasing dynamics. In addition, we consider an effective non-Hermitian description of the open quantum system dynamics for describing the effect of decoherence on the sensing performance of the probe. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we show that quantum-enhanced sensitivity can indeed be sustained over a certain range of decoherence strength for Wannier-Stark probes. This is demonstrated with two examples of non-Hermitian systems with nonreciprocal couplings.},

  abstract     = {Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins . More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.},

  abstract     = {Suppose you receive a sequence of qubits where each qubit is guaranteed to be in one of two pure states, but you do not know what those states are. Your task is to determine the states. This can be viewed as a kind of quantum state learning, or quantum state estimation. The problem is that, without more information, all that can be determined is the density matrix of the sequence and, in general, density matrices can be decomposed into pure states in many different ways. To solve the problem, additional information, either classical or quantum, is required. We show that if an additional copy of each qubit is supplied (that is, one receives pairs of qubits, both in the same state, rather than single qubits) the task can be accomplished. This is possible because the mixed two-qubit state has a unique decomposition into pure product states. For illustration purposes, we numerically simulate the symmetric, informationally complete measurement of a sequence of qubit pairs and show that the unknown states and their respective probabilities of occurrence can be inferred from the data with high accuracy. Finally, we propose an experiment that employs a product measurement and can be realized with existing technology, and we demonstrate how the data tell us the states and their probabilities. We find that it is enough to detect a few thousand qubit pairs.},

However, the most popular unitary coupled-cluster ansatz requires a large number of qubits and gates that are constrained by short coherence time and hardware noise. In this study, we present schemes for estimating the ground-state energies of the molecules and LiH using the VQE algorithm in a trapped-ion system with a high-dimensional method. It is shown that significantly fewer quantum gates are required to achieve the same result as the qubit-based model. High-dimensional quantum simulation can make more use of quantum resources. Utilizing the recently developed fixed-input-state method, the depth of the circuits can be further reduced. Only one and three single-qubit gates are required for the simulation of the and LiH molecules, respectively. Finally, combined with the zero-noise extrapolation technique to mitigate the effects of noise, the accuracy of the results is significantly improved. These findings indicate that using a fixed input state in high-dimensional quantum simulations can enhance the performance of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

Such a highly entangled state can be created using the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction between a collective spin system and a single vibrational mode. Our method relies on an adiabatic evolution in which the initial motional squeezing is adiabatically transferred into collective spin squeezing. In the weak squeezing regime, we show that the adiabatic evolution creates a spin-squeezed state, which reduces the quantum projective noise to a sub-shot-noise limit. For strong bosonic squeezing we find that the quantum Fisher information follows a super-Heisenberg scaling law in terms of the number of ions . Furthermore, we discuss the spin-squeezing parameter which quantifies the phase sensitivity enhancement in Ramsey spectroscopic measurements and show that it also exhibits a super-Heisenberg scaling with .

To this end, we implement a modified optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's and Bob's measurements remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of photons and quantum state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with the total absence of any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum operation applied by Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a spatial element of reality of Bob's photon. Our results reveal that Bob's photon can entangle two extra noninteracting degrees of freedom, thus confirming that Bob's photon path is not an element of physical reality.},

Sometimes a relatively strong transverse zero-field splitting is introduced in a color center due to its local strain and the low symmetry of the host structure. While clock transitions induced by transverse zero-field splitting serve as a method to prolong the coherence time, the Zeeman sublevels of solid-state color centers become insensitive to first-order magnetic-field signals, thereby limiting their utility as magnetometers. In this work, we address this challenge and achieve wide-band ac field detection spanning from hundreds of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz by utilizing a combination of orthogonal microwaves and phase modulation at different frequencies. Our control method effectively suppresses the system noise and the amplitude fluctuation of the driving field, which extends the coherence time of the quantum system.},

Recent studies have explored the broadcasting of quantum features such as asymmetry, magic, and imaginarity within the framework of resource theories. In this work, we study the quantitative aspects of coherence from the perspective of no-broadcasting. Although when the coherence is quantified by a superadditive measure, it can be readily proved that the amount of coherence cannot be broadcast, such an approach becomes invalid for nonsuperadditive measures of coherence. Thus, it is desirable to find methods to study the no-broadcasting of coherence effective for both superadditive and nonsuperadditive coherence measures. By employing a novel characterization of bipartite quantum states with vanishing basis-dependent correlations, we establish a no-broadcasting theorem of coherence in terms of Wigner-Yanase skew information, which is an important version of quantum Fisher information and a nonsuperadditive measure of coherence. The result extends the conventional no-broadcasting from quantum states to information-theoretic contents of quantum states and can be regarded as an instance of no-broadcasting of quantum Fisher information. We also establish no-broadcasting of the relative entropy of coherence, without relying on superadditivity.},

  abstract     = {Trapped-ion systems are a promising route toward the realization of both near-term and universal quantum computers. However, one of the pressing challenges is improving the fidelity of two-qubit entangling gates. These operations are often implemented by addressing individual ions with laser pulses using the Mølmer-Sørensen protocol. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a well-studied extension of this protocol, where the amplitude of the laser pulses is controlled as a function of time. We present an analytical study of AM, using a Fourier series expansion to maintain the generality of the laser amplitude's functional form. We then apply this general AM method to gate-timing errors by imposing conditions on these Fourier coefficients, producing trade-offs between the laser power and fidelity at a fixed gate time. The conditions derived here are linear and can be used, in principle, to achieve arbitrarily high orders of insensitivity to gate-timing errors. Numerical optimization is then employed to identify the minimum-power pulse satisfying these constraints. Our central result is that the leading-order dependence on gate-timing errors is improved from O ( Δ t 2 ) to O ( Δ t 6 ) with the addition of one linear constraint on the Fourier coefficients and to O ( Δ t 10 ) with two linear constraints without a significant increase in the average laser power. The increase approaches zero as more Fourier coefficients are included. In further studies, this protocol can be applied to other error sources and used in conjunction with other error-mitigation techniques to improve two-qubit gates.},

Moreover, we explore the use of recursive catalyst “towers” to implement these elementary rotations efficiently.

To address the difficulty of detection, we propose to use spin squeezing to quantify the entanglement within the individual subsystem. Knowing that the relation between spin squeezing and some entanglement measures is not one-to-one, we give some suggestions on how a judicious choice of squeezing Hamiltonian can lead to better results in our protocol. For systems with a small number of qubits, we derive analytical results and show how our protocol can work optimally for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. For larger systems, we show how the accuracy of the protocol can be improved by a proper choice of the squeezing Hamiltonian. Our protocol presents an alternative for entanglement detection in platforms where state tomography is inaccessible or hard to perform.

  abstract     = {Boundary time crystals exhibit measurement-induced phase transitions in their steady-state entanglement, with critical behavior that depends on the particular unraveling of the Lindblad dynamics. In this work, we investigate another key measure of quantum complexity—nonstabilizerness (or “magic”)—and show that it follows a markedly different pattern. Importantly, in contrast to entanglement, for large system sizes, nonstabilizerness remains invariant under different unraveling schemes—a property we attribute to the inherent permutational symmetry of the model. Although the steady-state stabilizer entropy does not display a genuine phase transition, it exhibits a singular derivative (a cusp) at the mean-field critical point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that finite-size simulations of the average Lindblad evolution fail to capture the asymptotic behavior of nonstabilizerness in the time-crystal phase, while quantum trajectory unravelings correctly reveal its extensive scaling with system size. These findings offer insights into how different quantum resources manifest in open systems.},

The three different qubit encoding schemes are assessed by conducting a Hamiltonian simulation for using a trapped-ion quantum computer. The qudit mapping is tested by running simulations with a simple noise model. The Dicke mapping, in which the spin states are encoded as superpositions of multiqubit states, is found to be the most efficient because of the small number of terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. We also investigate the dependence of the time step length in the Suzuki-Trotter approximation and find that should be inversely proportional to in order to obtain the same accuracy for all .},

Although substantial progress has been made in understanding and applying spatial correlations (i.e., those across different spatial systems at the same instant of time), temporal correlations (which emerge from the dynamics of a single quantum system across different instants of time) have been relatively less investigated. In this work, we first provide an axiomatic approach to temporal correlations by postulating natural requirements for a reasonable monotone of temporal correlations generated by a quantum channel. Then we study the temporal correlating power of quantum channels in terms of the Jordan product of quantum channels and compare it with the recently introduced notion of state over time. We introduce an information-theoretic monotone of such a power by exploiting the Jordan negativity and reveal its basic properties such as convexity, monotonicity, and unitary invariance. We further illustrate the monotone through several important channels and explicitly evaluate the corresponding temporal correlating power.},

A distance-based metric known as the generalized geometric measure (GGM) is used to quantify genuine entanglement. The GGM of a state is defined as its minimum distance from the set of all nongenuinely entangled states. To begin with, we derive an expression for the Haar-averaged value of any function defined on the set of energy-constrained states. Subsequently, we investigate states with a large number of modes and provide a closed-form expression for the Haar-averaged GGM in terms of the average energy per mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate that typical states closely approximate their Haar-averaged GGM value, with deviation probabilities bounded by an exponentially suppressed limit. We then analyze the GGM content of typical states with a finite number of modes and present the distribution of GGM. Our findings indicate that, as the number of modes increases, the distribution shifts towards higher entanglement values and becomes more concentrated. We quantify these features by computing the Haar-averaged GGM and the standard deviation of the GGM distribution, revealing that the former increases while the latter decreases with the number of modes. Finally, we compare the typical value of the GGM with its maximal value consistent with the imposed energy bound.},

In the case of fully thermalized qubits isolated from a thermal bath, the measurement precision of temperature can be improved exponentially when the temperature, the measurement time, or the input photon number approaches 0. In general, thermal fluctuations prevent the action of squeezed light. When multiple qubits maintain interacting with the thermal bath, the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved if the loss rate of the cavity is large and the coupling between the qubit and the optical cavity is weak enough.

  abstract     = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm, also known in its generalization as the quantum alternating operator ansatz, (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as maximum satisfiability. While the QAOA is well studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes) required for the QAOA. For our main result, we (i) leverage a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of the QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds of the QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii) show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective functions and, when the problem can be modeled as a -local Hamiltonian, can be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the conventional transverse-field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded-occurrence local cost problems and for all strictly -local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with a constant-round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. Using our proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound for unstructured search and, with small modification, show that our bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries.},

However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum-enhanced performance. To demonstrate this, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.},

This perturbative methodology, which we call feedback-based optimally controlled quantum states (FOCQS), can be used to improve the results of feedback-based algorithms, like FALQON, providing better convergence but still no formal guarantees of convergence. Furthermore, this perturbative method can be used to push smooth annealing-like control protocol closer to the control optimum, even providing an iterative approach, albeit with diminishing returns.

Quantum neural networks, on the other hand, are necessarily linear as they process information via unitary operations. Here we show that effective nonlinearities can be implemented in these platforms by exploiting the relationship between information processing and many-body quantum dynamics. The crucial point is that quantum many-body systems can show emergent collective behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions, which leads to an effectively nonlinear dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In the context of quantum neural networks, which are necessarily finite, this translates into metastability with transient nonergodic behavior. By using a quantum neural network the architecture of which is inspired by dissipative many-body quantum spin models, we show that this mechanism indeed allows one to realize nonlinear data classification, despite the underlying dynamics being local and linear. Our proof-of-principle study may pave the way for the systematic construction of quantum neural networks with emergent nonlinear properties.},

DEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their intricate nature, and finding solutions to DEs often exceeds the capabilities of traditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have triggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum algorithms for solving DEs. In this work, we introduce two different architectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange polynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the Hadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of DEs. To demonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known ordinary differential equations are used: the damped mass-spring system from a given initial condition and the Poisson equation for periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the proposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational quantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a different form of quantum steering, i.e., certification of quantum steering in a one-sided semi-device-independent way, has been formulated [C. Jebarathinam et al. , Phys. Rev. A 108 , 042211 (2023) ]. In this work, we use this phenomenon to provide operational simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases as quantified by the measures in [S. Wu et al ., Sci. Rep. 4 , 4036 (2014) ]. First, we show that for any bipartite state, such measure of simultaneous correlations in two mutually unbiased bases can be operationally identified as exhibiting one-sided semi-device-independent steering in a two-setting scenario. Next, we demonstrate that for two-qubit Bell-diagonal states, quantifying one-sided semi-device-independent steerability provides an operational quantification of information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases. Then, we provide a different classification of two-qubit separable states with the above-mentioned information-theoretic quantification of simultaneous correlations in mutually unbiased bases and the quantification of one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. Finally, we invoke quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to shed intuitions on the operational characterization of simultaneous correlations in complementary bases of two-qubit states via one-sided semi-device-independent steerability. This provides us with a geometric visualization of the results.},

  abstract     = {The rotation symmetric bosonic code (RSBC) is a unified framework of practical bosonic codes that have rotation symmetries, such as cat codes and binomial codes. While cat and binomial codes achieve the breakeven point in which the coherence time of the encoded qubits exceeds that of unencoded qubits, the state preparation fidelity needs to be improved for practical quantum computing. Concerning this problem, we investigate the framework of symmetry expansion, a class of quantum error mitigation that virtually projects the state onto the noise-free symmetric subspace by exploiting the system's intrinsic symmetries and postprocessing of measurement outcomes. Although symmetry expansion has been limited to error mitigation of quantum states immediately before measurement, we successfully generalize symmetry expansion for state preparation. Then, we consider two types of stabilization: photon number and phase stabilization. Photon number stabilization can be performed by leveraging the rotation operators. On the other hand, the phase errors can be suppressed via the extension towards phase direction by leveraging the recently proposed projective squeezing method. To implement our method, we use an ancilla qubit and a randomly generated controlled gate between the bosonic code states and the ancilla qubit. Our novel error mitigation method will significantly enhance computation accuracy in the near-term bosonic quantum computing.},

Moreover, we demonstrate that these distributions can be rendered informationally complete, providing both a comprehensive description of the quantum state and a direct indicator of the underlying resource. We further discuss the relationship between convex resource theories, between strong anomalous weak values, and negative quasiprobabilities.

  abstract     = {A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace-preserving map, also known as a quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 , 150402 (2008) ], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map in order to identify if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective Lindbladian in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.},

In this paper, we treat quantum coherence and classical distinguishability as complementary resources and uncover a novel duality relation, which is explored through quantum state discrimination under incoherent operations, extending beyond typical interference scenarios. We prove that in an ensemble of mutually orthogonal pure states, the sum of “co-bits,” quantifying the coherence preserved under incoherent free operations, and classical bits, representing the distinguishability extracted via quantum state discrimination, is bounded. This coherence-distinguishability duality relation exposes an inherent tradeoff between the simultaneous preservation of a system's quantum coherence (wavelike property) and the extraction of its classical distinguishability (particlelike property). Our findings provide a fresh perspective on wave-particle duality through quantum resource theories, offering complementary insights into manipulating quantum and classical resources, with implications for quantum foundations and quantum technologies.},

A standard approach based on the notion of information backflow detects the flow of information from the environment back to the system. Numerous measures of information backflow have been proposed using different definitions of distinguishability between pairs of quantum states. These measures, however, necessitate optimization over the state space, which can be analytically challenging or numerically demanding. Here we propose an alternative witness and measure of information backflow that is explicitly state independent by utilizing the concept of quasiprobability representation and recent advances in the theory of majorization for quasiprobabilities. We illustrate its use over several paradigmatic examples, demonstrating consistent Markovian conditions with known results and also reported necessary and sufficient conditions for the qutrit system in a random unitary channel. The paper concludes with a discussion of the foundational implications of quantum dynamical evolution.},

By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular, the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from the behavior of low-energy excitations in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalizes to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.},

An important example is a multimode photonic system coupled to a Markovian bath so that temporal evolution of the density matrix is governed by the master equation of the Lindblad form. Theoretical analysis of the Lindblad dynamics complicated by intermode couplings such as dynamical (coherent) and environment-mediated (incoherent) interactions between the modes can be rather involved, even for exactly soluble models. Our algebraic technique uses the Lie algebra of quadratic combinations of left and right superoperators to simplify both quantitative and qualitative analysis of intermode coupling-induced effects in multimode systems by eliminating jump superoperators and reducing the Lindblad equation to the form governed by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian . We show that the spectral properties of the thermal bath Liouvillian are determined by the effective temperature-independent Hamiltonian and employ jump-eliminating transformations for computing its eigenvalues and eigenoperators. It is found that the Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs) are the points in the parameter space where the matrix associated with is nondiagonalizable. For the case of photonic polarization modes modeled as a bimodal bosonic system, we describe the geometry of EPs and apply our method to study how the intermode-couplings-induced effects such as EPs and temperature influence the dynamics of the speed of evolution that governs the quantum speed limit times of polarization qubit states.},

We develop a method to analytically bound the value of steering functionals under local hidden state (LHS) models by employing a generalized inequality for the eigenvalues of positive semidefinite operators, extending classical results such as the Samuelson inequality. This yields universal upper bounds on the LHS value in terms of the parameters defining the frame.

One commonly used strategy involves Markovian approximations, assuming a memoryless environment. In this study, such approximations are not used and an analytical dynamical depiction of an open quantum system is provided. The system under consideration is an oscillator that is surrounded by a bath of oscillators. The resulting dynamics are characterized by an integrodifferential equation, which can be solved numerically. Remarkably, an exactly analytical solution exists when its reservoir spectral density is Lorentzian. Furthermore, this analytical solvability remains when rectangular pulse control is applied to the system, though with different parameters due to the pulses. Moreover, distinct dynamical regions emerge, depending on certain parameter values. Notably, the steady-state average excitation number (AEN) of the system shows rapid escalation with increasing non-Markovianity, reflecting the intricacies of real-world dynamics. In cases where there is detuning between the system frequency and the environmental central frequency within a non-Markovian regime, the AEN maintains its initial value for an extended period. Interestingly, the exact analytical solution with pulse control inherently protects the quantum system from decoherence effects without using approximations, while this protection fades as the system approaches the Markovian regime. The pulse control can not only prolong the relaxation time of the oscillator, but can also be used to speed up the relaxation process, depending on the specifications of the pulse.},

  abstract     = {We study the quantum thermodynamics of a coherent macroscopic electromagnetic field (laser) coupled to a two-level system (qubit) near resonance, from weak- to strong-driving regimes. This combined system is, in turn, weakly coupled to a thermal radiation field and can be described by an autonomous quantum master equation. We show that the laser acts as an autonomous work source and that, in the macroscopic limit, the work produced is independent of the phase of the laser. Using the dressed qubit approach, we show that the variation of energy in the laser is not the work transferred to the dressed qubit, which is instead obtained from the “dressed laser”—a coherent superposition of the laser and the qubit. Using a two-point measurement technique with counting fields, we obtain the full counting statistics for the work of the laser and dressed laser, and show that they satisfy the Crooks fluctuation theorems. We then use these theorems as criteria to investigate the thermodynamic consistency of quantum master equations, first in the autonomous setup for the combined system, then in the nonautonomous setup for the quantum system where the coherent field is eliminated and effectively described by a time-dependent external field. Treating the laser as an external field is known to yield expressions for the work which are in contradiction with quantum thermodynamics predictions in the strong-driving regime. We show that these inconsistencies stem from a confusion between the laser and dressed laser, and show how to correct them. We also derive a generalized Bloch master equation, thermodynamically consistent across all driving regimes, from which the Bloch and Floquet master equations can be obtained using additional approximations (of which we also examine the consistency).},

In the present paper we investigate further this platform of quantum-like states. First, we discuss a general protocol on how to construct classical synchronizing networks that allow for emergent states. We then study how gates can be implemented on those states. This suggests the possibility of quantum-like information processing on a special class of many-body classical systems. Finally, we show that our approach allows for non-Kolmogorov interference, a feature that separates our model from a classical probabilistic system. This paper aims to explore the mathematical structure of quantum-like resources distilled from classical synchronizing systems and shows how arbitrary gates can be implemented by manipulating many-body correlations.},

We consider a system of two qubits, each locally dissipating into its own bath while being coupled to a common bath. In this setup, we investigate different scenarios for temperature estimation of both the common and local baths. First, we explore how the precision of a single-qubit probe for estimating the common bath temperature can be enhanced by collective effects arising from the shared bath itself, particularly when the second qubit is in resonance with the probe. Interestingly, we find that the presence of local baths on each qubit can either jeopardize or, if these baths are sufficiently cold, enhance this precision. Next, we demonstrate a remote temperature sensing scheme in which one qubit acts as a probe to estimate the temperature of a local bath affecting the other qubit, by leveraging their indirect interaction through the common bath. This approach enables remote temperature sensing without directly coupling the probe to the target qubit or its local environment, thereby minimizing potential disturbances and practical challenges. Notably, we show that the collective Lamb shift, induced by the common bath, plays a crucial role in enabling remote temperature sensing by generating qubit-qubit correlations, even in the case of noninteracting qubits.},

Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Hence the associated Hamiltonian allows us to straightforwardly determine the self-trapping regime. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson-junction dynamics across its full range and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions. We further find that the off-axis droplets move in the radial direction during the evolution in accordance with the size of the central droplet.

Our system consists of a pair of two-component fermions in three dimensions at infinite scattering length, which furthermore interact with a boson confined in two dimensions so as to form a three-body bound state at zero energy. When another boson is added, the exchange of the resonant pair of fermions between two bosons leads to the semisuper Efimov effect of four such particles with the scaling exponent determined by the mass ratio of bosons to fermions. If bosons exist in three dimensions, an infinite number of bound states do not emerge, but some of them may survive for a large mass ratio, making our findings potentially relevant to two-neutron halo nuclei as well as ultracold atoms.},

Using experimentally available systems as examples, we show that such a system with a two-component Fermi gas exhibits an intrinsic spin Hall effect akin to that found in the context of electronic materials. For a two-component Bose gas, however, an unconventional spin Hall effect emerges in which the spin polarization and the currents are coplanar and the spin Hall conductivity displays a characteristic anisotropy. We propose to detect such an unconventional spin Hall effect in harmonically trapped systems using dipole oscillations and perform extensive numerical simulations to validate the proposal.

While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the BW effect for a single isotope has remained unverified. In this work, we determine the BW effect in H-like, singly ionized, and neutral mercury isotopes from experimental muonic- data together with differential anomalies and our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the measured hyperfine constant for using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously. This result allows for increased precision in calculations of the hyperfine structure and improved tests of atomic and nuclear theory.},

  abstract     = {One of the most striking quantum phenomena is superposition, where one particle simultaneously inhabits different states. Most methods to verify coherent superposition are indirect, in that they require the distinct states to be recombined. Here, we adapt an xor game, in which a “test” photon is placed in a superposition of two orthogonal spatial modes, and each mode is sent to separated parties who perform local measurements on their modes without reinterfering the original modes. We show that by using a second identical “measurement” photon the parties are nonetheless able to verify if the test photon was placed in coherent superposition of the two spatial modes. We then turn this game into a resource-efficient verification scheme, obtaining a confidence that the particle is superposed which approaches unity exponentially fast. We demonstrate our scheme using a single photon, obtaining a 99% confidence that the particle is superposed with only 37 copies.

  abstract     = {Recently, the resource theory of imaginarity has attracted much attention. As with other resources such as quantum correlations, coherence, and asymmetry, an important task in the resource theory of imaginarity is deimaginarity, which is to transform a state into a free state in the resource theory of imaginarity by the random covariant-free unitary operations. Here, we consider an asymptotic limit of infinitely many copies and vanishingly small error, and analyze the deimaginarity cost. We prove that the deimaginarity cost of a state is equal to its regularized relative entropy of imaginarity, which can be seen as an operational interpretation of the relative entropy of imaginarity.},

The intersection curves of these manifolds provide a phase diagram for effective Zeno transitions at small dissipation.

Here, we present a novel approach to investigate the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in a multilayered system, by introducing three-level coherent atomic medium inside a mirror and dielectric slab, causing an optomechanical effect on light incidence. Unlike typical photonic SHE systems that rely on fixed material setup, we demonstrate that photon-phonon coupling in an optomechanical cavity permits dynamic manipulation of the spin-orbit interaction of light. We employ the transfer matrix approach for computing the ratio of reflection coefficients for the TM and TE components, illustrating the manipulation of the transverse shift of reflected light from positive to negative near the Brewster angle. Further, we demonstrate that manipulating important variables such as photon-phonon, atom-photon coupling strengths, and atomic Rabi frequency can impact both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE. This optomechanical interaction has significant advantages over conventional approaches because it allows for real-time tuning of the SHE, increasing its potential for applications in optical sensing, spintronic devices, and quantum information processing. Our findings pave the way for further research into dynamically controlled photonic spin-dependent effects, offering a diverse platform to advance light manipulation.},

Of special interest are schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as the receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of the long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a nonequilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.},

In this work, we present a new analytical solution of the Lindblad master equations for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model and a perturbative analytical solution of the open quantum Rabi model in the limit of weak qubit-boson coupling , using the holomorphic formalism in Bargmann space. Specifically, we derive the most general solution of the local Lindblad master equation for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model coupled to a thermal bath, with the only assumptions that the initial state of the qubit-boson system is separable. Additionally, we obtain a perturbative analytical solution for the open quantum Rabi model up to second order in .

In the framework of the PSHE, we show that spin-orbit interactions cause separation of space across the transverse plane between photons with opposing spins. Our findings reveal that the formation of photonic spin can be tuned across both positive and negative values, depending on the Brewster angle, while varying the magnon-phonon coupling. Notably, we find that in the absence of magnon-phonon coupling, we have magnomechanically induced transparency window at resonance and the PSHE has a higher peak value. Further in the presence of magnon-phonon coupling, the absorption peak occurs at resonance, which leads to a decrease of the PSHE. However, we observe a significant enhancement of the PSHE at two distinct detuning points where light transmission is maximized. Additionally, probe field detuning emerges as a crucial factor in controlling the PSHE. These results suggest that dynamically tuning the coupling between cavity magnons and magnon-phonon modes can greatly enhance the PSHE, presenting new opportunities for advanced nanoscale light manipulation.},

We show that the eight energy levels involved in the optically pumped NV center polarization process can be mapped to a simple pumped two-level-system. We then derive simple analytical expressions for the optical pump threshold condition for masing as well as the steady-state microwave output power which can be used to design and predict maser performance.

  abstract     = {Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) enables the control of light-matter interactions at the single-photon level, rendering it a key component of many quantum technologies. Its practical realization, however, is complex since it involves placing individual quantum emitters close to mirror surfaces within a high-finesse cavity. In this work, we propose a cavity QED architecture fully based on atoms trapped in free space. In particular, we show that a pair of two-dimensional, ordered arrays of atoms can be described by conventional cavity QED parameters. Such an atom-array cavity exhibits the same cooperativity as a conventional counterpart with matching mirror specifications even though the cavity coupling strength and decay rate are modified by the narrow bandwidth of the atoms. We estimate that an array cavity composed of atoms in an optical lattice can reach a cooperativity of about 10. This value can be increased suppressing atomic motion with larger trap depths and may exceed with an ideal placement of the atoms. To reduce the experimental complexity of our scheme, we propose a spatially dependent ac Stark shift as an alternative to curving the arrays, which may be of independent interest. In addition to presenting a promising platform for cavity QED, our work creates opportunities for exploring novel phenomena based on the intrinsic nonlinearity of atom arrays and the possibility to dynamically control them.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity scheme for generating entangled states in a system of two and three giant atoms coupled to the coupled resonator waveguide. Our approach leverages the bound state in the continuum, which is robust against waveguide disorder. Specifically, we achieve a fidelity exceeding for Bell state generation, overcoming the limitations of conventional decoherence-free interaction mechanisms. This scheme can be readily extended to a three-giant-atom system for generating states. In both the two- and three-atom setups, the maximally entangled states are generated in a short time and remain stable even as time approaches infinity. Our proposal is feasible for implementation on state-of-the-art solid-state quantum platforms and significantly broadens the applications of giant atoms and waveguide QED systems in quantum information processing.},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamics of two giant atoms interacting with a coupled resonator waveguide (CRW) beyond the Markovian approximation. The distinct atomic configurations determine the number of bound states in the continuum (BICs), leading to different dynamical behaviors. Our results show that when the system supports two BICs, Rabi oscillations dominate the dynamics, whereas fractional population dynamics emerge in the presence of a single BIC. The connection between these dynamics and the existence of BICs is further verified by analyzing the photonic distribution in the CRW during time evolution. These findings challenge the conventional notion that the environment always induces dissipation and decoherence. Instead, the bound states in the CRW-emitter coupled system can suppress complete dissipation of the emitters. We also quantitatively illustrate the memory effect of the waveguide, which serves as the environment of the giant-atom feature that can only be captured within our non-Markovian treatment. This work offers an effective approach for controlling dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems.},

Linear Ramsey interferometer is widely employed for measuring physical quantities, enhancing quantum metrology even approaching the Heisenberg limit. However, the linear interferometer is notably susceptible to detection noise, which limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose an extended SU(1, 1) echo method to realize a generalized nonlinear interferometer, which is resilient to the detection noise. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two distinct models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and spin-mixing dynamics. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. Additionally, we identify a trade-off in selecting the echoing conditions, which can be utilized to further enhance estimation precision. Our proposal may be easily implemented in many platforms, such as Bose-Einstein condensate, Rydberg atoms, and polar molecules, to enhance the metrology of time and field strength.},

Moreover, the method simplifies the calculation of the joint differential cross section for multiple scattering scenarios and provides a means to characterize the polarization properties of the individual subsystems.

In this study, we propose a one-dimensional cross-stitch ladder lattice featuring both a dispersive band and a flat band. By modulating the relative phase between the coupling points, the giant atom selectively interacts with either band. First, we analyze the scenario where the dispersive and flat bands intersect at two points, and the atomic frequency lies within the band. Unlike the small atom, which simultaneously interacts with both bands, a single giant atom with a controllable phase interacts exclusively with the dispersive or flat band. Second, in the band-gap regime, where two atoms interact through bound-state overlaps manifesting as dipole-dipole interactions, we demonstrate that giant atoms enable deterministic long-range hopping and energy exchange with higher fidelity than small atoms. These findings provide promising applications in quantum information processing, offering enhanced controllability and selectivity for quantum systems and devices.},

Cavity modes lead to larger coupling strength than that of the normally assumed thermal vacuum, and thus higher generation rates are expected. Unlike approaches that have emerged so far, this paper presents an approach based on the solution of the master equation. This method allows us to investigate the photon statistics more strictly, and we show that the choices of pumping detuning and leaking rate of the cavities significantly affect the degree of the autocorrelation, and a higher-purity heralded single photon source is possible. We also derive a concise expression for the output state and the generation rate for the extreme cases where the cavity leaking rate is much smaller or larger than the rate of spontaneous emission.},

We show that the fidelity and gain of the amplification schemes for HESs are the same as those of coherent states. However, SCSs show quite nontrivial behavior by the amplification schemes, depending on the amplitudes of coherent states, the number of coherent-state components, and the relative phases between the components. This implies that appropriate amplification schemes for SCSs should be chosen depending on the tasks and specific forms of the states. To investigate the quality of amplified states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information, a measure of quantum phase estimation. In terms of the quantum Fisher information, the scheme tends to show better performance for relatively small amplitudes ( ), while the scheme is better in the larger amplitude regime.

Depending on the intended application, these devices can split incident light according to its power, polarization state, or wavelength. In this work, we theoretically present a type of beam splitter capable of separating a light beam into its two-mode bright and dark components. We propose a prototype based on an optical cross-cavity system resonantly coupled to a -type three-level atom. The dark component of the incoming light is transmitted because the antisymmetric collective mode of the cavity setup is decoupled from the atom. Meanwhile, the bright component is reflected due to a quantum interference, which arises from the high cooperativity between the atom and the symmetric collective mode of the cavity setup. Although the device requires only a two-level atom to operate, using a three-level atom allows the device to be turned on or off by controlling the atomic ground states. Our results pave the way for applications of beam splitters that leverage the collective properties of light. Manipulating and exploiting this additional degree of freedom can advance the field of quantum optics and contribute to the development of quantum technologies.},

The elliptical STOVs differ from standard STOVs in an additional spatial chirp that is manifested as a wave front temporal rotation, and results in an enhanced transverse orbital angular momentum. The longitudinal field is significantly larger than that of normal STOVs, and may also take the form of an elliptical STOV.

However, since its extension to inhomogeneous and nonlinear systems is not straightforward, much more computationally demanding methods such as finite difference time domain or method of lines are typically used. In this paper, we extend the TMM framework to incorporate the effects of nonlinearity. We consider the case where strong coupling between excitons (electron-hole pairs) and photons leads to the formation of exciton polaritons. This extension is crucial for accurately simulating the behavior of light in polariton microcavities, where nonlinearities arising from exciton-exciton interactions play a key role. We perform efficient simulations of light transmission and reflection in a multidimensional system using the plane-wave basis. Additionally, we compare our extended TMM approach with the state-of-the-art admittance transfer method, and highlight the computational advantage of extended TMM for large-scale systems. The extended TMM not only provides a robust and computationally efficient numerical framework, but also paves the way for the development of future low-power nonlinear optical devices, polariton-based photonic circuits, and quantum photonic technologies.},

The real-time spectrum evolution of bound-state solitons was measured using the time-stretched dispersion Fourier transform technique, confirming the existence of in-phase and out-of-phase period-doubling mechanisms in bound-state solitons. This study provides deeper insight into the complex dynamics of solitons in fiber lasers and contributes to the stability analysis of nonlinear systems and the detection of small signals.},

  abstract     = {The pulsed driving of passive fiber Kerr resonators is an effective approach to generating coherent optical soliton combs with high efficiency. Desynchronization, which is defined as the frequency mismatch between the pumping pulse repetition rate and the cavity round-trip time, is an additional system variable, making the nonlinear system of fiber resonators more complex. Research on the relevant physics of desynchronization is not yet comprehensive. In this article, the complex dynamics of Kerr cavity solitons in a pulsed-pumped normal dispersion fiber Kerr resonator with third-order dispersion (TOD) and desynchronization is studied in simulations. We find that the desynchronization effect plays a critical role in the formation of Kerr cavity solitons. Interestingly, the introduction of desynchronization leads to the formation of breathing Kerr cavity solitons before the onset of stable operation of Kerr cavity solitons. The competition and balance between TOD and desynchronization determine the behavior of Kerr cavity solitons. Without TOD, a strong desynchronization effect results in a breathing state with a sliding shift of pulse peak position. In contrast, a slight desynchronization effect causes the periodic oscillation of pulse peak power without changing the pulse location. The breathing period depends on the absolute value of desynchronization coefficient and the sliding direction is related to the sign of the desynchronization coefficient. Furthermore, a reversible switching between different nonlinear Kerr cavity soliton states is achieved by changing the degree of desynchronization, suggesting that the desynchronization can be used as an additional degree of freedom to control the Kerr cavity soliton dynamics in Kerr resonators. These findings enrich our understanding of Kerr cavity solitons and provide important references for improving the stability of Kerr cavity solitons and the application of efficient resonator frequency combs.},

These two-body edge BICs show remarkable robustness in the presence of disorder. We then discuss how intensity correlations can capture the dynamics of two identical fermions for which BICs do not exist on the same edge of the lattice. The localization of intensity correlation, observed in the linear regime, persists at weak nonlinearity due to the formation of long-lived edge breathers : spatially localized nonlinear states with oscillating intensity along the propagation distance. For stronger nonlinearities, localized edge states are not formed for a range of phases, destroying the localization of the intensity correlation. Our results highlight the interplay of band structure, initial state, and nonlinearity influencing transport and intensity correlations.},

We found that as for the SVS, small spatial chirp induces breathing behavior, while large spatial chirp leads to chaotic self-trapped behavior. This chaotic self-trapped behavior exhibits both chaotic property and trapping property. The transition between these two behaviors can be achieved by varying the magnitude of the spatial chirp. As for the VVS, small spatial chirp induces an asynchronous or synchronous breather-breather pair under short-range interaction. As spatial chirp increases, chaos-chaoticon, entangled and nonentangled chaoticon-chaoticon, and chaoticon-quasisoliton pairs are formed. By adjusting the spatial chirp, we achieve controllable conversion between soliton, breather, chaos, chaoticon, and quasisoliton.

In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.},

Here, in-depth analysis has been conducted on a multilayered structure that is enhanced by the presence of plasmonic antennae. These antennae are strategically placed to optimize the interaction with light, potentially improving the performance of the structure in various applications. The hybrid waveguide resonance mode, generated by combining the surface-plasmon polariton with waveguide modes and activated by the antenna modes, characterizes the multilayer. The antennae aid in hybridizing waveguide and surface-plasmon modes; in turn, the multilayer structure enhances near-field intensity and allows for tuning far-field responses through multiple resonances. The interaction between antennae is characterized by dark and bright modes, which can create bound states in the continuum because of destructive interference in radiation losses. The nonconservative nature of the open system enables exploration of non-Hermitian properties, complex topology, and exceptional points. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results enable the study of the system's behavior, and display that exceptional points significantly boost emission levels when measurements are taken in their vicinity. In conclusion, systems with hybrid architecture and including plasmonic antennae can provide enhanced sensitivity and demonstrate their potential value across a diverse array of applications. These include advanced sensing technologies and innovative communication systems, where the complete density matrix can be simplified, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian frames can be utilized to explore entanglement dynamics and analyze systems much larger than feasible.},

In this paper, we propose a scheme to enhance and control the detection bandwidth in optomechanical force sensing by exploiting synthetic magnetism achieved through tuning phonon-hopping interactions. By toggling between broken and unbroken dark mode, this approach effectively manages the response bandwidth and exhibits intriguing additional noise characteristics. Specifically, when the dark mode remains unbroken, the thermal noise is robust and reduced to half of that of a standard device. In contrast, when the dark mode is broken, thermal noise increases substantially at mechanical resonance but remains the same as when the dark mode is unbroken at effective detection frequencies. Moreover, our scheme offers the dual benefit of amplifying the mechanical response while suppressing additional noise, with the potential to surpass the standard quantum limit.},

  abstract     = {We describe the theory of focusing waves to a predefined focal point deep inside a disordered three-dimensional (3D) opaque medium by the shaping of different field sources outside the medium, also known as wavefront shaping. Our study is motivated by recent experiments where wavefront shaping, mediated by the controlled interference of scattered waves, coexists with a classical diffusion picture where wave interference appears irrelevant. We derive the energy density of the wave field both near the focal point and anywhere else inside the medium, averaged over realizations after optimizing the focus. To this end, we conceive of a point source at the focal point inside that emits waves to an external detector array that—by time reversal—becomes a source array that emits the desired shaped fields like a spatial light modulator. In this picture, the average energy density including the focusing is described by the , and even intensity correlations known from mesoscopic transport theory. We draw the remarkable conclusion that by averaging over optimized wavefronts of the array, associated with different realizations of the disorder, a background energy density is obtained that obeys a diffusion equation in which correlations create an energy source inside. Hence a classical property (diffusion) coexists with interference ( correlations). We derive the peak and background energy density distributions for , and correlations, including for a slab. We find that the relative enhancement of the energy density at the focal point is proportional to the angular opening of the array, which de facto replaces the role of the inverse dimensionless conductance as the universal parameter in the transmission statistics, and it generalizes the number of segments known from experiments. We exploit the concept of a source for “optimized background energy” inside the medium to compare several different energy density profiles proposed in the literature, which are associated with optimized transmission by a slab using wavefront shaping. We explain why the best matching models have the first diffusion mode dominating, as was found in earlier work. Our approach avoids random-matrix theory restricted to waveguide geometries, confirms the role non-Gaussian correlations in the wavefront shaping for focusing deep inside 3D random media, and highlights the notion of an energy source created in this process. Our results are relevant for applications where the internal energy density in opaque media is crucial, varying from white-light illumination, projection optics, semiconductor metrology, (bio)sensing, to photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Metallic nanoparticles, frequently applied to improve the efficiency or sensitivity of various antenna-reactor systems, utilize the plasmonic effect due to the unusual ability of plasmons to transmit energy at the nanoscale. The absorption and emission of light by plasmons are especially high in metallic nanoscale clusters with 10 7 − 10 electrons, but not in small clusters with a lower number of electrons. We demonstrate that the exceptional properties of plasmons at the nanoscale are conditioned by a large anharmonicity of plasmon oscillations induced by strong Lorentz friction, which significantly deviates local charge oscillations from the harmonic regime in this scale of metal spatial confinement. Due to this anharmonicity, plasmons can maintain their oscillations despite strong damping associated with efficient energy transfer, even when such large damping would cause a harmonic oscillator to become overdamped and stop. We also identify a sum-rule-type formula for plasmon polaritons in metallic nanochains arising from the anharmonicity of plasmons.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical backaction cooling has been demonstrated to be a successful method for achieving the motional quantum ground state of a mechanical oscillator in the resolved-sideband regime, where the mechanical frequency is significantly larger than the cavity decay rate. Nevertheless, as mechanical systems increase in size, their frequencies naturally decrease, thus bringing them into the unresolved-sideband regime, where the effectiveness of the sideband cooling approach decreases. Here we demonstrate, however, that this cooling technique in the unresolved-sideband regime can be significantly enhanced by utilizing a nonlinear cavity as shown in the experimental work of Zoepfl et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 , 033601 (2023) ]. The above arises due to the increased asymmetry between the cooling and heating processes, thereby improving the cooling efficiency. In addition, we show that injecting a squeezed vacuum into the nonlinear cavity paves the way to ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode. Notably, the required squeezing parameters are far less stringent than in the linear case, simplifying experimental implementation.},

Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium, and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous-wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second- and third-order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.},

In this case, the optima for the generation of the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth harmonics of the field correspond to three-, four-, five-, and six-photon resonances, and the optimal value of the peak field intensity, depending on the harmonic order, varies from to . The total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom at the end of a laser pulse under corresponding conditions exceeds 1/2. With such intensity and not-too-high frequency of the laser field, the Stark effect turns out to be very significant, which allows it to be tuned in resonance with an arbitrary excited state of the atom by changing the intensity of the field without changing its frequency. It is shown that for the laser field parameters maximizing the energy of the harmonic, 3 ≤ ≤ 9, this harmonic dominates in the dipole acceleration spectrum. At the same time, the amplitudes of the remaining harmonics increase as the harmonic order approaches . In particular, under the conditions maximizing the yield of the ninth harmonic, the harmonic amplitudes increase when moving from the third harmonic to the fifth and then to the seventh and ninth harmonics, and the harmonics form an attosecond pulse train. At the same time, under the conditions maximizing the yield of the third harmonic, its amplitude in the dipole acceleration spectrum exceeds not only the amplitudes of the other harmonics, but also the amplitude of the atomic response at the frequency of the driving field.},

Non-Hermiticity is introduced via the phase coupling φ between the atom and the optical field. In the thermodynamic limit of the quantum harmonic oscillator, we analytically derive the superradiance phase boundary, validated by observables. An unconventional quantum phase transition without a Hermitian analog arises when | φ | = π 4 or 3 π 4 , where the phase boundary is uniquely determined by the cavity coupling, at J = 1 2 ( J is the ratio of the cavity coupling strength J to the optical field frequency ω p , and J = J ω p ), independent of the atom-photon coupling strength g . For other φ , the phase boundary relies on both J and g , similar to the scenario observed in Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we identify phase-driven first- and second-order superradiance phase transitions, focusing on the quantum criticality of the second-order transition by determining the critical exponents and the universality class. The feasibility of experimental realization is also discussed, aiming to inspire further studies on non-Hermitian superradiance quantum phase transitions.},

Subsequently, the same procedure was applied after reversing the signs of both interactions to evaluate the sensitivity of vortex formation to such an interchange of interactions. As a reference to guide our investigation, valid for generic dipolar atomic species, we have assumed a condensate with the strong dipolar dysprosium isotope, . The correlation of the results with other dipolar BEC systems was exemplified by considering rotating BECs with two other isotopes, namely and . For a purely dipolar condensate (no contact interactions) under fixed rotation, we show how the number of visible vortices increases as the DDI becomes more repulsive, accomplished by tuning the orientation of the dipoles through a characteristic angle parameter.},

Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave-packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.},

  abstract     = {SO(2,1) dynamical symmetry makes a remarkable prediction that the breathing oscillation of a scale-invariant quantum gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is isentropic and can persist indefinitely. In two dimensions, this symmetry is broken due to quantum anomaly in the strongly interacting range, and consequently the lifetime of the breathing mode becomes finite. The persistent breather in a strongly interacting system has so far not been realized. Here, we experimentally achieve the long-lived breathing mode in a three-dimensional unitary Fermi gas, which is protected by the SO(2,1) symmetry. The nearly perfect SO(2,1) symmetry is realized by loading the ultracold Fermi gas in an isotropic trap and tuning the interatomic interaction to resonance. The breathing mode oscillates at twice the trapping frequency even for large excitation amplitudes. The ratio of damping rate to oscillation frequency is as small as 0.002, providing an interacting persistent breather. The oscillation frequency and damping rate are nearly constant for different atomic densities and temperatures, demonstrating the robustness of the SO(2,1) symmetry in three dimensions. The factors that lead to the residual damping have also been clarified. This work opens the way to study many-body nonequilibrium dynamics related to the dynamical symmetry.},

We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wave functions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the gap ( being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.},

  abstract     = {Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) changes the Fermi surface and creates topological states with non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. However, it also drastically suppresses the Cooper pairing with finite momentum and thus the coexistence of Majorana zero modes and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is still challenging to be observed. In this work we introduce more complex interactions to the platform and investigate the unconventional superfluidity of a dipolar fermionic gas in a biwire configuration with the SOC induced by laser-assisted interwire tunneling. Employing a nonlocal self-consistent Bogoliubov–de Gennes formalism, we reveal a complex phase diagram featuring various topological-superfluid phases. In particular, due to the peculiar competition between the long-range dipolar interaction and the SOC, a phase separation structure emerges, exhibiting a stripe FFLO phase core encompassed by the topological-superfluid states. Moreover, the long-range dipolar interaction induces a remarkable oscillatory structure in the resultant Majorana zero modes at the FFLO phase boundary and enables direct manipulation of these zero modes. Finally, we provide an experimental proposal to realize our system and give the method to detect the novel quantum phase. The discovery of the Majorana zero modes at the interface between the FFLO state and the topological phase, along with their unique properties, deepens our understanding of Majorana fermions and enriches the zoo of Majorana quasiparticles.},

It is shown that retarded Green's functions, as opposed to ordinary spin-spin correlators considered previously, convincingly distinguish between the GGE and thermal postquench steady states, justifying the assumption of convergence towards the GGE as the system equilibrates. We also propose the experimental protocol for measuring response functions with Ramsey interferometry, which can be used to distinguish between different postquench phases of the model.

By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches 0. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.},

Under the biorthogonal basis, the pumping is dictated by a Chern number of the Hermitian RM model. This can be verified by experiments where both the non-Hermitian RM model and its Hermitian conjugation are realized. Under the right-right vector basis, which is relevant to experiments where only the non-Hermitian one is required, we find that the charge pumping contains a dynamical and a topological part.

Tuning the impurity-boson mass ratio allows for the exploration of the transition from a spontaneous to an explicit breaking of the continuous rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We compare the minimum of the Higgs-Anderson-like mode as a marker of the onset of localization in the few-body limit to mean-field predictions of binding.

We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench.

This information can be used to estimate the superfluid fraction. We validate our linear-response theory against nonlinear mean-field simulations of the dynamics for ring, box, and harmonically trapped cases. A key focus is the behavior at the band edge—the regime occurring when the optical potential used to excite the system has a wavelength that is twice the value of the supersolid lattice constant. Here symmetry can be used to selectively excite a mode from one of the two low-energy gapless excitation bands. We also consider the application of the spectroscopy protocols to determine the superfluid fraction, showing the relationship to hydrodynamic theory and a Josephson-junction array model.

Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic and nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo amplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.},

Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by nonlinearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the , and series with principal quantum number as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light–Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess nontrivial position-dependent forces.},

The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of hydro-halide molecules, using two consecutive UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the acceleration lasers. We show how elastic collisions define number density and polarization P regimes for the prepolarized targets, and use particle-in-cell simulations to demonstrate the method's feasibility.},

The time-dependent wave function of the excited system includes bound- and continuum-eigenstate components of the field-free Hamiltonian. Here, we study the relation between the average kinetic energy and potential energy of the bound wave packet composed of coherent superposition of higher bound eigenstates. Our simulations show that around the peak time of the laser field at which the tunneling effect is strong, the bound wave packet still approximately agrees with the virial theorem, which reflects the Coulomb-related spatial symmetry of the system. Our results indicate that during the laser-induced exciting process, the system tends to keep its symmetry before ionization. This observation also holds for small molecules. It gives suggestions on analytically constructing Coulomb-included strong-field models.},

  abstract     = {We study polarization effects in photoionization of achiral matter and report on two types of circular dichroism driven by a pair of time-delayed copropagating broadband pulses. Both being of interferometric nature, they manifest in the photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) and vanish for fully time overlapping pulses having the same carrier-envelope phase. The first type, called atomic interferometric circular dichroism (AICD), is demonstrated in photoionization of the H atom or aligned along the pulse propagation direction . It is shown to be directly visualized through mirroring effects from two key interferograms created in the PMD within two polarization schemes: (i) spiral patterns produced by a pair of counterrotating circularly polarized pulses and (ii) tuning-fork-like patterns driven by linearly and circularly polarized pulses. The second type is dubbed molecular interferometric circular dichroism (MICD) as it occurs in molecular photoionization within the configuration . However, while the MICD occurs in polarization scheme (i), it is shown to interplay with the molecular-symmetry-mixed dichroism [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 123 , 143202 (2019) ] in scheme (ii). Switching the helicities or ordering of the two pulses is shown to be consistent with time-reversal symmetry, except when in scheme (ii). Exhibiting an inversion symmetry, characteristic of unpolarized targets, the manifestation of the AICD and MICD in the PMD can serve as target chirality identification in life and chemical science. Our predictions based on nonstationary quantum-mechanical calculations are within the reach of current attosecond or femtosecond laser technology, making this study timely for experimental verification.},

Here, we apply the reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT) technique to directly characterize correlation-driven effects in sequential DI of helium with attosecond resolution. We uncover a previously unobserved scattering phase shift, sensitive to the kinetic energy difference between the two released electrons, corresponding to a time delay of the order of as. Moreover, when the DI pathway proceeds via a doubly excited state, Fano resonances introduce nontrivial phase shifts for both the first electron and its correlated partner. By extracting joint angular distributions at each sideband energy, we provide an intuitive picture to understand these correlation-driven effects. Our findings provide direct, time-resolved insights into electron-electron interactions in DI, demonstrating the power of attosecond chronoscopy in unraveling electron-electron interactions on their natural timescale.},

Previous research has shown that spectral peaks in above-threshold ionization shift with changes in the opening angle and orbital angular momentum of Bessel pulse. However, the precise impact and sensitivity of these parameters on photoelectron momentum distributions (PMD) is still unclear. In this paper, we use the strong-field approximation and saddle-point method to analytically derive the ionization transition amplitude for these pulses. For computational simplicity, we model the atomic target using a hydrogenic orbital wave function, with parameters adapted for krypton to capture the essential ionization dynamics. This allows us to compute the PMD while resolving the effects of both the opening angle and orbital angular momentum.},

As a reference for comparison we use the orientation dependence of the static-field tunneling rate. Numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for ionization of the ground and first excited states of a model molecule show that linearly or circularly polarized single-color pulses are of limited use for obtaining the orientation-dependent rate accurately. By adding a second harmonic with suitable polarization, i.e., using either linearly polarized two-color fields or counterrotating circularly polarized two-color fields, the agreement of the extracted signal with the exact tunneling rate is substantially improved.},

Photoelectron holographic (PH) interference in tunneling ionization has become one of the research hotspots in strong-field physics. We investigate the interference structure of an Ar atom in orthogonally polarized laser pulses by the quantum-trajectory Monte Carlo (QTMC) model. The results show the “inner spider” holographic interference structure and above-threshold ionization (ATI) ring interference structure in photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) of the Ar atom at Δ t = 0 . However, as the time delay increases, the interference structure gradually becomes distorted until it is completely destroyed. We find that the interference structure at the PMDs center can only be identified clearly when the time delay has three or fewer optical periods, which indicates that the stability and observability of the interference structure are closely related to the number of periods of the selected time delay. By tracing the trajectories of ionized electrons, we find that the quadrant of the final position of the ionized electron trajectory is consistent with the quadrant of the PMDs for this time window. Furthermore, we find that the inner spider structure disappears when the Coulomb potential is ignored, which is due to the Coulomb focusing effect by analyzing the emission angle of the ionized electrons.},

Accordingly, measured yields of photoproducts were normalized to theory to obtain absolute cross sections . Aside from direct single ionization, there are additional contributions to from photoabsorption resonances. The parameters of the Fano profile of the most prominent of these resonances, the triply excited state, were calculated by employing the convergent close coupling (CCC) approach and the theoretical results were experimentally verified. Using the normalization procedure obtained from the investigation of single ionization, also the measured yields of product ions could be put on an absolute cross-section scale. The resulting experimental cross section is in good accord with the CCC calculations revealing unexpectedly strong contributions that arise from ionization with excitation of forming intermediate autoionizing levels, which subsequently decay to by Auger-electron emission. In addition, contributions to from resonant excitation of with could be identified.

Moreover, the kinetic energy of the fragments relative to the emission angles provides valuable insights into how the motion of the proton affects the energy distribution between ions. We also performed ab initio calculations to track the real-time movements of the four fragments. The simulations reveal the influence of fast-moving protons on the comparatively slow fragmentation process of ions.

  abstract     = {Above-threshold detachment of electrons from negative ions by a strong low-frequency elliptically polarized laser field is considered using the strong-field approximation. The detachment probability amplitude is expressed via integral over times of highly oscillatory functions. Particular attention is devoted to application of the asymptotic methods to solve these integrals. For the direct detachment only the integral over the detachment time appears, while for the high-order above-threshold detachment the double integral over the detachment and rescattering times should be solved. Depending on the ellipticity of the laser field, a critical photoelectron energy exists for which the standard saddle-point method fails. The problem can be solved by properly deforming the integration contour in the complex time plane and, for energies higher than this critical energy, taking into account only one of the two saddle-point solutions. However, this procedure still leaves a spike in the photoelectron spectrum near this critical energy. This problem is cured applying the uniform approximation. A formula for the transition amplitude in the uniform approximation is derived, and it is shown how this formula should be modified for the energies higher than the critical one. For high-order above-threshold detachment many more saddle-point solutions contribute. They are classified into pairs. For the saddle-point method each pair produces a spike in the spectrum which spoils the total spectrum. When the contribution of each pair is treated using the uniform approximation with a careful choice of the phase factors after the anti-Stokes transition the agreement with the exact numerical results becomes excellent.},

  abstract     = {We numerically integrate the Schrödinger equation for a model helium atom irradiated by an intense few-cycle laser pulse and find the emitted XUV spectra. They demonstrate resonant Fano peaks at the frequencies of the transitions from the doubly excited autoionizing states (AISs) to the ground state. Studying XUV intensity and phase, we show that the resonant peak should be described with an essentially complex asymmetry parameter. The Stark shift of the AIS and the decay of the AIS due to photoionization by the laser field result in the asymmetry parameter describing a spiral path in the complex plane when the laser pulse duration increases. This behavior, in particular, corresponds to the decrease of the resonant contribution with the increase of the laser pulse duration, in agreement with published experimental data. Moreover, we find a remarkable similarity of this behavior of the asymmetry parameter in the complex plane to that of the classical double pendulum. We conclude that transient perturbation of the natural frequency and friction in the upper pendulum can be treated as a classical analogy of the transient frequency shift and extra depopulation of the excited state in the quantum system demonstrating the Fano resonance.},

Past versions of the device utilizing continuous-wave optical pumping are sensitive to rotation and anomalous spin couplings along a single axis perpendicular to the plane spanned by the orthogonal pump and probe laser beams. These devices are susceptible to light shifts in the alkali atoms, and to power and beam pointing fluctuations of both the probe and pump lasers, the latter of which is a dominant source of noise. In this work, we model and implement an approach to alkali-metal–noble-gas comagnetometers using pulsed optical pumping. After each pump laser pulse, an off-resonance probe beam measures the precession of noble-gas-spins-coupled alkali spins via optical rotation in the dark, thus eliminating effects from pump laser light shift and power fluctuations. Performing nonlinear fitting on the sinusoidal transient signal with a proper phase enables independent and simultaneous measurement of signals along two orthogonal axes in the plane perpendicular to the pump beam. Effects from beam pointing fluctuations of the probe beam in the pump-probe plane are fundamentally eliminated, and signal response to pump beam pointing fluctuations is suppressed by compensation from noble-gas nuclear spins.},

  abstract     = {Multielectron polarization (MEP) has been identified as an essential factor that must be considered for understanding nonlinear effects resulting from interactions of intense lasers with highly polarizable targets. While recent studies have mostly focused on intensity modulation induced by MEP in high-order harmonic generation (HHG), this work explores a significant MEP effect on another critical HHG feature: harmonic frequency. In particular, we discover MEP-induced frequency shifts up to 0.8 order (1.24 eV) for harmonics in the cutoff region when a polar molecule CO interacts with a few-cycle laser pulse. These frequency shifts are clarified through their relationship with the MEP-induced phase changes of attosecond bursts and then validated numerically by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Moreover, we also verify them with available experimental data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the universality of these frequency shifts regardless of varying laser parameters. Importantly, we find a close connection between the MEP-induced harmonic frequency shift discovered in this study and MEP-induced intensity modulation of odd-even HHG reported previously. We claim that they are the two manifestations of the MEP effect on HHG, both stemming from the distortion of the phase difference between the two adjacent attosecond bursts. This comprehensive understanding of the MEP effect on HHG from polar molecules is significant for characterizing intrinsic molecular properties and probing molecular dynamics from HHG.},

We start with the Ps- scattering calculations which take into account electron exchange and correlations within the framework of the free-electron-gas model. The calculations reveal several resonances. Similar to the process of dissociative electron attachment, a resonance contributes to the dissociative Ps attachment at thermal energies. We determine the resonance position and width as functions of the internuclear separation and use them as inputs for the local version of the quasiclassical theory of dissociative attachment.

The accuracy of the PWIA was examined by comparing with a spectroscopic factor ratio predicted by a theoretical electronic structure study as well as those by the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) model and the two Coulomb waves with variable charge (2CWZ) model in which the exchange interaction is not included but the two outgoing electrons are both described by a Coulomb wave with . The DWBA result has been found to be in good agreement with the experiment and the theoretical prediction regarding the spectroscopic factor ratio over the covered range. On the other hand, it has been found that the PWIA and 2CWZ results both reveal almost the same, but an unacceptable, deviation from the theoretical prediction. Furthermore, the deviation has been found to become smaller with the increase in . These observations clearly not only indicate the need of improvement of the PWIA model, but also state that the spectroscopic factor ratio is suited for stringently testing a theoretical scattering model for the reaction at large momentum transfer.},

  abstract     = {Electron spin polarization in an intense laser field presents a promising avenue for generating highly polarized high-energy electron sources. In this study, we investigate numerically the spin polarization dynamics of an electron in a rotating laser field with a frequency chirp. We consider a standing wave formed by two counterpropagating chirped laser pulses, which have different chirp modes: linear and time-reversed chirp. Our results reveal that the frequency chirp breaks the time symmetry of the field, thereby altering the laser-electron interaction dynamics. Consequently, an electron can gain more net energy from a chirped laser field through optimal phase synchronization between the electron and the laser field. This results in a higher electron quantum parameter and an increased photon emission probability. As a result, the probability of spin flip for an electron during radiation in the magnetic node plane is enhanced, leading to improved electron polarization efficiency. We also find that the polarization degree is highly sensitive to the chirp parameter, and we identify an optimal chirp value that maximizes the polarization degree. By applying this optimal chirp parameter in the time-reversed chirped case, the electron's relative polarization can be enhanced by and reach its maximum value of approximately .},

A 105 , 062818 (2022) ] to study differential ionization of atomic helium under proton impact is extended to take account of electron capture into the continuum (ECC). In our fully quantum approach, the original four-body proton-helium scattering problem is reduced to finding the continuum state of the Coulomb three-body system ; this is accomplished by representing the required wave function in a basis of CQS functions whose asymptotic behavior corresponds to the ionization dynamics. Contrary to the original CQS approach that uses a basis set suitable for describing the two subsystems and , an appropriate set of Jacobi coordinates allows us to construct CQS functions corresponding to the continuous spectrum of the pair . The extraction of the ionization amplitude from the three-body wave function maintains a closed form character. The extension of the model space by including new basis functions makes it possible to adequately describe the ECC ionization mechanism. Calculations using these CQS functions are presented for 75-keV proton-impact ionization of atomic helium, and for ejected electrons with a velocity far from that of the projectile. Comparison is made with fully differential cross sections (FDCS), measured recently on an absolute scale [Majumdar et al. , Phys. Rev.

Scattering by hydrogenlike, iron, silver, and golden targets is considered. The incident electron carries a nonzero orbital angular momentum, while sLG and eLG packets have a definite radial quantum number as well. In the scattering of sLG and eLG wave packets by a macroscopic target, sensitivity of the average cross section to the orbital angular momentum is observed, which is absent for BG packets. We discuss the potential experimental realization of vortex-electron wave packets of these three types. The distinguishing features in the scattering results can be employed for imaging purposes and revelation of the packet properties in experiments.},

Here we study the stability required in order to measure this polarization dependence in a head-on collision between a high-power linearly polarized laser and a relativistic electron beam, where the rays produced via nonlinear Compton scattering are highly polarized. We find that the laser strength parameter has to be known to within a few percent and that the alignment of the laser and electron beam cannot fluctuate by more than half the spot size in order to attribute the reduction in positron yield to polarization effects. These collision parameters are difficult to achieve, but may be realized in future precision experiments that focus on beam stability.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear spin dynamics are essential in exploring nonequilibrium quantum phenomena and have broad applications in precision measurement. Among these systems, the combination of a bias magnetic field and feedback mechanisms can induce self-sustained oscillations at the base Larmor frequency due to nonlinearity. These features have driven the development of single-species and multiple-species spin masers. The latter, with multiple discrete Larmor frequencies, provides significant advantages for precision measurement by mitigating uncertainties in precession frequencies due to long-term drifts in experimental conditions. The self-sustained oscillations of single-species and multiple-species spin masers correspond to limit cycles and quasi-periodic orbits of the stable nonlinear dynamics of the systems, respectively; the correspondence is elucidated in a recent study on a related spin system featuring two discrete intrinsic Larmor frequencies under dual bias magnetic fields [T. Wang et al. , Commun. Phys. 8 , 41 (2025) ]. Here, we extend the study to the case where the intrinsic Larmor frequencies of individual spins of the system, given rise to by an inhomogeneous bias magnetic field, form a continuum. We show that generically the stable dynamics of the system includes limit cycles, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaos. We establish the relation between the synchronization frequency of limit cycles and the field inhomogeneity and derive an equation determining the stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, detailed characteristics of different dynamical phases, especially the robustness of limit cycles and quasi-periodic orbits against experimental fluctuations, are discussed. Our findings not only encompass the case of discrete Larmor frequencies, but also provide crucial insights for precision measurement and the exploration of continuous time crystals and quasi-crystals.},

It is found that inclusion of the relaxation effects in the time delay difference between Ar and photoionization near the CM dramatically alters the time delay and brings the theory into substantial agreement with experiment using the relativistic-random-phase approximation with relaxation. The key point is that photoionization is dominated by interchannel coupling in this region and the interchannel coupling matrix elements were found to be considerably altered by the inclusion of relaxation. This implies that relaxation should be important for any atomic or molecular transition that is dominated by interchannel coupling.},

The potential is decomposed into two components: the correlation-polarization (CP) potential, derived from perturbation theory for the positron-hydrogen system and generalized for other atoms, and the virtual positronium (VPs) potential. The VPs potential is modeled as a short-ranged attractive term based on the CP component but shifted toward the atom's vicinity, with its strength controlled by a semiempirical parameter fine tuned to match the scattering length to reference values. Our results show that the inclusion of the VPs term is essential for reproducing experimental measurements and results from other theoretical models for both integrated and differential cross sections.},

In this study, we conduct systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the x-ray-absorption spectra of , CN, and . Our findings provide valuable references for both x-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We assign the first electronic peak of and CN to transitions, while the peak for corresponds to a transition. We explain that the twofold degeneracy ( and ) of the transitions results in exhibiting a significantly stronger first absorption compared to the other two systems. We further calculate the vibronic fine structures for these transitions using the quantum wave-packet method based on multiconfigurational-level, anharmonic potential-energy curves, revealing distinct energy positions for the 0–0 absorptions at 280.7, 279.6, and 285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0–0 peak, showing overall similarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0–0 and 0–1 peaks. Notably, introducing a core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased vibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structures and x-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen species, emphasizing the influence of charge state on x-ray absorptions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the fundamental variational quantum algorithms, while a version of QAOA that includes counterdiabatic driving, termed digitized counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA), is generally considered to outperform QAOA for all system sizes when the circuit depth for the two algorithms are held equal. Nevertheless, DC-QAOA introduces more cnot gates per layer, so the overall circuit complexity is a tradeoff between the number of cnot gates per layer and the circuit depth and must be carefully assessed. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DC-QAOA and QAOA on maxcut problem with the total number of cnot gates held equal, and we focus on one implementation of counterdiabatic terms using nested commutators in DC-QAOA, termed as DC-QAOA(NC). We have found that DC-QAOA(NC) reduces the overall circuit complexity as compared to QAOA only for sufficiently large problems, and for maxcut problem the number of qubits must exceed 16 for DC-QAOA(NC) to outperform QAOA. Additionally, we benchmark DC-QAOA(NC) against QAOA on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model under realistic noise conditions, finding that DC-QAOA(NC) exhibits significantly improved robustness compared to QAOA, maintaining higher fidelity as the problem size scales. Notably, in a direct comparison between one-layer DC-QAOA(NC) and three-layer QAOA where both use the same number of cnot gates, we identify an exponential performance advantage for DC-QAOA(NC), further signifying its suitability for large-scale quantum optimization tasks. We have further shown that this advantage can be understood from the effective dimensions introduced by the counterdiabatic driving terms. Moreover, based on our finding that the optimal parameters generated by DC-QAOA(NC) strongly concentrate in the parameter space, we have devised an instance-sequential training method for DC-QAOA(NC) circuits, which, compared to traditional methods, offers performance improvement while using even fewer quantum resources. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of DC-QAOA circuits and an efficient training method based on their generalizability.},

  abstract     = {Creating robust quantum operations is a major challenge in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era. Recently, the importance of noise-resilient control methods has become more pronounced in the field. Ordinarily, noisy quantum systems are described by the Lindblad equation. However, minimizing noise susceptibility using this equation has proven challenging because of its irreversibility. In this study, we propose a method for creating robust pulses based on the stochastic Schrödinger equation. This equation describes individual noise realizations under any colored noise process, contrary to the Lindblad equation, which describes mean system behavior under white noise. Using stochastic optimal control techniques, our method, fidelity-enhanced variational quantum optimal control, is able to construct higher-fidelity paths than its nonstochastic counterpart. By accounting for both environmental noise sources as well as noise sources inherent to the control system, highly significant increases in fidelity are noted for both single- and multiple-qubit state preparations.},

However, such an equilibrium-probe-based metrology scenario severely suffers from the low-temperature-error-divergence problem in the weak-coupling regime. To circumvent this limit, we propose a strategy to eliminate the error-divergence problem by utilizing the strong-coupling effects, which can be captured by the reaction-coordinate mapping. The strong couplings induce a noncanonical equilibrium state which greatly enhances the metrology performance. It is found that our metrology precision behaves as a polynomial-type scaling relation, which suggests the reduction of temperature can be used as a resource to improve the metrology performance. Our result is sharply contrary to that of the weak-coupling case, in which the metrology precision exponentially decays as the temperature decreases. Paving a way to realize a high-precision noisy quantum metrology at low temperatures, our result reveals the importance of the non-Markovianity in quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Critical quantum metrology relies on the extreme sensitivity of a system's eigenstates near the critical point of a quantum phase transition to Hamiltonian perturbations. This means that these eigenstates are extremely sensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In realistic settings, there is always some degree of uncertainty in the control parameters used to tune the system to criticality. These uncertainties, while not the target of estimation, can significantly affect the attainable precision, effectively acting as nuisance parameters in the estimation process. Despite being a practically relevant source of noise, their impact on critical metrology has been largely overlooked. In this work we present a general framework that interpolates between single- and multiparameter estimation settings, enabling a systematic analysis of how such uncertainties influence sensitivity. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic transverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly demonstrating how uncertainty in control parameters affects the metrological performance of critical sensors. For finite-size systems, we identify a fundamental trade-off between robustness to uncertainty and the ability to retain a quantum advantage at the critical point. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the practical limitations of critical quantum metrology and provide a route toward its more resilient implementation.},

Through further optimization of the system using differential evolution algorithms, we achieve a sub-Poissonian phonon source with high purity and strong single-phonon statistics. The results show that the dynamic scheme allows the system to achieve quantum effects at the single-phonon level over a broad parameter range, which improves its robustness. This mechanism also regulates the time interval between consecutive emissions, reducing the requirements for time resolution.

Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for cx , cz , swap , leakage-controlled cx , and leakage-controlled cz two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on postoperation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a cxswap operation with minimal additional cost over a standard cx . We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected.

Controlling parameters in these transformations allows us to simulate selective state-to-state transitions as well as the long-lived coherences found in systems such as photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. These results suggest a general framework in which parameters in pseudo-identity unitary transformations can be chosen to generate arbitrary nonunitary system-bath channels without any additional qubits representing bath dynamics. The demonstrated controllability of the bath through these transformations establishes different possibilities for the efficient simulation of open quantum systems on quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the optimized implementation of multicontrolled Toffoli decomposition using the gate set. While there are several recent works in this direction, here we explicitly quantify the trade-off (with concrete formulas) between the Toffoli depth (this means the depth using the classical 2-controlled Toffoli gate) of the -controlled Toffoli decomposition and the number of clean ancilla qubits. Additionally, we achieve a reduced Toffoli (consequently ) depth, which is an extension of the technique introduced by Khattar and Gidney [T. Khattar and C. Gidney, arXiv:2407.17966 ]. In terms of a negative result, we first show that by using such conditionally clean ancilla techniques, the Toffoli depth can never achieve exactly , though it remains of the same order. This highlights the limitation of the techniques exploiting conditionally clean ancillas [J. Nie et al. , arXiv:2402.05053 ; T. Khattar and C. Gidney, arXiv:2407.17966 ]. Then we prove that, in a more general setup, the depth in the decomposition, via Toffoli gates, is lower bounded by , and this bound is achieved following the complete binary tree structure. Since the (2-controlled) Toffoli gate can further be decomposed using gate set, various methodologies are also explored in this regard for trade-off-related implications.},

We propose a quantum network for single-photon frequency conversion based on time-bin entanglement, where legitimate users can realize the spanning of communication bands between users by independently choosing the target conversion frequency mode. The results show that the converter in the network can be used as a bridge to completely connect the two networks by cascading the quadratic nonlinear process. Meanwhile, the converted quantum entangled states are demonstrated in entanglement measurements and can be used for entanglement swapping. This scheme is expected to be widely used in scenarios where different networks share quantum resources, switching communication channels and effectively connecting different multiplexed spectrum. This concept also provides significant applications in large-scale metropolitan area networks.},

In the spin-squeezing regime, we find that OAT is more susceptible to state-preparation error than TAT due to its parameter-dependent phase-space rotation. In the non-Gaussian regime, we find that OAT is robust to state-preparation errors, which can be explained by a small ratio of off-diagonal to diagonal elements in its Fisher-covariance matrix. In contrast, TNT does not exhibit this robustness. We find that the single-parameter unbiased estimators that are habitually used in quantum-enhanced atom interferometry are not always optimal, and that there may be occasions where biased estimators, or two-parameter unbiased estimators, lead to lower net error.},

Utilizing the composite pulses technique, we derive three fundamental quantum gates with narrowband and passband characteristics—the X ( not ) gate, the hadamard gate, and gates enabling arbitrary rotations. To systematically design these composite pulse sequences, we introduce the SU(2), modified-SU(2), and regularization random search methodologies.

Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these Hamiltonian terms into groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of . Moreover, our grouping measurement strategy reduces the number of measurements needed to , whereas the current best grouping measurement schemes require measurements. Additionally, we find that measuring the expectation value of a group of Hamiltonian terms requires fewer repetitions than measuring a single term individually, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit executions.

We first generate a restricted class of states from a single quantum emitter and then apply fusions to create a target graph state, where we use a dynamic programming approach to find the construction that requires the lowest possible number of fusions. Our analysis yields a lookup table for constructing nonisomorphic graph states with the minimum number of fusions. The lookup table covers all graph states with up to eight qubits and several other ones with up to 14 qubits. We present construction protocols of selected graph states and provide the lookup table. For large graph states that are not in the lookup table, we derive bounds for the required number of fusions using graph-theoretic properties. Finally, we use the lookup table to search for the best graph codes for loss-tolerant encodings, given a fixed number of fusions for their construction.},

Error processes are far more complex than simple depolarizing noise applied to single gates, and error rates can vary greatly between different qubits and at different points in the circuit. Nevertheless, it would be useful to distill all this complicated behavior down to a single parameter: an effective error rate for a simple uniform error model. Here we show that this can be done by means of the average detector likelihood, which quantifies the rate at which error detection events occur. We show that this parameter is predictive of the overall code performance for two variants of the surface code: Floquet codes and the 3-CX surface code. This is then used to define an effective error rate at which simulations for a simple uniform noise model result in the same average detector likelihood, as well as a good prediction of the logical error rate.},

  abstract     = {Graph states are a class of multipartite entangled quantum states that are ubiquitous in quantum information. We study equivalence relations between graph states under local unitaries (LU) to obtain distinguishing methods both in local and in networked settings. Based on the marginal structure of graph states, we introduce a family of easy-to-compute LU invariants. We show that these invariants uniquely identify the entanglement classes of every graph state up to eight qubits and discuss their reliability for larger numbers of qubits. To handle larger graphs, we generalize tools to test for local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states that work by condensing large graphs into smaller graphs. In turn, we show that statements on the equivalence of these smaller graphs (which are easier to compute) can be used to infer statements on the equivalence of the original, larger graphs. We analyze LU equivalence in two key settings, with and without allowing for the permutation of qubits. We identify entanglement classes, whose marginal structure does not allow us to distinguish them. As a result, we increase the bound on the number of qubits where the LU-LC conjecture holds from 8 to 10 qubits in the setting where qubit permutations are allowed.},

  abstract     = {The quantum trajectory sensing problem seeks quantum sensor states which enable the trajectories of incident particles to be distinguished using a single measurement. For an -qubit sensor state to unambiguously discriminate a set of trajectories with a single projective measurement, all post-trajectory output states must be mutually orthogonal; therefore, the state coefficients must satisfy a system of constraints which is typically very large. Given that this system is generally challenging to solve directly, we introduce a group-theoretic framework which simplifies the criteria for sensor states and exponentially reduces the number of equations and variables involved when the trajectories obey certain symmetries. These simplified criteria yield general families of trajectory sensor states and provide bounds on the particle-sensor interaction strength required for perfect one-shot trajectory discrimination. Furthermore, we establish a link between trajectory sensing and quantum error correction, recognizing their common motivation to identify perturbations using projective measurements. Our sensor states in fact form quantum codes, and conversely, a number of familiar stabilizer codes (such as toric codes) also provide trajectory sensing capabilities. This connection enables noise-resilient trajectory sensing through the concatenation of sensor states with quantum error-correcting codes.},

In this work, we develop a neural network-based method for measuring network quantum steerability, which can be generalized to arbitrary quantum networks and naturally applied to standard steering scenarios. Our method provides an effective framework for steerability analysis, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and efficiency in standard bipartite and multipartite steering scenarios. Numerical simulations involving isotropic states and noisy Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states yield results that are consistent with established findings in these respective scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility in the bilocal network steering scenario, where an untrusted central party shares two-qubit isotropic states of different visibilities, ν and ω , with trusted end-point parties and performs a single Bell state measurement. Through explicit construction of a network local hidden state model derived from numerical results and incorporation of the entanglement properties of network assemblages, we analytically demonstrate that the network steering thresholds are determined by the curve ν ω = 1 / 3 under the corresponding configuration.},

In this work, we consider the Gaussian random-displacement channel N σ , a type of bosonic Gaussian channels relevant in various bosonic quantum information processing systems. In particular, we attempt to make progress on the problem of determining the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random-displacement channel by analyzing the error-correction performance of several families of multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In doing so we analyze the surface-square GKP codes using an efficient and exact maximum-likelihood decoder (MLD) up to a large code distance of d = 39 . We find that the error threshold of the surface-square GKP code is remarkably close to σ = 1 / e ≃ 0.6065 at which the best-known lower bound of the quantum capacity of N σ vanishes. We also analyze the performance of color-hexagonal GKP codes up to a code distance of d = 13 using a tensor-network decoder serving as an approximate MLD. By focusing on multimode GKP codes that encode just one logical qubit over multiple bosonic modes, we show that GKP codes can achieve nonzero quantum state transmission rates for a Gaussian random-displacement channel N σ at larger values of σ than previously demonstrated. Thus, our work reduces the gap between the quantum communication theoretic bounds and the performance of explicit bosonic quantum error-correcting codes in regards to the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random-displacement channel.},

In the context of near-term quantum computing, RDMs provide sufficient information to effectively design variational quantum algorithms. However, their experimental estimation is challenging, as it involves preparing and measuring quantum states in multiple bases, a resource-intensive process susceptible to producing nonphysical RDMs due to shot noise from limited measurements. To address this, we propose a method to mitigate shot noise by reenforcing certain physicality constraints on RDMs. While verifying RDM compatibility with a global state is quantum Merlin-Arthur complete, we relax this condition by enforcing compatibility constraints up to a certain level using a polynomial-size semidefinite program to reconstruct overlapping RDMs from simulated data. Our approach yields, on average, tighter bounds for the same number of measurements compared to tomography without compatibility constraints. We demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our method by integrating it into an algorithmic cooling procedure to prepare low-energy states of local Hamiltonians. Simulations on frustrated Hamiltonians reveal notable improvements in accuracy and resource efficiency, highlighting the potential of our approach for practical applications in near-term quantum computing.},

A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum nonlocal nonstabilizerness (NN) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that NN can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, establishing a direct relationship with the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NN to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems. We reveal that the two-point NN decays according to a power law in critical states, indicating that it can serve as an effective quantum information probe for phase transitions. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NN and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed “nonstabilizerness swapping,” wherein post-measurement NN decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. The occurrence of this phenomenon provides a sufficient condition for both entanglement swapping and the presence of a nontrivial sign structure. Our results thus represent a pivotal step toward accurately quantifying the “quantumness” of a state and bring insights from multiple perspectives to the property of NN.},

We begin by examining quantum correlations, specifically quantum entanglement and EPR steering, in the ground state. These quantum correlations primarily stem from squeezing interactions in weak-coupling and normal strong-coupling regimes. As the coupling strength increases, especially upon entering the ultrastrong-coupling regime, the correlations emerge from the combined effect of squeezing and mix-mode interactions. Importantly, this scenario enables the realization of two-way EPR steering. Moreover, lower optical frequencies enhance both quantum entanglement and EPR steering. Further, when considering thermal effects, the ultrastrong-coupling and deep strong-coupling regimes, paired with lower optical frequencies, lead to improved entanglement. The one-way EPR steering for the resonant case can be effectively controlled in the ultrastrong-coupling and deep strong-coupling regimes which originate from the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir coupling induced by the diamagnetic term. Additionally, one-way EPR steering can also be produced for the nonresonant case. In this case, the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir originates from the combined effect of nonresonant frequencies and the diamagnetic term. Our findings have the potential to inspire further research into quantum information processing that leverages light-matter entanglement and EPR steering.},

For the first dataset, images are intentionally selected so that they could be classified with 100% accuracy. This allows us to specifically examine different types of quantum encodings of the digit dataset and study the impact of experimental noise. In the second dataset, graphs are divided into two categories based on the spectral structure of their Ising Hamiltonian models, which is related to the NP-hard problem. For this problem we consider an embedding of an exponentially large Hamiltonian spectrum into an entangled state of a linear number of qubits. For both problems, we study various levels of circuit optimization and found that, for all experiments conducted, we achieve classifiers with 100% accuracy on both training and testing datasets. This demonstrates that the quantum processor has the ability to correctly solve the basic classification task under consideration. As we expect, with the increase in the capabilities of quantum processors, they can be utilized for solving machine learning tasks.},

  abstract     = {The Leggett-Garg inequalities have been proposed to identify the quantum behavior of a system; specifically, the violation of macrorealism. They are usually implemented by performing two sequential measurements on quantum systems, calculating the correlators of such measurements and then combining them arriving at Leggett-Garg inequalities. However, this approach only provides sufficient conditions for the violation of macrorealism. Recently, an alternative approach was proposed that uses nondemolition measurements and gives both a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism. By storing the information in a quantum detector, it is possible to construct a quasiprobability distribution whose negative regions unequivocally identify the quantum behavior of the system. Here, we perform a detailed comparison between these two approaches. The use of the IBM quantum simulators allows us to evaluate the performance in real-case situations and to include both the statistical and environmental noise. We find that the nondemolition approach is not only able to always identify the quantum features, but it requires fewer resources than the standard Leggett-Garg inequalities. In addition, while the efficiency of the latter is strongly affected by the presence of the noise, the nondemolition approach results incredibly robust and its efficiency remains unchanged by the noise. These results make the nondemolition approach a viable alternative to the Leggett-Garg inequalities to identify the violation of macrorealism.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry is fundamental in the description and simulation of quantum systems. Leveraging symmetries in classical simulations of many-body quantum systems can result in significant overhead due to the exponentially growing size of some symmetry groups as the number of particles increases. Quantum computers hold the promise of achieving exponential speedup in simulating quantum many-body systems; however, a general method for utilizing symmetries in quantum simulations has not yet been established. In this work, we present a unified framework for incorporating symmetry group transforms on quantum computers to simulate many-body systems. The core of our approach lies in the development of efficient quantum circuits for symmetry-adapted projection onto irreducible representations of a group or pairs of commuting groups. We provide resource estimations for common groups, including the cyclic and permutation groups. Our algorithms demonstrate the capability to prepare coherent superpositions of symmetry-adapted states and to perform quantum evolution across a wide range of models in condensed-matter physics and ab initio electronic structure in quantum chemistry. Specifically, we execute a symmetry-adapted quantum subroutine for small molecules in first-quantization on noisy hardware and demonstrate the emulation of symmetry-adapted quantum phase estimation for preparing coherent superpositions of quantum states in various irreducible representations of a symmetry group. In addition, we present a discussion of open problems regarding treating symmetries in digital quantum simulations of many-body systems, paving the way for future systematic investigations into leveraging symmetries quantumly for practical quantum advantage. The broad applicability and rigorous resource estimation for symmetry transformations make our framework appealing for achieving provable quantum advantage on fault-tolerant quantum computers, especially for symmetry-related properties.},

This paper shows a simple Ising model capable of performing such nontrivial computational tasks in a quantum neural network model. An Ising spin chain as small as ten qubits can solve a practical image classification task with high accuracy. To evaluate the mechanism of its computation, we examine how the symmetries of the Hamiltonian would affect its computational power.

In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for generating vortex optical entanglement in coherently prepared media, employing continuous-variable analysis and leveraging Raman scattering as an alternative to the conventional spontaneous parametric down-conversion method. The entanglement arises from the quantum correlation between the two light fields, induced by atomic coherence. Using numerical simulations, we thoroughly explore the impact of various tunable system parameters on the degree of entanglement, ultimately identifying the optimal conditions for maximal entanglement. Our findings offer a reference framework for vortex light entanglement, with potential implications across quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum computing, high-dimensional quantum information, and other related fields.},

The resulting quantum gate corresponds to the holonomy associated with the closed path traced by the computational space. The isoholonomic inequality for gates establishes a fundamental lower bound on the path length of such cyclic transports, which depends only on the spectrum of the holonomy, that is, the eigenvalues of the implemented quantum gate. The isoholonomic inequality also gives rise to an estimate of the minimum time required to execute a holonomic quantum gate, underscoring the central role of the inequality in quantum computation. In this paper, we show that when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large, any quantum gate can be implemented using a parallel transporting Hamiltonian in a way that saturates the isoholonomic inequality and the corresponding time estimate. We call such implementations tight. The treatment presented here is constructive and lays the foundation for the development of efficient and optimal implementation strategies in holonomic quantum computation.},

A key element of this approach is a geometric constraint known as the parallel transport condition. According to the principle of covariance, this condition must be appropriately modified when changing reference frames. In this paper, we detail how to adjust the parallel transport condition when transitioning from the laboratory frame to a rotating reference frame. Furthermore, building on gauge invariance considerations, we develop a framework for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with projective gates. The parallel transport condition of this framework effectively addresses the problem of global dynamical phases inherent in conventional nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation. We extend the isoholonomic inequality, which provides a fundamental bound on the efficiency of protocols used to implement holonomic quantum gates, to encompass projective quantum gates. We also determine a minimum execution time for projective holonomic quantum gates and show that this time can be attained when the codimension of the computational space is sufficiently large.},

Fast Bayesian tomography (FBT) is a self-consistent tomographic protocol that can be bootstrapped from earlier characterization knowledge and be updated in real time with arbitrary gate sequences. Here we demonstrate how FBT allows for the characterization of key non-Markovian error processes. We introduce two experimental protocols for FBT to diagnose the non-Markovian behavior of two-qubit systems on silicon quantum dots. To increase the efficiency and scalability of the experiment-analysis loop, we develop a web-based FBT software stack. To reduce experiment cost and analysis time, we also introduce a native readout method and warm boot strategy. Our results demonstrate that FBT is a useful tool for probing non-Markovian errors that can be detrimental to the ultimate realization of fault-tolerant operation on quantum computing.},

In the domain of states, the concept of majorization serves as a fundamental tool for comparing the uncertainty inherent in both classical and quantum systems. This paper establishes a rigorous framework for assessing the uncertainty in both classical and quantum channels. By employing a specific class of superchannels, we introduce and elucidate three distinct approaches to channel majorization: constructive, axiomatic, and operational. Intriguingly, these methodologies converge to a consistent ordering. This convergence not only provides a robust basis for defining entropy functions for channels but also clarifies the interpretation of entropy in this broader context. Most notably, our findings reveal that any viable entropy function for quantum channels must assume negative values, thereby challenging traditional notions of entropy.},

In this regime, being in nonequilibrium (termed informational nonequilibrium ) provides thermodynamic resources, such as extractable work, solely from the information content. The usefulness of informational nonequilibrium creates an incentive to obtain more of it, motivating the question of how to concentrate it : can we increase the local informational nonequilibrium of a product state under a global closed system (unitary) evolution? We fully solve this problem analytically, showing that it is impossible for two-qubits, and it is always possible to find states achieving this in higher dimensions. Specifically for two-qutrits, we find that there is a single unitary achieving optimal concentration for every state, for which we uncover a Mpemba-like effect . We further discuss the notion of bound resources in this framework, initial global correlations' ability to activate concentration, and applications to concentrating purity and intrinsic randomness.},

  abstract     = {According to the celebrated Gottesman-Knill theorem, magic resource (nonstabilizerness) is necessary to drive universal quantum computation. Thus characterization and quantification of magic resource for quantum states and quantum channels are significant issues. In this work, we propose a method to construct quantifiers of magic resource for quantum channels from those for quantum states by employing the channel-state duality to convert quantum channels to the corresponding Choi states. We focus on a specific quantifier of magic resource based on characteristic functions (Fourier transforms) of quantum states. This quantifier is well defined for all dimensions and easy to calculate, as opposed to those defined via discrete Wigner functions. It satisfies some desirable properties and provides an upper bound to the mana (a kind of logarithmic negativity of discrete Wigner functions) of quantum channels. Using this quantity, we evaluate the amount of magic resource for some typical quantum channels and compare them with some existing quantifiers of generating-power of magic resource. For the dephasing channels in prime dimensional systems, our quantifier of magic resource essentially characterizes the average generating power of magic resource, while, for general channels, they are quite different and some challenging issues arise.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction represents a significant advancement in large-scale quantum computing. However, achieving fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford logical gates with reduced overhead remains a challenge in the popular surface code strategy. Recent advances have underscored the need for a substantial code distance to attain complete fault tolerance. Here, we introduce a continuous fault-tolerant scheme for non-Clifford logical gates via multiple injections. Unlike existing protocols that focus on a single logical chain, our approach utilizes multiple logical chains, each of which can employ the same or different logical rotation angles to initialize a non-Clifford state. Compared to previous efforts, our protocol significantly alleviates the challenges associated with the requirement for a large code distance and reduces the corresponding resource overheads, making it more feasible to be implemented in current midscale chips via the surface code strategy.},

We first establish a key technical result demonstrating that given the set of correlations for a complementary experiment, the EP restricts the maximum set of correlations for the original experiment to the antiblocking set. Based on it, we can prove our central result: if all quantum behaviors are accessible in Nature, the EP guarantees that no postquantum behaviors can be realized. This can be seen as a generalization of the result of B. Amaral et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 89 , 030101(R) (2014) ], to a wider range of scenarios.

We analyze the presence of multipartite entanglement in the system's degrees of freedom through the Quantum Fisher Information, revealing that fermionic states generated during the walk are better suited to perform quantum metrology tasks.

By the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we show the bridge from the generalized TC model to the central spin model. We also discuss the effect of the temperature, the coupling constant, and the magnetic field on the dynamical multipartite entanglement in the central spin model, where the central spin is initially unentangled. Strong coupling and low temperature are necessary conditions for a genuine multipartite entanglement in the model. The former governs the maximum entanglement, while the latter plays a crucial role in stabilizing the entanglement. The magnetic field modulates the period and amplitude of multipartite entanglement, primarily affecting the stable waveform of it.

This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short timescales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling nonadiabatic topological transport.

Using the well-known Petz recovery map, we first show that conditions for approximate QEC can be easily generalized for the case of non-Markovian noise in the strong-coupling regime where the noise map becomes non-completely-positive at intermediate times. While certain approximate QEC schemes are ineffective against quantum non-Markovian noise, in the sense that the fidelity vanishes in finite time, the Petz map adapted to non-Markovian noise uniquely safeguards the code space even at the maximum noise limit. Focusing on the case of non-Markovian amplitude damping noise, we further show that the non-Markovian Petz map also outperforms the standard, stabilizer-based QEC code. Since implementing such a non-Markovian map poses practical challenges, we also construct a Markovian Petz map that achieves a similar performance, with only a slight compromise on the fidelity. Finally, we also study an example of non-Markovian Pauli noise, namely the non-Markovian dephasing channel. In this case, we show that the non-Markovian Petz recovery preserves the code space even at the high-noise limit for certain noise-adapted codes, whereas the Markovian Petz and stabilizer recoveries are ineffective.},

Two acoustic modes couple to the qubit through piezoelectric interaction, and the qubit is driven by a microwave field. Under the condition of far detuning between the qubit and acoustic modes, the qubit can be eliminated adiabatically, thus establishing the indirect interaction between the two acoustic modes. We demonstrate that such an indirect interaction can be a parametric-amplification-type interaction by appropriately choosing the drive frequency and strength, so the entanglement between acoustic modes can be created by the direct unitary evolution. We numerically analyze the parameter conditions for generating the entanglement in detail and evaluate the influence of system dissipations and noise. The results show that the scheme can be realized using currently available parameters and has strong robustness against the dissipations and the environmental temperature.

The analysis focuses on a one-dimensional transversely confined NeHe molecule model used to simulate the scattering between an electron and a ion (molecule). The time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the finite element method with a self-developed Julia package FEMTISE to compute potential energy curves and the parameters of the interactions between particles. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is solved using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree algorithm. The time-dependent electronic and nuclear probability densities are calculated for different electron incoming energies, evidencing elastic and inelastic processes that can be correlated to changes in von Neumann entropy, von Neumann mutual information, and Shannon mutual information. The expectation value of the position of the particles, as well as their standard deviations, are analyzed along the whole dynamics and related to the entanglement during the collision and after the process is over, thus highlighting the dynamics of entanglement generation.

In the last decade, a new type of teleportation called port-based teleportation , in which the receiver can recover the state simply by looking at the correct port without having to actively perform correction operations, has been widely studied. In this paper, we consider the analog of telecloning, in which conventional teleportation is replaced by the port-based variant. To achieve this, we generalize the optimal measurement used in port-based teleportation and develop a new one that achieves port-based telecloning. Numerical results show that, in certain cases, the proposed protocol is strictly better than the trivial clone-and-teleport approach.},

In this paper, we develop a hypothesis-testing framework for quantum dynamics symmetry using a limited number of queries to the unknown unitary operation and establish the quantum max-relative entropy lower bound for the type-II error. We construct optimal ancilla-free protocols that achieve optimal type-II error probability for testing time-reversal symmetry ( symmetry) and diagonal symmetry ( symmetry) with limited queries. Contrasting with the advantages of indefinite causal-order strategies in various quantum information processing tasks, we show that parallel, adaptive, and indefinite causal-order strategies have equal power for our tasks. We establish optimal protocols for symmetry testing and symmetry testing for six and five queries, respectively, from which we infer that the type-II error exhibits a decay rate of with respect to the number of queries . This represents a significant improvement over the basic repetition protocols without using global entanglement, where the error decays at a slower rate of .},

  abstract     = {Gaussian quantum channels are relevant operations in continuous variable systems. In general, given an arbitrary state, the action on it is well known, provided that the quantum channels are completely characterized. In this work, we have studied the role played by quantum coherence in the estimation of Gaussian channel parameters. For this purpose, we start by considering an initial single-mode vacuum state where coherence is generated through displaced or/and squeezing operations. Then, we consider a probe state with two resources, the average thermal number and the quantum coherence. The results are computed using the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as well as some gain functions defined in the work. We applied the estimation protocol for two paradigmatic bosonic Gaussian channels: the thermal attenuator and the thermal amplifier. Our results show that for the vacuum initial state, coherence can be exploited to obtain a high QFI. Moreover, we can state two important facts: the first being that for a small parameter region of a channel, the QFI depends on the mechanism used to generate the coherence, while the second is that the QFI depends not only on the amount of coherence but also on how it changes as a function of the parameter to be estimated. For the probe state, including also an average thermal number, the two examples show that thermal resources are not always beneficial to the QFI and that this depends on the channel structure. For the attenuator channel, the optimal probe state is only limited by the ability to implement an average thermal number and generate an amount of coherence, while for the amplifier channel, the vacuum probe state with coherence is the optimal state. Finally, we obtain a direct relation between the quantum Fisher information and the relative entropy of coherence, allowing, in principle, an experimental verification based on the measurement of the covariance matrix of the probe system.},

In this work, we suggest a gate-to-tensor encoding method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), with which two long short-term memory networks are trained to predict both entangling capability and trainability. We call these LG networks. The remarkable capabilities of LG networks afford a statistical way to investigate the entanglement-trainability correlation of PQCs within a data set encompassing millions of generated circuits. This machine-learning-driven method first confirms the negative correlation between entanglement and trainability. Then, we observe that circuits with any values of entangling capability and trainability exist. These circuits with high entanglement and high trainability possess an appropriate high portion of nearest-neighbor nonlocal gates. Furthermore, the trained LG networks can be employed to construct PQCs with specific entanglement and trainability, demonstrating their practical applications in VQAs.},

It is known that in the nearest-neighbor model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long-range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a nonequilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.},

This advancement enhances the study of Loschmidt echoes, which generally require accurate calculations of the overlap between the evolved state and the initial wave function. By incorporating Clifford-disentangling gates during TDVP evolution, our method effectively controls entanglement growth while keeping the computation of these amplitudes accessible. Specifically, it reduces the problem to evaluating the overlap between a matrix product state (MPS) and a stabilizer state, a task that remains computationally feasible within the proposed framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we first benchmark it on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We then apply it to more challenging scenarios, including a nonintegrable next-to-nearest-neighbor Ising chain and a two-dimensional Ising model. Our results highlight the versatility and efficiency of the Clifford-augmented MPS, showcasing its capability to go beyond the evaluation of simple expectation values. This makes it a powerful tool for exploring various aspects of many-body quantum dynamics.},

Extending such a shift to two-dimensional lattices reveals a geometrically anomalous -shaped wave-packet formation with orientation-tunable arms.

This protocol exploits an additional quantum system that is sequentially coupled to the system and eventually measured to reconstruct temporal correlations developed by the system. In reference to a given measurement observable, the protocol's outcomes are well described by a quasiprobability distribution, which can be negative. In this paper, we prove that the presence of negative regions in this distribution defined at three times is a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism. This approach falls within the category of sequential noninvasive measurability and automatically satisfies all no-signaling-in-time conditions at multiple times by design. We show that reconstructing the negativity is a much stronger condition than the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities, commonly used for the same task, as they may be satisfied even if the macrorealism is violated. Quantum nondemolition measurements provide a clear and operational tool to identify violations of macrorealism directly. Thus, our result could also be applied to the study of the quantum-to-classical transition and in all those fields where quantumness certification is desirable.},

We not only demonstrate the consistency between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg representations but also present a Heisenberg-like representation grounded in the generalized vielbein formalism, which provides a clear and intuitive geometric interpretation. Unlike the standard Heisenberg representation, where the metric of the Hilbert space is encoded solely in the dual states, the Heisenberg-like representation distributes the metric information between both the states and the dual states. Despite this distinction, it retains the same Heisenberg equation of motion for operators. Within this formalism, the Hamiltonian is replaced by a Hermitian counterpart, while the “non-Hermiticity” is transferred to the operators. Moreover, this approach extends to regimes with a dynamical metric (beyond the pseudo-Hermitian framework) and to systems governed by time-dependent Hamiltonians.},

Aging transitions in coupled oscillators have been studied extensively in both the classical and quantum contexts. It is well known that the onset of aging transitions can be modulated by the dissipative coupling between oscillators. In this study, we propose an alternative way to modulate the aging transition through coherent couplings between a two-level atom and the oscillators. Our findings reveal that, compared to atom-free systems in both classical and quantum regimes, the atom-oscillator coherent interaction reduces the inactive-to-total oscillator ratio required for aging transitions. Analytical results of the transition for both the classical oscillators and quantum oscillators suggest that the decay rate of the atom and the atom-oscillator coupling strength jointly change the aging transition point. The physics behind the observation is also elucidated in this article. Our research introduces a readily implementable strategy for manipulating aging transitions in more intricate systems, thereby advancing the control and understanding of these critical transitions in quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {We derive multiparty games that, if the winning chance exceeds a certain limit, prove the incompatibility of the parties' causal relations with any partial order. This, in turn, means that the parties exert a backaction on the causal relations; the causal relations are dynamical. The games turn out to be representable by directed graphs, for instance by an orientation of the Möbius ladder. We discuss these games as device-independent tests of space-time's dynamical nature in general relativity. To do so, we design relativistic settings where, in the Minkowski space-time, the winning chance is bound to the limits. In contrast, we find otherwise tame processes with classical control of causal order that win the games deterministically. These suggest a violation of the bounds in gravitational implementations. We obtain these games by uncovering a “pairwise central symmetry” of the correlations in question. This symmetry allows us to recycle the facets of the acyclic subgraph polytope studied by Grötschel, Jünger, and Reinelt in the mid-80s for combinatorial optimization. In addition, we derive multiparty games in a scenario where the polytope dimension grows only linearly in the number of parties. Here, exceeding the limits not only proves the dynamical nature of the causal relations, but also that the correlations are incompatible with any global causal order.},

  abstract     = {Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's “atoms,” say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a degenerate parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to linear environments.},

  abstract     = {Thermodynamics is based on a coarse-grained approach, from which its fundamental variables emerge, effectively erasing the complicated details of the microscopic dynamics within a macroscopic system. The strength of thermodynamics lies in the universality provided by this paradigm. In contrast, quantum mechanics focuses on describing the dynamics of microscopic systems, aiming to make predictions about experiments we perform, a goal shared by all fundamental physical theories, which are often framed as gauge theories in modern physics. Recently, a gauge theory for quantum thermodynamics was introduced, defining gauge-invariant work and heat, and exploring their connections to quantum phenomena. In this work, we extend that theory in two significant ways. First, we incorporate energy spectrum degeneracies, which were previously overlooked. Additionally, we define gauge-invariant entropy, exploring its properties and connections to other physical and informational quantities. This results in a complete framework for quantum thermodynamics grounded in the principle of gauge invariance. To demonstrate some implications of this theory, we apply it to well-known critical systems.},

  abstract     = {Two important ingredients necessary for obtaining Bell nonlocal correlations between two spatially separated parties are an entangled state shared between them and an incompatible set of measurements employed by each of them. However, not all entangled states can give rise to Bell nonlocality. Here, we are interested in a complementary question, regarding the role of the sets of incompatible measurements in enabling Bell nonlocality, for arbitrary entangled states. It is known that for some sets of more than two jointly incompatible measurements performed by one of the parties, there does not exist an entangled state and another set of incompatible measurements for the other party, which will result in Bell nonlocality. However, in the two-input and two-output setting per party, measurement incompatibility at a single party will always guarantee Bell nonlocality. Thus, it is interesting to ask whether all sets of incompatible measurements at both parties, in the two-input and two-output setting per party, will result in Bell nonlocality for some shared state. We first observe that Bell nonlocality can always be established when both parties employ any set of incompatible projective measurements. On the other hand, going beyond projective measurements, we present a class of incompatible positive operator-valued measures, employed by both observers, which can never activate Bell nonlocality. Furthermore, we find a sufficient criterion for achieving Bell nonlocal correlations given a fixed amount of pure two-qubit entanglement and a fixed amount of incompatibility of projective measurements applied by either both parties or a single party.},

  abstract     = {Creating macroscopic spatial superposition states is crucial for investigating matter-wave interferometry and advancing quantum sensor technology. Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective. The first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially delocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [ New J. Phys. 19 , 123029 (2017) ]. The second method employs a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 111 , 180403 (2013) ]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent inflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded nanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate two methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial separation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories of the wave packets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large spatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition with a mass of and a size of around is realized in 0.1 s. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic potential (HP) and IHP using the path integral approach.},

Adiabatic elimination is a useful model reduction method for systems with separated timescales, where a reduced model is derived by discarding rapidly decaying degrees of freedom. So far, adiabatic elimination has been formulated using a geometric approach, which provides a versatile and general framework. This article introduces a reformulation of adiabatic elimination through the framework of the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, a widely recognized tool for computing projected time evolution in open quantum systems. We show that the TCL master equation formulation yields results equivalent to those obtained from the geometric formulation. By applying the TCL master equation formulation to typical examples, we demonstrate a practical methodology for performing adiabatic elimination calculation. This study not only bridges two previously independent approaches, thereby making the adiabatic elimination method accessible to a broader audience, but also enables the analysis of complex cases that are challenging within the geometric formulation. Additionally, it reveals a geometric interpretation of the TCL master equation formalism.},

The answer is yes, if the measuring device corresponds to a complex-projective 3-design. In this privileged case, not only does each quantum state correspond to a probability distribution over the outcomes of a single measurement, but also the probability distributions which correspond to quantum states can be elegantly characterized as those which respect a generalized uncertainty principle. The latter takes the form of a lower-bound on the variance of a natural class of observables as measured by the reference. We give simple equations which pure-state probability distributions must satisfy, and contextualize these results by showing how 3-designs allow the structure-coefficients of the Jordan algebra of observables to be extracted from the probabilities which characterize the reference measurement itself. This lends credence to the view that quantum theory ought to be primarily understood as a set of normative constraints on probability assignments which reflect nature's lack of hidden variables and further cements the significance of 3-designs in quantum information science.},

The problem is that we do not know any rigid KS set in , the smallest quantum system that allows for KS sets. Moreover, none of the existing methods for constructing KS sets leads to rigid KS sets in . Here, we show that two fundamental structures of quantum theory define two rigid KS sets. One of these structures is the supersymmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measure. The other is the minimal state-independent contextuality set. The second construction provides a clue to solve the minimal KS problem, the most important open problem in this field. We prove that there is no KS set of 30 elements that can be obtained from the minimal state-independent contextuality set by completing bases and adding elements that are orthogonal to two previous elements. We conjecture that 31 is the solution to the minimal KS set problem.},

Dipolar interactions between these electronic states are then translated into effective interactions among ground-state atoms. Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate two dressing protocols, in which Rydberg atoms are resonantly excited in a stroboscopic fashion. The first one is nonadiabatic, meaning Rydberg states are excited by short pulses. In this case, mechanical forces among Rydberg atoms result in electron-motion coupling, which generates effective multibody interactions. In the second, adiabatic protocol, Rydberg states are excited by smoothly varying laser pulses. We show that also, in this protocol, substantial multibody interactions emerge.},

  abstract     = {Vortex beams are exotic states of classical light fields that contain orbital angular momentum (OAM) due to their space-dependent phases. While the experimental realization of intense low-frequency optical vortices has led to the discovery and application of OAM conservation in high-harmonic generation, there is not a comparable signature of light's OAM on photoelectrons. Here we propose using a linear combination of vortex modes, referred to as a vector vortex beam, for strong-field ionization of atoms. We then demonstrate that the input vortex beam's position-dependent phase can be obtained from the resulting electron momentum distribution following strong-field ionization. We validate this method by performing classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations and comparing momentum distributions corresponding to different ionization locations within the beam profile, demonstrating that one can unambiguously determine the ionizing radiation's OAM index. These results are suitable for the added control offered by vortex light compared to Gaussian or plane-wave radiation in intense light-matter interactions.},

Our procedure is universally applicable to the cat and squeezed states, the former displaying the characteristic negativity in its Wigner function, while the latter does not do so. We explicate this in the case of the squeezed vacuum and even coherent states and show that photon addition (or subtraction) is mirrored in the shift in the intensity of specific regions in the tomogram. Further, we examine the dependence of W 1 on the squeezing parameter and its sensitivity to different quadratures.},

We obtain the localization phase regimes with the MBDL and delocalized states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase regipmes. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL phase, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other nonthermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.},

We show that this distribution can be mapped to a continuation of the canonical partition function of a classical spin chain with noninteracting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to conclude that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially at long times, depending on whether the spin chain displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of N adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behavior, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time as a function of N . The analysis presented here provides an overarching understanding of many-body quantum first detection problems in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic phases.

With the scaling theory, we accurately measure the critical point and critical exponents of the second-order quantum phase transition in a bosonic mode with a Kerr nonlinearity. The results show that the dissipative phase transition exhibits a weak universality class, in which the universality classes of the close and open quantum Rabi models in the previous studies are both included. Further, one may understand the spatial dimension d = 1 and the correlation length from the photon occupation probability distribution. When coupled to a quantum-dot electronic circuit, such quantum criticality can be detected by a simple transport signature. As an application, the photocurrent in an unbiased quantum dot system can be significantly enhanced near the phase transition.},

On the one hand, it reveals that PS and photon addition (PA) can reduce entanglement, and on the other hand, it shows that PS or PA can achieve a limited amount of Gaussian state purification. Through the analysis of several examples, we demonstrate the inherent mechanism and applicable scope of photon-subtraction-based purification. We further compare the performance between PS and PA for purifying single-mode Gaussian states, and analyze their capabilities in generating Wigner negativity within purification regimes. In a multimode system, we find that PS can simultaneously increase entanglement and purify some of the reduced states. These findings demonstrate the new application potential of PS and PA, specifically their capability to directly suppress Gaussian noise.},

However, establishing entanglement and squeezing in the degrees of freedom of mechanical motion of macroscopic objects is generally hindered by thermal fluctuations of their environments. Here, we propose a scheme to generate steady-state squeezing and entanglement between two rotating mirrors of a Laguerre-Gaussian cavity by quantum squeezed-reservoir engineering. It is revealed that, by injecting a broadband squeezed light into the cavity, stable squeezing in the relative momentum and entanglement between the two rotating mirrors are created. Compared to the previous work where only the entanglement between the two rotating mirrors appears under the condition of different angular frequencies, our result highlights the stable entanglement of the two mirrors with identical frequency and the simultaneous presence of the entanglement and squeezing of the two mirrors. Our finding deepens our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena of Laguerre-Gaussian cavity optomechanical system.},

We also examine single-photon scattering in the giant-atom model within both the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The results reveal that ultranarrow scattering windows are induced by the phases ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 under specific conditions, making them well suited for precise frequency conversion and sensing. Additionally, in the non-Markovian regime, the spectra exhibit irregular polygonal shapes, offering enhanced opportunities for exploring nonreciprocal frequency conversion in the off-resonant regime.

A discontinuous phase transition between the two types of superradiant phases also emerges in the presence of a strong A 2 term. Additionally, a rich phase diagram featuring a triple point, which connects first- and second-order phase transitions, is derived analytically and confirmed through numerical diagonalization at large effective system sizes. Finally, distinct critical behavior at the triple point is revealed and contrasted with that of a single continuous SRPT. This work may open a new avenue for observing SRPTs in their intrinsic form without altering the A 2 term, while also offering a practical platform for exploring rich quantum phenomena.},

The probe atom can scatter an antibunched radiation emitted from the source, thereby generating a field with specific properties. We experimentally demonstrate wave mixing between nonclassical light from the coherently cw-pumped source and another coherent wave acting on the probe. We observe unique features in the wave mixing stationary spectrum which differs from the mixing spectrum of two classical waves on the probe. These features are well described by adapting the theory of Gardiner et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 50 , 1792 (1994) ] for a strongly coupled cascaded system of two atoms. We further analyze the theory to predict nonclassical mixing spectra for various ratios of atoms' radiative constants. Both experimental and numerical results confirm the domination of the multiphoton scattering process with only a single photon from the source. We evaluate entanglement of atoms in the quasistationary state and illustrate the connection between the expected second-order correlation function of the source field and wave mixing side peaks corresponding to a certain number of scattered photons.},

Using the discrete-coordinate scattering approach, exact expressions of the four scattering coefficients are obtained, and the single-photon routing properties are studied. We find that the single-photon routing properties are closely related to the size of the giant atom, the coupling strength between the giant atom and waveguides, and the phase difference between two coupled channels of the atom-upper (lower) waveguide. Without considering the effect of phases of the atom-waveguide coupling coefficients, the probability for a single-photon routing from one waveguide to the other does not exceed 50 % . However, by properly selecting coupling points between the giant atom and two waveguides, and the phase difference between two atom-upper (lower) waveguide coupling coefficients, a single photon can be transferred from the input port to an arbitrarily selected output port deterministically, i.e., with 100 % probability. It is also found that chiral and nonreciprocal single-photon scattering can be realized in our model by properly adjusting the phase difference between two atom-upper (lower) waveguide coupled channels.

In the phase space, the quantum hyperspins are represented as spherical shells whose radius scales with the number of particles in a way such that it cannot be factorized even in the limit of large particle number. We show that the nonlinearly coupled quantum oscillators form a high-dimensional entangled state that is surprisingly robust with respect to the coupling with the environment. Such a behavior results from a properly engineered reservoir. Networks of entangled quantum hyperspins are a new approach to quantum simulations for applications in computing, Ising machines, and high-energy physics models.

Here we address an exotic parity behavior of the QRM in its superradiant phase by numerical exact diagonalization, namely, the parities of eigenstates of the QRM behave irregularly in the strong-coupling regime but the sum of parities for each pair of neighboring eigenstates beginning from the ground state remains vanishing. It is found that this exotic behavior originates from the comparability of the photon distribution in the odd and even components of Fock basis when the eigenenergies of each pair of neighboring eigenstates approach close enough to each other, and physically this is due to the emergent double-well potential induced by the strong coupling between the single-mode photon field and the two-level atom. The result not only uncovers the physics not known previously in the QRM but also makes an intrinsic limitation on the measurement precision of motional quantum states through parity measurements in modern quantum science and technology.},

  abstract     = {Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as metrology and simulations of many-body physics. Recent research has proposed utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with logical lifetimes potentially on the order of seconds, achieved via enhanced collective interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed “parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing”: For small amplitudes, odd cat states are significantly more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing than even cat states due to the difference in parity symmetry. This discrepancy between even and odd cat states vanishes at large amplitudes and behaves similarly to a spin coherent state with the same amplitude. To analyze the stability of the spin coherent state, we perform a mean-field analysis of the driven-dissipative dynamics, from which we identify a synchronization phase transition wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical inhomogeneous linewidth. The mean-field analysis suggests that the dissipative stabilization can suppress the decoherence effects from inhomogeneous broadening. We argue that the stability of the mean-field model provides a reasonable estimate for that of spin cat states with a large amplitude in the full quantum model. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective spin states, which is important for advancing quantum technologies.},

The PSHE shift is maximized when all fields are resonant, aligning with the transparency point of the system, and is notably weaker under off-resonant conditions, where gain effects dominate. Additionally, the tripod scheme enables an enhanced transverse shift for the signal field at resonance, resulting in dual-field PSHE enhancement.

  abstract     = {Squeezed states of light are one of the most important fundamental resources for quantum optics, optical quantum information processing, and quantum sensing. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that the squeezing of single-mode squeezed vacuum states can be enhanced by probabilistic two-photon subtraction. A further enhancement of the squeezing is subsequently possible by heralded Gaussification, which distills a Gaussian state from the de-Gaussified two-photon subtracted state. Here we provide an extended theoretical analysis of squeezing distillation and purification. We consider a more general scheme in which photon subtraction is combined with a weak coherent displacement. This more flexible scheme allows us to enhance squeezing for an arbitrary input squeezing value. Moreover, if the modified two-photon subtraction operation is properly chosen, then arbitrary strong squeezing can be distilled by subsequent Gaussification. We go beyond pure states and show that the combination of photon subtraction and heralded Gaussification cannot suppress losses that have affected the input state. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative de-Gaussifying operation based on a Fock-state filter that removes the single-photon state. With this de-Gaussifying operation and subsequent re-Gaussification, pure single-mode squeezed states can be distilled from a large class of mixed input states. Interestingly, we have found that squeezing distillation by two-photon subtraction is closely related to certain methods for generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, which are crucial for optical quantum computing.},

  abstract     = {We propose schemes for steady-state emission of quadrature-squeezed light from a single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics system. Two effective atom-cavity interaction models are suggested, motivated by correlated photon-pair emissions and multiphoton coherences that manifest themselves as squeezing of light emitted from the cavity. We consider idealized models to examine the mechanisms and optimal regimes for generating squeezed light. We also demonstrate realizations of these models based on both single 8 7 R b and 1 3 3 C s atoms, using combinations of laser- and laser-plus-cavity-driven Raman transitions between magnetic sublevels in a single ground hyperfine state. We show that these systems can in principle produce a much stronger level of squeezing than has previously been possible from a single-atom source.},

Lett. 130 , 160801 (2023) ], identical single photons are shared between receivers and interfere with a star photon. In this paper we consider two outstanding questions: (i) what is the precise effect of the low photon occupancy of the mode associated with the starlight? and (ii) what is the effect on the achievable resolution of imperfect indistinguishability (or partial distinguishability) between the ground and star photons? We find that the effect of distinguishability is relatively mild, but low photon occupancy of the optical mode of the starlight quickly deteriorates the sensitivity of the telescope for higher auxiliary photon numbers.},

The parameters included in the formula comprise the propagation loss, the resonator thickness, the energy of the light, the light confinement factor, the stimulated emission cross section, the PL quantum yield, and the fraction of the exciton energy that can be afforded to generate the stimulated emission for each PL peak. To compare the theoretical with the experimental , we fabricated 300-nm-thick disk-shaped WGM resonators from the highly efficient blue laser molecule 2,7-bis[9,9-di(4-methylphenyl)-fluoren-2-yl]-9,9-di(4-methylphenyl)fluorene (terfluorene) on 1-µm-high glass microdisks with diameters ranging from 3 to 10 µm. The theoretical replicated the experimentally obtained values, thus demonstrating the validity of the proposed formula. The value in the WGM resonators was three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value reported for a simple slab-type waveguide that was fabricated from terfluorene. We assessed the mechanism that causes the high using the proposed formula and found that the high value mainly originated from attenuation of the confined PL emission that occurred during orbiting within the WGM resonators. This result suggests that the formula will be beneficial in clarifying the dominant factor that governs .},

  abstract     = {In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: (i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate, (ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and (iii) asymptotic DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: (i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, (ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and (iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DS generation. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr 2 + :ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.},

It is observed that the explosive evolution undergoes a disintegrating process from a multi-SR state to a normal SR, and to a soliton group followed by annihilation, and eventually to the explosion. Continuous observations reveal that each explosion exhibits a decay, a sudden drop, and an eruption of energy, thereby manifesting a quasiperiodic characteristic. A numerical experiment has effectively simulated the explosive processes and confirmed the Q -switching effect inside the collective soliton explosions. An analysis of the orbit diagrams derived from nonlinear mapping solidly substantiates the origin of the SR explosions: a gain-modulated mode-locking mechanism. These findings unveil an extreme collective soliton behavior in dissipative systems.},

Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the coexistence of conventional zero, modes, and the new modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.},

  abstract     = {Photonic lattice modulations, such as lattice distortions achieved by stress-strain engineering, have been crucial for the development of various fields of photonics, in particular, topological photonics. Here we modulate the Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic graphene lattices by utilizing a Lorentz-like transformation applied to the lattice sites. The modulated lattice may fall into two categories, according to the symmetry axis of the lattice. If the axis is aligned in the diagonal direction through the unit cells, the lattice belongs to case II; otherwise, it belongs to case I. For the case-I transformed lattice, the Dirac cones always disappear from the band structure, whereas for the case-II transformed lattice, the Dirac cones only disappear if the transformation angle θ is larger than that of the regular lattice, θ = π / 2 . The Lorentz-like transformation always helps to restore the parity-time ( PT ) symmetry in the non-Hermitian case-I photonic graphene lattices. In the case II of transformed non-Hermitian lattices, the PT symmetry can be restored as well, but only for θ > π / 2 . When θ < π / 2 , one obtains exceptional lines in the band structure of the lattice. These results demonstrate that the Lorentz-like transformation can serve as an effective tool to modulate photonic lattices and thus may inspire novel ideas in the manipulation of photonic topological insulators.},

This approach involves interfacing a quantum cascade laser (QCL) with an external reflector featuring frequency-dependent reflectivity. A notable advantage of this method over existing ones is its dual functionality in shaping HFCs, allowing for control over both the frequency offset and comb spacing based on the external reflectivity profile. Moreover, the resulting HFCs manifest as sequences of short pulses in the time domain. Consequently, our method enables the generation of ultrashort picosecond pulses passively, providing a distinct alternative to conventional pulse generation systems reliant on active bias current modulation, which struggle with modulation frequencies significantly higher than the first beat note. This offers intriguing prospects for utilizing HFCs in pump and probe spectroscopy, a field already recognized in the literature as one of the most compelling applications of these states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these HFCs can be triggered from an initial condition of free-running unlocked dynamics, eliminating the need for assuming free-running comb emission. Thus, the utilization of an external, frequency-dependent reflector is capable of enhancing the coherence of the QCL emission.},

By exploiting two kinds of exceptional surfaces (ESs) derived from the design of the waveguide structure, we study the transmission spectra and fast-slow light phenomena at various EPs on these ESs, and we identify ES-protected transmission spectra that are robust to parameter fluctuations. Consequently, the system exhibits a complete reversal of both transmission and fast-slow light behavior at EPs compared with those at non-EPs when the phase transition occurs.

  abstract     = {We present and theoretically demonstrate a method for generating helicity-selected near-circularly polarized attosecond pulses in mixed He-Ne gases using bichromatic counter-rotating circularly polarized (BCCP) fields. High-order harmonics driven by BCCP fields exhibit circular polarization for individual orders in the frequency domain, but adjacent orders have opposite helicities. By utilizing the He-Ne mixture, we select only one helical component of the harmonics, resulting in the generation of highly elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in the time domain. Our analyses based on the quantum-orbit theory and the strong-field approximation further clarify that the polarization of attosecond pulses is governed by the interference mechanism of high-order harmonics emitted by He and Ne. This combination of BCCP fields and an atomic mixture which requires no alignment in experiments significantly simplifies the generation of elliptically polarized harmonics dominated by one helical component, thereby paving the way for an efficient and robust method to generate bright attosecond pulses with large ellipticity.},

The nonlinear process is driven by a single continuous-wave (cw) laser in a pure two-level system due to the forward geometry with circular and parallel polarization of the input fields. The intensity cross correlations of the four-wave mixing signals and the transmission signals present an oscillatory behavior with a clear dependence on the power of the incident fields, which indicates a connection with Rabi oscillations. A two-level theoretical model using stochastic differential equations to account for the mechanism of conversion of phase noise into amplitude noise shows good agreement with our experimental results.

The entire composite medium is composed of two segments, the first segment with self-focusing nonlinearity and the second segment with self-defocusing nonlinearity. In the self-focusing segment, a temporal pulse sequence is generated via the formation of a dark soliton train due to the nonlinearity acting on the modulation. In the self-defocusing segment, these temporal pulses can be effectively compressed into the controlled and isolated ultrashort solitons via the temporal compression method, as long as the time delay between double pulses and the ratio of the self-focusing segment are suitably set. Interestingly, when the ratio of the self-focusing segment is relatively small, a giant soliton can be produced by the combined effect of temporal compression and soliton collision, which exhibits an extremely high intensity and a significant redshift but does not need to follow the L -shaped intensity probability distribution.},

Using the photocurrent model and far-field coherent superposition method, we show that two-color laser-induced air filaments can generate terahertz radiation with independent control on both its polarization and amplitude when a circularly polarized fundamental wave and an elliptically polarized second harmonic are adopted. The polarization of the terahertz radiation, including polarization angle and polarization ellipticity, can be controlled independently by tuning the initial relative phase between two-color components and the filament length, respectively. Meanwhile, by increasing the polarization ellipticity of the second harmonic from − 1 (with polarization opposite to the fundamental wave) to 1, the amplitude of the terahertz radiation can be tuned continuously from 0 to its maximum with its polarization fixed at a desirable state. Our studies provide an all-optical method for the manipulation of multiple parameters of terahertz radiation, which is useful for terahertz science.},

Here, we propose a method to efficiently generate multimode non-Gaussian entangled states using a single Rb vapor cell integrated with a cyclic optical system. By employing multiple pump light pulses and recycling the output signal light as a seed light, our system is equivalent to implementing the multiple cascaded four-wave mixing processes while maintaining resource efficiency. Through the analysis of the properties of multipartite steering and entanglement in the cyclic system, we find a hierarchical Gaussian steering structure, which enables the photon number projection on superior signal mode to prepare a multimode entangled non-Gaussian state in the idler modes. Conversely, the projection on each subordinate idler mode can induce more negativity in the signal mode. More importantly, our approach significantly improves the success probability of photon number projections, thereby augmenting the yield of non-Gaussian states and enhancing their potential for delivering robust quantum advantages.},

By studying the interferometric signal at 1 GHz, next to the usual phase term we discover the existence of an amplitude-modulated term which vanishes at periodic positions when we displace the acoustic device relative to the beam focus. With this, we reveal the optical Talbot effect where, despite the curved wavefronts of the optical field, the conventional Talbot length appears.

In this article, we propose a theoretical model for analyzing the operational mechanism of the adaptive distributed-feedback semiconductor laser. Theoretical and experimental results show that achieving adaptive linewidth compression requires tens of or more feedback points. On the basis of sufficient feedback points, increasing the feedback length and ratio can achieve an ultranarrow laser linewidth and high side-mode suppression ratio.

  abstract     = {A fairly large number of optical frequency comb (OFC) generation methods have been proposed and practically implemented to date. All of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, the application of bulk whispering gallery modes or on-chip optical ring microresonators allows one to obtain soliton Kerr combs in the spectral band achieving tens of nm and containing hundreds of lines. However, the spectral spacing between these lines will be determined by the dimensions of the microresonator and, as a rule, ranges from tens to hundreds of GHz. On the other hand, the application of frequency-shifting loop (FSL) systems with an acousto-optic (AO) device as the frequency shifter allows one to obtain OFCs with a frequency spacing of tens of MHz, but the spectral band of the AO FSL OFCs containing several thousand lines will hardly exceed 0.5 nm. In this paper, we propose a method to expand the AO FSL OFCs' spectral band applying multifrequency optical seeding. As a source of such seeding we propose to use lines of a soliton comb spectrum generated with an optical microresonator. This approach can also be considered as a method for enriching the optical spectrum of the microresonator OFC by adding spectral components generated in AO FSLs with a frequency spacing that is a multiple of the seeding soliton microcomb lines' frequency spacing. The paper presents the results of an experiment that confirms the possibility of implementation of such a concept.},

In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.},

Here we exemplify a hybrid molecule-metal system and decouple the two contributions to surface-enhanced Raman-scattering (SERS) intensity. Our findings demonstrate the nanoscale near-field enhancement can be estimated with only the measured far-field SERS intensity. Notably, the chemical effect on the SERS signal exhibits an essentially different response against the enhanced near field between molecular vibrational lines. Hence, this work may be helpful in better understanding the origin of the anomalously changed Raman patterns when adsorbates upon metal surfaces, but also offers heuristic insights into the underlying interactions between various enhancement effects in surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {High-order harmonic generation (HHG) plays a key role in producing coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and x-ray radiation, which is crucial for applications in attosecond science and high-energy density physics. The intensity and order of high-order harmonics are crucial for advancing their applications. In this paper, a scheme is proposed to generate harmonics by the relativistic oscillating mirror (ROM) based on the energy exchange between electron and excited plasma wave by Landau damping, which employs dual laser pulses to sequentially excite the plasma surface electron oscillation to enhance the intensity and order of harmonics. Through theory and numerical analysis, we discover that our scheme significantly enhances the intensity of higher-order harmonics by an order of magnitude compared to typical harmonic generation methods of the same energy, and observe the higher-order harmonics. Furthermore, we investigate the essential factors affecting energy exchange in Landau damping and find that there exists an optimal pulse interval and energy ratio to maximize the energy exchange. The scheme based on Landau damping for generating high-order harmonics offers an alternative perspective for advancing HHG research and applications.},

Motion could be natural, where the set of positions is estimated or separately obtained, or directed, where a mechanical stage can be used to adjust the object's position. In the experiment, a coherent laser illuminates two scattering diffusers, while an object is translated between them in the resulting speckled field and images are collected in a transmission configuration. Results are shown for various objects of differing size and geometry, allowing the theory to be validated and interpreted with new understanding. This work demonstrates imaging opportunities, and applications include material characterization, environmental imaging and sensing, and deep-tissue in vivo imaging.},

  abstract     = {We describe a gyroscope that measures rotation based on the effects of the rotation on the polarization of light. Rotation induces a differential phase shift in the propagation of left- and right-circularly polarized light and this phase shift can be measured in suitably designed interferometric setups. The signal in this setup is independent of the frequency of light, unlike various sources of noise such as vibrations, which cause phase shifts that depend on the frequency. Such vibrations are the practical limit on the sensitivity of conventional Sagnac-style optical interferometers that are typically used as gyroscopes. In the proposed setup, one can potentially mitigate this source of noise by simultaneously using two (or more) sources of light that have different frequencies. The signal in this setup scales with the total storage time of the light. Due to its frequency independence, it is thus most optimal to measure the signal using superconducting radio-frequency systems where the high finesse of the available cavities enables considerably longer storage times than is possible in an optical setup.},

The wetting phase diagram was found to depend on intrinsic atomic parameters, being the masses and the scattering lengths, and on the extrinsic wall boundary condition. Here we study wetting transitions in GP theory without an optical wall in a setting with three phase-segregated BEC components instead of two. The boundary condition is removed by replacing the wall with the third component and treating the three phases on an equal footing. This leads to an unequivocal wetting phase diagram that depends only on intrinsic atomic parameters. It features first-order and critical wetting transitions, and prewetting phenomena. The phase boundaries are computed by numerical solution of the GP equations. In addition, useful analytic results are obtained by extending the established double-parabola approximation to three components.},

  abstract     = {Configurable arrays of optically trapped Rydberg atoms are a versatile platform for quantum computation and quantum simulation, also allowing controllable decoherence. We demonstrate theoretically that they also enable proof-of-principle demonstrations for a technique to build models for open quantum dynamics using machine learning with artificial neural networks, recently proposed by Mukherjee et al. [ Quantum Sci. Technol. 10 , 02LT01 (2025) ]. Using the outcome of quantum transport through a network of sites that correspond to excited Rydberg atoms, the multistage neural-network algorithm successfully identifies the number of atoms (or nodes in the network) and, subsequently, their location. It further extracts an effective interaction Hamiltonian and decoherence operators induced by the environment. To probe the Rydberg array, one initiates dynamics repeatedly from the same initial state and then measures the transport probability to an output atom. Large datasets are generated by varying the position of the latter. Measurements are required in only one single basis, making the approach complementary to, e.g., quantum process tomography. Due to steeply increasing requirements for training data size, the present implementation appears best suited for networks of just a few sites. The cold-atom platform discussed in this article can be used to explore the performance of the proposed protocol when training the neural network with simulation data but then applying it to construct models based on experimental data.},

We also show that the system supports both bright maxon and dark roton solitons if the center wave numbers of excited wave packets are chosen respectively to be those of the maxon and roton. Moreover, we corroborate that both the maxon and roton solitons are dynamical stable during the evolution if system parameters are kept in the domain where the homogeneous background of the BEC is modulationally stable. The results reported are beneficial not only for understanding the physical property of Rydberg-dressed BECs, but also for creating and actively manipulating new types of nonlinear matter-wave excitations in cold atomic gases.},

Our findings reveal that in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the superfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a) attractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density defect region, and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute environments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive to attractive angulon states as the bath density increases.

The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local-density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal population to population imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)–like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg excitation, the transition towards population imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory “clumpy states” to compensate for the local-density difference.

  abstract     = {Calculating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems theoretically is a challenging problem. Essentially exact results can be obtained for the out-of-equilibrium correlations in the Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension, but higher dimensions require approximate methods. One such method is the two-particle irreducible strong coupling (2PISC) approach [M. R. C. Fitzpatrick and M. P. Kennett, Nucl. Phys. B 930 , 1 (2018) ]. Calculations of the single-particle correlations using this method yield values of the velocity for correlation spreading that match well with exact methods in one dimension and experiments in one and two dimensions. However, the 2PISC method is less accurate for determining the amplitude of correlations, especially in the regime where interactions are not very strong. Viewing the calculation of the single-particle correlations as an image correction problem, we train a neural network (NN) to take input from the 2PISC approach to reproduce the output of exact diagonalization calculations. We show that the predictions of the NN improve on 2PISC results for parameters outside the training region. Our approach is not specific to the Bose-Hubbard model and may find application to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of other quantum many-body systems.},

This paper provides detailed information on the derivation and analysis of the inelastic quantum Boltzmann equation (IQBE) used to describe the system. We demonstrate that the Mellin transform is a powerful tool for solving and approximating the IQBE for free-space systems. In this case, the particle-number dynamics are beyond the description of the widely used phenomenological two-body equation. For harmonically trapped systems, we propose a fast-flowing approximation to simplify the numerical evaluation of the IQBE. We verify the approximation in an analogous quasi-one-dimensional system and apply it to three-dimensional calculations, obtaining satisfactory agreement with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we compare the nonequilibrium results with those obtained using a thermal ansatz in both situations, providing a systematic understanding of the antievaporation phenomena observed in such systems.},

  abstract     = {Quantum mixtures of Bose gases with tunable s - and p -wave interactions offer a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated phases and exotic phenomena. While repulsive interactions often drive phase separation, the interplay of p -wave interactions with spin-density decoupling remains underexplored. In this work we employ the path-integral field theory to investigate the role of p -wave interactions in three-dimensional two-component Bose gas. We derive the Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion, revealing how p -wave interactions modify equations of state of the model system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p -wave interactions predominantly renormalize the spin-sector effective mass in the language of decoupling the density and spin-density degrees of freedom. This effect manifests in the dynamic structure factor, computed via hydrodynamic theory, where Bragg spectroscopy can detect a tunable splitting between spin and density modes. Our results bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, offering insights into anisotropic interaction effects in quantum gases and their implications for probing emergent phases.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the recent realization of the Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) model for the minimal spin-orbit-coupled quantum anomalous Hall phase in ultracold fermions, we introduce the on-site attractive interaction and map out the topological phase diagram for the Qi-Wu-Zhang-Hubbard (QWZH) model at the mean-field level. We show that, in addition to the conventional chiral topological superfluids (TSs) with nonzero Chern number, there is also an obstructed superfluid (OSF) with zero Chern number in the extended region of phase space. This phase is characterized by gapless edge states completely detaching from the bulk energy bands and two Z 2 numbers. We find the gapless edge states in OSF are protected by particle-hole symmetry and robust for the disorder. The appearance of OSF demonstrates that it is not sufficient to label TSs in the two-dimensional D class only by Chern numbers. These different topological phases in the attractive QWZH model can be detected experimentally by spin-resolved time-of-flight imaging. We also plot the phase diagram of the attractive QWZH model with one-dimensional spin-orbit coupling and find a series of TSs with gapless Dirac points. Considering the successful realization of the QWZ model and the tremendous progress in manipulating cold atom systems, our work provides a possible route to realize OSF in cold fermionic systems in the future.},

In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially, we consider a two-dimensional quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions, the local speed of sound and the magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogs of black and white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform-density acoustic-black-hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.},

We theoretically investigate the dynamics of Josephson vortices (rotational fluxons) induced by coupled persistent currents in a system of coplanar double-ring atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. We study the Josephson effect in an atomic Josephson junction formed by coaxial ring-shaped condensates. Tunneling superflows, initiated by an imbalance in atomic populations between the rings, are significantly influenced by the persistent currents in the inner and outer rings. This results in pronounced Josephson oscillations in the population imbalance for both corotating and nonrotating states. If a linear acceleration is applied to the system, our analysis reveals peculiar azimuthal tunneling patterns and dynamics of Josephson vortices which leads to nonzero net tunneling current and shows sensitivity to the acceleration magnitude. When multiple Josephson vortices are present, asymmetric vortex displacements that correlate with both the magnitude and direction of acceleration can be measured, offering the potential for quantum sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Bosonic Josephson junctions provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum tunneling and coherence phenomena in ultracold atomic systems. While extensive research has examined the Josephson-junction dynamics in various double-well configurations, most studies have been limited to inertial reference frames. In the present work we pose the question how placing a Josephson junction in a noninertial reference frame would impact the quantum tunneling. Our findings demonstrate that accelerating a Josephson junction alters the tunneling dynamics. Conversely, tunneling behavior can be used to assess the acceleration of the system. By analyzing the changes in physical properties, we can assess the acceleration of the double well. We begin with the most simple noninertial frame: moving with constant acceleration. The tunneling time decreases exponentially as acceleration increases, making it effective for measuring larger accelerations. However, for smaller accelerations, accurate assessment requires accounting for many-body depletion, which decreases linearly as acceleration rises. Next we explore a more complex scenario where the acceleration is time dependent. In this case, the acceleration is mapped onto the tunneling time period and depletion, which again serve as predictors of acceleration. We also explore how the tunneling time and condensate depletion are affected by changes in the interparticle interaction. We go further by conducting a detailed analysis of the change in tunneling dynamics when the system deviates from constant or zero acceleration. The quantitative analysis shows that the depletion changes exponentially near constant acceleration, while around zero acceleration, the change follows a polynomial pattern. A comprehensive analysis of the effects of damped motion on the condensate depletion is performed as well. All in all, we quantify how the tunneling process and the mean-field and many-body properties evolve in a noninertial system of increasing complexity.},

  abstract     = {Impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can interact indirectly through the exchange of Bogoliubov excitations. These impurities, which form dressed quasiparticles known as Bose polarons due to their interaction with the BEC, can pair up to form a bound state called a bipolaron, via an induced interaction. Previous studies on induced interactions have focused primarily on cases with an isotropic excitation spectrum. In this work, we investigate the properties of induced interactions and bipolarons mediated by anisotropic Bogoliubov excitations using field theory. Taking a BEC with spin-orbit coupling as an example, we show that the induced interaction becomes anisotropic. Notably, a double-minima feature appears in the induced interaction in momentum space due to the exchange of roton excitations. Additionally, we calculate the binding energy and wave functions of these bipolarons induced by anisotropic interactions. Unlike previously studied bipolarons formed through the exchange of isotropic phonon excitations, we identify an alternative type of bipolaron whose wave functions feature a double-peak structure under strong impurity-boson interactions. Our work extends the theory of induced interactions from isotropic to anisotropic systems, and it reveals the novel features in both the induced interactions and bipolarons arising from BEC with an unconventional excitation spectrum.},

At discrete sets of commensurate twisting angles, a moiré periodic pattern is formed, and the low-energy single-particle spectrum forms distinct bands and gaps. Here, we consider twisted systems at a commensurate angle made of two continuous-space periodic potentials. We devise a general approach, based on a hierarchy of energy scales, to derive effective tight-binding models that capture the energy spectrum, focusing on the case of square lattices. Localized states in the moiré unit cell are coupled by strong intracell and weak intercell tunnelings, generating a series of energy bands and subbands that correspond to distinct, periodic lattices. For sufficiently deep potentials, we find excellent agreement between the spectrum of the continuous-space system and the tight-binding approximation thus constructed. Our approach allows for the interpretation of moiré band structures and the extraction of parameters for the effective tight-binding models. Applications to the physics of many-body systems and extensions to other twisted models are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice after a sudden quench from the superfluid phase to the free-boson regime. The initial superfluid state is described approximately using both the Bogoliubov theory and the Gaussian variational principle. The subsequent time evolution remains Gaussian, and we compare the results from each approximation of the initial state by examining different aspects of the dynamics. First, we analyze the entanglement entropy and observe that, in both cases, it increases linearly with time before reaching a saturation point. This behavior is attributed to the propagation of entangled pairs of quantum depletions in the superfluid state. Next, we explore the fate of particle-number symmetry, which is spontaneously broken in the superfluid phase. To do so, we use the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that enables us to track symmetry breaking within a subsystem. We observe that its evolution varies qualitatively depending on the theory used to describe the initial state. However, in both cases, the symmetry remains broken and is never restored in the stationary state. Finally, we assess the time it takes to reach the stationary state by evaluating the quantum fidelity between the stationary reduced density matrix and the time-evolved one. Interestingly, within the Gaussian variational principle, we find that an initial state further from the stationary state can relax more quickly than one closer to it, indicating the presence of the recently discovered quantum Mpemba effect. We derive the microscopic conditions necessary for this effect to occur and demonstrate that these conditions are never met in the Bogoliubov theory.},

For the ferromagnetic condensate, the ground state shows an amplitude-modulated plane-wave state, where its modulated amplitude and frequency are related to the strength of the soft-core interaction and SU(3) spin-orbit coupling, respectively. In particular, due to the subtle balance of the soft-core interaction and SU(3) spin-orbit coupling, a stable higher-order spin vortex lattice can be formed in the lattice phase of an antiferromagnetic condensate, where the density distributions of each component and the total system show spatial configurations with threefold and sixfold symmetries, respectively.

  abstract     = {An electrospray ion source has been coupled to a cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring to enable experimental studies of the fundamental properties of biomolecular ions and their reactions in the gas phase on longer timescales than with previous instruments. Using this equipment, we have measured the vibrational radiative cooling rate of the deprotonated anion of the chromophore of the cyan fluorescent protein, a color-shifted mutant of the iconic green fluorescent protein. Time-resolved dissociation rates of collisionally activated ions are first measured to benchmark a model of the dissociation rate coefficient. Storage time-dependent laser-induced dissociation rates are then measured to probe the evolution of the internal energy distribution of the stored ion ensemble. We find that significant heating of the electrosprayed ions occurs upon their extraction from the ion source, and that the radiative cooling rate is consistent with the prediction of a simple harmonic cascade model of vibrational relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Studies of high harmonic generation (HHG) have entered a new stage by using the quantum light instead of the classical field. Recent theoretical progress has demonstrated promising features, such as the significantly higher maximum harmonic photon energy in a squeezed or thermal light field, which is not observed under classical field conditions with the same number of fundamental mode photons. However, there are many approximations in the theoretical treatments. More accurate methods are required to check the appealing results. By employing the generalized von Neumann lattice basis, here we develop a general and precise method to describe the HHG process, taking into account the coherent superposition of the diagonal part components and the nondiagonal part components from the overlap of the coherent states. It can be extended to calculate the multimode quantum light, such as two-mode squeezed vacuum. Our study provides a powerful tool for investigating the full properties of quantum light in HHG.},

Utilizing a three-level model, we demonstrate that the multipeak structure for the rectangular pulse is attributed to single-slit diffraction in the time domain, rather than to dynamic interference as in the sin-squared pulse. Furthermore, we show that the photoelectron yield of these peaks oscillates with laser intensity for both pulse shapes, with the yields from resonant and nonresonant paths oscillating in opposite directions. This oscillatory behavior is attributed to interference between split energy levels in the energy domain. Our work completes the understanding of the multipeak structure in Rabi oscillations for different laser pulse shapes and provides a way to manipulate the yield of these peaks through laser intensity.},

For trapped ions, electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling has received attention for the relative speed, low laser power requirements, and broad cooling bandwidth of the technique. However, in applications where the ion used for cooling has hyperfine structure to enable long coherence times, it is difficult to find a closed three-level system in which to perform standard EIT cooling. Here, we demonstrate successful EIT cooling on Mg + 25 by the addition of an extra laser frequency; this method can be applied to any ion with nonzero nuclear spin. Furthermore, we simultaneously EIT cool all axial modes in mixed-species crystals Be + 9 − Mg + 25 and Be + 9 − Mg + 25 − Be + 9 through the Mg + 25 ion. This demonstrates the viability of EIT cooling in architectures where the laser-cooled species can host high-fidelity hyperfine qubits.},

Suppression of a false-cumulant signal may impose severe restrictions on the stability of the experimental setup and/or the permissible average event rate, which increase with cumulant order.

We use the Dalgarno-Lewis method to obtain both numerically exact results and accurate analytic expressions for short- and long-range contributions to the wave packets condensing information from the initial state and its coupling with the infinitely many virtual intermediate states in these two-photon processes. We identify some specific conditions under which short- and long-range terms adding up into the intermediate state induce radial matrix elements to hold competing coherent contributions for both single- and two-color cases.

  abstract     = {Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-range electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far have focused on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario not only is important in the case of possible field misalignment but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in two- and three-dimensional ion crystals, we develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are important requirements for conducting coherent manipulations.},

By tuning the relative phase of the two-color laser pulse, we can extract the partial-wave complex amplitudes from the photoelectron angular distributions. Our analysis shows that controlling the fundamental frequency of the bichromatic pulses enables us to resolve resonant and nonresonant channels simultaneously. Taking the hydrogen atom as the prototype, at the resonant frequency, while the g partial wave is resonance-free, the quantum phases of the s and d partial waves and the corresponding Wigner time delays are significantly influenced by the intermediate resonance.

This cyclic motion is also present if the full time-dependent dynamics are taken into consideration. However, there are time delays regarding the time-averaged potential, and some tail-shaped spilling of the quasiprobability flow towards higher momentum regions. These tails are signatures of ionization, indicating that, for the potential studied in this work, a small momentum spread is associated with stabilization. A comparison of the quasiprobability flow with classical phase-space constraints shows that, for the KH atom, the momentum must be bounded from above. This is a major difference from a molecule, for which the quasiprobability flow is confined in position space for small internuclear separation. Furthermore, we assess the stability of different propagation strategies and find that the most stable scenario for the full dynamics is obtained if the system is initially prepared in the KH ground state.},

  abstract     = {The complex physics of inner-shell ionization of target atoms by heavy-ion impact has remained only partially solved for decades. Recently, agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved by considering inner-shell ionization of target atoms due to projectile electron capture in addition to direct Coulomb ionization including multiple ionization effects. A thorough investigation exhibits such a picture only if the atomic parameters of the target atoms are correct. In fact, the theoretical approach is found to be right, but the problem arises with the faulty atomic parameters. Furthermore, we show that fluorescence yields play a major role among the atomic parameters. We explore such a powerful method that enables us to measure the correct and accurate fluorescence yields for almost every element in the periodic table. As per our present knowledge, this, in turn, not only solves the said complex issue fully but also makes the particle/proton-induced x-ray emission analysis more reliable and accurate using both light and heavy ions.},

  abstract     = {Classical trajectory Monte Carlo calculations for fast positron and electron impact ionization of argon are used to provide information about how the pre- and postcollision kinematics alter the triply differential spectra. It is shown that in addition to the scattering direction expected for a positive or negative projectile passing near a partially screened nuclear charge, scattering in the opposite direction also occurs. Independent of energy transfer, when the impact parameter is less than the mean radius of the electron cloud, the expected direction of scattering always occurs. In contrast, for scattering in the opposite direction, the impact parameter is larger than the mean radius for low energy transfer but decreases to values near the radius for large energy transfer. The change in impact parameter and direction of scattering are shown to influence the recoil to binary triply differential cross-section ratios and explains the unexpectantly large ratios that have been observed at higher emission energies and may explain the larger ratio observed for electron impact.},

Here we report the experimental observation of a nonlocal decay process, i.e., nonadiabatic-coupling-mediated charge transfer (NCMCT), in argon dimer. This process can be effectively produced and manipulated by the double electron capture in low-charge-state oxygen ion collisions. Compared to other common decay mechanisms of dication, the NCMCT process results in notably different kinetic energy releases for the channel. It is due, revealed by theoretical calculations, to the special potential energy curve of the responsible state that possesses many crossing points and thus nonadiabatically couples with the states in a wide internuclear distance range. Such an NCMCT process is expected to be a general process occurring in weakly bound systems when highly excited. The present work provides a prime collision system to explore the charge transfer in ion-molecule reactions and also brings insight into cluster dissociation mechanism.},

The solved vibration wave functions have both the angular quantum number and the symmetric or antisymmetric properties with respect to the -Ar axis. The theoretical calculation shows that laser-induced molecular vibrational excitation needs to satisfy the selection rules of nonresonant Raman processes. Two modes of excitation are further distinguished as follows: (1) and the symmetry does not change; here, the van der Waals bond will be strengthened. (2) and the symmetry is reversed; here, the dimer will be partially excited into a linear structure. Our results point out that the initially located in the ground vibrational state mainly prefers the excitation of mode (1), but the one located in the first excited state will undergo two modes of excitation simultaneously.},

The hyperfine-structure properties encompass first-order hyperfine-structure parameters, as well as second-order and third-order corrections caused by the off-diagonal hyperfine interaction. Based on our theoretical results, we reanalyze the previously reported measurement of the hyperfine interval for the 2 s 2 p P 3 state in Be 9 [A. G. Blachman and A. Lurio, Phys. Rev. 153 , 164 (1967) ], yielding updated hyperfine-structure constants. Our results show that the hyperfine-structure constant B of 2 s 2 p P 1 3 is notably sensitive to second-order correction. Conversely, accurately determining the hyperfine-structure constant B of 2 s 2 p P 2 3 necessitates consideration of the magnetic octupole hyperfine interaction in the first-order hyperfine interaction equation. The updated hyperfine-structure constant B of the 2 s 2 p P 2 3 state is found to be 1.4542(67) MHz, which is approximately 1.7 % larger than the previous value of 1.427(9) MHz [A. G. Blachman and A.

By combining our theoretical results with the updated hyperfine-structure constant for the 2 s 2 p P 2 3 state, we extract the electric quadrupole moment Q of Be 9 nucleus to be 0.05320(50) b. This value is consistent with the most recent determination using the few-body precision calculation method [Puchalski et al. Phys. Rev. Res. 3 , 013293 (2021) ]. Additionally, we discuss the reasons for the discrepancy between the electric quadrupole moment Q obtained through few-body and previous many-body calculations.},

The potential energy calculations reveal that hydrogen migration reduces the energy barrier of C-C bond cleavage, thereby promoting the fragmentation of acetonitrile dications. Moreover, we find that, instead of transferring to the nitrogen atom yielding the double hydrogen migration channel, the roaming H 2 captures a proton or transfers an electron to the remaining moiety, leading to the formation of H 3 + and H 2 + cations. This work provides insight into the competitive interplay between hydrogen migration and Coulomb explosion mechanisms in molecular fragmentation.},

Although Rydberg molecules formed between alkali atoms have received the most attention, the additional complexity found in atoms with more than a single valence electron poses new theoretical challenges as well as new possibilities for control and design of the molecular structure. In this paper, we extend the theory of Rydberg molecules to include the additional spin coupling of the Rydberg states of a multivalent atom. We employ this theory to describe the properties of Rydberg molecules composed of mercury atoms. We calculate the potential energy curves of both heteronuclear ( Hg * Rb ) and homonuclear ( Hg * Hg ) molecules. In the former case, we propose the realization of long-range spin entanglement and remote spin flip. In the latter, we show how long-lived metastable molecular states of Hg * Hg exist as resonances above the dissociation threshold.},

  abstract     = {Precise evaluation of the isotope shift (IS) factors for seven low-lying potassium states is achieved using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. The energies of these states are compared with the experimental data to confirm the accuracy of wave functions calculated at different approximations and to highlight the significance of many-body and relativistic effects. Various methods are used to compute the IS factors, with the finite-field (FF) approach yielding results that align with observed and semiempirical data. This is attributed to orbital relaxation effects that are present naturally in the FF method but emerge only through perturbation in other methods. Using results from the FF approach, we review the mean-square-radius difference between 38 m K and K 39 , which is combined with muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy and updated calculation of the nuclear polarizability effect to deduce the absolute radius of 38 m K . Finally, we evaluate the isospin symmetry breaking (ISB) in the isotriplet by integrating the radius of 38 m K with an updated radius of Ca 38 , concluding that the ISB is compatible with zero. This finding offers a stringent benchmark for nuclear models of ISB corrections in nuclear beta decay, which play a key role in determining the V u d matrix element.},

Angular scans of the scattering yield were performed on a W(110) and a Fe(100) single crystal using and beams with energies of 3 keV/atom using a time-of-flight low-energy ion scattering setup. Information on the interatomic potentials was deduced by reproducing width and intensity of minima and maxima in the angular scans in molecular dynamics simulations by adjusting the assumed screening length with a correction factor. Results from experiments were compared to common interatomic potential models and density functional theory predictions. Our measurements show that the uncorrected Thomas-Fermi-Molière and the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark potentials overestimate the interatomic potential for the studied combinations. In contrast, the Yamamura-Takeuchi-Kawamura potential yields values slightly below our experimental result. At the same time, density functional theory predictions agree well with our experimental results for the He cases while differing significantly for the D cases.},

The complete set of ɛ B values is presented including, where necessary, updated analyses of previous data to provide more accurate values of ɛ B . The result is a dataset of 85 distinct hydrocarbon molecules and 29 deuterated analogs with ɛ B values ranging in precision from ± 3 to ± 20 meV. Linear regression analysis is used to estimate ɛ B using the global molecular parameters polarizability α , permanent dipole moment μ , and the number of π bonds N π associated aromatic molecules and those with unsaturated bonds. Use of an optimized expansion for the entire dataset predicts ɛ B to within a root-mean-square error of ≈ 30 meV. This expression can provide useful estimates of ɛ B for molecular species similar to those in the existing dataset but for which ɛ B has not been measured. Chemical species for which this regression analysis is not valid are discussed. Complementary analyses are made for restricted ranges of global parameters, and these empirical expressions provide additional insight into the underlying physical mechanisms for positron-molecule binding. The results are related to recent many-body theory calculations of the bound-state positron wave functions.},

Our spectroscopy technique involves polarization modulation and lock-in detection yielding microradian-level optical rotation resolution. At temperatures where direct absorption was significant for both E1 and M1 transitions, we also extracted matrix element values from a direct optical absorption depth comparison.

Results are compared from the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, third-order many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(3) method], random-phase approximation (RPA) and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster theory (RCCSD method). We find the DHF and RPA results are close to each other, while the MBPT(3) and RCCSD results are close to each other. This suggests that pair-correlation effects play significant roles over core-polarization effects to determine these quantities accurately in the above alkali-metal atoms. We also compare contributions arising through the core, core-valence, and valence correlations through all the methods in Li, Na, and K, which show that the core-valence contributions are negligibly small in all the methods and there is no particular trends of the core and valence correlation contributions with the size of the atom. Uncertainties to the RCCSD results are estimated to quote the final values, and they are compared with the previous calculations and experimental results.},

Recent study [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 206402 (2024) ] has demonstrated that hypercomplex orbitals in a determinant are equivalent to a set of real-valued orbitals that allow fractional occupations, making them desirable fundamental descriptors for many-electron systems. The algebraic properties of Clifford algebra are rigorously applied to derive key quantities within HCOFT, addressing the complexities introduced by the hypercomplex representation. It is shown that, despite this added complexity, the resulting density and kinetic energy remain physically meaningful and satisfy essential properties, including the Pauli exclusion principle. To establish the uniqueness of HCOFT, alternative definitions of hypercomplex orbitals within Clifford algebra are explored. These alternatives can lead to the loss of physical meaning in fundamental quantities for many-electron systems. Overall, this work demonstrates that HCOFT not only preserves the desired physical properties but also provides a single-determinant framework capable of describing multireference systems.},

The effects of these interactions may be described in terms of the two main energy-loss parameters, namely, the stopping power and the energy-loss straggling; these are the main parameters that characterize the interaction of external particles with the plasma. Here we perform a comparative study of the ionic and electronic contributions to the stopping and the straggling for the hydrogen isotopes, alpha particles, positrons, and muons, traversing different types of plasmas: tokamak plasmas, the dense helium region of a giant star, and the solar interior. To calculate these parameters we apply a quantum approach to describe the interaction of charged particles with plasmas, based on one side on the quantum dielectric plasma model, which includes a full description of statistical effects on energy exchange processes together with a quantum treatment of electron excitations. In addition, we incorporate the effect of the plasma ions through a semiclassical dielectric function that combines a quantum description of plasma electrons with a classical dielectric model for plasma ions. Through various examples we analyze the partial (electronic and ionic) and total contributions to the stopping power and energy straggling for protons, positrons, and muons. The comparison between these cases provides insights into the effects of statistical fluctuations and ionic contributions to the energy-loss processes for each of these particles and different plasma media.},

  abstract     = {The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.},

  abstract     = {Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables the efficient distribution of unconditionally secure keys for both communicating parties. Despite significant advancements in optical-based CV-QKD, a persistent challenge is the limited resilience of optical quantum signals to atmospheric noise in free-space channels. This susceptibility leads to considerable degradation in the performance of optical CV-QKD systems, particularly under adverse climatic conditions. Meanwhile, recent advancements in superconducting quantum computing have driven the demand for quantum communication between spatially separated superconducting processors operating at microwave frequencies. To solve the problems, we propose a Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol operating at microwave frequencies, utilizing traveling-wave parametric amplifiers to generate entangled states. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that CV-QKD at microwave frequencies enables secure communication in a free-space channel at room temperature. Furthermore, we show that this protocol outperforms the THz frequency protocol over a distance of 20 m and exhibits stronger immunity to interference. Finally, we consider the impact of microwave antenna gain on the protocol's performance, highlighting the decisive role of antenna gain in determining the maximum transmission distance in practical application scenarios.},

Quantum-classical interfaces (QCIs) are ubiquitous in devices such as optical modulators, quantum sensors, and signal processors, where classical signals influence quantum dynamics. In this paper, we employ the Lindblad master equation to simulate the evolution of a quantum system interacting with a classical control system. Our model captures both linear and nonlinear interactions by incorporating first- and second-order susceptibilities, and it quantifies the influence of externally applied control parameters on decoherence and state evolution. As an illustrative example, we analyze an optical modulator and demonstrate how variations in material response and drive conditions affect photon statistics, coherence, and phase-space distributions. The findings offer a path to an all-encompassing model for understanding and optimizing QCIs, with wide-ranging implications for the performance, design, and robustness of next-generation quantum devices.},

However, much less work has been done to understand how more general Zeno effects could be used in a similar setting. We use a construction based on three-state systems rather than directly in qubits, so that a qubit can remain after projecting out one of the states. We find that our model of computing is able to recover the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model. Several generalizations are possible, but our methods allow for constraints to be implemented nonperturbatively and do not need tunable couplers, unlike simple transverse field implementations. We further discuss how to implement the protocol physically using methods building on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) protocols for state transfer. We find a substantial challenge that settings defined exclusively by measurement or dissipative Zeno effects do not allow for frustration, and in these settings pathological spectral features arise leading to unfavorable runtime scaling. We discuss methods to overcome this challenge, for example including gain as well as loss as is often done in an optical setting.},

In this article, we investigate the effect of high processor connectivity on average two-qubit gate fidelity in a cavity-based architecture with tunable coupling. Via a perturbative approach, we quantify the crosstalk errors from transverse residual couplings and show that they scale as n m 2 where n is the number of idle qubits and m is the ratio between the transverse residual and active couplings. Setting an error threshold E thr , we demonstrate that crosstalks restrict the hardware topology and prevent the full use of all-to-all connectivity.

One of such strategies entails implementing the inverse of a known noise map of an environment by using a set of completely positive maps weighted by a quasiprobability distribution, i.e., a probability distribution with positive and negative values. This distribution is realized using classical postprocessing after final measurements of desired observables have been made. Here we make a connection with quasiprobability EM and recent results from quantum trajectory theory for open quantum systems. We show that the inverse of noise maps can be realized by performing classical postprocessing with a quasiprobability measure called the influence martingale on the quantum trajectories generated by an additional engineered reservoir coupled to the system. We demonstrate our result on a model relevant for current NISQ devices. Finally, we show the required quantum trajectories themselves can be simulated by coupling an ancillary qubit to the system.

  abstract     = {Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit gate fidelity. Here we present a fully fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, submicrosecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz 2 /Hz and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1–10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. We observe the improvement offered by this fast-phase-noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.},

  abstract     = {The adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics implies that if a system is in a discrete eigenstate of a Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian evolves in time arbitrarily slowly, the system will remain in the corresponding eigenstate of the evolved Hamiltonian. Understanding corrections to the adiabatic result that arise when the evolution of the Hamiltonian is slow, but not arbitrarily slow, has become increasingly important, especially since adiabatic evolution has been proposed as a method of state preparation in quantum computing. This paper identifies two regimes, an adiabatic regime in which corrections are generically small and can depend on details of the evolution throughout the path and a hyperadiabatic regime in which the error is given by a form similar to an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the evolution time with the coefficients depending principally on the behavior at the endpoints. However, the error in this hyperadiabatic regime is neither given by a true asymptotic series nor solely dependent on the endpoints: The coefficients combine the contributions from both endpoints, with relative phase factors that depend on the average spectral gaps along the trajectory, multiplied by the evolution time. The central result of this paper is to identify a quantity, referred to as the typical error, which is obtained by appropriately averaging the error over evolution times that are small compared to the evolution time itself. This typical error is characterized by an asymptotic series and depends solely on the endpoints of the evolution, remaining independent of the details of the intermediate evolution.},

  abstract     = {Ramsey spectroscopy serves as a key tool for frequency measurement. Although entanglement can enhance the measurement precision, the atom-atom interaction required for entanglement generation may lead to a frequency shift. In addition, the spectra also suffer from light shift caused by the interaction between light and atoms. Thus, it is difficult to achieve high precision without inducing additional systematic errors. Here, we propose to realize high-precision entanglement-enhanced Ramsey spectroscopy with composite pulses. First, we utilize spin-squeezed states generated by one-axis twisting (OAT) dynamics to enhance the measurement precision. We find that by applying a suitable pulse after OAT, the resonant frequency can be inferred and the light shift can be reduced by using composite pulses. To increase the signal slope, we use anti-OAT dynamics to perform interaction-based readout after interrogation. By designing suitable composite pulses, it can significantly increase the signal response and further improve the measurement precision. Although both schemes can mitigate the light shift, it cannot be entirely eliminated. Thus, we develop the autobalanced entanglement-enhanced Ramsey spectroscopy. By using combination of different sequences with short and long interrogation times and feedback control, the light shift of both our protocols can be completely suppressed, which increases the measurement accuracy. Besides, we also investigate the effects of background atom-atom interaction and find that it only reduces the measurement precision without introducing additional frequency shift. Our study offers an alternative method for achieving precise frequency measurement, which has the potential to be of significant application in quantum sensors such as atomic clocks.},

However, these gates are sensitive to charge noise in experimental settings, which remains a significant challenge. Geometric gates, which utilize pure geometric phases for gate operations, are a promising approach to achieving robust control. In this work, we theoretically propose a feasible strategy to implement geometric two-qubit gates for silicon-based spin qubits considering experimental control environments. By operating in the suitable region where the local magnetic field gradient is significantly larger than the exchange interaction, we can implement both entangling and nonentangling geometric gates through analytical and numerical methods. It is found that the geometric gates obtained are highly compatible with existing experimental techniques using electric dipole spin resonance in silicon. Moreover, the implemented geometric controlled- Z (CZ) gates can achieve fidelities exceeding 99% under experimental noise levels and the gate times are as short as 20 ns. Our work paves the way for the realization of high-fidelity geometric two-qubit gates for spin qubits in silicon.},

Using the framework, we can achieve exact uniform sampling over all vertices and perfect state transfer between any two vertices, provided that eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix of the graph are all integers. Furthermore, if the graph is vertex transitive as well, then we can achieve deterministic quantum spatial search that finds a marked vertex with probability 100 % . In contrast, existing quantum search algorithms generally have a certain probability of failure. Even if the graph is not vertex transitive, such as the complete bipartite graph, we can still adjust the algorithmic framework to obtain deterministic spatial search, which thus shows the flexibility of it. Besides unifying and improving plenty of previous results, our work provides results on more graphs. The approach is easy to use since it has a succinct formalism that depends only on the depth of the Laplacian eigenvalue set of the graph, and may shed light on the solution of more problems related to graphs.},

While a universal quantum computer can perform digital simulations, an analog-digital hybrid quantum processor offers advantages such as parallelism. Here, we engineer a class of high-dimensional Ising interactions using a linear one-dimensional ion chain with up to eight qubits through stroboscopic sequences of commuting Hamiltonians. In addition, we extend this method to noncommuting circuits and demonstrate the quantum XY and Heisenberg models using Floquet periodic drives with tunable symmetries.

  abstract     = {Entanglement is a resource to improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In an ideal case, using an entangled state as a probe to detect target fields, we can beat the standard quantum limit by which all classical sensors are bounded. However, since entanglement is fragile against decoherence, it is unclear whether entanglement-enhanced metrology is useful in a noisy environment. Its benefit is indeed limited when estimating the amplitude of dc magnetic fields under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence, where the noise operator is parallel to the target field. In this paper, on the contrary, we show an advantage to using an entanglement over the classical strategy under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence when we try to detect ac magnetic fields. We consider a scenario to induce a Rabi oscillation of the qubits with the target ac magnetic fields. Although we can, in principle, estimate the amplitude of the ac magnetic fields from the Rabi oscillation, the signal becomes weak if the qubit frequency is significantly detuned from the frequency of the ac magnetic field. We show that, by using the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, we can significantly enhance the signal of the detuned Rabi oscillation even under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence. Our method is based on the fact that the interaction time between the GHZ states and ac magnetic fields scales as 1 / L to mitigate the decoherence effect, where L is the number of qubits, which contributes to improving the bandwidth of the detectable frequencies of the ac magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for new applications of entanglement-enhanced ac magnetometry.},

The RMT analysis enables analytical predictions for different regimes and critical disorders of the many-body dynamics. We find two critical disorders. At small disorder, finite-dimensional manifold remains nonergodic as long as the noise is smaller than an ergodicity-breaking transition, which scales as O ( L − 1 ) . Computational power is lost at a much smaller disorder that scales as O ( 2 − L / 2 ) .

Two concrete problems are investigated. For generic state preparation problems, both multiple bang-bang and bang-singular-bang are legitimate and should be considered. Generally, the optimal is bang-bang for small u max , and there exists a state-dependent critical amplitude above which singular control emerges. For the X-gate operation of a qubit, the optimal protocol is exclusively multiple bang-bang. The minimum gate time is about 80% of that based on the resonant Rabi π -pulse over a wide range of control strength; in the u max → 0 limit, this ratio is derived to be π / 4 . To develop practically feasible protocols, we present methods to smooth the abrupt changes in the bang-bang control while preserving perfect gate fidelity.

We highlight that correlation tests designed for multioutcome measurements can be trivialized in binarized implementations and we then show how to accurately analyze binarized data to reveal their quantum features. For seminal types of correlation experiments, such as Bell inequality tests, steering tests and prepare-and-measure experiments, we find that binarization may incur a sizable cost in the magnitude of quantum advantages.

  abstract     = {Quantum continuous measurement strategies are an essential element in many modern sensing technologies, leading to potentially enhanced estimation of unknown physical parameters. In such schemes, continuous monitoring of the quantum system, which encodes the parameters of interest, gives rise to different quantum trajectories conditioned on the measurement outcomes which carry information on the parameters themselves. Importantly, different trajectories carry different amounts of information, i.e., they are more or less sensitive to the unknown parameters of interest. In this work, we propose an approach on how to systematically engineer the quantum open-system dynamics in order to increase the probability of obtaining trajectories of high sensitivity. We focus on the simplest case scenario of a single two-level system interacting with ancillas, which are in turn measured using the discretized version of continuous monitoring. We analyze the performance of our protocol and demonstrate that it may lead to a substantial enhancement of sensitivity, as quantified by the classical Fisher information, even when applied to such small system sizes, holding the promise of direct implementation in state-of-the-art experimental platforms and large, complex many-body systems.},

By incorporating nonunitary effects via, e.g., measurements on ancilla qubits, these algorithms can be extended to open-system dynamics, such as Markovian processes described by the Lindblad master equation. In this paper, we analyze the convergence criteria and speed of a Markovian, purely dissipative quantum random walk on an unstructured classical search space. Notably, we show that certain jump operators make the quantum process replicate a classical one, while others yield differences between open quantum (OQRW) and classical random walks. We also clarify a previously observed quadratic speedup, demonstrating that OQRWs are no more efficient than classical search. Finally, we analyze a dissipative discrete-time ground-state preparation algorithm with a lower implementation cost. This allows us to interpolate between the dissipative and the unitary domain and thereby illustrate the important role of coherence for the quadratic speedup.},

The first step towards this is to develop novel entanglement measures that are both informative and computationally tractable at large scales. While numerous such entanglement measures exist for discrete-variable (DV) systems, a comprehensive exploration for experimentally preferred continuous-variable (CV) systems is lacking. Here, we introduce a class of CV entanglement measures, among which we identify a nonconvex entanglement monotone—the ratio negativity, which possesses a simple, scalable form that determines the exponential decay of optimal entanglement swapping on a chain of pure Gaussian states. This characterization opens avenues for leveraging statistical physics tools to analyze swapping-protocol-based CV QNs.},

This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work [ Phys. Rev. A 110 , 022417 (2024) ], that uses gauge transformations in two ways. First, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Second, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure one-dimensional SU(2) toy model.},

In this work, we introduce several potential quantum-state texture measure schemes and check whether they satisfy the three fundamental conditions required for a valid quantum-state texture measure. Specifically, the measure induced by the norm serves as a vital tool for quantifying coherence, but we prove that it cannot be used to quantify quantum-state texture. Furthermore, we show that while relative entropy and robustness meet three fundamental conditions, they are not optimal for quantifying quantum-state texture. Fortunately, we still find that there are several measures that can be used as the measure standard of quantum-state texture. Among them, the trace distance measure and the geometric measure are two good measurement schemes. In addition, the two measures based on Uhlmann's fidelity are experimentally friendly and can serve as an ideal definition of quantum-state texture measures in nonequilibrium situations. All this research on quantum-state texture measure theory can enrich the resource theory framework of quantum-state texture.},

The implementational advantage of surface codes has driven extensive research into decoding algorithms for surface codes, aimed at improving error-rate performance and/or reducing decoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity postprocessing algorithm that effectively resolves failures of a syndrome-based belief-propagation (SB-BP) decoder for surface codes. In particular, we carefully analyze the topological structure of surface codes and present a method for selecting reliable qubits, enabling efficient recovery operator identification through a simple syndrome matching technique with a lookup table. Furthermore, we present an efficient way to construct lookup tables tailored to the proposed postprocessing algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed postprocessing algorithm requires substantially reduced complexity as compared to that of a competing postprocessing algorithm, the ordered statistics decoding in the depolarizing error model, while providing the same logical error-rate (LER) performance. It is also demonstrated that the combination of SB-BP decoding and the proposed postprocessing algorithm outperforms minimum weight perfect matching, a more computationally expensive decoding algorithm, in terms of LER and threshold at drastically reduced complexity.},

We introduce two protocols and show that on average, the teleportation succeeds in teleporting the spin variables of a spin coherent state with average zero angular error in the ideal case, beating classical strategies based on quantum state estimation. In a single run of the teleportation, there is an angular error at the level of ∼ 0.1 radians for large ensembles.

A particularly pressing one arises at the prediction stage because the outputs of quantum learning models are inherently random. This creates an often considerable overhead, as many executions of a quantum learning model have to be aggregated to obtain an actual prediction. In this work, we analyze when quantum learning models can evade this issue and produce predictions in a near-deterministic way—paving the way to single-shot quantum machine learning. We give a rigorous definition of single shotness in quantum classifiers and show that the degree to which a quantum learning model is near deterministic is constrained by the distinguishability of the embedded quantum states used in the model. Opening the black box of the embedding, we show that if the embedding is realized by quantum circuits, a certain depth is necessary for single shotness to be even possible. We conclude by showing that quantum learning models cannot be single shot in a generic way and trainable at the same time.},

  abstract     = {The equivalence between absolutely separable states and absolutely positive partial transposed (PPT) states in general remains an open problem in quantum entanglement theory. In this work, we study an analogous question for symmetric multiqubit states. We show that symmetric absolutely PPT (SAPPT) states (symmetric states that remain PPT after any symmetry-preserving unitary evolution) are not always symmetric absolutely separable by providing explicit counterexamples. More precisely, we construct a family of entangled five-qubit SAPPT states. Similar counterexamples for larger odd numbers of qubits are identified.},

  abstract     = {Certain unitary invariants, known as Bargmann invariants or multivariate traces of quantum states, have recently gained attention due to their applications in quantum information theory. However, determining the boundaries of sets of Bargmann invariants remains a theoretical challenge. In this study, we address the problem by developing a unified, dimension-independent formulation that characterizes the sets of the third and fourth Bargmann invariants. In particular, our result for the set of fourth Bargmann invariants confirms the conjecture given by Fernandes et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 190201 (2024) ]. Based on the obtained results, we conjecture that the unified, dimension-independent formulation of the boundaries for sets of third- and fourth-order Bargmann invariants may extend to the general case of the n th -order Bargmann invariants. These results deepen our understanding of the fundamental physical limits within quantum mechanics and pave the way for novel applications of Bargmann invariants in quantum information processing and related fields.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in near-term quantum computing is its application to large real-world datasets due to scarce quantum hardware resources. One approach to enabling tractable quantum models for such datasets involves finding low-dimensional representations that preserve essential information for downstream analysis. In classical machine learning, variational autoencoders (VAEs) facilitate efficient data compression, representation learning for subsequent tasks, and novel data generation. However, no quantum model has been proposed that exactly captures all of these features for direct application to quantum data on quantum computers. Some existing quantum models for data compression lack regularization of latent representations, thus preventing direct use for generation and control of generalization. Others are hybrid models with only some internal quantum components, impeding direct training on quantum data. To address this, we present a fully quantum framework, ζ -QVAE, which encompasses all the capabilities of classical VAEs and can be directly applied to map both classical and quantum data to a lower-dimensional space, while effectively reconstructing much of the original state from it. Our model utilizes regularized mixed states to attain optimal latent representations. It accommodates various divergences for reconstruction and regularization. Furthermore, by accommodating mixed states at every stage, it can utilize the full data density matrix and allow for a training objective defined on probabilistic mixtures of input data. Doing so, in turn, makes efficient optimization possible and has potential implications for private and federated learning. In addition to exploring the theoretical properties of ζ -QVAE, we demonstrate its performance on representative genomics and synthetic data. Our results indicate that ζ -QVAE consistently learns representations that better utilize the capacity of the latent space and exhibits similar or better performance compared with matched classical models.},

Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unraveling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the interdetection times. Furthermore, by comparing single- and multiphoton scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.},

In this work we study the problem of detecting genuine tripartite entanglement among systems of indistinguishable bosons. A genuine entangled state is one that cannot be separable under any bipartition, where separability in the indistinguishable regime is defined by the existence of single-particle properties within each subsystem, without the possibility of knowing which property belongs to which subsystem. We use an algorithm that allows us to search for these single-particle properties and consequently rank states according to their degree of separability. In particular, we introduce a state of indistinguishable bosons with properties analogous to those of the standard Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian boson sampling is a popular method for experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage, but many subtleties remain in fully understanding its theoretical underpinnings. An important component in the theoretical arguments for approximate average-case hardness of sampling is anticoncentration, which is a second-moment property of the output probabilities. In Gaussian boson sampling these are given by hafnians of generalized circular orthogonal ensemble matrices. In a companion work by Ehrenberg et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 140601 (2025) ], we develop a graph-theoretic method to study these moments and use it to identify a transition in anticoncentration. In this work, we find a recursive expression for the second moment using these graph-theoretic techniques. While we have not been able to solve this recursion by hand, we are able to solve it numerically exactly, which we do up to Fock sector 2 n = 80 . We further derive analytical results about the second moment. These results allow us to pinpoint the transition in anticoncentration and furthermore yield the expected linear cross-entropy benchmarking score for an ideal (error-free) device.},

Our findings are as follows: (1) In the strong-coupling regime, the counter-rotating terms accelerate the decay of genuine three-party correlations, and the obvious sudden birth of Bell nonlocality is found. (2) In the ultrastrong-coupling regime, we observe a phenomenon in which nonlocality is consistently transferred between a three-qubit system and its subsystem. In addition, the inclusion of counter-rotating wave terms obviously enhances genuine tripartite nonlocality. (3) These counter-rotating terms cannot effectively generate genuine three-party correlations in zero-excitation cases, which differs from previous studies involving only two qubits.

We also construct several four-GBS sets without detectors, most of which are one-way LOCC indistinguishable and only one of which is one-way LOCC distinguishable, indicating that the detectors are not necessary for LOCC distinguishability.

High-dimensional, or multipartite, quantum states are of specific interest, as they can exhibit unique properties both fundamentally and in application. The synthesis of high-dimensional, entangled photonic states can take the form of various schemes, which result in varying forms of entanglement. Frequency entanglement is specifically attractive due to compatibility with integrated systems and resistance to decoherence in fiber transportation; however, increasing the dimension of frequency-entangled states requires a system that offers quantum interactions between a large set of distinct frequencies. Here, we show how the phonon-photon interactions of forward Brillouin scattering, which offer access to a ladder of optical resonances permitted by a single mechanical mode, can be used for fast synthesis of frequency-entangled, single-photon W states. In our proposed system, simultaneous laser pulses of different frequencies dynamically evolve either an injected single photon or a heralded single phonon, generating W states of selected dimension and output frequency. This method enables the synthesis of “perfect” W states by adjusting the pulse amplitudes. In addition, we show how this system can be used for quantum frequency translation.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is one of the most prominent features of quantum mechanics and serves as an essential resource in quantum information science. Therefore, the certification of entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing tasks. While entanglement witnesses are the most frequently used method for entanglement certification in experiments, recent research shows that even tiny errors in measurements may significantly undermine the effectiveness of a witness. In this work, we propose a randomized-measurement-based method to solve this problem. Through this method, the errors in measurement results can be substantially suppressed, thereby restoring the certification capability of entanglement witnesses. Our method is not only applicable to general types of witnesses, including multiparty entanglement and high-dimensional entanglement witnesses, but also experimentally friendly in the sense that only slight modifications are needed to the original measurement settings.},

However, we show that, unlike projective measurements which completely destroy quantum correlations between nodes in quantum networks, sequential applications of noisy measurements can mitigate the adverse impact of noise in the measurement device on quantum information processing tasks. We demonstrate this in the case of concentrating entanglement on chosen nodes in quantum networks via noisy measurements performed by assisting qubits. In the case of networks with a cluster of three or more qubits, we exhibit that sequentially performing optimal unsharp measurements on the assisting qubits yields localizable entanglement between two nodes akin to that obtained by optimal projective measurements on the same assisting qubits. Furthermore, we find that the proposed approach using consecutive noisy measurements can potentially be used to prepare desired states that are resource for specific quantum schemes. We also argue that assisting qubits have greater control over the qubits on which entanglement is concentrated via unsharp measurements, in contrast to sharp-measurement-based protocols, which may have implications for secure quantum communication.},

  abstract     = {The formalism of quantum estimation theory with a specific focus on classical data postprocessing is applied to a two-level system driven by an external gyrating magnetic field. We employed both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimate the unknown transition frequency. In the frequentist approach, we have shown that only reducing the distance between the classical and the quantum Fisher information does not necessarily mean that the estimators as functions of the data deliver an estimate with desirable accuracy, as the classical Fisher information takes small values. We have proposed and investigated a cost function to account for the maximization of the classical Fisher information and the minimization of the aforementioned distance. Due to the nonlinearity of the probability mass function of the data on the transition frequency, the minimum variance unbiased estimator may not exist. The maximum likelihood and the maximum a posteriori estimators often result in ambiguous estimates, which in certain cases can be made unambiguous upon changing the parameters of the external field. It is demonstrated that the minimum mean-square error estimator of the Bayesian statistics provides unambiguous estimates. In the Bayesian approach, we have also investigated the effects of noninformative and informative priors on the Bayesian estimates, including a uniform prior, Jeffrey's prior, and a Gaussian prior.},

For example, one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics is that observables may be incompatible, implying among other things that it is not always possible to find joint probability distributions which fully capture the joint statistics of multiple measurements. Instead, one must employ more general tools such as the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution, which may exhibit negative or nonreal values heralding nonclassicality. In this paper, we consider the KDQ distributions describing arbitrary collections of measurements on disjoint components of some generic multipartite system. We show that the system dynamics ensures that these distributions are classical if and only if the Hamiltonian supports quantum Darwinism. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental relationship between these two notions of classicality and their emergence in the quantum world.},

In the strong coupling regime, the charging time is insensitive to the charger energy, the number of charging units, and the residual ergotropy in the QB, while the ergotropy charged on the QB strongly depends on the charger energy and ergotropy, and the residual ergotropy in the QB does not help to enhance its performance.

In this work, we analyze the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation expanded to order and demonstrate that, while van Kampen's cumulants suppress early-time secular growth, they ultimately diverge at long times. To overcome this, we introduce a resummation technique based on the Hadamard trick, which incorporates time integrals directly into the bath's spectral density via elementwise multiplication. This approach establishes a maximum expansion order, and defines a precision limit of the asymptotic states of , where is the power-law exponent and is the weak-coupling constant. The resummed master equation features renormalized Bohr frequencies that capture decoherence and spectral overlap effects. In the unbiased spin-boson model, this results in an inflation of the generator at a temperature-independent rate equal to the decoherence rate and a finite validity time . For exponentially decaying correlations, the method recovers a proper Markovian limit below a critical coupling threshold.},

We employ the quantum formalism for an investigation of random probabilistic cellular automata for which the properties of the deterministic updating are randomly distributed over space and time. We are interested in a possible continuum limit for a very large number of cells or space points. We consider bits with two colors, moving to the left or right on a linear chain. At randomly distributed scattering points they change direction and color. A numerical simulation reveals the typical features of quantum systems. We find particular initial probability distributions which reemerge periodically after a certain number of time steps, as produced by the periodic evolution of energy eigenstates in quantum mechanics. Using a description in terms of wave functions allows us to introduce statistical observables for momentum and energy. They characterize the probabilistic information without taking definite values for a given bit configuration, with a conceptual status similar to temperature in classical statistical thermal equilibrium. Conservation of energy and momentum are essential ingredients for the understanding of the evolution of the stochastic probabilistic automata. This evolution resembles in some aspects a single Dirac fermion in two dimensions with a generalized random potential.},

Intriguingly, the system under quench dynamics undergoes an energy-dependent dynamical quantum phase transition, characterized by the singularities of the Loschmidt echo in time scale. Specifically, we find disentangling behavior between static and dynamical quantum phase transitions for eigenenergies excluding band edges. Remarkably, the connection between static and dynamical quantum phase transitions does not hold generally for all eigenenergies.

  abstract     = {We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden-quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink-number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink-number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability p k . We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize p k without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden-driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink-number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant ratios that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden- to the slow-driving regime. Due to the determination of p k for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink-number statistics from the slow-driving regime to the sudden-quench limit.},

  abstract     = {Bipartite entangled states between a qubit and macroscopically distinct states of a mesoscopic system, known as micro-macro entangled states, are emerging resources for quantum information processing. One main challenge in generating such states in the laboratory is their fragility to environmental noise. We analyze this fragility in detail for single-particle noise by identifying what factors play a role in the robustness and quantifying their effect. There is a trade-off between the macroscopicity of a micro-macro entangled state and the robustness of its bipartite entanglement to environmental noise. We identify symmetric micro-macro entangled states as the most robust states to single-particle noise. We show that the robustness of bipartite entanglement of such states to single-particle noise decreases as the second order of macroscopicity, which identifies a regime where the bipartite entangled state is both robust and macroscopic. Our result is a step towards retaining quantum characteristics on large scales and experimental realization of micro-macro entangled spin states and their use for connecting separated qubits. Moreover, it advances our understanding of quantum to classical transition.},

We unveil in this work the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines in non-Hermitian topology for multiple bands. In particular, the nonseparability of non-Hermitian multibands can be topologically nontrivial without exceptional points in two-dimensional space.

Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.},

Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the nonunitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the nonunitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among Hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.},

A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing bulk-edge correspondence under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [T. Isobe et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 , 126601 (2024) ]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover bulk-edge correspondence of the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a form of bulk-edge correspondence based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous bulk-edge correspondence defined herein provides an alternative perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of bulk-edge correspondence.},

The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a catlike structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states.

This finding demonstrates the controllability of the azimuthal IPM density and its mechanical effects on nanoparticles, providing insights into the manipulation of optical forces.

This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the other two modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical use, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition. Besides optimizing the protocol speed, our NOON state preparation scheme achieves excellent fidelities that are competitive for practical applications.},

The approach is straightforward to implement and requires no quantum resources. We analytically prove average-case as well as worst- and best-case scenarios, and rigorously prove that it is, in principle, always worth biasing the estimators.

  abstract     = {Magnons can serve as a bridge between spin, phonon, and photon systems, which renders them suitable for constructing hybrid systems. An important application of such hybrid systems is generating entanglement between different platforms. As magnons can support a broad variety of states, e.g., Fock states, squeezed states, or coherent states, and hybrid states can be produced with cavities or spins, there are many different kinds of entangled states in magnon systems. In this paper, we consider the entanglement of cat-state-like throughout states, which can be generated in magnon systems with parametric pumps beyond the parametric stable intensities. However, estimating the entanglement in such states is challenging due to their multiphoton and non-Gaussian properties. Here, we apply a modular variable-based projection, which maps the catlike states to spin states, preserving the encoded information. After the projection, Bell's inequality is employed to detect the entanglement in the effective spin states. Our numerical analysis provides the conditions for generating catlike entanglement in magnon systems and can be conveniently extended to other entangled states that may be formed by magnon and spin systems.},

As the direct output, the photon scattering characteristics show the total reflection with the frequency preservation or the complete frequency conversion at the specific choices of two phases. We uncover the underlying topological effect by analyzing the photon scattering amplitudes in the parameter space of two phases, which links to the singularity with nonzero winding numbers. Our results are verified by numerical simulations, and hence point to an alternative perspective for the research at the intersection of single-photon transport and topology, without using the topological geometric arrangement of atoms.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a method to achieve nonreciprocal photon blockade in an optical resonator that is chirally coupled to a two-level atom. This approach enables single-excitation and two-excitation resonant conditions to be simultaneously satisfied. The atom-uncoupled optical mode can be blocked with eliminating its two-photon excitation by judiciously selecting parameters, e.g., the optical coupling strength. The chiral interaction between the resonator mode and the atom leads to different optimal parameter conditions for generating photon blockade in the two opposite drivings. This offers a natural way to realize nonreciprocal photon blockade. The nonreciprocity achieved by the chiral cavity-atom interaction diminishes the experimental difficulty by eliminating the need to rotate the resonator. The blockade mode achieves very high purity of single-photon excitation, as characterized by a second-order correlation function of g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) ∼ 10 − 4 . In particular, in the nonreciprocal regime, the mean number of photons is significantly higher where photon blockade occurs compared to the general Jaynes-Cummings case. Our findings are particularly relevant for the development of quantum nonreciprocal devices and their applications in quantum information processing, including chiral networks.},

The decay rate of the photon pulse can be significantly minimized by using giant atoms instead of point atoms and by carefully selecting the spacing between the coupling points of the giant atom to the waveguide. The quality factor for the cavity is analyzed by varying the number of atoms, coupling points, and coupling point spacing in each mirror to find the optimal parameters for a high Q -factor cavity.

One such tool is a photon-number-resolving detector, and the simplest configuration involves counting the total number of photons in the state to be characterized. This motivates the following question: What properties of a multimode Gaussian state are determined by the signal from one detector that measures the total number of photons up to some bound? We find that if the Gaussian state occupies S modes and the probabilities of n photons for all n ≤ 8 S are known, then we can determine the spectrum of the Gaussian covariance matrix and the magnitude of the displacements in each eigenspace of the covariance matrix. Nothing more can be learned, even if all photon-number probabilities are known. When the state is pure, the covariance matrix spectrum determines the squeezing parameters of the state.},

When the four cavity modes are coupled to a common superconducting qubit, the strong coherent coupling between the magnons and qubit can be established through virtual photon exchange. In the dressed picture, it is of interest to explore two types of interaction under different frequency-matching conditions, being responsible for the continuous-variable quadripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and cluster entanglement. Furthermore, the generation of collective steering originates from the dissipation channel of Bogoliubov mode rather than from the conventional asymmetry of the system parameters. The multipartite entanglement in this solid-state device may find potential applications in constructing macroscopic quantum networks and the collective steering may be useful in one-sided device-independent quantum secret sharing.},

In this theoretical article, we go beyond the simple model used in the previous study to address more phenomena, such as the appearance of bunching shoulders in second-order correlation function, Rabi splitting in steady-state spectrum, and population dynamics on excited Dicke states, which for moderate pumping explains the observed collective effects. Overall, our results can guide further experiments with NV centers, and they are also relevant for other solid-state color centers, such as silicon-vacancy centers in diamond and silicon carbide, boron-vacancy centers, and carbon-related centers in hexagonal boron nitride.},

However, most of the existing literatures only focuses on the DIT effect with coherent dipole-cavity coupling, thus its universality in other types of coupling is still to be clarified. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to realize dissipative dipole-cavity coupling with the assistance of a highly dissipative microcavity, and explicitly exhibit cavity-mode attraction. We then investigate the DIT effect in a cavity-waveguide system with attractive cavity modes and find that it can still be achievable even though the probe light is resonant with two attractive cavity modes. Furthermore, we reveal its underlying transparency mechanism with eigenfrequencies and the effective susceptibility of the dipole-cavity system, and show that its transparency lies in the destructive interference of two attractive cavity modes with splitting damping rates instead of splitting resonance frequencies in coherent coupling. Moreover, we find that the attractive and repulsive phenomena of the effective susceptibility, which also plays an important role in the DIT effect, exist in the dipole-cavity system. Our findings may not only be of importance for gaining a more comprehensive understanding on the DIT effect, but also have potential applications in quantum networks.},

The applied atom-light interaction model is based on the Wigner-Weisskopf approximation. We characterize the properties of the optimal two-photon state that excites an atom perfectly, i.e., with probability equal to one. We find that the spectrotemporal shape of the optimal state of light is determined by the lifetimes of the atomic states, with the degree of photonic entanglement in the optimal state depending on the lifetime ratio. In consequence, two distinct interaction regimes can be identified in which the entanglement of the input state of light has a qualitatively different impact. As the optimal states may be challenging to prepare in general, we compare the results with those obtained for photon pairs of selected experimentally relevant pulse shapes.

  abstract     = {Ultranarrow scattering spectra have important applications in precision measurements. Here, we show that the dark state of two atoms coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide leads to an ultranarrow transparency window with a width significantly smaller than the spontaneous decay rate of the atoms. Specifically, the position of this transparency dip is linearly proportional to the atom-atom distance. This ultranarrow dip can measure the atom-atom distance with an accuracy of one percent of the resonant wavelength. Additionally, the dip depth is highly sensitive to the atom-atom detuning, which could be used to measure small magnetic-field gradients at the nanoscale. The sign of the detuning can be further determined by measuring the second-order correlation function of the reflected photons.},

  abstract     = {The study of atomic behaviors in a squeezed vacuum reservoir plays an important role in exploring quantum effect and quantum physics. We here propose a scheme to manipulate the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide driven by a broadband squeezed field, which acts as a squeezed vacuum reservoir. By tuning the propagating phase of photons, the center-of-mass phase of the giant atom, and the squeezing parameter, both the dephasing dynamics and entanglement dynamics of giant atoms can be effectively controlled. In the single-giant-atom case, we obtain the expressions of the dephasing rates based on the Bloch equations derived from the quantum master equation of the giant atom. Adjusting these two phases enables the dephasing rates to be enhanced, suppressed, or reduced to zero, thereby changing the dephasing dynamics. For the two-giant-atom system, we find that the atomic individual and collective squeezing depend on these two phases simultaneously. The steady-state giant-atom population and entanglement are obtained by working in the collective state representation for the two atoms. Different from small atoms, the steady-state population and entanglement depend on not only the center-mass-of phase, but also the propagating phase. In addition, we identify the condition for achieving larger steady-state entanglement via analyzing the system parameters. This work will facilitate the study of light-matter interaction based on giant-atom waveguide QED systems driven by a squeezed vacuum reservoir and has potential applications in quantum information processing.},

In a complex optical quantum network, the quantum signals should be routed to multilevel quantum channels, but how to modulate this quantum routing process is a challenge. We study the quantum routing of single photons with three-level quantum channels connected by two whispering-gallery resonators (WGRs). We find that single photons can be efficiently routed to a third level quantum channel, though the maximum probability is not higher than that to the second level quantum channel, which can reach 100 % . Moreover, we also investigate how the phase shift parameter and the dissipation rates influence the routing probability in a third level quantum channel. Our work provides a robust proposal for harvesting the potential of quantum networks in the future.},

In this paper, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to realize a genuine single-mode temporal filter that is based on the concept of temporal cavity , a device with temporal mode-dependent resonances in the basis of temporal broadband modes. This functionality is achieved as the temporal-domain analogy of spatial-mode cleaner cavities.

These EHBEs provide an intuitive framework for understanding the spin dynamics in the SERF regime and yield simple solutions that are in excellent agreement with the results of density-matrix simulations. A stochastic EHBE model is created by adding spin noise caused by fundamental quantum fluctuations. This yields an optical-spin-noise spectrum that includes the intrinsic spin-projection noise and the backaction light-shift noise from Faraday rotation measurements. The spectrum is a summation of several absorptive and dispersive components, each of which has a clear physical origin and a simple algebraic expression. This provides a benchmark for calibrating future spin-squeezing experiments in the SERF regime.},

Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are readily excited when the real part of the permittivity of the atomic medium falls below unity, enabling an efficient and streamlined excitation process. The atomic medium dynamics is modulated by external fields, such as pump fields and microwaves, facilitating precise control over SPP excitation. We investigate the influence of the atomic medium, analyzing the lifetimes and propagation lengths for both gold and silver layers, while also addressing realistic factors such as dipole momenta, the potential for structural damage, and manufacturing imperfections. Additionally, we explore the Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift of the reflected light, noting an enhanced GH shift that aligns with optimal SPP excitation. Both negative and positive GH shifts are observed, with their directions and magnitudes modifiable through external parameters. This system provides a straightforward and viable method for SPP generation and controlled SPR and GH shift modulation, presenting significant potential for tunable optical devices in telecommunication. We expect these findings to contribute to the development of advanced systems with improved data transmission capabilities.},

The dynamics of the 3GA and its radiative field in the waveguide for long times are analyzed in each subspace with only one excitation exchanged between the waveguide and the 3GA cavity. Besides the steady value, we also found an oscillatory character of the excited-state population, a signature of oscillating bound states which is generated by the superposition of two bound states in the continuum. The radiative field propagates in the cavitylike geometry formed by the coupling points. When one bound state is emergent, a sinelike interference pattern is visible for the emitted photon distribution in spacetime. An oscillatory character in time and a beat in space for the emitted photon distribution are observed when two bound states are emergent in a subspace. The wavelengths and the periods are controlled by the number of photons in the cavity.},

  abstract     = {Resonances in the form of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for open scattering systems can be generally identified in the far field through peaks of scattering spectra (e.g. cross sections of scattering, extinction, and absorption). Nevertheless, when the resonant frequencies of different QNMs are spectrally overlapped or sufficiently close, the scattering peaks merge and it then becomes extremely challenging to reveal the mode constituents underlying the scattering spectra solely in the far field. Here in this paper, we study open systems scattering electromagnetic plane waves, and reveal that spectrally close or even overlapped QNMs can be selectively excited through tuning incident directions and polarizations. Such a far-field technique can be further applied to categorize the nature of degenerate QNMs sharing identical complex eigenfrequencies (coalescent eigenvalues): at effectively Hermitian degeneracies (conical or Dirac points), the eigenvectors are not coalescent and thus the QNMs can still be selectively excited, producing distinct scattering patterns, while for non-Hermitian degeneracies (exceptional points) eigenvectors also coalesce and thus selective QNM excitation does not exist, leading to invariant scattering patterns. Our technique sheds light on the borderlands of Mie theory, QNMs, non-Hermitian photonics, and singular optics, which can empower new explorations and applications and cross-fertilize all those disciplines.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic pulse propagation through a plasma layer below the plasma frequency is a genuine classical wave tunneling phenomenon strongly differing from tunneling in dielectric structures due to the specific dispersion of plasma. We consistently examine this phenomenon using direct numerical simulations of a time-dependent wave equation and show that in the low-frequency limit the tunneling time has the frequency-independent asymptotic 2 / ω p with ω p being the plasma frequency, in good correspondence with the analysis in stationary approximation. These results prove that radiation tunneling for plasma principally differs from the other electromagnetic tunneling phenomena which supposedly obey the inverse proportional dependence of the tunneling time on radiation frequency. The Hartman effect (saturation of the tunneling time with layer thickness) is demonstrated for pulse propagation as well with the saturated time getting closer to the asymptotic value as we move deeper into the tunneling regime. We also show that the reflected wave packet build-up gives an efficient tool for the tunneling problem and that reflection develops synchronously with transmission.

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) photonic waveguide array is proposed to simulate the concept of reservoir-engineering-induced nonreciprocal transmission. The reservoir is offered by coupling two optical modes simultaneously to an additional mode with loss, yielding a jump operator, which is a coherent superposition of annihilation operators of these two modes. The waveguides are helically curved, leading to a synthetic gauge field for the propagating photons and consequently an adjustable phase factor for the jump operator. The unidirectional coupling is derived analytically and verified numerically, and an intuitive interpretation is provided. Furthermore, the model is extended to a periodic lattice, where asymmetric hopping arises and unidirectional hopping appears for certain Bloch wave vectors. Our design is based on real-experiment parameters, which can be readily implemented by femtosecond laser direct writing of 3D waveguides in silica.},

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the fundamental building blocks of graphene, have been documented to possess plasmonic properties through experimental observations, making them prime candidates for investigation. By doping different elements, the conjugated structure of the molecule can be altered. In this study, the plasmonic excitation properties influenced by conjugated structures in peropyrene and its derivatives are investigated through first-principles calculations that combine the plasmonicity index, generalized plasmonicity index, and transition contribution map. For molecular plasmonic excitation, the conjugated structure can influence the oscillation modes of valence electrons, which is pivotal in yielding distinct field enhancement characteristics. Furthermore, charge doping can lead to a certain degree of alteration in the conjugated structures, and the doping of elements will result in varying degrees of such alteration, thereby initiating different trends in the evolution of plasmonic resonance. This further enhances the tunability of molecular plasmonic resonance. The results provide novel insights into the development and utilization of molecular plasmonic devices in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Precision measurement of small angles is essential in both industrial applications and high-precision scientific research. Although a traditional angle interferometer is widely employed, its resolution is fundamentally constrained. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method for ultrahigh-resolution angle measurement based on the laser frequency measurement, directly converting angle measurement into frequency measurement, which can be traced to the most accurate frequency standards. The proposed scheme integrates a frequency selection element interference filter (IF) with a transparent solid or liquid medium, forming a highly sensitive measurement system. This system capitalizes on the sensitivity of laser frequency to changes in cavity length and the incidence angle of the IF. As a result, even minute angular rotations of the sensor induce detectable shifts in the laser's frequency. The angular displacement is inferred directly by analyzing the frequency difference between a test signal and a reference, with this difference arising from variations in the incident angle at the IF and the corresponding changes in cavity length due to medium rotation. Theoretical analysis suggests that this method can achieve a resolution better than 10 − 4 arcsecond ( 10 − 8 deg ), representing an order of magnitude improvement over existing techniques.},

In particular, we show that in a mode-locked laser cavity the NOLM can be designed to serve as a mode-locking element in the transient regime of the laser, and as a power regulator in the stationary regime. While the conventional architecture of a NOLM is usually built from nontunable components, our multifunctional NOLM is built with tunable components offering great flexibility in setting the device's transfer function, and therefore the ability to access different types of optical functions such as pulse regeneration, power regulation, or mode locking in laser cavities.},

To characterize the spatial correspondence between the optical modes of the signal and those of the idler, we look at the classical transverse dynamics of these beams when they propagate in a generic thick OPA at a nominally small angle. In these conditions, the beams tend to copropagate while maintaining a fixed separation, a phenomenon that we term hitching. We develop a model for hitching, validated by a numerical simulation, and provide an experimental demonstration using four-wave mixing in a hot atomic vapor. They show that the OPA gain is the primary influence on the final hitching distance. These results have implications for the generation of multi-spatial-mode squeezed light for quantum imaging applications, where the exact spatial correlations between the quantum fluctuations of the signal and the idler are of prime importance.},

In addition to hyperbolic eigenmodes, hyperbolic metasurfaces can also support the propagation of surface-wave eigenmodes with an antihyperbolic isofrequency contour (i.e., antihyperbolic eigenmodes). In this work, we explore the lesser-known antihyperbolic eigenmodes, highlighting their unique polarization properties compared to hyperbolic eigenmodes. We find that the antihyperbolic eigenmodes at the vertices of the antihyperbolic isofrequency contour and the hyperbolic eigenmodes at the vertices of the hyperbolic isofrequency contour could have purely linear but opposite polarizations. Moreover, we reveal that the manipulation of metasurface's surface conductivity can provide a feasible route to realize the polarization conversion between these linearly polarized antihyperbolic and hyperbolic eigenmodes. That is, the s -polarized antihyperbolic eigenmodes would be changed to p -polarized ones, while the p -polarized hyperbolic eigenmodes are changed to s -polarized ones. These findings offer a pathway to selectively excite either hyperbolic or antihyperbolic eigenmodes, enabling control over subwavelength light propagation. Our results provide insights into polarization manipulation and potential applications in nano-optics and photonic devices.},

By distinguishing the individual contributions of frequency and loss perturbations to MI gain, we demonstrate that, in addition to the widely studied frequency perturbation, the introduction of an additional loss to the pump mode can also induce MI even without frequency perturbation, enabling the spontaneous excitation of frequency combs. The effects of pump mode perturbations in various mode-coupling schemes are compared, revealing that loss perturbation has a more significant impact when the pump power is relatively low or when the auxiliary mode experiences a sufficiently higher loss than the main mode.

We consider that the output field from the OM cavity undergoes three typical kinds of multiphoton operations: multiphoton subtraction, multiphoton addition, or multiphoton catalysis, followed by homodyne detection. We first demonstrate that these multiphoton operations can lead to non-Gaussian OM quantum steerable correlations, which are unveiled by the subsequent homodyne detection with a Fisher-information-based steering criterion. It is found that the non-Gaussian steering is obviously enhanced with an increasing number n of photons in the multiphoton operations, which, as we show, fails to be revealed with the well-known Reid's steering criterion. It therefore suggests that the Fisher-information-based criterion is more effective for witnessing non-Gaussian quantum steering. We next show that the strong OM steering enables the remote preparation of large-size Schrödinger odd or even cat states of the mechanical oscillator by the homodyne detection. Accordingly, the amplitudes of the cat states also increase significantly with the photon number n , particularly in the cases of multiphoton subtraction and addition. Our results reveal the properties of non-Gaussian steering generated by multiphoton operations, and the large cat states of macroscopic mechanical resonators hold promise for fundamental tests in quantum mechanics and practical applications in quantum science.},

However, experimental realization can be difficult due to the stringent parameter conditions associated with these points. In this work we study an EP laser composed of two coupled nonlinear resonators that uses nonlinearity to simplify these tuning requirements. This system demonstrates a distinct cube-root response in the steady-state lasing frequency, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the distribution of linear and saturable gain and loss. This design freedom enables several orders of magnitude higher responsivity than systems with a single nonlinear resonator, which have been previously explored. Maximizing responsivity also improves the robustness of sensing performance against parametric errors. These features are derived from coupled-mode theory and further supported by steady-state ab initio laser theory results at several nonlinear EPs. Through linear stability analysis, we also identify regions of instability within the class-A regime that arise due to mode competition, which can be induced by asymmetric passive losses. In the class-B regime, we show that the interplay between gain dynamics and detuning can lead to restabilization at slow relaxation rates or higher interresonator coupling rates. This regime could be used to increase the maximum achievable responsivity of the system.},

The selection of specific geometrical or material parameters is essential to achieve devices that sustain BICs. Our work presents a framework for generating BICs by driving the transfer matrix of a device to a singular point, where it becomes noninvertible, thus defining the BIC states. This method applies to nonhomogeneous, tessellated structures and is supported by closed-form analytical expressions, facilitating efficient parametric exploration. The proposed framework aligns with the conjecture that the most robust BICs are associated with topological defects in specific parameter spaces. We identify regions in parameter space supporting BICs and validate our theoretical predictions through full-wave numerical simulations. The framework extends to a wide range of photonic structures, enabling robust design and optimization of devices for diverse applications.},

Interestingly, due to the presence of PT -symmetric nonlinearity, applying a spatial offset to the initial wave can excite an SRB with a significantly larger peak value, which can reach over 100 times the amplitude of the plane wave. Our results provide a method for exciting SRBs with spatial asymmetry and can offer different insights for the experimental observation of extremely asymmetric modulation instability phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Levitated optomechanical systems are rapidly becoming leading tools for precision sensing of forces and accelerations acting on particles in the femtogram to nanogram mass range. These systems enable a high level of control over the sensor's center-of-mass motion, rotational degrees of freedom, and electric charge state. For many sensing applications, extending these techniques to arrays of sensors enables rejection of correlated noise sources and increases sensitivity to interactions that may be too rare or weak to detect with a single particle. Here we present techniques capable of trapping defect-free, two-dimensional arrays of more than 25 microspheres in vacuum. These techniques provide independent control of the optical potential for each sphere. Simultaneous imaging of the motion of all spheres in the array is demonstrated using camera-based imaging, with optimized object tracking algorithms reaching a displacement sensitivity below 1 nm/ Hz . Such arrays of levitated microspheres may find applications ranging from inertial sensing to searches for weakly interacting particles such as dark matter.},

  abstract     = {Exceptional points (EPs) in propagation states induce intriguing properties as the group velocities. However, superluminal propagation near EPs is challenging due to the smoothing caused by symmetry breaking. In this study, we propose a photonic crystal waveguide design with glide and time-reversal symmetry and derive an effective Hamiltonian to realize fast-light edge states. We adopt a systematic method to generate EPs in edge states by introducing non-Hermitian perturbations to Dirac points guaranteed by glide symmetry, which ensures that EP modes are free from out-of-plane radiation losses. We identify the conditions for exact EP restoration and provide an analytical solution to offset the EP smoothing due to symmetry breaking, which significantly reduces the group velocity contrast. A glide symmetry of the photonic crystal waveguide allows us to derive the effective Hamiltonian in a simple form, and the EPs can be restored by adjusting the real part of the permittivity. Furthermore, we design a feasible photonic crystal slab waveguide incorporating graphene as the absorbing material, and numerically demonstrate a group velocity reaching v g = 3.3 c near the EP, which is up to 25 times that of the original structure. The proposed setup based on non-Hermitian photonics paves the way for the realization of superluminal devices in nanophotonics. In addition, the method for restoring EPs also addresses challenges in the phenomena arising from non-Hermitian properties.},

A phase diagram of multiple EPs including higher than third-order EP is divided into different regions with a certain EP pattern, the variation of which with the parameters are demonstrated by analyzing the eigenspectrum of the system. In particular, the emergence, coalescence, and separation of the multiple EPs are strongly dependent on the relative phase between different paths in the cavity optomechanics system. On the other hand, the optical nonreciprocity with a large isolation about 50 dB can be achieved by incorporating mechanical gain. It is shown that the optical nonreciprocity at the relative phase φ exhibits exchange symmetry with that in the case of the phase 2 π − φ . Additionally, the system presents a special nonreciprocal spectra at different EPs, which can provide a means to identify the type of multiple EPs. Our scenario shows that the optical nonreciprocity associated with the multiple EPs may provide a useful platform for realizing optical communications and exploring the physics related to the higher-order EPs.},

  abstract     = {Optical microcavities have attracted increasing attention for high-performance sensing, where a laser scans the resonance, providing high-resolution and time-sensitive measurements. However, rapid resonance scanning can lead to readout distortions, affecting the accuracy of high-speed sensing. Traditional methods have attempted to alleviate this distortion by examining the relationship between the ringing behavior and the scanning speed or by reconstructing the steady-state spectra. Yet the complexity of distorted readouts often obscures their correlation with well-established steady-state spectra, presenting a significant challenge for transient sensing. In this study, we revisit electromagnetic theory in microcavities and discover that ringing distortion stems from quadratic phase interference between light emitted from the microcavity and the input. Remarkably, this quadratic phase solely arises from the spectral scanning speed, indicating a universality across microcavity types. As a result, the proposed method enables the recovery of a complex steady-state spectrum from a distorted readout at an arbitrary scanning speed after compensating for the introduced phases. This method bridges the gap between transient and steady-state spectra by harnessing the dimensions of spectral scanning speed, offering a promising avenue for high-speed sensing, precision measurement, and advanced scientific research.},

In particular, we apply sum-frequency mixing (SFM) of weak signals from resonantly enhanced third-harmonic-generation (THG) spectroscopy with strong nanosecond pump pulses, implemented in a conventional bulk nonlinear crystal. The conversion efficiency reaches 26%, i.e., a substantial fraction of the THG signal photons from the molecular sample at long midinfrared wavelength are converted to a SFM signal pulse at much shorter wavelength in the near-ultraviolet regime. This permits detection of the SFM signal beam on a standard photomultiplier tube with large amplification and aperture rather than detection of the midinfrared THG signal on an avalanche photodiode with much lower amplification and smaller aperture. The measure also considerably improves the signal-to-noise ratio by more than a factor of 20, which in turn pushes the particle detection limit by an order of magnitude towards much lower gas pressures.},

The analysis of the localization properties and Husimi distributions reveals that each branch corresponds to a periodic orbit in the closed classical system. Our findings show that these decay rates gradually resolve the structure of the islands in mixed phase space as we approach the short-wavelength limit. We present an effective semiclassical model incorporating wave-number-dependent localization, Fresnel reflection, and the Goos-Hänchen shift and demonstrate that these effects are crucial in accounting for the observed branches of decay rate curves.},

Using this theory, we find that the usual symmetry of complex conjugation plus changing the sign of the frequency, required for real-valued fields, implies that the allowed propagation constants in the medium are either real valued or come in conjugate pairs. The real-valued wave numbers are only present in time-varying media, implying that time variation leads to modes that are free from dissipation, even in a lossy medium. Moreover, these symmetry-unbroken waves lack a defined propagation direction. This can lead to a divergent transmission coefficient when waves are incident onto a finite, time-varying slab. The techniques used in this paper present a route toward further analytic applications of this operator formalism.},

  abstract     = {Spin masers are a prototype nonlinear dynamic system. They undergo a bifurcation at a critical amplification factor, transiting into a limit cycle phase characterized by a Larmor precession around the external bias magnetic field, thereby serving as a key frequency reference for precision measurements. Recently, a system of coupled twin spin masers placed in dual bias magnetic fields, involving simultaneously two intrinsic Larmor frequencies, has been studied in Commun. Phys. 8 , 41 (2025) . Compared with previous spin masers, this setup exhibits new attractors such as quasiperiodic orbits and chaos in addition to the usual limit cycles and the trivial no signal fixed point. The richer dynamic phases imply the existence of bifurcations, whose nature has not been fully analyzed. Here, to shed light on the nature of the bifurcations, we turn to a closely related system and systematically study the various bifurcations therein along different routes in parameter space. We identify the bifurcations as of the types including pitchfork, Hopf, homoclinic bifurcations, and saddle-node bifurcations of cycles. By both analytical and numerical methods, we reveal how various attractors interplay with each other and change their stability. We also quantitatively evaluate the locations where these bifurcations occur by tracking the both stable and even not easily detected unstable limit cycles. These findings deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms resulting in the rich dynamic phases in the coupled twin spin masers.},

We present a many-body interaction platform to enhance multimode Gaussian entanglement where the center-of-mass motion is coupled to a magnon through a microwave field. The strong and ultrastrong cavity-magnon couplings allow the generation of simultaneous entanglement in all bipartitions, without any pairwise entanglement, through numerical optimization of parameters, akin to quantum phase transitions in spin systems. Moreover, the ultrastrong coupling facilitates the generation of such multimode entanglement for a low-frequency oscillator in the unresolved sideband. This scheme provides a potential platform to explore the quantum effects in a large massive oscillator and paves the way for creating complex states for quantum simulation, sensing, exploring exotic quantum phases, and quantum computing.},

We measure the spectrum and efficiency of wavelength conversion, which successfully validates the designed CMPM scheme. We further measure the pairs generation rate of the biphoton based on the spontaneous four-wave mixing, which features a narrow bandwidth consistent well with the theoretical simulations. Multiple CMPM conditions can be achieved by exploiting the combinations of even and odd supermodes of the coupled system and tuned by designing a proper coupling gap between the two waveguides. The CMPM can extend the FWM nonlinear process ranging from the O band to the U band and even the midinfrared, enriching the working wavelength to a large extent. In addition, the CMPM features a discrete-band narrow bandwidth, which will greatly enhance the encoding density of frequency and the spectral purity of generated photon. In addition, our methods can be easily extended to a wide range of materials such as silicon nitride, dispensing with the dispersion engineering for phase matching.},

It is seen that both their photonic and phononic wave components manifest quasi-periodic oscillatory patterns and coherent localization. We unveil that such breather dynamics can be well controlled by adjusting the coupling strength, the cavity field decay, and the number of array cells. As a result, we observe an unusual odd-even lattice effect in that stable breathers are only available when the cell number is even. We anticipate that these findings from the staggered optomechanical configuration may expand the realm of cavity optomechanics, yielding promising applications such as on-chip manipulation of light propagation.},

  abstract     = {We have developed a theory of the first- and second-harmonic-generated extinction coefficients in plasmonic nanohybrids. We consider that a nanohybrid is made of an ensemble of interacting metallic nanoparticles (MNPs). The surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) for the MNPs and the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) between nanoparticles are calculated. Using the quantum mechanical density matrix method, we have obtained analytical expressions for the first- and second-harmonic-generated extinction coefficients in the presence of the SPP and DDI fields. These analytical expressions can be useful for scientists and engineers to compare their experiments and make new plasmonic devices. We have predicted that there is a noticeable enhancement in the extinction coefficients due to an extra contribution from the SPPs present in the nanohybrid. We found that there are two types of contributions to the extinction coefficients. The first is called the photonic extinction coefficient induced by the probe field. The second is called the polaritonic extinction coefficient produced by the SPP field. The enhancement phenomenon can be used to fabricate the nanoamplifiers and nanosensors from plasmonic nanohybrids. Next, we have compared theory with experimental data of the Au-MNPs and Au/Ag core-shell metallic nanorods for the first harmonic extinction coefficient. Similarly, we have also compared our theory with experimental data of the Au/Ag core-shell MNPs for the second harmonic extinction coefficient. Good agreement between theory and experiments is found. Further, we predicted the phenomenon of the electromagnetically induced transparency in the first- and second-harmonic-generated extinction coefficients due to DDI coupling. In other words, the nanohybrid becomes transparent for the first- and second-harmonic-generated extinction processes. Additionally, we found that a peak in the extinction coefficient splits into two peaks due to DDI coupling. Due to the strong coupling between the exciton and DDI polaritons, the excitonic state splits into two states and produces two excitons. These two excitons are responsible for the two peaks. This finding can be used to fabricate nanoswitches (i.e., ON = one peak, OFF = two peaks) and nanosensors using plasmonic nanohybrids.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here we develop a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.},

Both quantities exhibit characteristic scaling near transition points, with the disorder to the Z 2 ordered phase transition showing behavior consistent with the Ising universality class, while the disorder to the Z 3 phase transition displays distinct critical properties. We demonstrate that GP and GE serve as sensitive probes of quantum criticality, providing consistent critical parameters and scaling behavior. A unifying description of these geometric quantities from a quantum geometry perspective is explored, and an interferometric setup for their potential measurement is discussed. Our results provide insights into the interplay between geometric phase and multipartite entanglement near quantum phase transitions in Rydberg-atom systems, revealing how these quantities reflect the underlying critical behavior in these complex quantum many-body systems.},

  abstract     = {Haldane's fractional exclusion statistics (FES) describe generalized Pauli exclusion statistics, which can be regarded as emergent quantum statistics induced by the intrinsic dynamical interaction. Nonmutual FES have been identified at the quantum criticality of the one-dimensional (1D) and 2D interacting Bose gas [ Nat. Sci. Rev. 9 , nwac027 (2022) ]. It is naturally asked if such nonmutual FES can be induced by the spin-spin interaction in the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 X X X chain. In this article, we first represent the Bethe ansatz equations of spin strings in terms of the FES equations of different species. Then we show that the 1D spin X X X chain remarkably possesses nonmutual FES in the critical region. We observe that the equation of state in terms of the FES gives rises to full statistical properties of the model at quantum criticality, which are in good agreement with the results obtained from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the model. From the nonmutual FES, we also precisely determine the quantum scaling functions, which further agree well with the previous TBA results [ Phys. Rev. B 96 , 220401(R) (2017) ]. Finally, we also establish an exact mapping between the scaling functions of the Lieb-Liniger model and the spin Heisenberg spin chain at quantum criticality.

The system is driven by two alternating interaction kicks per period. For small kick strengths, localized topologically protected bound states exist, and as the kick strengths increase, these states proliferate. However, at large kick strengths they gradually delocalize in stages, eventually becoming random orthonormal vectors as chaos emerges. We identify the delocalization of the bound states as a finite-size effect where their proliferation leads to their eventual overlap. This insight allows us to make analytic predictions for the onset and full emergence of chaos which are supported by numerical results of the quasienergy level spacing ratio and Rényi entropy. A dynamical probe is also proposed to distinguish chaotic from regular behavior.},

We find that the form of the semiclassical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. The quantum correction to the phase is a factor ℓ 2 / A 2 smaller than the semiclassical perturbation itself, where ℓ is the quantum harmonic-oscillator lengthscale, and A is the classical amplitude of the motion.

Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this paper and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of the MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.},

We analyze the complex excitation spectrum of a miscible trapped dipolar Bose mixture, showing that it provides key insights about the double-supersolid regime. We show that this regime may be readily probed experimentally by monitoring the appearance of a doublet of superfluid compressional modes, linked to the different superfluid character of each component. Additionally, the dipolar supersolid mixture exhibits a nontrivial spin nature of the dipolar rotons, the Higgs excitation, and the low-lying Goldstone modes. Interestingly, the analysis of the lowest-lying modes allows for monitoring the transition of just one of the components into the incoherent-droplet regime, whereas the other remains coherent, highlighting their disparate superfluid properties.},

An efficient analytical method for revealing the impact of non-Hermiticity on the ground states and dynamics of SO-coupled BECs is proposed. A dispersion relation with effective mass m 2 that can be larger than 1, less than 1, or negative is engineered by the momentum-dependent gain and loss, which is distinct from the ordinary SO-coupled BECs, where m 2 > 1 always holds. Negative effective mass can lead to the self-interference effect of condensates, while m 2 < 1 means that condensates can gain a larger acceleration when they are subjected to a constant force. Interestingly, the high-order zero-point kinetic energies are derived analytically and confirmed numerically, establishing a link between the zero-point kinetic energy and dispersion relation. In particular, the second-order zero-point kinetic energy can be controlled by the effective mass m 2 , which has an important impact on many phenomena of ultracold atomic physics. In addition, another key result is that the frequencies of dipole and breathing modes can exceed the values of traditional BECs without SO coupling when the effective mass m 2 < 1 , showing that gain (loss) is a powerful tool for probing and controlling quantum systems. Moreover, the asymmetric free expansion and self-interference effect of the condensates caused by negative effective masses are observed, and it is found that the rate of expansion is controlled by the effective mass m 2 . Our results show that the controllable gain-loss engineering in SO-coupled BECs provides a prospect to explore novel quantum many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {The Hubbard model is a paradigmatic model of strongly correlated quantum matter, thus making it desirable to investigate with quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. Here we consider the problem of two atoms interacting in a quasi-one- or quasi-two-dimensional optical lattice, geometries which are routinely realized in quantum-gas-microscope experiments. We perform an exact calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitude which accounts for the effects of the transverse confinement as well as all higher Bloch bands. This goes beyond standard perturbative treatments and allows us to precisely determine the effective Hubbard on-site interaction for arbitrary s -wave scattering length (see source code available at https://github.com/HaydnAdlong/Hubbard-Interaction-Optical-Lattices ). In particular, we find that the Hubbard on-site interaction displays lattice-induced resonances for scattering lengths on the order of the lattice spacing, which are well within reach of current experiments. Furthermore, we show that our results are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic measurements of the Hubbard interaction for a quasi-two-dimensional square optical lattice in a quantum-gas microscope. Our formalism is very general and may be extended to multiband models and other atomlike scenarios in lattice geometries, such as exciton-exciton and exciton-electron scattering in moiré superlattices.},

For weak nonlinear strength, the introduction of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the energy spectrum, which makes the topological pumping from the left edge to the right edge differ from the inverse process. For moderate nonlinear strength, self-crossing structures appear in the spectrum, and the right-to-left adiabatic pumping channel is destroyed, only left-to-right topological pumping can be achieved under slow modulation. As the nonlinear strength further increases, although left-to-right topological pumping in one pumping cycle also breaks down, we find that a thin soliton, located at a single left edge, can be mixed with the bulk soliton, and hybridized topological pumping of edge and bulk solitons can be realized after multiple pumping cycles. For stronger nonlinear strength, edge solitons are self-trapped and all topological pumping channels are shut down. Our work could trigger further studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology.},

However, a measurement error is induced as the common phase noise, e.g., vibration noise, increases. In this work, we demonstrated a real-time compensation (RTC) scheme to improve the accuracy of measurements of the differential phase in dual atom interferometers. The vibration noise was measured by two seismometers and its induced phase shift was fed back to the Raman lasers after this shift was calculated based on the sensitivity function of the atom interferometers. After the RTC module was applied, the interference signals obtained via the square modulation method were stabilized at their midfringe points, which caused the vibration-induced phase noise for each of the atom interferometers to decrease from 495 mrad to 165 mrad. The differential phase error obtained by the dual atom interferometers and two seismometers was reduced from 114.8 mrad to 49.6 mrad, which implies that the rotation measurement error was improved by a factor of 2.3. This work paves the way to accurately measuring the rotation signal and has promising applications in fields of precision measurements.},

Here we show that in a multiply connected confinement, the strong in-plane attraction of an antidipolar condensate can form stacks of ring-shaped density lumps which may coherently overlap to form a supersolid along the azimuthal symmetry axis of the system. Intriguingly, the functional behavior of the energy–angular-momentum dispersion of the antidipolar ring condensate differs from that of a usual repulsive superfluid. The periodic maxima between persistent flow and the nonrotating ground state flatten significantly and the typical pronounced cusps in the energy dispersion also occur in the rotationally symmetric supersolid state. A weak link results in the reduction of this minimum, shifting it to smaller angular momenta. With an asymmetric link potential one can selectively induce superfluid and rigid-body rotation in different layers within the same system. This intriguing setup offers new perspectives for atomtronics applications.},

Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.},

Our studies were performed using known Born-Oppenheimer potentials while developing a reduced interaction potential model. Such reduced potential models are currently a key for solving certain classes of few-body problems of atoms as they decrease the numerical burden on the computation. Although the reduced potentials are significantly shallower than actual Born-Oppenheimer potentials, they still capture the main properties of the near-threshold bound states, including their spin structure, and the scattering states over a broad range of magnetic fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that the variation in spin structure across different alkali species originates from the interplay between electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. To characterize this competition we introduce a single parameter that is a function of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, the atomic hyperfine splitting constant, and the molecular binding energy. We show that this parameter can be used to classify the spin structure of vdW molecules for each atomic species.},

Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of “synthetic dimensions” in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects.

Outgoing waves are absorbed by means of a complex absorbing potential. The corresponding photoelectron spectra are calculated by aggregating the absorbed part of the outgoing particle. Via a density operator formulation and projections onto time-independent scattering states, we obtain convergent spectra using numerical domains for which a significant part of the unbound wave is absorbed during interaction with the time-dependent field. We compare this numerical approach with methods based on approximating time-dependent scattering states by Volkov states, which do not encompass the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential. This comparison demonstrates how the present method, which was introduced by Selstø [ Phys. Rev. A 106 , 042213 (2022) ], is able to account for Coulomb corrections to the photoelectron spectra.},

In particular, the local-oscillator-based Rydberg mixer approach allows for bandwidths into the few-megahertz range. Here we use heterodyne detection of the Rydberg-atom receiver probe laser to separate the negative and positive sidebands that originate from distinct six-wave-mixing processes, in order to investigate their individual bandwidths. We experimentally confirm the prediction that the negative sideband exhibits a higher bandwidth than the positive sideband. We further explore the effect of coupling and probe laser Rabi frequency on the bandwidth, which we find to be in close agreement with our model. We achieve maximum experimental (and theoretical) bandwidths of 10.5 ± 0.4 (11.6) and 3.4 ± 0.2 (5.4) MHz for the negative and positive sidebands, respectively, from the − 3 dB roll-off point for optimized field parameters. This work provides insight into the bandwidth-limiting features of Rydberg-atom receivers and points the way towards further optimization of their response.},

  abstract     = {Alkali-metal dimers, Ak 2 , located on the surface of a helium nanodroplet, are set into rotation through the polarizability interaction with a nonresonant 1-ps-long laser pulse. The time-dependent degree of alignment is recorded using femtosecond-probe-pulse-induced Coulomb explosion into a pair of Ak + fragment ions. The results, obtained for Na 2 , K 2 , and Rb 2 in both the ground state 1 1 Σ g + and the lowest-lying triplet state 1 3 Σ u + , exhibit distinct, periodic revivals with a gradually decreasing amplitude. The dynamics differ from that expected for dimers had they behaved as free rotors. Numerically, we solve the time-dependent rotational Schrödinger equation, including an effective mean-field potential to describe the interaction between the dimer and the droplet. The experimental and simulated alignment dynamics agree well and their comparison enables us to determine the effective rotational constants of the alkali dimers with the exception of Rb 2 ( 1 3 Σ u + ) that only exhibits a prompt alignment peak but no subsequent revivals. For Na 2 ( 1 3 Σ u + ), K 2 ( 1 1 Σ g + ), K 2 ( 1 3 Σ u + ), and Rb 2 ( 1 1 Σ g + ), the alignment dynamics are well described by a two-dimensional rotor model. We ascribe this to a significant confinement of the internuclear axis of these dimers, induced by the orientation-dependent droplet–dimer interaction, to the tangential plane of their residence point on the droplet.},

  abstract     = {The saddle-point approximation (SPA) within the framework of strong-field approximation is extensively applied in strong-field physics because it offers clear physical insight into intense light-matter interactions. In this study, we introduce an -resolved saddle-point approximation ( -SPA), where is the magnetic quantum number, to analyze the ionization dynamics of atoms initially in orbitals subjected to an intense laser field. Our results reveal that influences not only the prefactor of the ionization rate but also the saddle-point equation itself, an effect overlooked in prior studies. The accuracy of the -SPA method is validated through comparisons with the backpropagation method and the strong-field approximation, showing its superiority over the conventional SPA approach. By employing the -SPA approach, we are able to extract more accurate distributions of the initial tunneling exit energy and position, thereby allowing for a more precise determination of the asymptotic photoelectron characteristics. Additionally, we extend the conservation law for angular momentum and energy of photoelectrons from orbitals to orbitals and from circularly polarized to elliptically polarized laser fields, both at the tunnel exit and in the asymptotic region. This work facilitates future research on strong-field ionization from arbitrary atomic orbitals.},

This three-body channel is distinguished from the raw data by analyzing the correlation between the sum momentum vectors of the two ionic fragments A r + versus their total kinetic energy releases. Two distinct fragmentation pathways, concerted and sequential, are confirmed by a detailed examination of the kinetic energy releases’ correlation spectra, Newton diagrams, and Dalitz plots of the fragments. The emission directions of the neutral fragments from the sequential pathway are manipulated by adjusting the relative phase of the two-color laser fields. The observed relative phase-dependent asymmetry patterns are attributed to the enhanced ionization induced asymmetric emission of residual A r 2 + in the first dissociation step.

Furthermore, TDDFT simulations exhibit broader angular distributions and more diverse ion trajectories, aligning closely with experimental observations.

  abstract     = {We present comprehensive determinations of the diffusion coefficients D at T = 24 ∘ C for trace amounts of naturally abundant Rb atoms in inert, naturally abundant He, Ne, N 2 , Ar, Kr, and Xe buffer gases using a single measurement technique. They have been measured by establishing a spatially periodic population grating in the Rb sample using two laser beams that intersect at a small angle θ of a few milliradians. The atomic population grating decays exponentially in time due to diffusive motion induced by momentum-changing elastic collisions between Rb and buffer gas atoms or molecules. This decay is monitored by observing the scattered field from a readout beam aligned along the direction of one of the excitation beams. We distinguish the contribution of diffusion from other collisional processes by measuring the characteristic θ 2 dependence of the decay rate. We also measure the systematic dependence of the decay rate on the buffer gas pressure over a range of 7000 to 90 000 Pa. In this manner, we obtain diffusion coefficients at standard atmospheric pressure of 101 325 Pa and at a temperature of 24.0 ( 5 ) ∘ C . We use two models to correct for systematic effects due to the transit time, one assuming a rectangular profile of the population distribution and a rectangular readout beam profile, and a second using Gaussian profiles. We obtain weighted averages of 0.33(5), 0.214(14), 0.132(7), 0.123(9), 0.093(9), and 0.073 ( 4 ) cm 2 /s for Rb in He, Ne, N 2 , Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. The number in parentheses represents one standard deviation of the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty. We also compare these data with diffusion coefficients obtained using quantum, classical, and semiclassical theoretical methods based on the most accurate interatomic interaction potentials from the literature. Near room temperature, simulations of D using classical and quantum methods agree within their intrinsic, sub-1% standard uncertainties. We find that the semiclassical model only gives the correct orders of magnitude for D . Our computed diffusion coefficients based on the quantum theory agree with the experimental determinations when systematic effects are taken into account. Our measurements and modeling are relevant to the optimization of magnetometers, biomedical imaging using spin-polarized noble gases, tests of collision models based on interatomic potentials, and the development of pressure sensors.},

These two prominent dynamical effects—characteristic of intense, short, and (near-)resonant laser pulses interacting with matter—usually coexist, and are thus hard to distinguish. Here, we revisit the multipeak pattern of the Autler-Townes doublet to uncover its physical origin, by calculating the photoelectron spectrum accurately. Our joint analytical and numerical analysis reveals that selectively populating the two emerging dynamically dressed states is key to an efficient balancing between ROs and DI. We demonstrate physical situations where either ROs or DI dictate the spectrum shape, and explore the transition between these regimes.

We employ density-matrix simulations and experiments to investigate how this hyperfine systematic error varies with spin polarization in a Rb 87 free-induction-decay (FID) magnetometer. At low spin polarizations P ≤ 0.5 , this effect causes single-frequency magnetic-field-extraction techniques to exhibit inaccuracies up to approximately 3.5 nT. Density-matrix simulations reveal that this bias can be traced to the relative amplitude and phase between the F = I ± 1 / 2 hyperfine ground-state manifolds in the FID spin precession signal. We show that this systematic error can be mitigated using either a double-frequency fitting model that accounts for the relative amplitude and phase or synchronous-pulse pumping that minimizes the F = 1 contribution to the FID signal. Theoretical simulations predict accuracies within 0.5 nT for both techniques across a wide range of spin polarizations, suggesting a sevenfold enhancement over single-frequency extraction methods. Our experiments validate this, showcasing a variation in the extracted field below 1 nT, a 3.5-fold improvement compared to single-frequency extraction methods. Furthermore, the mitigation techniques demonstrate agreement of the extracted magnetic field within 1.5 nT.},

  abstract     = {Manipulating quantum states is at the heart of quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Landau-Zener Rabi oscillation (LZRO), which arises from a quantum two-level system swept repeatedly across the avoided crossing point in the time domain, has been suggested for widespread use in manipulating quantum states. Cold atoms are one of the most prominent platforms for quantum computing and precision measurement. However, LZRO has never been observed in cold atoms due to its stringent requirements. By compensating for the linear drift of the clock laser and optimizing experimental parameters, we successfully measured LZRO on the strontium atomic optical clock platform under both fast- and slow-passage limits within four to six driving periods. Compared to previous results on other platforms, the duration of the plateau is times longer in the optical lattice clock. The experimental data also suggests that destructive Landau-Zener interference can effectively suppress dephasing effects in the optical lattice clock, paving the way for manipulating quantum states against various environmental effects in cold atomic systems.},

  abstract     = {Multiphoton electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of atomic vapors involves several intermediate atomic levels. The substructure of these levels and their collisional interactions can drastically alter experimental EIT signals. Here we report on hyperfine structure and collision effects in three-photon Rydberg EIT on the cascade in a room-temperature vapor cell. In our measurements of EIT spectra, we identify two types of EIT signatures that correspond with distinct excitation pathways and atomic velocity classes in the atomic vapor. The hyperfine structure and Autler-Townes splittings lead to complex patterns in the EIT spectra, which we analyze with the aid of 10-level EIT simulations. Adding 50 mTorr of Ar gas alters the EIT spectra and induces an additional, third EIT mode. Based on our simulation results, we attribute these changes to hyperfine collisions in the Rb level. Our study may become useful in quantum technologies involving Rydberg EIT and hyperfine collisions in vapor cells, including noninvasive spatiotemporally resolved electric-field sensing of electric fields in low-pressure plasmas.},

This interaction is traditionally modeled within orbital-free density functional theory with frozen atomic electron densities, following the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) model. In this work, we calculate atom pair-specific repulsive interatomic potentials with the ZBL model, and compare them to two kinds of quantum chemical calculations (second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory in flexible Gaussian basis sets as well as density functional theory with numerical atomic orbital basis sets) which go well beyond the limitations in the ZBL model, allowing the density to relax in the calculations. We show that the repulsive interatomic potentials predicted by the two quantum chemical models agree within for potential energies above 30 eV, while the ZBL pair-specific potentials and universal ZBL potentials differ much more from either of these calculations. We provide pair-specific fits of the screening functions in terms of three exponentials to the calculations for all pairs for , and show that they agree within % with the raw data. We use these potentials to simulate ion implantation depth profiles in single-crystalline Si and show very good agreement with experiment. However, we also show that under channeling conditions, the attractive part of the potential can affect the depth profiles.},

  abstract     = {The molecular anion C 2 − has been of interest in the past few years as a candidate for laser cooling due to its electronic structure and favorable branching ratios to the ground electronic and vibrational states. Molecular hydrogen has been used by the Wester group at Innsbruck as a buffer gas to cool the molecule's internal rovibrational motion. In the present work we generate a five-dimensional (5D) interaction potential for the system by considering the H 2 as a rigid rotor and the C 2 − as a rotating-vibrating diatomic molecule. We then calculate the cross sections and rate coefficients for rovibrational inelastic collisions of C 2 − with both para- and ortho- H 2 on this 5D ab initio potential energy surface using quantum scattering theory for the dynamics. The rates for vibrational quenching are obtained over a range of temperatures that covers the single point measured by the experiments. A comparison is also made with earlier results which had used a simpler 3D interaction potential. Para- H 2 is found to be more efficient than ortho- H 2 (with or without also undergoing rotational excitation) in cooling C 2 − . The rate coefficients for cooling the anions have been computed by appropriately weighting the ortho- and para- H 2 and compared with the available experimental result at 20 K. The computed results are nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the single experimental point. When the vibrational deexcitation rate coefficients are employed without any concurrent rotational excitations in the final C 2 − anions (a situation considered to be nonphysical under the present experimental setup), the properly averaged results are found to get smaller and to become very close to the existing experimental measurements. The robustness of the present results is tested and confirmed. The implications of these results for laser cooling of C 2 − are analyzed and discussed.},

Stark deceleration provides an important access to taming polar molecules and makes the collision and high-resolution spectroscopy a reality. However, the full deceleration efficiency of the traditional Stark decelerator has been impeded by its intrinsic loss mechanisms, which significantly limit its applications. In this paper, we introduce an interspersed guiding deceleration strategy that surpasses the periodic phase stability limitations of traditional Stark decelerator. Our approach is theoretically and experimentally validated using the molecule, achieving significant gains of for all final velocity ranges. Additionally, our method requires a lower operation number of switching that is beneficial for reducing the consumption of the high-voltage switches and suitable for controlling a large number of deceleration stages. This method is applicable to any traditional crossed-pin Stark decelerator and can stop a wider variety of molecular species with higher densities, including those with a small Stark shift-to-mass ratio. It is anticipated to become an essential tool for producing cold and dense molecular samples, offering promising prospects for cold collision studies and precision measurements.},

Our approach achieves a measurement resolution of 0.36 G in an ambient magnetic field of 610 G and can effectively track time-varying magnetic fields.

In alkaline Rydberg molecules, bound vibrational states exist even when these potential wells are disrupted by level repulsion from the steep butterfly potential energy curve induced by a scattering shape resonance. The binding in this case is attributed to quantum reflection. However, the rapidly varying regions of the potential energy landscape where quantum reflection occurs often coincide with regions where nonadiabatic coupling becomes significant. By comparing the molecular states calculated within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where quantum reflection is the only binding mechanism, with those obtained from the full set of coupled channel equations, we assess the effects of nonadiabatic coupling on vibrational energies and lifetimes. Our findings show that these couplings can stabilize the molecule by providing an additional barrier which protects the vibrational states from predissociation and nonradiative transitions. There can also be extreme cases where nonadiabatic coupling completely dominates the binding and the molecular lifetimes saturate at the atomic Rydberg lifetime.},

The theory of this process, known as two-center dielectronic recombination (2CDR), is significantly extended to account for the interatomic motion between the two atoms involved. Additionally, the electron transfer mechanism, due to orbital overlap between the atoms, is incorporated into the model. Using the example reaction , we demonstrate that both interatomic motion and electron transfer have a substantial impact on the predicted efficiency of 2CDR. Our findings suggest that 2CDR can dominate over photorecombination across a much broader energy range of the incoming electron than previously estimated.

These metals are characterized by the filling of the 𝑑 subshell and the promotion of some of the electrons to the conduction band. The contribution of 𝑑 electrons at low-impact energies has been noted experimentally in the past as a break of the linear dependence of the stopping power with the ion velocity. In this paper we describe the response of these electrons considering the atomic inhomogeneous momentum distribution. We focus on the transition metals of groups 10 and 11 in the Periodic Table: Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au. Results are shown to describe the low-energy stopping power, with good agreement with the experimental data and available time-dependent density-functional theory results. By combining the present nonperturbative model for the 𝑑 -subshell contribution with other approaches for the valence electrons and for the inner shells, we provide a coherent theoretical method capable of describing the stopping power of these transition metals from the very-low- to the high-energy region.},

To resolve the measured Xe target x-ray spectra into four Gaussian peaks, including the hypersatellites and satellites of the lines, we develop a data-analysis method that reduces the fitting parameters from 12 to 6. The determined intensities of the hypersatellites and satellites, which shows no significant radiation anisotropy, are subsequently used to calculate the cross-section ratio for double-to-single -shell vacancy production in the Xe target atoms.

It then reveals that individual excited states also have state-specific stationary conditions that can be deduced from the ensemble solution and apply to EDFT and its EPFT counterpart. However, the state-specific stationary condition for the noninteracting Kohn-Sham EPFT is revealed to be more complicated than the ground-state problem, due in part to a contribution from density-driven correlations that are neglected in typical “ ” approaches. The importance of this term is scrutinized through exact and approximate examples. Some implications for self-consistency in exact theory and approximations are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Energy exchanges among internal energy modes in collisions directly affect the microscopic dynamical evolution of nonequilibrium phenomena in these gases. Quantum calculations of energy exchanges, especially those involving high molecular levels, are challenging due to their daunting computational costs. In this study, by capturing quantum effects associated with vibrational motions, we employ the improved mixed quantum-classical (MQC) method to obtain rate coefficients of both vibration-to-vibration (V-V) and vibration-to-translation or rotation (V-T–R) energy exchanges for collisions over a wide temperature range (100–9000 K). This approach permits the achievement of results up to vibrational levels close to the molecular dissociation limit. The adopted potential-energy surface (PES) is formulated using a proper representation of both intermolecular and intramolecular components to provide the dependence of the interaction energy on molecular separation distances and molecular deformations. Notably, the MQC calculations with the new PES yield vibrational relaxation rate coefficients consistent with experimental data. In addition to the comprehensive MQC data, we utilize Gaussian process regression to predict rates for processes not directly computed, thus completing the V-V and V-T–R datasets for selected processes across full vibrational levels of and . At low temperatures, notable anti-Arrhenius behavior is observed, which would enhance relaxation processes in cold environments typical of upper and planetary atmospheres. The extensive datasets are valuable for describing the kinetic behaviors of and across various vibrational levels and temperatures, aiding in addressing non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions where the influence of vibrationally excited air molecules cannot be ignored.},

Precise knowledge of these quantities is immensely useful for estimating uncertainties caused by major systematic effects such as the linear and quadratic Stark shifts and black-body radiation shifts in the optical and clocks. A finite-field approach is adopted for estimating these quantities in which the first-order and second-order energy level shifts are analyzed by varying strengths of externally applied electric field and field- gradient. To achieve high-accuracy results in the heavier ion, we first calculate these properties in a relatively lighter clock candidate , which involves similar clock states. From these analyses, we learn that electron correlation effects arising from triple excitations in the RCC theory contribute significantly to the above properties, and are decisive factors in bringing the calculated values closer to the experimental results.},

To realize the model, we make use of the strong dipolar exchange interactions that naturally occur in the ground state of dysprosium due to its large electron angular momentum of J = 8. To implement spin-1 particles, we encode the spin degree of freedom into three Zeeman sublevels, which are energetically isolated by applying a magnetic field. Using the density-matrix renormalization group, we analyze the ground-state properties of the resulting effective model. We find that a chain of fermionic dysprosium atoms in a suitable magnetic field can form a Haldane state with the characteristic spin-1/2 edge modes. Furthermore, we discuss the use of AC Stark shifts and Raman-type schemes for bosonic dysprosium to isolate effective spin-1 systems and to increase the tunability of model parameters.},

Existing polarization measurement methods are difficult to implement experimentally because they require direct interference in the environment of the qubit. Here, in order to obtain the information, it is necessary to measure the qubit coherence at certain points of time, which are unambiguously determined by the applied magnetic field. For sufficiently high magnetic fields, the minimum value of the measured coherence constitutes an upper bound on the product of the initial polarizations of each environmental spin. The most significant advantage of the method, which allows to infer initial values of nuclear polarizations without any direct access to the environment, lies in its simplicity and the small amount of experimental resources that it requires. We exemplify the operation of the scheme on a realistic, randomly generated environment of eight nuclear spins, obtaining a reasonably accurate estimation of the initial polarization.},

Fisher information supplied to the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) has proved to be a powerful and efficient tool for resolution analysis and optical setups optimization. However, the standard CRB is not applicable to constrained problems violating the unbiasedness condition, while such models are frequently encountered in quantum imaging of complex objects. Complementary to the existing approaches based on modifying CRB, we propose a practical algorithm for approximate construction of a modified Fisher information matrix, which takes the constraints into account and enables accurate estimation of errors for constrained problems by the standard CRB. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique by applying it to one-, two-, and multiparameter model problems in quantum imaging. The approach provides quantitative explanation of previous results with successful experimental reconstruction of objects with the spatial scale smaller than the theoretical limit predicted by the standard CRB.},

  abstract     = {Distributed computing, involving multiple servers collaborating on designated computations, faces a critical challenge in optimizing interserver communication—an issue central to the study of communication complexity. Quantum resources offer advantages over classical methods in addressing this challenge. In this work, we investigate a distributed computing scenario with multiple senders and a single receiver, establishing a scalable advantage of multipartite quantum entanglement in mitigating communication complexity. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the receiver and the senders share a multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state—a quintessential form of genuine multipartite entanglement—certain global functions of the distributed inputs can be computed with only one bit of classical communication from each sender. In contrast, without entanglement, two bits of communication are required from all but one sender. Consequently, quantum entanglement reduces communication overhead by n − 1 bits for n senders, allowing for arbitrary scaling with an increasing number of senders. We also show that the entanglement-based protocol exhibits significant robustness under white noise, thereby establishing the potential for experimental realization of this quantum advantage.},

Lett. 59 , 2044 (1987) ] for the quantum interference of amplitudes that lead to complete destructive interference for coincident counts for the output of a balanced, lossless 50:50 beam splitter (BS). We examine the extended HOM (eHOM) effect by first investigating diagrammatically the multiphoton scattering of photons from the two input ports to the two output ports for Fock number basis states (FS) | n , m 〉 12 , and show that destructive interference occurs pairwise within the quantum amplitudes with many scattering components, generalizing the two-photon HOM effect. This analysis leads us to a general, simple analytical derivation of the eHOM effect for FS/FS inputs, which has profound implications for arbitrary bipartite photonic input states constructed from such basis states: if the input state to one input port of the BS is of odd parity, i.e., constructed only of odd numbers of photons, then regardless of the input state to the second 50:50 BS port, there will be a central nodal line (CNL) of zeros in the joint output probability distribution along the main diagonal for coincidence detection. We further examine the case of a single photon interacting with a coherent state (an idealized laser) and consider prospects for experimental detection by including additional effects such as imperfect detection efficiency and time delay between the detected output photons. This work highlights the importance of the nonclassicality of light, and in particular the interference effects stemming from the discreteness of photon quanta.},

However, the successful implementation of the VQE is quite challenging, as the ansatz must be sufficiently expressive, yet, if it is overly expressive, it may hinder the optimization process of the VQE in finding the global minimum. To address this challenge of the VQE, a commonly used approach is to apply the symmetries of the system, which reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space for the VQE. Here, we propose a quantum circuit that can be used for systems with mirror symmetry and occupation-number-inversion symmetry. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to find the eigenenergies of the Anderson impurity model, a representative fundamental model for various quantum simulations. In addition, we demonstrate the usability of our quantum circuit by applying it to a quantum algorithm for Green's function, which plays a crucial role in understanding quantum systems of condensed matter physics.},

Via periodically modulating the couplers, the Abelian gauge potential, termed effective magnetic flux, can be synthesized artificially, making the system an excellent platform for simulating two-dimensional topological physics. First, we focus on the three-leg ladder which only has three rows and investigate the chiral dynamics therein for the single-particle ground state when the effective magnetic flux varies. We find what we call the “staggered vortex-Meissner phase transition,” where the vortex number can typically stagger a few times between one (defined as “vortex phase”) and larger integers (defined as “Meissner phase”) when the effective magnetic flux changes between − π and π . This phenomenon, actually not a phase transition by definition, is quite different from the vortex-Meissner phase transition in the two-leg ladder that, in contrast, possesses only two rows and is usually treated as the quasi-two-dimensional model. Also, we find that the chiral current relies on the effective magnetic flux according to a squeezed sinusoidal function. Both the staggering of the vortex number and squeezing of the chiral current can be controllable by the coupling ratio, which is defined by the coupling-strength ratio between the column direction and row direction. Second, we continue to increase the number of rows beyond three, and the topological band structure to be anticipated at an infinite number of rows begins to occur even for a relatively small number (10 or so for typical parameters) of rows. This heralds a small circuit scale enough to observe the topological band. The behavior of the edge state in the band gap can be interpreted by the topological Chern number, which can be calculated through integrating the Berry curvature with respect to the first Brillouin zone. Last, we present a systematic method on how to measure the topological band structure based on time- and space-domain Fourier transformation of the wave function after properly exciting the qubits, which should be helpful for comprehensively analyzing the topological physics since all the topological properties are mainly contained in the band structure. Our results offer an avenue for simulating two-dimensional topological physics on the state-of-the-art superconducting quantum chips.},

We propose a practical technique that enables noise tolerance in such scenarios, recovering the quantum advantage in retrieving the required bit. We perform a photonic implementation of a QRAC using polarization-encoded qubits under an amplitude-damping channel, where simple operations allow for noise robustness showing the revival of the quantum advantage when the noisy channel degrades the performance of the QRAC. This revival can be observed by violating a suitable dimension witness, which is closely related to the average success probability of the QRAC. This technique can be extended to other applications in the so-called prepare-and-measure scenario, enhancing the semi-device-independent protocol implementations.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining exact solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using classical computing is computationally expensive. The current tenet in the field is that quantum computers can address these problems more efficiently. While promising algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum hardware, variational algorithms have emerged as viable candidates for near-term devices. The success of these algorithms hinges on multiple factors, with the design of the Ansatz being of the utmost importance. It is known that popular approaches such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing suffer from adiabatic bottlenecks, which lead to either larger circuit depth or evolution time. On the other hand, the evolution time of imaginary-time evolution is bounded by the inverse energy gap of the Hamiltonian, which is constant for most noncritical physical systems. In this work we propose an imaginary Hamiltonian variational Ansatz ( ) inspired by quantum imaginary-time evolution to solve the MaxCut problem. We introduce a tree arrangement of the parametrized quantum gates, enabling the exact solution of arbitrary tree graphs using the one-round . For randomly generated -regular graphs, we numerically demonstrate that the solves the MaxCut problem with a small constant number of rounds and sublinear depth, outperforming the QAOA, which requires rounds increasing with the graph size. Furthermore, our Ansatz solves the MaxCut problem exactly for graphs with up to 24 nodes and , whereas only approximate solutions can be derived by the classical near-optimal Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We validate our simulated results with hardware demonstrations on a graph with 67 nodes.},

The promising potential of parameter transferability across problem instances with similar local structures has been demonstrated in the context of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. In this paper we build on these advancements by extending the concept to annealing-based protocols, employing Bayesian optimization to design robust quasiadiabatic schedules. Our study reveals that, for maximum independent set problems on graph families with shared geometries, optimal parameters naturally concentrate, enabling efficient transferability between similar instances and from smaller to larger ones. Experimental results on the Orion Alpha platform validate the effectiveness of our approach, scaling to problems with up to 100 qubits. We apply this method to address a smart-charging optimization problem on a real dataset.

Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of noise interpolation, the use of a single-qubit random ancilla, and superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful performance.},

The basis vectors are prepared using truncated versions of standard state preparation methods such as imaginary-time evolution (ITE), adiabatic state preparation (ASP), and variational quantum eigensolver. By using these truncated methods combined with eigenvector continuation, we can directly improve upon them, obtaining more accurate ground-state energies at a reduced cost. We use several spin systems to demonstrate convergence even when methods like ITE and ASP fail, such as ASP in the presence of level crossings and ITE with vanishing energy gaps. We also showcase the noise resilience of this approach beyond the gains already made by having shallower quantum circuits.

Moreover, we show that the two-photon driving requirement can be relaxed and that full controllability is achievable with only one-photon (linear) drives. We make use of both Trotter-Suzuki decompositions and gradient-based optimization to find control pulses for a desired gate, which reduces the computational overhead by using a small blockaded subspace. We also discuss the infidelity arising from input power limitations in realistic settings, as well as from corrections to the rotating-wave approximation.

  abstract     = {We propose a scheme achieving the ultimate quantum precision for the estimation of the transverse displacement between two interfering photons. Such a transverse displacement could be caused, for example, by the refracting properties of the propagation medium or by the orientation of a system of mirrors. By performing transverse-momentum sampling interference between polarization-entangled pairs of photons that propagate with different momenta, we show that it is possible to perform transverse-displacement estimation with a precision that increases with the difference of the transverse momenta of the photons. We show that the precision achieved with our scheme is independent of the value of the displacement, which is useful when tracking a variable displacement. Moreover, only for small displacements, we show that the estimation can be performed without the need for transverse-momentum-resolving detectors. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that it is the quantum interference arising from two-photon entanglement in the transverse momenta at the very heart of the foreseen quantum-limited sensitivity in the spatial domain.},

In this paper, we present two deterministic protocols designed for the generation of a four-dimensional two-qudit Bell state and three-qudit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state assisted by cross-Kerr nonlinearity, where the four-dimensional qudit is encoded in the hybrid polarization-spatial state of the single photon to conserve quantum resources and alleviate environmental noise. The proposed protocols for generating a four-dimensional two-qudit Bell state and three-qudit GHZ state are circuit concise, high success, robust fidelity, noise resistant, and resource saving. Moreover, the four-dimensional -qudit ( ) GHZ states can be generated with the help of the generating devices of the four-dimensional Bell state. Consequently, its efficiency and fidelity decay exponentially by a factor of . Further, the arbitrary high-dimensional qudit-encoded entangled states can be achieved with linear-optics four-dimensional single-qudit gates and gates. These protocols offer a reference for further advancements in high-dimensional state generation technology and providing insights for the practical implementations of metrological enhancement, quantum simulation, high-dimensional quantum computation, and quantum error correction.},

This is done using the usual kick sequence in combination with the well established technique of Raman velocity selection. We argue that this platform is well suited to implement AA, as its characteristic property of localization can be exploited to enhance the performance of the amplitude amplification algorithm by reducing its average runtime. We also introduce a kick potential which asymptotically leads to the optimal quantum speedup, constituting a complementary approach. Finally, we demonstrate that the scheme is fairly robust to noise in the kicks and discuss the experimental feasibility of each component of our proposal},

Identifying quantum codes with nice code parameters for physically motivated noise models remains an interesting challenge. While past work has primarily focused on qubit codes, here we identify a [4,1] qudit error correcting code tailored to protect against amplitude-damping noise. We show that this four-qudit code satisfies the error correction conditions for all single-qudit and a few two-qudit damping errors up to the leading order in the damping parameter γ . We devise a protocol to extract syndromes that unambiguously identify this set of errors, leading to a noise-adapted recovery scheme that achieves a fidelity loss of O ( γ 2 ) . For the d = 2 case, our QEC scheme is identical to the known example of the four-qubit code and the associated syndrome-based recovery. We also assess the performance of this code using the Petz recovery map and note some interesting deviations from the qubit case. Finally, we generalize this construction to a family of [ 2 M + 2 , M ] qudit codes that can approximately correct all the single-qudit and a few two-qudit amplitude-damping errors.},

Using the well-known Schrödinger-Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters theorem, the computation of convex-roof entanglement measures is reframed as a search for unitary matrices: a nonconvex optimization problem. To address this nonconvexity, we modify a genetic algorithm, known in the literature as differential evolution, constraining the search space to unitary matrices by using a QR factorization. We then refine results using a quasi-Newton method. We benchmark our method on simple test problems and, as an application, compute entanglement between a system and its environment over time for pure dephasing evolutions. We also study the temperature dependence of Gibbs state entanglement for a class of block-diagonal Hamiltonians to provide a complementary test scenario with a set of entangled states that are qualitatively different. We find that the method works well enough to reliably reproduce entanglement curves, even for comparatively large systems. The modified genetic algorithm is a derivative-free, nonconvex computational method that broadly applies to the computation of convex-roof entanglement measures.},

In this paper, we derive an impossibility theorem for generalized flipping devices, applicable to higher-dimensional systems, based on a causal principle, namely, commutation of spacelike operations. Given a bipartite quantum state shared between two parties Alice and Bob, this principle prohibits the resulting state from depending on the time order of Alice's and Bob's spacelike separated local operations applied on the respective parts of the bipartite systems. Importantly, unlike the argument applied to qubits, our approach does not rely on the unitary dynamics postulate of quantum theory. Furthermore, we investigate the implications of violating the principle of commutation of spacelike operations and demonstrate that such violations do not necessarily entail a violation of the no-signaling principle.},

We explore spatial search on the complete bipartite graph, which is generally irregular and breaks the equivalence of the three quantum walks for regular graphs, and where the search oracle breaks the equivalence of the Laplacian and signless Laplacian quantum walks on bipartite graphs without the oracle. We prove that a uniform superposition over all the vertices of the graph partially evolves to the marked vertices in one partite set, with the choice of set depending on the jumping rate of the quantum walk. We boost this success probability to 1 by proving that a particular nonuniform initial state completely evolves to the marked vertices in one partite set, again depending on the jumping rate. For some parameter regimes, the signless Laplacian yields the fastest search algorithm of the three, suggesting that it could be a new tool for developing faster quantum algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We present a method for gradient computation in quantum algorithms implemented on linear optical quantum computing platforms. While parameter-shift rules have become a staple in qubit gate-based quantum computing for calculating gradients, their direct application to photonic platforms has been hindered by the infinite dimensionality of phase-shift operators in Fock space. We introduce a photonic parameter-shift rule that overcomes this limitation, providing an exact formula for gradient computation in linear optical quantum processors. Our method scales linearly with the number of input photons and utilizes the same parametrized photonic circuit with shifted parameters for each evaluation. This advancement bridges a crucial gap in photonic quantum computing, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization for variational quantum algorithms on near-term photonic quantum processors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical simulations in quantum chemistry and generative modeling tasks, showing superior optimization performance as well as robustness to noise from finite sampling and photon distinguishability compared to other gradient-based and gradient-free methods.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the dynamical aspects of the quantum switch and find a particular form of quantum memory emerging out of the switch action. We first analyze the loss of information in a general quantum evolution subjected to a quantum switch and propose a measure to quantify the switch-induced memory. We then derive an uncertainty relation between information loss and switch-induced memory. We explicitly consider the example of depolarizing dynamics and show how it is affected by the action of a quantum switch. For a more detailed analysis, we consider both the control qubit and the final measurement on the control qubit as noisy and investigate the said uncertainty relation. Further, while deriving the Lindblad-type dynamics for the reduced operation of the switch action, we identify that the switch-induced memory actually leads to the emergence of non-Markovianity. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the emergent non-Markovianity can be explicitly attributed to the switch operation by comparing it with other standard measures of non-Markovianity. Our investigation thus paves the way forward to understanding the quantum switch as an emerging non-Markovian quantum memory.},

We propose a straightforward strategy based on postselection to prepare the logical | 0 〉 L and | + 〉 L states of the Bacon-Shor code by using flaglike qubits to verify their constituent Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. We perform stabilizer simulations with a circuit-level, depolarizing Pauli error model and find that Steane's method significantly outperforms Shor's. Not only does Steane's method result in pseudothresholds that are about one order of magnitude higher than Shor's, but also its advantage increases monotonically as we go from a distance-3 to a distance-9 Bacon-Shor code. The advantage of Steane's method is the greatest in the regime where gate errors dominate over measurement errors. Some of the circuit constructions we propose for Steane's method are not formally fault tolerant yet outperform the formally fault-tolerant Shor's protocols for experimentally relevant physical error rates. This suggests that constructing formally fault-tolerant circuits that maintain the full code distance is not strictly necessary to guarantee the usefulness of a quantum error-correcting protocol. Despite relying on postselection, we find that our methods can be efficient. These protocols would be naturally implementable on a platform with long-range qubit interactions like trapped ions or neutral atoms.},

However, entanglement criteria for MDI-EWs typically assume the idealized condition that the laboratory input states are precisely the desired ones. In this work, we remove this idealization by considering the realistic scenario in which laboratory input states may be imprecise. We specify a class of MDI-EWs, termed sensitive MDI-EWs, whose entanglement criteria fail under any nonzero imprecision in the input states. We derive sufficient conditions for an MDI-EW to be classified as sensitive, revealing that a large class of MDI-EWs exhibit this sensitivity, consistent with the intuition that sensitive MDI-EWs are common. Additionally, we demonstrate that two well-known MDI-EWs for Werner states are sensitive according to our criteria, one of which recovers the result from a previous study [ Phys. Rev. A 104 , 012429 (2021) ]. Moreover, we clarify the concept of laboratory input states in a way that makes imprecisions experimentally measurable and propose a systematic approach for modifying the criterion of any MDI-EW to accommodate small imprecisions, thus enhancing experimental relevance. A simple MDI-EW example is provided, where our modified criterion is already optimal. This work bridges the gap between idealized theoretical models and practical experimental conditions, paving the way for more robust and accessible entanglement detection in real-world settings.},

Similar to coherence and entanglement, the imaginarity has been regarded as a quantum resource, further revealing the nonclassical properties of quantum systems and providing new research directions and applications for fields such as quantum computing and quantum communication. In our work, we mainly explore the quantitative relationship between imaginarity and entanglement. For an arbitrary quantum state, there exists a general quantitative relationship between imaginarity and entanglement. For a given class of quantum states, where the closest real states to them are diagonal states, there exists an imaginarity-entanglement inequality. We demonstrate that for these quantum states, any degree of imaginarity with respect to some reference basis can be transformed into entanglement through incoherent real operations. This discovery allows us to define an entanglement-based imaginarity quantifier for these states in quantum systems of arbitrary dimensions and to study their properties. It is shown that for these quantum states, imaginarity and entanglement are operationally equivalent. Our work provides a clear quantitative and operational link between imaginarity and entanglement.},

Previous numerical results suggest that the surface code has a constant accuracy and coherence threshold under uniform coherent rotation. However, having analytical proof supporting a constant threshold is still an open problem. It is analytically proven that the toric code can exponentially suppress logical coherence in the code distance . However, the current analytical lower bound on the threshold for the rotation angle is , which linearly vanishes in instead of being constant. We show that this lower bound is achievable by the -Shor code, which does not have a threshold under stochastic noise. Compass codes provide a promising direction to improve on the previous bounds. We analytically determine thresholds for two new compass code families that provide upper and lower bounds to the rotated surface code's numerically established infidelity threshold. Furthermore, using a Majorana mode-based simulator, we use random families of compass codes to smoothly interpolate between the -Shor codes and the -Shor codes.},

We demonstrate the feasibility of VoA for three-qubit pure states and certain classes of pure tripartite qudit states. We have extended this measure to four-qubit states and general multipartite scenarios. We have done a comparative analysis to illustrate VoA's distinctiveness from established entanglement measures, notably showing it serves as an upper bound for the much celebrated generalized geometric measure. Remarkably, VoA excels in distinguishing a broad class of states that elude differentiation by the recently proposed Minimum Pairwise Concurrence measure. Finally, VoA is applied to quantify genuine entanglement in the ground states of a three-qubit Heisenberg X Y model, which highlights its practical utility in quantum information processing tasks.},

As our main focus is on assessing the usefulness and effectiveness of the ML approach, we focus exclusively on the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenario, both the four-dimensional variant, for which an analytical solution is known, and the eight-dimensional variant, for which no analytical solution is known but numerical approaches are relatively well understood. We consider a wide selection of approaches, ranging from simple data science models to dense neural networks. The two classes of models that perform well are support vector machines and dense neural networks, and they are the main focus of this work. We conclude that while it is relatively easy to achieve good performance on average, it is hard to train a model that performs well on the hard cases, i.e., points in the vicinity of the boundary of the quantum set, which are precisely the cases that are interesting from the academic point of view. In order to improve performance on hard cases we must, especially for the eight-dimensional problem, resort to a tailored choice of training data, which means that we are implicitly feeding our intuition and biases into the model. We feel that this is an important and often overlooked aspect of applying ML models to academic problems, where data generation or data selection is performed according to some implicit subjective criteria. In this way, it is possible to unconsciously steer our model so that it exhibits features that we are interested in seeing. Hence, special care must be taken while determining whether ML methods can be considered objective and unbiased in the context of academic problems.},

We show that in both scenarios, the squeezing phase of the reservoir decreases the entropic uncertainty (EU), whereas the squeezing strength increases the EU. In addition, we find that EU can be significantly reduced when both the measured particle and quantum memory are subjected to a common squeezed-vacuum bath. Furthermore, we explore the key factors controlling the behavior of EU by exploring the competition between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Moreover, we examine the tightness of the entropic uncertainty bound (EUB) in both system-environment setups and observe that the EUB is less tight when both the measured particle and quantum memory are coupled to a common squeezed-vacuum bath.},

  abstract     = {As is well known, within the single-excitation subspace, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model exhibits a remarkable ability to transfer an excitation from one end of the lattice to the other. In this work, by relaxing the restriction of the single excitation, we find that a topological channel formed by the topological edge modes of the SSH model can also realize the transfer of arbitrary Gaussian states. Specifically, we investigate the state transfer process within a one-dimensional (1D) optomechanical lattice, which can be mapped to the SSH model with tunable coupling strength. By initially preparing the first optical mode in a squeezed vacuum state and adiabatically varying the system parameters over a full cycle, the squeezed vacuum state can be transferred to the mechanical mode. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the transfer of arbitrary Gaussian states. Since Gaussian states can be described by the covariance matrix of the system, we reformulate the evolution equation of the covariance matrix in a Schrödinger-type equation. This reformulation provides us with an intuitive way to show how an arbitrary Gaussian state is transferred. Our work broadens the application of topological systems for quantum state transfer, demonstrating that not only single-excitation states but also arbitrary Gaussian states, which include multiple excitations and quantum coherence, can be efficiently transferred, with potential implications for quantum information processing.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce and characterize a broad class of quantum operations with a unique fixed point, termed quantum ergodic channels. We derive Lindblad-type master equations for these channels in arbitrary finite dimensions and analyze their non-Markovian dynamics using established measures. When the fixed point is a passive state, the channels exhibit ergotropy dynamics with notable thermodynamic implications. Specifically, under Markovian processes, ergotropy (a measure of the extractable work from a system under unitary evolution) monotonically decreases. However, in non-Markovian dynamics, ergotropy fluctuates, leading to a backflow effect that highlights memory-induced resource recovery. Our findings suggest that this ergotropy backflow could serve as an operationally meaningful indicator of non-Markovianity, offering new perspectives on the interplay between memory effects and thermodynamic behavior in open quantum systems. This study enhances the theoretical framework for understanding energy dynamics under ergodic channels and highlights new avenues for exploring the implications of memory effects in quantum batteries.},

  abstract     = {Collective Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a unique multipartite resource that enables the realization of more secure communication protocols. However, due to the lack of suitable experimental criteria, research on collective EPR steering has so far been limited to continuous variable systems. Here, we employ the coherence-based collective EPR steering criteria proposed by Mondal et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 99 , 012312 (2019) ] and develop a semidefinite programming method to find the optimal measurement settings. Experimentally, we take the three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and generalized states as examples, demonstrating that collective EPR steering can be observed by detecting the average norm of coherence of the steered subsystem. We also explored the effect of measurement settings on complementarity relations between different collective steering criteria, and established a connection between collective steering and coherence complementarity. Our paper fills a gap in the verification of collective steerability in discrete variable systems and reveals a profound connection between EPR steering and quantum coherence.},

In this work, we take Planck's principle as the underlying physical motivation for continuous-time quantum algorithms. Planck's principle states that the energy of an isolated system cannot decrease as the result of a cyclic process. We use this principle to justify monotonic schedules in quantum annealing, which are not adiabatic. This approach also highlights the limitations of reverse quantum annealing in an isolated system.},

We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an 𝑁 s × 𝑁 s matrix corresponding to 𝑁 s sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes 𝑂 ⁡ ( 2 𝛼 ⁢ 𝑁 s ) with a constant 𝛼 ≪ 1 , in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the 𝑂 ⁡ ( 2 𝑁 s ) number of summations requiring the exponential time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than 100 sites.

Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and maximum 2-satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.},

Initially we construct two distinct classes of measures for genuine multipartite entanglement utilizing real symmetric concave functions and the convex roof technique. We then demonstrate that all coherence measures for any qudit states, defined through the convex roof approach, are identical to our two classes of GME measures of the states combined with an incoherent ancilla under an incoherent unitary operation. This relationship implies that genuine multipartite entanglement can be generated from the coherence incoherent in an initial state through the incoherent unitary operations. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary exploration into the interplay between coherence and genuine quantum correlations such as genuine multipartite steering and genuine multipartite nonlocality. We show that the coherence exists in a qubit state if and only if genuine multipartite nonlocality is present for the special three-qubit states, obtained by performing unitary incoherent operations on the tensor product of the qubit state and the incoherent ancilla. Moreover, under the above process, we prove that the coherence of the qubit state exists if and only if the corresponding special state is genuinely multipartite steerable.},

Using various mutual information (MI) estimation methods, including an autoregressive network-based estimator, we find that simple image datasets exhibit area law scaling, suggesting efficient representation by two-dimensional tensor networks. More complex image datasets exceed the area law, indicating the need for generalized tensor network states or hybrid models. For Wikipedia text data, we observe power-law scaling with , approaching a volume law. This implies that one-dimensional tensor networks with area law entanglement may not efficiently capture the structure of text. We introduce two models to reproduce this scaling: a quantum-inspired random pair toy model and a linguistically motivated Markovian dependency tree model.

We analytically prove an upper bound on the number of the controlled rotation gates required to accomplish the quantum addition up to an arbitrary defect in the fidelity between the desired and imperfect output. When the environment interacts with individual qudits, we establish a connection between quantum coherence and fidelity of the output. Interestingly, we demonstrate that when banding is employed in the presence of noise, approximate circuits of constant depth outperform circuits with a higher number of controlled rotations, establishing a complementary relationship between the approximate quantum adder and the strength of the noise.

We demonstrate that applying multiphoton operations to the state results in notable nearly isotropic sub-Planck structures, with the characteristics of these structures being influenced by the photon addition and subtraction. Increasing the number of added photons compresses the sub-Planck structures in both cases. Photon subtraction, however, has the opposite effect on the sub-Planck structures in the first case and no effect in the second. Furthermore, we observe that the optimal choices of multiphoton operations lead to improved isotropy of sub-Planck structures in our cases.

We also clarify theoretically how the type-II error (false negative) probability of the proposed test behaves asymptotically and show that the proposed test is better at distinguishing hypotheses than traditional approaches. In addition, through numerical calculation, we demonstrate that the proposed test enhances performance in quantum statistical models, where we usually use the classical binomial test.

  abstract     = {Quantum architecture search (QAS) has shown significant promise in automating quantum circuit design for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, a central challenge remains in the high computational cost of evaluating the ground-truth performance of numerous circuit architectures during the search process. This challenge is further complicated by factors such as inefficient gradient computation, the barren plateau phenomenon, and frequent data exchange between classical and quantum systems within VQAs, all of which restrict the scalability of QAS for increasingly complex VQAs. In this study, we propose an enhanced QAS framework that integrates a performance predictor trained through self-supervised learning with Bayesian optimization to overcome these computational barriers. To address the challenges of circuit performance evaluation, we develop a graph-isomorphism-network-based predictor pretrained using expressibility prediction, an intrinsic measure of a circuit's capacity to explore the Hilbert space uniformly. This pretraining process creates a structured and smooth latent space, significantly improving the predictor's accuracy and generalizability with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization is integrated into the QAS framework to refine the predictor iteratively, concentrating the search on regions containing high-performance circuits and thus accelerating the search process. Simulation results for VQAs involving the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum approximate optimization algorithm demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves faster convergence to optimal circuits and substantially reduces computational costs compared to existing QAS methods.},

  abstract     = {Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECCs). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.},

We assume the code to be embedded on the surface of a wide cylinder of height and circumference with . We demonstrate a power-law divergence of FS across the QPT and determine the quantum critical points via a finite-size-scaling analysis. We verify these results by mapping the perturbed Kitaev code to the two-dimensional Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions and computing the single-site magnetization as the order parameter using the quantum Monte Carlo technique. We also demonstrate a finite-size odd-even dichotomy in the occurrence of the QPT in the Kitaev ladder with respect to the odd and even values of , when the system is perturbed with only Ising interaction. Our results also indicate a higher robustness of the topological phase of the Kitaev code against local perturbations if the boundary is made open along one direction. We further consider a local entanglement witness operator designed specifically to capture a lower bound to the localizable entanglement on the vertical nontrivial loop of the code. We show that the first derivative of the expectation value of the witness operator exhibits a logarithmic divergence across the QPT and perform the finite-size-scaling analysis. We demonstrate similar behavior of the expectation value of the appropriately constructed witness operator also in the case of a locally perturbed color code with open boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Many-body quantum batteries composed of N two-level systems benefit from collective effects, demonstrating excellent charging performance. In this paper, we consider a charging scheme where an atomic ring array serves as the quantum battery system, coupled to a central charger atom that is pumped by an incoherent thermal source. Assuming no interactions among the atoms on the ring, the system can be described using the Dicke model, where collective coupling results in a significant initial charging power. When dipole-dipole interactions among the atoms are taken into account, the charging power of the battery decreases due to the introduction of intricate collective dissipation. However, the symmetric coherent interactions facilitate the rapid relaxation of the system's dynamics to the eigenstates, thereby increasing the proportion of useful work within the battery. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the ring size and the detuning of the charger atom on the steady-state ergotropy of the quantum battery. Our findings indicate that, at zero detuning, the system exhibits a larger effective charging ring size. As the magnitude of the detuning increases, the effective charging ring size decreases. By analyzing the radiation properties of the system in its steady state, we also explain why the steady-state ergotropy is higher when the charger atom is positively detuned.},

Motivated by recent advances in neutral atom arrays, here we investigate a model where the ancillas are governed by a classical controller that allows them to queue up while they wait for their turn to interact with the system. The ancillas can undergo individual open dynamics while they wait, which could cause them to, e.g., decohere. The system, which plays the role of the server in the queue, can also undergo its own open dynamics whenever it is idle. We show that this framework greatly generalizes existing approaches for quantum collision models, recovering the deterministic and stochastic formulations in the appropriate limits. Next, we show how the combination of queueing dynamics with quantum collisions introduces rich dynamical phenomena, including phase transitions and a sharp dependence on the queue statistics.},

In the ultrarelativistic limit where the Lorentz γ factor is large ( γ ≫ 1 ), the general field configuration focused by the relativistic curved plasma mirror is calculated using the 4 π -spherical focusing scheme in the boosted frame of reference. The calculated field strength and distribution can be applied to investigate nonlinear quantum electrodynamic effect (electron-positron pair creation from the vacuum via the Schwinger mechanism) under the two-beam colliding scheme, in which a high-intensity laser pulse collides with a focused field by the relativistic mirror. The benefit of using the relativistic mirror has been discussed in terms of the invariant field. Taking advantage of the mathematical expression for the focused field, the spatial distributions of the pair creation rate have been calculated as functions of time and the carrier envelope phase of the laser pulse. The calculation predicts that creating ≈ 2.2 × 10 6 electron-positron pairs is possible by colliding a 25 PW laser pulse with a reflected and focused field by the relativistic mirror with γ = 100 . This attributes to the field enhancement by the double Doppler effect, a large geometrical factor of the relativistic mirror, and the increase in the reflectivity due to the oblique incidence.},

However, one can ask the reverse question: starting with only weak measurements, can all the results of standard strong measurements be recovered? Prior work has shown that some results can be, such as the Born rule for the probability of measurement outcomes as a function of wave intensity. In this paper, we show that another crucial result can be reproduced by purely weak measurements, namely, the collapse of a many-body, nonlocally entangled wave function on a timescale comparable to the characteristic time of a single, local measurement. For an entangled state of a single excitation among qubits, we find the collapse time scales as a double logarithm of . This result affirms the self-consistency of the hypothesis that spontaneous weak measurements lie at the base of all physical measurements, independent of human observers.},

Through illustrative examples, we reveal intriguing disparities between classical and quantum interpretations of walk dynamics. Remarkably, local APR phases emerge as powerful tools for marking graph nodes, optimizing quantum searches without altering graph structure.

In this paper, we derive a formal expression for the non-Markovian two-point function within the context of the weak coupling limit. Using this expression, we explicitly compute the two-point function for specific models, demonstrating their adherence to the KMS. In addition, we formulate a nonperturbative approach in the form of a self-consistent approximation that includes a partial resummation of perturbation theory. This approach can capture strong coupling phenomena while still relying on simple equations.

The two-band system is subjected to an “adiabatic” time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2D) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2D Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2D manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.},

Lett. 112 , 40005 (2015) ], states that projective measurements in quantum systems establish the reality of physical properties, even in the absence of a revealed outcome. This framework provides a nuanced perspective on the distinction between classical and quantum notions of realism, emphasizing the contextuality and complementarity inherent in quantum systems. While prior works quantified violations of quantum realism (VQRs) using measures based on entropic distances, here we extend the theoretical framework to geometric distances. Building on an informational approach, we derive geometric monotones of VQRs using trace distance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, Schatten distances, and Bures and Hellinger distances. We identify Bures and Hellinger distances as uniquely satisfying all minimal criteria for a bona fide VQR monotone. Remarkably, these distances can be expressed in terms of symmetric Rényi and sandwiched Rényi divergences, aligning geometric and entropic approaches. Our findings suggest that the realism-information relation implies a deep connection between geometric and entropic frameworks, with only those geometric distances expressible as entropic quantities qualifying as valid monotones of VQRs. This work highlights the theoretical and practical advantages of geometric distances, particularly in contexts where computational simplicity or symmetry is important.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we explore a form of quantum circuit complexity that extends to open systems. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on a basic model where the projective Hilbert space of states is depicted by the set of orientations in the Euclidean plane. Specifically, we investigate the dynamics of mixed quantum states as they undergo interactions with a sequence of gates. The latter aim to accurately adjust the path from referent to target, aligning it as closely as possible with the path we have chosen. Our approach involves the analysis of sequences of real density matrices. This mathematical model is physically exemplified by the Stokes density matrices, which delineate the linear polarization of a quasimonochromatic light beam, and the gates, which are viewed as quantum polarizers, whose states are also real density matrices. The interaction between polarizer-linearly polarized light is construed within the context of this quantum formalism. Each density matrix for the light evolves in an approach analogous to a Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) process during the time interval between consecutive gates. Notably, when considering an upper limit for the tolerance or accuracy, we unearth that the number of gates follows a power-law relationship which gives an upper bound of the complexity.},

Under the quantum resonance condition, we thoroughly examine the exotic dynamics of directed current, mean energy, and quantum scrambling based on the exact expression of a time-evolving wave packet. The directed current is controlled by the phase of the ratchet potential. Interestingly, the phase modulation induced by self-interaction dominates the quadratic growth of both mean energy and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). Under the quantum nonresonance condition, the disorder in momentum space, induced by the pseudorandom feature of the free evolution operator, suppresses the directed current at all times. Meanwhile, the disorder also leads to the dynamical localization of the mean energy and the freezing of quantum scrambling for an initially finite-time interval. The dynamical localization can be effectively manipulated by the phase, with underlying physics rooted in the different quasieigenenergy spectrum modulated by ratchet potential. Both the mean energy and OTOCs exponentially increase after long-time evolution, which is governed by the classically chaotic dynamics dependent on the self-interaction. Possible applications of our findings for quantum control are discussed.},

We reveal that the on-axis energy backflow will appear when the amplitude modulation factor and the topological charge of the vortex phase carried by basis vectors satisfy the condition . And, we show that the longitudinal Poynting vector is not circularly symmetric but related to the azimuthal angle in the focal plane for the hybrid vector beams with nonzero and .

We investigate the exceptional points in a system of identical qubits possessing parity-time-reversal symmetry. We prove that owing to an incomplete coalescence of eigenstates, the highest possible order of exceptional point is , which is also the upper bound of the order of energy response to perturbation. More interestingly, by considering an Ising-type interaction, we analytically prove that to achieve an order response for any , the system must acquire a nontrivial -body interaction.

In particular, we show that the friction force can be enhanced by an atomic transition with a dipole moment with a certain handedness and can almost be suppressed by the dipole moment with the opposite handedness. Curiously, the handedness of the transition dipole moment that boosts the ground-state friction force is the opposite of what is classically expected from the spin-momentum locking. We explain this discrepancy in terms of the interaction between positive- and negative-frequency oscillators.},

Considering the local Hamiltonian as the observable, and adopting a specific interpretation of the nature of thermal interactions, we obtain an alternative version of the first law of thermodynamics. Within this framework, we show that in some cases the power performed by the system can be considered as a quantum observable.

During the drop time of the atoms in a gravitational field, we ensure lattice formation by changing the relative detuning of counterpropagating components of the standing wave. The contrast of the lattice, which is sensitive to the first-order Doppler shift, is measured by backscattering a near-resonant traveling-wave electric field. We infer the center-of-mass velocity by determining the line center of the backscattered spectrum. By varying the drop time, we also measure the gravitational acceleration of the falling lattice. We find that the spectrum can be considerably narrowed by imprinting a Ramsey fringe using two time-separated excitation pulses. We demonstrate these ideas using a sample of rubidium atoms with a temperature of ∼ 10 µ K , achieving a precision of 600 µ m / s for measurements of velocity and 2 mm / s 2 for determinations of gravity. Since the primary limitation in precision relates to the thermal coherence length of the sample, we show that the most precise atomic velocimeter can be realized by applying these techniques to a typical Bose gas.},

The accuracy reaches 20 µ Gal within half an hour of continuous measurement. We also systematically measure and analyze the main noises affecting the g -measure sensitivity, indicating no physical obstacles to achieving higher sensitivity.

In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong-coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.},

For an initial state far from equilibrium, we find that Landau damping differs from the conventional picture of exponentially relaxing quasiparticles. Moreover, our results showcase a pronounced mechanism of slow algebraic transport at late times, rooted in energy conservation.

  abstract     = {The dissociation of an acidic molecule in water clusters is a captivating and important subject. This paper employs hybrid density-functional theory to optimize HCl ( H 2 O ) n = 1 – 8 structures under electric fields ( E F = 0 − 50 MV / cm ) . It finds that strong E F greatly enhances the average dipole moments (ADMs) of dissociated clusters ( n ≥ 4 ) , while undissociated clusters, including n ≤ 3 , remain undissociated and exhibit negligible ADM changes. This means that the correlation between HCl dissociation and ADMs can be realized by increasing the E F strength, without changing the requirement of four water molecules for one HCl dissociation. A physical model elucidates this correlation, and beam deflection method is shown to operate effectively under significant E F s (∼40 MV/cm), challenging the conventional assumption of lower field strengths.},

  abstract     = {Coherent storage of quantum information is crucial to many quantum technologies. Long coherence times have been demonstrated in trapped-ion qubits, typically using the hyperfine levels within the ground state of a single ion. However, recent research suggests qubits encoded in metastable states could provide architectural benefits for quantum information processing, such as the possibility of effective dual-species operation in a single-species system and erasure-error conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate long-lived encoding of a quantum state in the metastable states of a trapped ion. By sympathetically cooling with another ion of the same species, employing a tuned CPMG dynamical-decoupling sequence, and constantly monitoring for leakage errors, we demonstrate a coherence time of 136(42) s with a qubit encoded in the metastable 5 D 5 / 2 state of a single 137 Ba + ion. In agreement with a model based on empirical results from dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, we find that dephasing of the metastable levels is the dominant source of error once leakage errors are removed.},

We provide an explanation for why imprecision plateaus are possible, a simple criterion for their existence, and tools for analyzing their properties. We also demonstrate that these plateaus have natural applications when the assumption of perfect measurements is relaxed: They allow for maintaining both the noise robustness and loss robustness of standard steering tests and the performance rate of idealized one-sided device-independent random number generators.},

We find that via simple algebraic conditions (in terms of the Hamiltonian, the jump operators as well as their parameter derivatives), one can characterize the four classes of metrological models that represent: quadratic-linear, quadratic-quadratic, linear-linear, and linear-quadratic time scalings. We also investigate the relevant time scales on which the transition between the two regimes appears. Additionally, we provide universal numerical methods to obtain quantitative bounds on sensitivity that are the tightest that exist in the literature.

Here, we characterize metrologically useful entanglement for nonlinear Hamiltonians, presenting separability bounds for collective angular momenta. Also, we provide a general expression for entangled states maximizing the QFI, which can be written as the superposition between the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like and singlet states.

  abstract     = {We investigate the fundamental and practical precision limits of thermometry in bosonic and fermionic environments by coupling an N -level probe to them and continuously monitoring it. Our findings show that the ultimate precision limit, quantified by the Fisher information, scales linearly with N , offering an exponential improvement over equilibrium thermometry, where the scaling is only log 2 N . For a fixed Hamiltonian structure, we develop a maximum-likelihood estimation strategy that maps the observed continuously monitored trajectories of the probe into temperature estimates with minimal error. By optimizing over all possible Hamiltonian structures, we discover that the optimal configuration is an effective two-level system, with both levels exhibiting degeneracy that increases with N —a stark contrast to equilibrium thermometry, where the ground state remains nondegenerate. Our results have practical implications. First, continuous monitoring is experimentally feasible on several platforms and accounts for the preparation time of the probe, which is often overlooked in other approaches such as prepare and reset. Second, the linear scaling is robust against deviations from the effective two-level structure of the optimal Hamiltonian. Additionally, this robustness extends to cases of initial ignorance about the temperature. Thus, in global estimation problems, the linear scaling remains intact even without adaptive strategies.},

To this end, a nonsingular, additive non-Markovian measure with appropriate asymptotic behavior is formulated.

Math. Phys. 9 , 1327 (1968) ] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU ( N ) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N -body physics phenomena in the two-site SU ( N ) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU ( N ) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U c = − 1 / ( 2 N ) , in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36 , suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU ( N ) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.},

Though various strategies have been developed to mitigate this problem, there is only a superficial and/or empirical understanding of these strategies’ efficacies due to the difficulty of measuring ground-state population distributions among hyperfine Zeeman sublevels. Here, we demonstrate an optical technique to measure the first three (density-matrix) state multipole moments of a single ground-state hyperfine manifold. Using this technique, we have discovered that ground-state angular momentum alignment (i.e., the quadrupole moment) can play an important role in CPT signal-to-noise ratios.},

In our particular case where our experimental datasets consist of 5000 single-shot images of 256 × 256 pixels each, our method reduced the overall computation time by 2 orders of magnitude. This speedup would be even more dramatic for larger input sizes. Consequently, we are able to rapidly characterize the Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum for a range of pump amplitudes and study their variation with increasing gain. Our results clearly reveal the broadening of the Schmidt modes and the narrowing of the Schmidt spectrum for increasing gain with agreement between theory and experiment.},

  abstract     = {We propose a technique that makes it possible to transform the intensity of a quasimonochromatic single-photon wave packet, emitted by a radioactive Mössbauer γ-ray source, into a sequence of short bursts with an arbitrary number of bursts, including a single burst. In addition, the technique allows one to individually and independently control, on demand, the moments of the burst appearance, as well as the peak intensity, duration, and shape of each burst in the sequence. The technique is based on the transmission of Mössbauer (recoilless) photons through a resonantly absorbing medium, which is rapidly displaced at some moments of time relative to the source (or vice versa) along the photon propagation direction at a distance less than the photon wavelength, and returned to its original position. The burst duration can be comparable to the duration of the single-photon pulses that are produced by synchrotrons but have the controlled spectral-temporal characteristics. We show that the proposed technique can be implemented on the basis of currently available equipment with the use of 14.4-keV recoilless photons, emitted by a Co 57 source and a Fe 57 absorber, which opens up prospects for its applications in Mössbauer spectroscopy and x-ray quantum optics.},

This study presents a theoretical framework for simulating the diagonal Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model in the context of giant-atom wQED. The proposed scheme employs photonic modes in the waveguide to not only mediate interactions between atoms but also to detect the energy spectrum of the atom array. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present a simulation of the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum with high precision. Furthermore, for an incommensurate AAH atomic chain, we demonstrate that the photon transmission spectrum can accurately distinguish between the many-body localized phase and the extended phase. The method presented here is also applicable to the simulation of other types of 1D atomic chains based on giant-atom wQED.},

  abstract     = {The giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems have recently emerged as a promising platform for manipulating light-matter interactions. The combination of the multiple-point couplings and topological phase effect could lead to rich physical phenomena and effects. Here, we study single-photon scattering in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide coupled to either one or two two-level giant atoms. We assume that each giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points and hence there exist four and sixteen coupling configurations for the single-giant-atom case and two-giant-atom separate coupling case, respectively. By solving the single-photon scattering problem in the real space, we obtain the exact expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes. It is found that a single photon in the SSH waveguide can be completely reflected or transmitted by choosing proper coupling configurations, coupling-point distances, atomic resonance frequency, and dimerization parameter. In addition, under proper parameter conditions, the scattering spectra are periodically modulated by the coupling-point distances. We also find that the collective behavior of the two giant atoms can be adjusted by quantum interference effect and topological effect and that the single-photon scattering spectra can exhibit the Lorentzian, super-Gaussian, electromagnetically induced transparencylike, and asymmetric Fano line shapes for some coupling configurations. This work will inspire the development of controllable single-photon devices based on the giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems.},

We find that single-particle states from different initial positions exhibit similar behavior at specific second-order coupling strengths. At the same time, entangled bosons display correlations that are either analogous to or mirror-symmetric to those of bosons and fermions. We numerically calculate the interparticle distance probabilities of both planar and circular structures and show that their distinct boundary conditions produce unique correlation patterns. In certain cases, bosons are less likely to occupy the same site and single-particle states show asymmetric probability distributions. The effects of second-order coupling and disorder act to cancel out these nontrivial features. Nonclassical states have found numerous applications in integrated quantum photonics. Furthermore, in practical scenarios, disorder is unavoidable, and second-order coupling becomes crucial for light-matter interactions, polymer chains, magnetic materials, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, topologically nontrivial systems, spin chains, and so on. Their combined effects across diverse physical systems and experimental platforms signify the broader importance of our work.},

Here, we propose a practical scheme to manipulate the QPT of quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime. By applying a periodic frequency modulation to the two-level system in a quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime, an anisotropic quantum Rabi model with ultrastrong and tunable coupling strengths for rotating and counterrotating terms is obtained. The ground state and excitation energy of this model, in terms of the modulation parameters, are studied.

In the weak-excitation regime, we give the energy levels and their decay rates into the waveguide modes in the dressed basis, which both depend on the distance between the two atoms. We focus on the Bragg case and anti-Bragg case, where subradiant and superradiant states are produced and perfect transmission with a phase shift may occur on resonance. We observe quantum beats in the photon-photon correlation function of the reflected field in the anti-Bragg case. Moreover, the frequencies of quantum beats can be controlled due to the tunability of the bound states via the dispersion engineering of the structure. We also observe directional photon emission in the anti-Bragg case and give the dynamic mechanism of the perfect transmission. We quantify the effects of the system imperfections, including the deviation in the distance between the two atoms and the asymmetry in the atomic decay rates into the waveguide modes.

Here we propose an approach for generating chiral cat states in a spinning resonator supporting both the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes, which are dispersively coupled to a two-level atom. The physical mechanism for the chiral-cat-state generation is based on the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. Concretely, when the resonator is rotating, the CW and CCW modes have different frequency detuning with respect to the atomic transition frequency and hence the atomic-state-dependent rotating angular velocities for the CW and CCW modes in phase space are different. This mode-dependent evolution leads to a chirality mechanism in the state generation. Based on the mode-dependent conditional rotation evolution and atomic projection measurement at proper time, we achieve the separate generation of cat states in the CW mode and coherent states in the CCW mode. We also investigate quantum coherence properties of the generated states by examining their Wigner functions. In addition, the influence of the system dissipations on the state generation in the open-system case is investigated. Our work will provide some insights into the development of chiral optical devices and nonreciprocal photonics.},

Here, we propose an appealing method for the directional generation of broadband microwave squeezing based on hybrid magnonics, where multiple chiral cavity-magnonic subsystems are connected together through a bidirectional waveguide in a cascading way. The chirality arises from the selective coupling between the Kittel mode in the ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere and one of the two degenerate counter-rotating microwave modes in a ring-shaped cavity. By introducing Floquet engineering to simultaneously induce red and blue sidebands in the photon-magnon coupling, the chiral squeezing-type interaction can be engineered in each cavity-magnonic subsystem. Considering all the photon-magnon couplings in the cascaded system with the same chirality, we show that a broadband squeezed microwave field can be emitted on demand to either of the two output ports along the waveguide. Compared with a single chiral cavity-magnonic system, both the squeezing amount and the bandwidth can be significantly enhanced through the cumulative effect of the cascaded system.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically propose a cavity magnomechanical system with a levitated yttrium iron garnet sphere to study the entanglement characteristics between subsystems. The system consists of microwave photon, magnon, and mechanical phonon modes, where the photon and magnon modes can be driven by external microwave sources. We find that with the appropriate choice of the suspension position, the effective couplings between the cavity field and the magnon and phonon modes can be established, thus inducing the generation of bipartite entanglement and genuine tripartite entanglement in the system. Further, we also analyze in detail the influences of the radius of the sphere, the detunings of the cavity and magnon modes, the driving power, the frequency of the phonon mode, and the environment temperature on the characteristics of the quantum entanglement. The results obtained here indicate that the bipartite and tripartite entanglements can be manipulated by changing the radius and the oscillation frequency of the sphere in addition to changing the parameters of the cavity field, and therefore, the levitated magnomechanical system has a potential application in the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena.},

  abstract     = {A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to optimize pulse width effectively. By adjusting the photon energy while maintaining a constant peak electric field, this strategy modulates the peak vector potential and laser field period, thereby controlling the high harmonic cutoff energy and the time-domain emission characteristics of the harmonics. The field-driven electronic dynamics lead to a nonmonotonic variation in both the intensity and the duration of the generated attosecond pulses. The light field frequency can be adjusted to yield the optimal pulse. Beyond the primary demonstration with hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, significant pulse width optimization has been achieved across a range of different materials. This straightforward and versatile strategy shows promise for application in solid-state materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.},

Here, we investigate SHG from gold plasmonic nanostructures by scanning nanostructures at the single-particle level to acquire two-dimensional (2D) SHG maps which are qualitatively and quantitatively compared with numerically simulated SHG maps. This approach allows us to discriminate the role played by the surface and bulk contributions to SHG. Our findings reveal that the tangential surface source contribution, often neglected in the literature, plays a dominant role and is affected by surface roughness. This is evident when comparing the SHG maps obtained from identically sized gold nanoparticles that are fabricated using physical and chemical techniques. Additionally, the normal surface source is not found to significantly impact SHG in these configurations.},

A transition from a state with unbroken symmetry to a state with broken symmetry leads to a qualitative change in system properties and respective states are called symmetric and nonsymmetric phases of the system. Usually, the change in the system parameters is necessary for the transition between symmetric and nonsymmetric phases. In this paper, we consider the behavior of an optomechanical system with an exceptional point under the influence of noise. We demonstrate that below the exceptional point, -symmetric and non- -symmetric phases can coexist. In this regime, a noise can lead to random transitions between the symmetric and nonsymmetric phases. These transitions are accompanied by the abrupt changes in the intensities of photon and phonon modes. The predicted phenomenon opens up the possibility of studying the kinetics of phase transitions caused by spontaneous breaking of symmetry.},

In the present paper, we performed systematic computer simulations of the appropriate generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation to extend the MTC method for generation of dark solitons through controlled interactions of bright solitons in waveguiding systems with the normal group-velocity dispersion. Further, the generated dark solitons are demonstrated to be useful for accurately governing the dynamics of bright solitons generation in complex systems based on stacked waveguides. Therefore, we report scenarios that provide mitigation or switching of the energy transfer during bright-soliton collisions, along with the ability of the cascaded MTC processes to increase the number of generated solitons. These results underscore the potential of the MTC as a versatile method for managing the propagation dynamics of multiple temporal bright and dark solitons produced by a single input pulse, with possible applications for the design of optical devices.},

For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting with single-photon-detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the minimum efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection.

The mathematical basis of the algorithm is formed by (i) expansion of a focused beam into a linear superposition of circularly polarized vortex vector beams and (ii) expansion of the focal amplitudes of the circularly polarized vortex vector beams into power series of the focal distance coordinate . The algorithm's computational speed is from four to seven orders of magnitude greater than that of the direct double-integral Richards-Wolf algorithm and up to two orders of magnitude greater than that of the Bluestein-method-based algorithm [ Light: Sci. Appl. 9 , 119 (2020) ], the fastest existing method, for typical focal-plane field calculations. We show that such computational speeds are the fastest possible for focal field calculations in planes perpendicular to the microscope objective axis. These speeds are able to allow for the real-time prediction of focal fields. The accuracy of the suggested algorithm is completely controllable and unlimited. The reported computational speed enhancement is valid for three-dimensional focal field calculations as well because a three-dimensional region can be scanned slice by slice in the longitudinal direction.},

Precise temporal control of quantum phases provides fundamental insights into quantum systems and serves as a cornerstone for numerous quantum technologies. Nevertheless, achieving phase control of quantum systems with high temporal and spatial resolution remains a substantial challenge in the realm of hard x-ray quantum optics due to the ultrashort oscillation periods of photons. In this study, we propose to manipulate the magnetic properties of a thin film using near-infrared (NIR) pulses characterized by a high repetition rate. By calculating the evolution of quantum beats, we can theoretically extract the phase information of the nuclear response. Coherence within the nuclear ensemble is preserved throughout the entire process.

Comparing the filamentation of CVBs to that of a circularly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, we found that CVBs undergo filamentation more easily due to their more effective nonlinear focusing, in contrast with LG beams. In the case of low-order FPBs, we examined the role of the constituent orthogonally polarized spatial modes in their filamentation process. Our findings reveal that the Gaussian mode within these beams primarily contributes to their filamentation. Additionally, when compared with a linearly polarized Gaussian beam, star and lemon FPBs displayed greater resistance to filamentation. In all comparisons, the vector beams and their counterparts are initialized with equal physical powers to isolate the role of polarization and beam structure on filamentation dynamics. Furthermore, we investigated the evolution of polarization profiles of the beams during filamentation. We observed that the polarization profiles of CVBs remained largely unchanged. In contrast, the polarization profiles of the FPBs underwent significant nonuniform changes due to differences in accumulated nonlinear phase and Gouy phase among the constituent modes.},

  abstract     = {Ultrabroadband intense terahertz (THz) radiation generated by two-color femtosecond pulses is a promising tool for applications in many areas involving linear and nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy and light-matter interactions. The essential challenge is to understand and control the THz spectrum in order to optimize it for specific applications. Here we study the frequency-dependent modulation of the THz spectrum with the relative phase between the second-harmonic and fundamental-field components of the linearly polarized femtosecond pulse. Analytical consideration reveals the physical reason for the suppression of the spectral modulation, which is local (induced by the local ionization dynamics and electron motion and not related to propagation effects such as phase slippage) and coherent (associated only with the phase-dependent coherent THz waveforms). The spectral modulation is sensitive to the frequency detuning, both its absolute value and the sign. Having this asymmetric dependence on the detuning, the suppressed modulation can be observed even in commensurate two-color pulses with the effect enhanced additionally by the ionization blueshift. The theoretical findings are confirmed by the experiment, where we employed chirped two-color pulses with a variable time delay between their components, effectively enabling a scan over the detuning. The obtained results show that not only the THz yield but also the spectral shape can be effectively controlled by the relative phase and may be very sensitive to a small frequency detuning arising naturally during two-color pulse propagation.},

  abstract     = {Controlling wave transmission is crucial for various applications. In this work we apply the concept of unitary control to manipulate multiport wave transmission. Unitary control aims to control the behaviors of a set of orthogonal waves simultaneously. The approach fully harnesses the capability of wavefront shaping techniques, with promising applications in communication, imaging, and photonic integrated circuits. Here we present a detailed theory of unitary control of wave transmission, focusing on two key characteristics: total (power) transmittance and direct (field) transmission. The total transmittance for an input port represents the fraction of total transmitted power with respect to the input power for a wave incident from an input port. The direct transmission for an input port denotes the complex transmission amplitude from that input port to its corresponding output port. We address two main questions: (i) the achievable total transmittance and direct transmission for each port and (ii) the configuration of unitary control to attain desired transmission values for each port. Our theory illustrates that unitary control enables uniform total transmittance and direct transmission across any medium. Furthermore, we show that reciprocity and energy conservation enforce direct symmetry constraints on wave transmission in both the forward and backward directions under unitary control.},

  abstract     = {The spiral phase plate is an essential optical component for the generation of Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses with doughnut intensity profiles and helical wavefronts. This is due to its extraordinary ability to create and manipulate polarization distributions and orbital angular momentum of laser pulses. Here, we show that Gaussian laser pulses with near-relativistic intensity can acquire orbital angular momentum directly through a fixed-thickness plasma transmission spiral phase plate, whose density increases proportionally to the azimuthal angle around the plasma center. We propose the design for a plasma spiral phase plate and outline how the thickness and density distribution of the plasma determine the orbital angular momentum. We also use three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to examine the properties of plasma transmission spiral phase plates, such as orbital angular momentum generation and high-intensity laser pulses manipulation. The simulations suggest that Gaussian laser pulses could be turned into Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses carrying orbital angular momentum through a plasma plate, with the conversion efficiency above 90% at high light intensity exceeding . Our scheme offers a method for producing near-relativistic intensity vortex laser pulses with controlled orbital angular momentum, which could significantly advance the development of intense twisted laser pulses in high-field physics. Potential applications include the rotational dynamics of particle clumps, the generation of high-energy particles in plasma accelerators, and the radiation of attosecond pulses radiation with orbital angular momentum.},

  abstract     = {Polarized ultrashort high-energy sources of electromagnetic radiation are widely applied in nuclear physics, astrophysics, high-energy physics, etc. However, generation of a feasible and easy-to-deploy source, especially reaching the attosecond scale in the time-domain and MeV energy levels, is still a great challenge. Here, we put forward a method for producing ultracollimated high-brilliance polarized attosecond -rays via the interaction of an unpolarized electron beam with a solid-density plasma. As a relativistic electron beam enters a solid-density plasma, it can be modulated into high-density clusters via the self-modulation instability of itself and further into attosecond slices due to its own hosing instability. This is accompanied by the generation of similar pulse-width photon slices via synchrotron radiation. The severe hosing instability breaks symmetry of the excited electromagnetic fields, resulting in net linear polarization of the photon slices, which challenges the conventional perception that interaction of an axially symmetric unpolarized electron beam with a uniform plasma cannot generate radiation with net polarization. This paper provides new ideas for the generation of ultrashort, high-energy pulses with reduced dependence on the ultraintense peak power of the laser pulse.},

The absence of static displacement sustains the resonance linewidth of the effective Fabry-Pérot cavity and guarantees the approximation of a linear dissipative coupling. In this case, we show that the membrane can be cooled from the cryogenic temperature to its quantum ground state outside the resolved-sideband limit with a moderately strong driving operating at the red-detuned regime, where the optomechanical cooling rate can be competitive with typical schemes that utilize a real coupling strength and a blue-detuned laser drive. The dissipative optomechanical system with a phase-controlled coupling strength offers the flexibility to investigate fundamental optomechanical effects and may find potential applications in high-sensitive position transduction.},

In this work, we show that, under resonant excitation well beyond the linear regime, the situation changes drastically: A small magnetic linear anisotropy considerably increases, and an even stronger new quadrupole dichroism emerges. The latter manifests itself as the -periodic azimuthal dependence of the transmission and anisotropic rotation of the probe polarization plane. These effects are described microscopically in a toy model, and their symmetry analysis is presented. Both are observed experimentally on the resonance of cesium vapor and agree with the theoretical predictions. The large magnitude of the quadrupole dichroism makes it promising for magnetometric applications and for studying the effects of anisotropic bleaching.},

We study this entanglement dynamics using the spin-boson model and numerically solve our system of equations using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) formalism. We show that within the range of practically relevant system parameters, our developed model exhibits both Markovian and non-Markovian entanglement decay behavior. Further, to counter the observed entanglement decay, we propose the implementation of dynamical decoupling in optical fibers using spaced half waveplates. In particular, we numerically model the time-dependent Hamiltonians of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill and Uhrig dynamical decoupling schemes and show a reduced rate of entanglement decay even with sparsely spaced half waveplates along the length of optical fiber.

Here, we theoretically investigate Thouless pumping of vector solitons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate confined in spin-dependent optical superlattices, using both numerical solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the Lagrangian variational approach. The spin-up and spin-down components experience superlattice potentials that are displaced by a tunable distance , leading to a vector soliton state with a relative shift between its components. We demonstrate that , as an independent degree of freedom, offers a novel control parameter for manipulating the nonlinear topological phase transition of vector solitons. Specifically, when , both components are either pumped or arrested, depending on the interaction strength. When fixing the interaction strength and varying , remarkably, we find that an arrested vector soliton can reenter the pumped regime and exhibits a quantized shift. As continues to increase, the vector soliton transitions into a dynamically arrested state; however, with further increases in , the quantized shift revives.

Unlike systems with static interactions, the incident wave in our setup can be scattered inelastically into different Floquet channels, absorbing or emitting quanta from the modulation field. A family of Floquet resonances is identified, at which universal recurrence relations are derived for the Floquet scattering amplitudes. These relations are equivalent to a discrete Schrödinger equation describing a pointlike source trapped by an effective potential. The resonance mechanism is explained as the coincidence of the point source's energy with the bound states of the effective potential. We discuss the scattering properties both at and near the resonances, finding that the resonance width and the ratio of the inelastic to elastic cross sections can be effectively controlled through the modulation of the interaction.

To fully account for quantum effects, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and—in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions—the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. A mean-field description of the Bose polaron based on coupled Gross–Pitaevskii Schrödinger equations predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron. We here show that such a solution does not exist and is an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. To this end we consider a mobile impurity in a box potential. Our work demonstrates that correlations between the impurity position and the bosons are important even in the limit where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore, we derive analytical approximations for the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and large but finite boson-boson couplings which accurately reproduce DMRG results. This demonstrates that the polaron problem of a heavy impurity in a one-dimensional Bose gas can be accurately approximated by a proper mean-field description plus a linearized treatment of quantum fluctuations for arbitrary boson-boson and impurity-boson couplings. Finally, we determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for small and intermediate distances , which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.},

In the linear regime, vortex states are characterized by quantum numbers, 𝑛 and 𝑚 , corresponding to the transverse and circumferential directions, with the phase structure determined by the winding number (WN) 𝑚 . Odd and even values of 𝑛 must associate, respectively, with integer and half-integer values of 𝑚 , the latter ones requiring two cycles of motion around MS for returning to the initial phase. Using variational and numerical methods, we solve the GP equation with the attractive nonlinearity, producing a family of ground-state (GS) solitons for values of the norm below the critical one, above which the collapse sets in.

  abstract     = {Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in ultracold atoms is engineered by light-atom interaction, such as two-photon Raman transitions between two Zeeman spin states. In this paper, we propose and experimentally realize chiral Raman coupling to generate SOC in ultracold atomic gases, which exhibits high quantization axis direction dependence. Chiral Raman coupling for SOC is created by chiral light-atom interaction, in which a circularly polarized electromagnetic field generated by two Raman lasers interacts with two Zeeman spin states (chiral transition). We present a simple scheme of chiral one-dimensional (1D) Raman coupling by employing two Raman lasers at an intersecting angle with the proper polarization configuration. In this case, Raman coupling for SOC exists in one direction of the magnetic quantization axis and disappears in the opposite direction. Then we extend this scheme into a chiral two-dimensional (2D) optical square Raman lattice configuration to generate the 1D SOC. There are two orthogonal 1D SOCs, which exist in the positive and negative directions of the magnetic quantization axis respectively. This case is compared with 2D SOC based on the nonchiral 2D optical Raman lattice scheme for studying the topological energy band. This paper broadens the horizon for understanding chiral physics and simulating topological quantum systems.},

Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of nontrivial phases: a conventional topological insulator, a conventional topological Aubry-André insulator, and an unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-André insulator.

Our aim will be to check the possibility of having self-bound arrangements beyond the balanced compositions reported in previous literature rather than exploring all the situations in which that could be possible. In that vein, we focused mainly on mixtures in which the atoms belonging to one isotope are spin polarized, while the spins of the particles in the other isotope are evenly distributed in two sets. What we found was that, even though self-bound droplets are possible for different compositions, the most stable ones are clusters with a slight excess of attractively interacting particles with different spins with respect to the number of spin-polarized atoms. Clusters in which the number of repulsively interacting unequal-spin atoms are in excess with respect to the spin-polarized particles have a very narrow stability range.},

Here, we propose a scheme to realize an interaction-induced twisted-bilayer lattice in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The key idea here is to utilize the intrinsic atomic interaction to couple different layers and dynamically induce a supercell structure, distinct from the conventional wisdom to achieve the static twisted-bilayer lattices. To illustrate that, we study the dynamics of a two-component BEC and show that the intrinsic interaction effect arising from interacting bosonic ultracold atoms can dynamically induce both periodic (commensurable) and aperiodic (incommensurable) moiré structures. One of the interesting moiré-physics effects, i.e., the flat-band physics, is shown through investigating the dynamics of a wave packet of the BEC. Our proposal can be implemented using available state-of-the-art experimental techniques and leads to an alternative way to study twistronics in cold atom quantum simulators.},

Our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations provide a comprehensive phase diagram of the vortex Borromean states. Additionally, we uncover an unconventional topological phase—a vortex anti-Borromean state—in which two vortices bind together but separate upon the addition of a third vortex.

Building on the results in G. Aupetit-Diallo et al. , Phys. Rev.

We show that this term initially grows as and subsequently follows the spin-mixing dynamics of the system.

Our model is wholly probabilistic and shows that the number of the ultracold atoms remaining in the trap as a function of time is nonexponential. We update the recent results of a comparison between a traditional pressure standard—a combined flow meter and dynamic expansion system—and the CAVS [D. S. Barker et al. , AVS Quantum Sci. 5 , 035001 (2023) ] to reflect the results of our model. We find that the effect of glancing collisions shifts the theoretical predictions of the total loss rate coefficients for colliding with noble gases or by up to 0.6%. Likewise, we find that in the limit of zero trap depth, the experimentally extracted loss rate coefficients for colliding with noble gases or shift by as much as 2.2%.},

In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general ) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean-field equations, which capture nontrivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, enables efficient numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the specific way in which the entire system is divided into multiple equally sized finite clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on correlation propagation dynamics in a two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We further compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of sites with those from a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in the short-time region, where the energy conservation is well maintained in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it has the potential for application to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems, even in higher dimensions.},

Along the waveguide, the particle scatters on an infinite array of regularized delta potentials. Our starting point is the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, which for quasi-1D geometry can be solved exactly, based on the analytical formula for the quasi-1D Green's function. We study the properties of eigenenergies as a function of particle quasimomentum, which form band structure, as in standard Kronig-Penney model. We test our model by comparing it to the numerical calculations for an atom scattering on an infinite chain of ions in quasi-1D geometry. The agreement is fairly good and can be further improved by introducing energy-dependent scattering length in the regularized delta potential. The energy spectrum exhibits the presence of multiple overlapping bands resulting from excitations in the transverse direction. At large lattice constants, our model reduces to standard Kronig-Penney result with 1D coupling constant for quasi-1D scattering, exhibiting confinement-induced resonances. In the opposite limit, when lattice constant becomes comparable to harmonic oscillator length of the transverse potential, we calculate the correction to the quasi-1D coupling constant due to the quantum interference between scatterers. Finally, we calculate the effective mass for the lowest band and show that it becomes negative for large and positive scattering lengths.},

Therefore, they are suitable for studying fundamental aspects of these correlations and nonlocality. Occupation defects, such as vacancies or multiple atoms occupying a single site due to imperfect system preparation, limit the detection of Bell correlations. We study their effects with the help of a simplified toy model parametrized by the probability of having a single occupation for a given site. Within this model, and for entangled systems obtained by one-axis twisting evolution from an initial factorized state, we derive two Bell inequalities, one based on many-site correlations and the other on two-site correlations, and identify the smallest probability that allows the Bell inequalities violation to be detected. We then consider two physical realizations using entangled ultracold atoms in optical lattices where the parameter is related to a nonunitary filling factor and nonzero temperature. We test the predictions of the toy model against exact numerical results.},

The annular stripe phase simultaneously breaks two continuous symmetries, namely rotational and U ( 1 ) gauge symmetry, and is more probable in the condensates with a larger orbital angular momentum transfer imparted by a pair of Laguerre-Gaussian beams than what has been considered in the recent experiments. Accordingly, we consider a SOAM-coupled spin-1 condensate with a 4 ℏ orbital angular momentum transferred by the lasers. Depending on the values of the Raman coupling strength and quadratic Zeeman term, the condensate with realistic antiferromagnetic interactions supports three ground-state phases: the annular stripe, the vortex necklace, and the zero angular momentum phase. We numerically calculate the collective excitations of the condensate as a function of coupling and quadratic Zeeman field strengths for a fixed ratio of spin-dependent and spin-independent interaction strengths. At low Raman coupling strengths, we observe a direct transition from the zero angular momentum to the annular stripe phase, characterized by the softening of a double symmetric roton mode, which serves as a precursor to supersolidity.},

  abstract     = {In his seminal proposal of quantum droplets in binary Bose mixtures [D. Petrov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 , 155302 (2015) ], Petrov suggested that the density ratio of the two bosonic components is locked to an optimal value, which is given by the square root of the ratio of the two intraspecies scattering lengths, i.e., . Due to such density locking, quantum droplets can be efficiently described by using an extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation within the single-mode approximation. Here, we find that this single-mode description necessarily breaks down in the deep quantum droplet regime, when the attractive interspecies scattering length significantly deviates away from the threshold of mean-field collapse (i.e., ). By applying a bosonic pairing theory, we show that the density ratio is allowed to fluctuate in a sizable interval. Most importantly, the optimal density ratio would be very different from , in the case of unequal intraspecies scattering lengths ( ). Our finding might provide a plausible microscopic explanation of the puzzling low critical particle number of quantum droplets, as experimentally observed. Our predicted interval of the density ratio, as a function of the interspecies scattering length, could also be experimentally examined in cold-atom laboratories in the near future.},

  abstract     = {We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes and characterize the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a k − 3.5 scaling over wave number k ; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the k − 3.5 scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a k − 7 / 3 regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.},

Here, the backreaction problem in one-dimensional condensates is considered from the perspective of energy and momentum conservation. By assuming the validity of Bogoliubov theory, the backreaction equations are used to identify the contributions to the system energy and momentum coming from quantum fluctuations and condensate corrections. The backreaction is solved for a condensate trapped in a ring configuration such that particle interactions are gradually switched on. It is shown that the energy in the condensate cannot be addressed without taking into account how the system entered the interacting regime, and even for homogeneous condensates the power transferred to the condensate by quantum fluctuations showcases an intricate nonmonotonic pattern.},

In systems of two pseudospin degrees, two particles contain symmetric states and antisymmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. This mixed spin symmetry has been overlooked and has not been investigated thoroughly. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider a system of three bosons with two hyperfine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. Similar to that in two-particle systems, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between antialigned pseudospins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. Also, the emergence of mixed-spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. In contrast to two-particle systems, the pair correlation of the ground state is analogous to the Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions, and this feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.},

  abstract     = {The interplay among interaction, non-Hermiticity, and disorder opens a new avenue for engineering novel phase transitions. We study here the spectral and localization features of two interacting bosons in one-dimensional nonreciprocal quasicrystals. Specifically, by considering a quasiperiodic Hubbard lattice with nonreciprocal hoppings, we show that the interaction can lead to a mobility edge, which arises from the fact that the bound states display a much lower threshold for spectral and extended-localized transitions than scattering states. The localization transition of bound or scattering states is accompanied by a complex-real spectrum transition. Moreover, while the two-particle localized states are robust to the boundary conditions, the two-particle extended states turn into skin modes under open boundary conditions. We also show the correlated dynamics to characterize these localization transitions. Finally, we reveal that the bound states can form a mobility edge on their own by introducing a dimerized nonreciprocal quasicrystal. Our paper may pave the way for the study of non-Hermitian few-body physics.},

We show our numerical result of the decay process and compare it with these previous studies.

  abstract     = {The formation of quantized vortices above a certain critical trap rotation frequency serves as a hallmark signature of superfluidity. Based on the beyond mean-field framework, crucial for the formation of exotic supersolid and droplet states, we investigate dynamical protocols for vortex nucleation in the superfluid and supersolid states of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at a trap rotation frequency lower than the conventional critical rotation frequency. We find that the critical rotation frequency depends not only on the dipole-dipole interaction strength, but also on the polarization direction of the external magnetic field. Interestingly, in the superfluid state, the critical rotation frequency increases with the tilt angle of the magnetic field, whereas in the supersolid state, increasing the tilt angle lowers the critical threshold. Leveraging these characteristics of dipolar BECs, along with the robustness of vortices with respect to changes in the polarization direction and -wave scattering length, we demonstrate three dynamical protocols for vortex nucleation, even when rotating below the critical rotation frequency, viz., (i) varying the -wave scattering length, (ii) changing the polarizing angle, and (iii) successive modulation of both the scattering length and polarizing angle. These dynamical vortex seeding protocols could serve as important benchmarks for future experimental studies.},

We demonstrate several schemes to suppress this remaining heading error within 1 nT using a single magnetometer or a comagnetometer. In the magnetometer system, two schemes are developed to average out the horizontal atomic polarization in space or in time, respectively.

Rev. A 99 , 063426 (2019) ], who measured the ACF only on a circle in the plane perpendicular to the incident light beam. The atom-pair state determined with much less uncertainty than before is investigated in terms of whether or not the state is entangled. We discover that the pair of fragment atoms is certainly entangled in terms of the electron-electron entanglement, and obtain the entanglement entropy of the atom-pair state. The similar discussion is made in terms of the electronic spatial-spin entanglement too, where the spatial motion and spin motion of electrons are considered nonidentical partial systems at variance with the former electron-electron entanglement. It turns out that the pair of fragment H( ) atoms is entangled in terms of the electronic spatial-spin entanglement as well as the electron-electron entanglement.},

  abstract     = {Within a joint experimental and theoretical research project, double photoionization of the He-like B 3 + ion by a single photon was studied in the energy range from approximately 350 to 1160 eV. With the parent-ion beam in the experiment containing both 1 s 2 1 S ground-state (90.9%) and 1 s 2 s S 3 metastable B 3 + ions (9.1%), two contributions to the apparent single- and double-ionization cross sections, σ 34 app and σ 35 app , respectively, are involved in the measurements. Ratios Y ( 5 + ) / Y ( 4 + ) of double- over single-ionization yields were experimentally determined. By multiplying the measured ratios by the known cross section σ 34 app , the apparent cross section σ 35 app for double ionization was inferred. Using the information thus obtained, the measured yield of B 5 + ions produced from hydrogenlike B 4 + could also be normalized. The results show good agreement with theoretical benchmark cross sections σ 45 for single photoionization of B 4 + . Convergent close-coupling calculations were performed to determine double-photoionization cross sections σ 35 for B 3 + ( 1 s 2 ) and B 3 + ( 1 s 2 s ) ions. The result for the ground state agrees very well with theoretical data obtained previously with an intermediate-energy R -matrix approach. Within the systematic uncertainty of the normalized experimental cross sections, calculated and measured data are in agreement with one another.},

This feature is most pronounced for intermediate (on the atomic scale) CP pulse intensities and very short pulse durations. We have applied the nonstationary perturbation theory (PT) in all orders to analyze the observed effects.

  abstract     = {This study theoretically investigates the angular distribution of core-level photoem ission time delay within a molecular frame. This phenomenon can be measured with the advancement of attosecond pulsed lasers and metrology. Our focus is on homonuclear diatomic molecules. The two-center interference patterns observed in the gerade and ungerade core-level Molecular-Frame Photoelectron Angular Distributions (MFPAD) of homonuclear diatomic molecules demonstrate symmetry breaking with respect to the direction of light propagation, attributed to the nondipole (multipole) effect. This nondipole effect reflects the zeptosecond time discrepancy in the initiation of photoelectron waves at the two absorbing atoms. Our study delves into the photoemission time delay resulting from the nondipole effect through the introduction of a theoretical model. We reveal that when considering the contributions from the gerade and ungerade delocalized states in incoherent sums, the two-center interference terms cancel each other in both the MFPADs and photoemission time delays. However, a residual term persists showcasing the nondipole effect in the photoemission time delays. Furthermore, by expanding the scattering state of photoelectrons using the Multiple Scattering theory, we demonstrate the significant role played by the scattering of photoelectrons at the molecular potential in describing the photoemission time delays of homonuclear diatomic molecules. Additionally, we establish that the direct wave contribution does not exhibit angular dependence in the photoemission time delays. Next, we apply our theoretical model to a nitrogen molecule, demonstrating the energy- and angular-dependent characteristics of the MFPADs and photoemission time delays through both analytical and numerical approaches. The incoherent sums of the MFPADs in both forward and backward directions exhibit equal intensity, whereas the incoherent sums of the photoemission time delays show a slight variation of a few hundred zeptoseconds compared with numerical calculations using a multiple scattering code. Our findings demonstrate that the photoemission time delay serves as a valuable tool for investigating attosecond and zeptosecond photoionization dynamics, providing insights that may be overlooked in the MFPAD analysis. This study provides a basis for theoretical investigations into photoionization phenomena in nano systems containing numerous identical atoms, such as large polyatomic molecules and condensed matter, enabling the examination of photoemission time delays and nondipole effects.},

In this study, we experimentally investigate the dissociative Rydberg state excitation of and CO molecules induced by a femtosecond laser pulse centered at 400 nm. Coincidence measurements are conducted for the resulting photoelectrons, ionic, and Rydberg fragments. Electron-nuclear correlations are observed by analyzing the joint electron-nuclear energy spectrum, which shows multiple diagonal lines spaced by photon energy, indicating that the observed dissociative Rydberg state excitations are primarily accessed via multiphoton resonance excitation. The excitation pathways of and CO molecules are explored in detail. Interestingly, the dissociative Rydberg state excitations of and CO molecules exhibit distinct behavior compared to their respective dissociative double ionization channels. This notable difference is attributed to electron-nuclear correlations in photon energy sharing and is further explained through an analysis of the relevant potential energy curves. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dissociative Rydberg state excitation of molecules in femtosecond laser fields.},

In this study we first compare the total cross section for this process with the total cross section for the positronium breakup by photoabsorption, showing that they become equal at the incident photon energy keV and that—due to strong (and opposite) dependencies of these cross sections on the photon energy—the Compton scattering rapidly becomes by far the dominant breakup channel when the photon energy exceeds . Then we explore the energy and angular spectra of electrons and positrons, which are emitted from the positronium in collisions with high-energy photons, and of the scattered photons. By analyzing the physical mechanisms, which determine the properties of the spectra, we demonstrate that in such collisions the atomic particles can be clearly subdivided into the “participator,” on which the incident photon scatters, and the “spectator,” which is not directly involved in the scattering process. The results for the positronium breakup are compared with the corresponding results for the ionization of atomic hydrogen and the similarities in these processes as well as the differences between them are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by ongoing pump-probe spectroscopy experiments, this work develops a theoretical framework for describing the rovibrational wave-packet dynamics that ensues when a single weakly bound van der Waals trimer is exposed to a short, subpicosecond linearly polarized pump laser pulse. The intensity of the pump laser is chosen such that excitation and ionization of the electronic degrees of freedom are negligible, while excitation of the wave packet in the nuclear degrees of freedom is non-negligible. The numerical treatment, which takes advantage of the fact that the laser pulse is very short compared to typical molecular time scales, is based on a wave-packet decomposition that utilizes hyperspherical coordinates. The framework is applied to the extremely floppy bosonic helium trimer. A convergence analysis of the partial-wave decomposition is conducted. The kinetic-energy release and orientation dynamics are presented. While the dynamics of more strongly bound van der Waals trimers such as, e.g., the argon trimer, display negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture appropriate, those of weakly bound trimers display non-negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture inappropriate. It is shown that a model that constructs the helium trimer dynamics from the dynamics of the helium dimer captures a number of key characteristics of the alignment signal, including the interference between different angular momentum wave-packet components.},

They provide a framework in which photoelectron momentum distributions can be interpreted as the quantum interference between different semiclassical pathways the electron can take on its way to the detector, which brings with it great predictive power. The transition amplitude of an electron going from a bound state to a final continuum state is often written as multiple integrals, which can be computed either numerically or by employing the saddle-point method. If one computes the momentum distribution via a saddle-point method, then the obtained distribution is highly dependent on the time window from which the saddle points are selected for inclusion in the “sum over paths.” In many cases, this leads to the distributions not even satisfying the basic symmetry requirements and often containing many more oscillations and interference fringes than their numerically integrated counterparts. Using the strong-field approximation, we find that the manual enforcement of the energy-conservation condition on the momentum distribution calculated via the saddle-point method provides a unique momentum distribution which satisfies the symmetry requirements of the system and which is in a good agreement with the numerical results. We illustrate our findings using the example of the Ar atom ionized by a selection of monochromatic and bichromatic linearly polarized fields.},

Different from normal coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT), we propose a surprisingly large and nontrivial effect of second-order coupling on broadened CDT essentially attributed to avoided level crossings and localized Floquet states. Moreover, our results at high-frequency approximation supported by exact numerical ones demonstrate that the extent to which the normal CDT is broadened depends on the separation of quasienergy levels in the vicinity of zeros of J 0 ( A / ω ) . Remarkably, beyond the intensity of second-order coupling, the lattice size and its parity also significantly influence Floquet dynamics by either facilitating or suppressing tunneling probabilities, which in essence are also determined by noncrossing quasienergies and localized Floquet states. These findings substantially extend the theory of normal CDT, unveil the intrinsic physics behind broadened CDT, and open up an exciting possibility for quantum state control.},

  abstract     = {Ionization of atoms by a strong laser field can be described using the improved strong-field approximation. The corresponding transition amplitude of high-order above-threshold ionization is presented in the form of a two-dimensional integral over the electron ionization time t 0 and the rescattering time t . This integral can be solved using the saddle-point (SP) method and the resulting T -matrix element is expressed as a sum (over the SP times t 0 and t ) of the partial transition amplitudes. We address the problem of finding the solutions of the system of SP equations for the times t 0 and t . For a bichromatic linearly polarized laser field with the frequencies r ω and s ω ( r and s are integers, s > r , and ω is the fundamental frequency) we found that there are 8 s 2 SP solutions per optical cycle. For one half of them the velocity of the electron emitted in the laser field polarization direction changes the sign at the rescattering time (we call such solutions backward-scattering solutions), while for the other half this velocity remains unchanged (these solutions we call forward-scattering SP solutions). For very short (or even negative) electron travel time we call these solutions backward-like and forward-like scattering SP solutions. For these solutions the imaginary parts of the times t 0 and t become large so that the concept of real electron trajectories becomes questionable. Having such a classification, we found additional SP solutions even for the simplest case of a monochromatic linearly polarized laser field. For a bichromatic linearly polarized laser field with s = 2 and equal component intensities we presented a detailed analysis of all 32 solutions per optical cycle, showing how the SP times t 0 and t and the corresponding differential ionization rates depend on the photoelectron energy. We have also analyzed the case where the intensity of the second component decreases while the sum of the component intensities remains fixed.},

  abstract     = {In a previous paper we showed that an inhomogeneous body in vacuum will experience a spontaneous force if it is not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. This is due to the asymmetric asymptotic radiation pattern such an object emits. We demonstrated this self-propulsive force by considering an expansion in powers of the electric susceptibility: A torque arises in first order, but only if the material constituting the body is nonreciprocal. No force arises in first order. A force does occur for bodies made of ordinary (reciprocal) materials in second order. Here we extend these considerations to the torque. As one would expect, a spontaneous torque will also appear on an inhomogeneous chiral object if it is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment. Once a chiral body starts to rotate, it will experience a small quantum frictional torque, but much more important, unless a mechanism is provided to maintain the nonequilibrium state, is thermalization: The body will rapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the vacuum, and the angular acceleration will essentially become zero. For a small, or even a large, inhomogeneous chiral body, a terminal angular velocity will result, which seems to be in the realm of observability.},

For a single-electron system, we prove that the operator results of the iterative equations are consistent with the existing results obtained by the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.

Described by the effective Hamiltonian, the mechanical energy is directly converted to the photons through a three-wave-mixing mechanism. It is not a quantum simulation of a parametric DCE such as in superconducting circuits. Using a master-equation approach, we analyze the system dynamics in various regimes with respect to the ratio of the effective coupling strength and the loss rate of the system. The dynamics under the strong-coupling regime confirms various three-wave-mixing processes for creating photons by annihilation of mechanical and atomic excitations. Under the weak-coupling regime, a continuous production of photons can be demonstrated by driving both the mechanical oscillator and atom. By virtue of an atom of tunable frequency, our method avoids using the high-frequency mechanical oscillator, which is required for the conventional DCE in optomechanical systems under the double-photon resonance yet is out of reach of experiment. It is found that the mechanical frequency can be about two orders smaller than the cavity mode in yielding a remarkable flux of DCE photons.},

  abstract     = {A weak magnetic-dipole absorption band has been recently identified in the Martian atmosphere. This unprecedented discovery raised a question of whether similar magnetic transitions could be found in other polyatomics as well. The present work proposes a simplified, but physically well-grounded approach, which is intended to help to evaluate the strength of magnetic-dipole transitions induced in the course of molecular vibrations. The suggested theory is developed assuming a pure vibrational magnetic moment arising within a combination band. Our estimate for the electric-dipole-forbidden band demonstrates good agreement of the transition matrix element with the value derived previously from both laboratory experiments and in-depth ab initio based consideration. The possibility is shown to observe magnetic transitions owing to a magnetic moment that is linear with respect to momentum. This prediction is discussed taking a molecule of type HCN as an example.},

The hydrogen in excited states has an effective dipole moment which in the presence of a laser field leads to a dipolar focusing [H. B. Ambalampitiya et al. , J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt.

Two-photon UV photolysis of H 2 S produced population in these high-lying bound states that were subsequently interrogated at high precision via Doppler-free spectroscopy of the F 1 Σ g + − X 1 Σ g + system. A third UV laser was used for detection through auto-ionizing resonances. The experimentally determined binding energies were found to be in excellent agreement with calculations based on nonadiabatic perturbation theory, also including relativistic and quantum electrodynamical contributions. The s -wave scattering length of the H + H system is derived from the binding energy of the last bound J = 0 level via a direct semi-empirical approach, yielding a value of a s = 0.2724 ( 5 ) a 0 , in good agreement with a result from a previously followed theoretical approach. The subtle effect of the m α 4 relativity contribution to a s was found to be significant. In a similar manner a value for the p -wave scattering volume is determined via the J = 1 binding energy yielding a p = − 134.0000 ( 6 ) a 0 3 . The binding energy of the last bound state in H 2 , the ( v = 14 , J = 4 ) level, is determined at 0.023 (4) cm − 1 , in good agreement with calculation.

  abstract     = {Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) aims to mitigate adversarial exploitation of imperfections in quantum devices by providing an approach for secret key distillation with modest security assumptions. Advantage distillation, a two-way communication procedure in error correction, has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against independent and identically distributed (IID) collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol. Furthermore, using this security condition we obtain some improvements over previous results on the noise tolerance thresholds for DIQKD. Our results provide insight into a fundamental question in quantum information theory regarding the circumstances under which DIQKD is possible.},

While VQAs have found broad applications, certain challenges persist. Notably, a significant computational burden arises during parameter optimization. The prevailing “parameter shift rule” mandates a double evaluation of the cost function for each parameter. In this paper, we introduce an optimization approach named “learning to learn with an evolutionary strategy” (LLES). LLES unifies “learning to learn” and “evolutionary strategy” methods. Learning to learn treats optimization as a learning problem, utilizing recurrent neural networks to iteratively propose VQA parameters. Conversely, evolutionary strategy employs gradient searches to estimate function gradients. Our optimization method is applied to two distinct tasks: determining the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian and training a quantum neural network. The obtained results underscore the efficacy of this approach. Additionally, we identify a key hyperparameter that significantly influences gradient estimation using the evolutionary strategy method.},

The method we present can directly be adapted for any symmetry, though in the present work we focus explicitly on the examples of , and particle number conservation. We show how to construct symmetric gates that respects the aforementioned symmetries. In the second part, we focus on numerical analysis of parameterized particle-conserving gates. In variational quantum simulation, for example, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the symmetric gates of the PQC are parameterized. Since there are often many possible inequivalent parametrizations, it is often not immediately obvious which gate parametrization would be most efficient in general for a wide range of Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry. We streamline our analysis to particle-conserving circuits and Hamiltonians. We numerically analyze the efficiency of different particle-conserving gate parametrizations by studying two examples, namely, a physics problem of learning the ground state of Heisenberg spin chains, and an artificial problem of learning the random arbitary states sampled within the particle number conserved subspace.},

  abstract     = {Quantum radar, also known as quantum illumination, is a type of quantum-sensing protocol for detecting noncooperative targets hidden in noisy environments. Recently, considerable research efforts have been focused on optimizing quantum illumination via conditional photon-detection methods, such as photon subtraction and photon catalysis of the entanglement source. However, to date, almost none of these studies have considered the probability of successful detection of nonzero photons. Often, the probability of conditional nonzero photon detection is extremely low, which may negate the advantage of conditional measurements in a quantum radar. In this paper, we propose enhancing the performance of quantum radars using zero-photon subtraction (ZPS), where no physical photons are subtracted from a given optical system. We demonstrate that the probability of ZPS is one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of nonzero photon detection. Our results show that ZPS helps enhance the performance of quantum radars, even when the probability of photon detection is considered. Moreover, in this paper, we consider a more realistic quantum radar in which target detection is performed using amplitude-damped quantum entanglement, which is more commonly used in the preparation of quantum entanglement in radar transmitters. This means that ZPS is a more efficient conditional photon-detection method for quantum illumination, providing a more robust scheme for developing future quantum radars.},

  abstract     = {Quantum transducers are essential for connecting hybrid quantum systems with distinct frequencies, pivotal for hybrid quantum networks. A deterministic quantum transducer protocol is proposed for the upconversion of single phonons in the microwave domain to optical photons. Utilizing a hybrid optomechanical crystal coupled to a three-level emitter, the protocol deterministically upconverts an itinerant phonon into an optical photon, when an auxiliary optical cavity mode is driven by a single photon. Furthermore, the deterministic upconversion transducer can also be achieved by driving the emitter with a classical laser pulse, rather than driving the optical cavity with a single photon. The intracavity photon numbers in both protocols are significantly less than one during the operation, thus overcoming the problem of parasitic heating within radiation-pressure coupling of hybrid optomechanical systems. These outstanding features make the protocols particularly useful for the realization of large-scale distributed hybrid quantum networks.},

In a trapped-ion quantum computer, this is typically implemented with laser beams which are modulated in amplitude, frequency, phase, or a combination of these. The required modulation becomes increasingly more complex as the quantum computer becomes larger, complicating the control hardware design. Here we develop a simple method to essentially remove the pulse-modulation complexity by engineering the normal modes of the ion chain. We experimentally test the feasibility of the method in a three-ion chain. This opens up the possibility to trade off complexity between the design of the trapping fields and the optical control system, which will help scale the ion-trap quantum computing platform.},

In this work we develop validity conditions for high-fidelity digital adiabatic tasks. To this end, we assume a digitizing process based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, which allows us to introduce a digitized adiabatic theorem. As a consequence of this theorem, we show that the performance of such a hybrid model is limited by the fundamental constraints on the adiabatic theorem validity, even in ideal quantum processors. We argue how our approach predicts the existence of intrinsic nonadiabatic errors reported by Barends et al. [ Nature (London) 534 , 222 (2016) ] through an empirical study of digital annealing. In addition, our approach allows us to explain the existence of a scaling of the number of Suzuki-Trotter blocks for the optimal digital circuit with respect to the optimal adiabatic total evolution time, as reported by Mbeng et al. [ Phys. Rev. B 100 , 224201 (2019) ] through robust numerical analysis of digital annealing.

  abstract     = {Λ , V , Ξ (ladder), and other three-level quantum systems with one forbidden transition (referred to here as Λ -type systems) play an important role in quantum physics. Various applications require manipulation of such systems using as a control a shaped laser field. In this work, we study how the degeneracy of energy states or of Bohr frequencies in these systems affects the efficiency or difficulty of finding the optimal shape of the control field. For this, we adopt the notion of higher-order traps, which was introduced in Pechen and Tannor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 , 120402 (2011) , where second-/third-order traps were discovered for a Λ -atom with one forbidden transition and with nondegenerate energy levels. We theoretically study the control of such systems with and without degeneracy in their eigenstates and Bohr frequencies, and we investigate numerically using GRAPE and l-BFGS algorithms how this degeneracy influences the efficiency of optimizing the control laser field. We find that the degeneracy of the Bohr frequencies in the Ξ system, which makes the system energy levels symmetrically distributed, leads to the appearance of a seventh-order trap with a more significant attracting domain resulting in a more difficult optimization, while the degeneracy of energy states in generic Λ -type systems does not lead to an increase of the order of the zero control trap compared to the nondegenerate case. We also find that when not only are the Bohr frequencies degenerate in the system Ξ but also the dipole moments for the two allowed transitions coincide (in this case, the Ξ system is not controllable), then true traps arise in the quantum control landscape. In particular, the constant zero control becomes a trap.},

  abstract     = {Generating stable entanglement by mimicking a squeezed environment plays an important role in quantum metrology and quantum information. Here, we propose an efficient scheme for generating stable entanglement of two boron-vacancy (VB) defects in a suspended circular hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) membrane via a two-phonon drive. Compared to other reported methods, our scheme only needs a linear resource and thus is more convenient for experimental implementation. In the presence of a gradient magnetic field, the electronic spin degree of freedom of the VB defect can be coupled to the mechanical mode of h -BN membrane through spin-phonon interaction. The coupling strength is closely related to the geometry of the magnetic field and the parameters of the membrane, which allows us to realize different coupling regimes by choosing the parameter appropriately. After applying a time-dependent pump to the h -BN membrane, we can modulate its spring constant and obtain a tunable two-phonon drive to the mechanical mode. We then investigate the dissipative coupling between two VB spins in the condition of a large dissipation limit, showing that the stable entanglement can be generated under a two-phonon drive. In addition, we also take the spin dephasing into consideration to explore the robustness of our scheme. We then extend this scheme to multiparticle systems, which shows that the entanglement degree deepens with the increase of VB spin number. This work offers a fascinating platform for generating stable entanglement with VB spins in two-dimensional h -BN.},

Focusing on the five-qubit code and adapting it to partially correct two-qubit errors in relevant parameter regimes according to the noise model, we find that a composite-channel approximation where every noise term is considered separately captures the behavior in many physical cases up to long timescales, eventually failing due to the effect of noncommuting terms. In contrast, we find that single-qubit approximations do not properly capture the error-correction dynamics with two-qubit noise, even for short times. A Pauli approximation going beyond a single-qubit channel is sensitive to the details of the noise, state, and decoder and succeeds at short timescales relative to the noise strength, beyond which it fails. Furthermore, we point out a mechanism for a Pauli model failure where it underestimates the success rate of a code even with frequent syndrome projection and correction cycles. These results shed light on the performance of error correction in the presence of realistic noise and can advance the ongoing efforts towards useful quantum error correction.},

Studies have shown that the empirical error is usually much smaller than the one suggested by existing bounds, implying the actual circuit cost required is much less than the ones based on those bounds. Here, we improve the estimate of the Trotter error over existing bounds, by introducing a general framework of commutant decomposition that separates disjoint error components that have fundamentally different scaling with time. In particular we identify two error components that each scale as O ( τ p t ) and O ( τ p ) for a p th -order product formula evolving to time t using a fixed step size τ , implying one would scale linearly with time t and the other would be a constant of t . We show that this formalism not only straightforwardly reproduces previous results but also provides a better error estimate for higher-order product formulas. We demonstrate the improvement both analytically and numerically. We also apply the analysis to observable error relating to the heating in Floquet dynamics and thermalization, which is of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Circuit quantum-electrodynamics-based quantum information processing relies on low noise amplification for signal readout. In the realm of microwave superconducting circuits, this amplification is often achieved via Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs). In the past, these amplifiers exhibited low power added efficiency (PAE), which is roughly the fraction of pump power that is converted to output signal power. This is increasingly relevant because recent attempts to build high saturation power amplifiers achieve this at the cost of very low PAE, which in turn puts a high heat load on the cryostat and limits the number of these devices that a dilution refrigerator can host. Here, we numerically investigate upper bounds on PAE. We focus on a class of parametric amplifiers that consists of a capacitor shunted by a nonlinear inductive block. We first set a benchmark for this class of amplifiers by considering nonlinear blocks described by an arbitrary polynomial current-phase relation. Next, we identify that it is important for amplifiers with inductive blocks composed of repeating elements to have monotonic current-phase relations for each element in order to avoid exciting high-frequency modes. Using this design rule, we propose two circuit implementations for repeating elements in JPA inductive blocks. Finally, we investigate polynomial amplifier chains. We find that while amplifiers with higher gain have a lower PAE, regardless of the gain there is considerable room to improve as compared with state-of-the-art devices. For example, for a degenerate amplifier with a power gain of 20 dB, the PAE is ≈ 0 . 1 % for typical JPAs, 37.9% for our simpler circuit JPAs, 42.6% for our more complex circuit JPAs, 63.3% for our arbitrary polynomial amplifiers, and at least 98% for our amplifier chains.},

We compute the corresponding asymptotic key rate imposing a photon-number cutoff and recent advances in conic optimization. Our method yields significant improvements on key rates: at metropolitan distances, it provides positive key rates for block sizes of the order of rounds, orders of magnitude smaller compared to previous works.},

  abstract     = {Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) exploits the information-processing capabilities of quantum systems to tackle time-series forecasting tasks, which is expected to be superior to their classical counterparts. By far, many QRC schemes have been theoretically proposed. However, most of these schemes involve long-time evolution of quantum systems or networks with quantum gates. This poses a challenge for practical implementation of these schemes, as precise manipulation of quantum systems is crucial, and this level of control is currently hard to achieve with the existing state of quantum technology. Here we propose a different QRC scheme, which is friendly to experimental realization. It implements the quantum version of nonlinear vector autoregression, extracting linear and nonlinear features of quantum data by measurements. Thus, the evolution of complex networks of quantum gates can be avoided. Compared to other QRC schemes, our proposal also achieves an advance by effectively reducing the necessary training data for reliable predictions in time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we experimentally verify our proposal by performing the forecasting tasks, and the observation matches well with the theoretical ones. Our work opens up a different way for complex tasks to be solved by using QRC, which can herald the next generation of QRC.},

Such imaging normally holds Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field zone. We show that time -modulation of an inhomogeneous dielectric can be used to determine its susceptibility. To this end, we focus on the inverse quantum optics problem for spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric susceptibility is similar to moving dielectrics. We show that the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is nonzero due to the negative frequencies even in the far-field zone. Hence, certain dielectric features can be determined without radiating any incident field on the dielectric. When the incident light is scattered (or reradiated), the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced and overcomes Rayleigh's limit in the far-field zone. We study similar effects for an inhomogeneous dielectric moving with a constant speed, a problem we consider within relativistic optics. Now the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal reflects dielectric features, can be long-range in space but is not a far-field effect.},

However, the maximum measurement precision of a single measurement is limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty at the two-photon level, which constrains the development of a HOM-based sensor. In this paper, we combine the multipass approach of a sequential scheme for quantum metrology with the traditional HOM-based sensor, and provide a general theoretical scheme of a multipass HOM-based sensor. For N passes of the probe through the sample, our proposed scheme offers an N -fold improvement in the precision of parameter estimation compared to a traditional HOM-based sensor under the same number of measurement repetitions. Furthermore, we present the simulation results of decoherence models for the multipass HOM-based sensor by introducing phase diffusion and photon loss, which are significantly enhanced due to the multipass approach. Last, we present the predictions of achievable precision for the multipass HOM-based sensor, considering measurement repetitions of the order of 10 4 in a sample with a thickness of 100 µ m .},

  abstract     = {Dynamical decoupling multipulse sequences can be applied to solid-state spins for sensing weak oscillating fields from nearby single nuclear spins. By periodically reversing the probing system's evolution, other noises are counteracted and filtered out over the total evolution. However, the technique is subject to intricate interactions resulting in additional resonant responses, which can be misinterpreted with the actual signal intended to be measured. We experimentally characterize three of these effects present in single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, where we also develop a numerical simulation model without rotating-wave approximation, showing robust correlation to the experimental data. Regarding centers with the nitrogen isotope, we observe that a small misalignment in the bias magnetic field causes the precession of the nitrogen nuclear spin to be sensed by the electronic spin of the center. Another studied case of ambiguous resonances comes from the coupling with lattice nuclei, where we use the echo modulation frequencies to obtain the interaction Hamiltonian and then utilize the latter to simulate multipulse sequences. Finally, we also measure and simulate the effects from the free evolution of the quantum system during finite pulse durations. Due to the large data volume and the strong dependence of these ambiguous resonances with specific experimental parameters, we provide a simulations data set with a user-friendly graphical interface, where users can compare simulations with their own experimental data for spectral disambiguation. Although focused on nitrogen-vacancy centers and dynamical decoupling sequences, these results and the developed model can potentially be applied to other solid-state spins and quantum sensing techniques.},

The quest for high sensitivity combined with high spatial resolution naturally leads to dense ensembles of NV centers and hence to strong, long-range interactions between them. Hence, simulating strongly interacting NVs becomes essential. However, obtaining the exact dynamics for a many-spin system is a challenging task due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension, a problem that is exacerbated when the system is modeled as an open quantum system. In this work, we employ the matrix product density operator (MPDO) method to represent the many-body mixed state and to simulate the dynamics of an ensemble of NVs in the presence of strong long-range couplings due to dipole-dipole forces. We benchmark different time-evolution algorithms in terms of numerical accuracy and stability against time evolution based on exact numerical diagonalization. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics in the strong-interaction regime and study the impact of decoherence on the accuracy of the MPDO method. Last, we investigate the dynamics of quantum Fisher information and show that for small distances below about 5 nm the resulting strong dipole-dipole interaction can improve the sensitivity for magnetic field sensing when the ensemble is driven by pulses of constant amplitude.},

However, achieving practical implementations that balance efficiency, security, and flexibility remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose an innovative QSS scheme that integrates a verification mechanism for the distribution process by leveraging quasicausal cones within the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz framework. This approach ensures the secure dissemination of entangled photons across a multiuser network while enhancing the integrity of the quantum state against disturbances. A key feature of our scheme is the application of quasicausal cones, which improve the system's fault tolerance and recovery precision, preserving quantum state coherence and stability even in the presence of errors or losses. The recursive and hierarchical design of our framework enables it to dynamically adapt to fluctuations in network size and the number of participants, making it well suited for large-scale quantum networks. Furthermore, our method reduces the costs associated with photon transmission and storage, enhancing resource allocation within expansive quantum networks. The strategic incorporation of quasicausal cones represents a major advancement, streamlining the flow of quantum information and minimizing the overall resource footprint. By flexibly accommodating varying network sizes and configurations, our scheme marks a significant step towards efficient large-scale QSS, underscoring the critical role of quasicausal cones in advancing quantum communication technologies.},

The result is an error mitigation protocol which requires minimal noise assumptions, making it straightforwardly implementable on existing, noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

This is often remedied using maximum likelihood estimators, which have a high computing time or by other estimation methods that decrease the reconstructed fidelity. In this paper, we show that when restricting the measurement sample size, improvement over existing algorithms can be achieved.

Early resource theories primarily focused on analyzing static quantum resources. Recently, interest in the study of dynamic quantum resources has been growing. In this paper, we utilize superchannel theory to describe the dynamic resource theory of quantum coherence. In this dynamic resource theory, we treat classical channels as free channels and consider two classes of free superchannels that preserve channel incoherence [maximally incoherent superchannels (MISCs) and dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISCs)] as free resources. We regard the quantum Fourier transform as the golden unit of dynamic coherence resources. We first establish the one-shot theory of dynamic coherence cost and dynamic coherence distillation, which involves converting the quantum Fourier transform into an arbitrary quantum channel using MISCs and DISCs. Next, we introduce a class of free superchannels known as -MISCs, which asymptotically generate negligible dynamic coherence. Finally, we provide upper and lower bounds for the one-shot catalytic dynamic coherence cost of quantum channels under the action of these -MISC superchannels.},

  abstract     = {Quantum resources may provide an advantage over their classical counterparts in communication tasks. We refer to this as quantum advantage . Here, we consider a single communication task to study different approaches of observing quantum advantage. We call this setting a unified scenario . Our task is described as the following. There are three parties—the Manager, Alice, and Bob. The Manager sends a value of a random variable to Alice, and at the same time Bob receives some partial information regarding that value. Initially, neither Alice nor Bob knows the input of the other, which is received from the Manager. The goal of the task is achieved if and only if the value of the random variable, sent to Alice by the Manager, is identified by Bob with a success probability greater than half all the time. Here, nonzero error probability is allowed. However, to help Bob, Alice sends a limited amount of classical or quantum information to him (cbit or qubit). We show that the goal of the task can be achieved when Alice sends a qubit. On the other hand, a cbit communication is not sufficient for achieving the goal. Thus, it establishes quantum advantage. We further show that the optimal success probability in the overall process for a qubit communication can be higher than the optimal success probability for a cbit communication. In fact, this success probability is higher for qubit communication even if along with cbit communication Alice and Bob share randomness which allows mixing of classical strategies. Clearly, it not only establishes quantum advantage, it also demonstrates a more prominent nonclassical feature. Actually, we obtain higher success probability compared to other tasks. This also suggests the experiment-friendly nature of our task. For applications, we connect our task with semi-device-independence and show how our task can be useful to detect quantumness of a communication in a secure way. Moreover, within the same setting, we provide a way to detect universal coherence present in an ensemble. For a high-dimensional random variable, to achieve the goal, it may require a high-dimensional classical communication, while it can be achieved with only a qubit communication. This establishes a large separation between the quantum and the classical communication.},

For a single qubit immersed in a binary Bose mixture, we show that the system maintains coherence over finite timescales and exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, particularly in the upper branch of the environment. We explore the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian dephasing through the Ohmicity of the spectral density functions, which are significantly influenced by interspecies interactions. In the case of two spatially separated qubits coupled to the Bose-Bose mixture reservoir, we demonstrate that collective decoherence affects the system dynamics, leading to prolonged coherence survival in both branches of the mixture. The intricate evolution of the decoherence factors is reflected in the density spectral functions and their Ohmicity characteristics. We find that the decoherence functions and spectra oscillate with increasing distance between the qubits, modifying the information flow dynamics. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation of the entanglement dynamics between the two qubits induced by the binary Bose mixture reservoir in both branches, underscoring the critical role of interspecies interactions.},

However, quantum processors, notably analog quantum simulators, have the potential to offer an unprecedented, efficient method of Hamiltonian simulation by evolving a state in real time to compute phase transitions, dynamical properties, and entanglement witnesses. To elucidate the response of materials to neutron scattering, we present a method for simulating the spin dynamics in the transverse field Ising chain on QuEra's Aquila processor by calculating the dynamic structure factor (DSF) and propose a method for error mitigation. We provide numerical simulations and experimental results for the performance of the procedure on the hardware, up to a chain of length .

Alternatively, optimal evolutions can happen along predefined paths with no waste of energy resources and 1 0 0 % speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios typically result in less-than-ideal evolutions. In this paper we study different families of suboptimal qubit Hamiltonians, both stationary and time varying, for which the so-called geodesic efficiency and the speed efficiency of the corresponding quantum evolutions are less than one. Furthermore, after proposing an alternative hybrid efficiency measure constructed out of the two previously mentioned efficiency quantifiers, we provide illustrative examples where the average departures from time optimality and 1 0 0 % speed efficiency are globally captured over a limited time period. In particular, due to this hybrid measure, quantum evolutions are partitioned in four categories: geodesic unwasteful, nongeodesic unwasteful, geodesic wasteful, and nongeodesic wasteful. Finally, we discuss Hamiltonians specified by magnetic-field configurations, both stationary and nonstationary, yielding optimal hybrid efficiency, that it, both time optimality and 1 0 0 % speed efficiency, over a finite time interval.},

Although catalytically enabled state transformations have been formally characterized by the monotonic behavior of entropic quantifiers (e.g., the von Neumann entropy or nonequilibrium free energy), such characterizations often rely on unphysical assumptions, namely, the ability of using catalysts of infinitely large dimension. This approach offers very limited insights into the practical significance of using catalysis for quantum information processing. Here, we address this problem across a broad class of quantum resource theories. Leveraging quantum information tools beyond the asymptotic regime, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of catalytic transformations with finite-size catalysts. We further unveil connections between finite-size catalysis and multicopy transformations. Notably, we discover a phenomenon of catalytic resonance : by carefully tailoring the catalysts's state, one can drastically reduce the required dimension of the catalyst, thus enabling efficient catalytic transformations with minimal resources. Finally, we illustrate our findings with examples from the resource theories of entanglement and thermodynamics, as well in the context of catalytic unitary transformations.},

The P&M quantum multichain-shaped networks involve multiple measurement parties, with each measurement party potentially having multiple sequential receivers. We adapt the original Navascués, Pironio, and Acín (NPA) hierarchy by incorporating a finite number of linear and positive semi-definite constraints to characterize the quantum correlations in P&M quantum multichain-shaped networks. These constraints in each hierarchy are derived from sequential measurements and the inner-product matrix of prepared states. The adapted NPA hierarchy is further applied to tackle some quantum information tasks, including sequential quantum random access codes (QRACs) and semi-device-independent randomness certification. First, we derive the optimal trade-off between the two sequential receivers in the sequential QRACs, and investigate randomness certification in its double violation region. Second, considering the presence of an eavesdropper in actual communication, we show how much local and global randomness can be certified using the optimal trade-off of sequential QRACs. We also quantify the amount of local and global randomness that can be certified from the complete set of probabilities generated by the two sequential receivers. Our conclusion is that utilizing the full set of probabilities certifies more randomness than relying solely on the optimal trade-off relationship.},

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics is that nonorthogonal states cannot be distinguished perfectly. When distinguishing multiple copies of a mixed quantum state, a collective measurement, which generates entanglement between the different copies of the unknown state, can achieve a lower error probability than nonentangling measurements. The error probability that can be attained using a collective measurement on a finite number of copies of the unknown state is given by the Helstrom bound. In the limit where we can perform a collective measurement on asymptotically many copies of the quantum state, the quantum Chernoff bound gives the attainable error probability. It is natural to ask, then, what strategies can be employed to reach these two bounds—is entanglement across all available modes always necessary or can other, experimentally more simple measurements saturate these bounds? In this work we address this question. We find analytic expressions for the Helstrom bound for arbitrarily many copies of the unknown state in simple qubit examples. Using these analytic expressions, we investigate whether the quantum Chernoff bound can be saturated by repeatedly implementing the -copy Helstrom measurement. We also investigate the necessary conditions to saturate the -copy Helstrom bound. It is known that a collective measurement on all copies of the unknown state is always sufficient to saturate the -copy Helstrom bound. However, general conditions for when such a measurement is necessary to saturate the Helstrom bound remain unknown. We investigate specific measurement strategies which involve entangling operations on fewer than all copies of the unknown state. For many regimes we find that a collective measurement on all copies of the unknown state is necessary to saturate the -copy Helstrom bound.},

These models host symmetry-protected topological phases, characterized by edge modes with vanishing single-particle energy in the thermodynamic limit. The same fact prevents the standard VQE algorithm from converging to the correct ground state for finite chains, since it is quasidegenerate in energy with other many-body states. Notably, this quasidegeneracy cannot be removed by small perturbations, as in typical spin systems. We address this issue by imposing appropriate constraints on the VQE evolution and constructing appropriate variational circuits, to restrict the probed portion of the Hilbert space along the same evolution. These constraints stem from general properties both of the topological phases and of the studied Hamiltonians. In this way, the improved VQE algorithm achieves an accurate convergence to the exact ground states in each phase. The present approach promises large applicability, also to realistic systems with different topologies and/or not easily removable degeneracies, thanks to the very high fidelity achievable also on systems with a relatively high number of qubits.},

  abstract     = {Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LMs). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve the QCRB through LMs. The first method, dubbed the iterative matrix partition method and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a traceless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LMs as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by Zhou et al . [ Quantum Sci. Technol. 5 , 025005 (2020) ], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of the QCRB through LMs for the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed the hierarchy of orthogonality conditions and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRBs, including the three-qubit states and the -qubit states ( ). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.},

An example is the measurement of a magnetic field through the rotation of a spin that is subject to decoherence due to its coupling to a surrounding spin or bosonic bath. In this work we define mixed optimal quantum rotosensors (OQRs) as mixed spin- states that achieve maximum sensitivity to estimate infinitesimal rotations, when the rotation axis is unknown. We study two scenarios, where the probe states saturate the averaged fidelity or the averaged quantum Cramér-Rao bound, the latter giving the ultimate sensitivity. We find that mixed OQRs can achieve sensitivity equal to that of pure states and are obtained by mixing states from linear subspaces of anticoherent states. We present several examples of mixed OQRs and their associated anticoherent subspaces. We also show that OQRs maximize entanglement in a specific sense, preserving the known relation between entanglement and optimal rotation sensitivity for pure states, even in the context of mixed states. Our results highlight the interconnection between quantum metrology of rotations, anticoherence, and entanglement in mixed spin states.},

It is thus crucial from both the algorithmic and hardware standpoints to understand whether multipartite entanglement contributes to achieving a good solution. Here we tackle this challenge by analyzing genuine multipartite entanglement—quantified by the generalized geometric measure—generated in Trotterized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Using numerical benchmarks, we analyze its occurrence in the annealing schedule in detail. We observe a multipartite-entanglement barrier, and we explore how it correlates to the algorithm's success. We also prove how multipartite entanglement provides an upper bound to the overlap of the instantaneous state with an exact solution. Vice versa, the overlaps to the initial and final product states, which can be easily measured experimentally, offer upper bounds for the multipartite entanglement during the entire schedule. Our results help to shed light on how complex quantum correlations come to bear as a resource in quantum optimization.},

In this paper, we investigate theoretically the preparation and error correction of a GKP qubit in a vibrational mode of a neutral atom stored in an optical dipole trap. This platform has recently shown remarkable progress in simultaneously controlling the motional and electronic degrees of freedom of trapped atoms. The protocols we develop make use of motional states and, additionally, internal electronic states of the trapped atom to serve as an ancilla qubit. We compare optical tweezer arrays and optical lattices and find that the latter provide more flexible control over the confinement in the out-of-plane direction, which can be utilized to optimize the conditions for the implementation of GKP codes. Concretely, the different frequency scales that the harmonic oscillators in the axial and radial lattice directions exhibit and a small oscillator anharmonicity prove to be beneficial for robust encodings of GKP states. Finally, we underpin the experimental feasibility of the proposed protocols by numerically simulating the preparation of GKP qubits in an optical lattice with realistic parameters.},

  abstract     = {It is well known in quantum machine learning that the form of the feature map has a significant effect on the operation and performance of those tasks being undertaken. It is essential to investigate how to generate an effective feature map within the limitations of the number of qubits and quantum gates to apply in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we explore how the qubit connectivity impacts the performance of quantum extreme reservoir computation (QERC) for image classification using the XY Hamiltonian. We find that networks of qubits with simple connectivity generate an effective feature map, whereas a network with high connectivity does not since the XY Hamiltonian on it yields a unitary map with a periodic property. The existence of the periodicity can be fully determined by the underlying connectivity and the overall symmetry of the Hamiltonian. However, the symmetries in the XY Hamiltonians can contribute to a better generalization for QERC. We further find that it is possible to design QERC to give this high generalization property while maintaining high accuracy. Our work suggests that Hamiltonian dynamics with simple connectivity or symmetry can be exploited as a computational resource in quantum machine learning.},

  abstract     = {We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on and off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a spin- system, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the spin. We study the emergence of diabolical points and diabolical loci in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique for tuning the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting different adiabatic evolutions of the driving protocol, characterized by distinct paths in parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.},

This allows for gradient-based optimization of DQC1 circuits, positioning DQC1 as a quantum protocol for both training and inference. We then analyze the expressivity of the parametrized DQC1 circuits characterizing the set of learnable functions, and show that DQC1-based machine learning (ML) is as powerful as quantum neural networks based on universal computation. Our findings highlight the potential of DQC1 as a practical and versatile platform for ML, capable of rivaling more complex quantum computing models while utilizing simpler quantum resources.},

Two major reasons for this are the large number of gates required for Trotterizing time-dependent electronic structure Hamiltonians, as well as discretization errors heating the state. We show that a recently proposed randomized algorithm [E. Granet and H. Dreyer, npj Quantum Inf. 10 , 82 (2024) ], which implements exact adiabatic evolution without heating and with far fewer gates than Trotterization, can overcome this problem. We develop three methods for measuring the energy of the prepared state in an efficient and noise-resilient manner, yielding chemically accurate results on a four-qubit molecule in the presence of realistic gate noise, without the need for error mitigation. These findings suggest that adiabatic approaches to state preparation could play a key role in quantum chemistry simulations both in the era of noisy as well as error-corrected quantum computers.},

We identify a nonmonotonic dependence on the local noise strength in both the averaged entanglement and operator correlations, specifically the subsystem parity variance. While the nonmonotonicity persists at any finite efficiency for the operator correlations, it disappears at finite inefficiency for the entanglement. The analysis of scaling with the system size in a finite-length chain indicates that, at finite efficiency, this effect leads to distinct measurement-induced phase transitions for operator correlations and entanglement. Our result hints at a difference between area-law entanglement scaling and Zeno-localized phases for inefficient monitoring.},

  abstract     = {In the search for quantum advantage with near-term quantum devices, navigating the optimization landscape is significantly hampered by the barren plateaus phenomenon. This study presents a strategy to overcome this obstacle without changing the quantum circuit architecture. We propose incorporating auxiliary control qubits to shift the circuit from a unitary 2-design to a unitary 1-design, mitigating the prevalence of barren plateaus. We then remove these auxiliary qubits to return to the original circuit structure while preserving the unitary 1-design properties. Our numerical simulation suggests that the proposed structure effectively mitigates the barren plateaus phenomenon. A significant finding is that the gradient of θ 1 , 1 , the first parameter in the quantum circuit, displays a broader distribution as the number of qubits and layers increases. This suggests a higher probability of obtaining effective gradients. This stability is critical for the efficient training of quantum circuits, especially for larger and more complex systems. The results of this study represent a significant advance in the optimization of quantum circuits and offer a promising avenue for the scalable and practical implementation of quantum computing technologies. This approach opens up new opportunities in quantum learning and other applications that require robust quantum computing power.},

  abstract     = {The one-dimensional spin- 𝑠 ⁢ S U ⁡ ( 2 ) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, as a paradigmatic example for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes (GMs), is expected to exhibit an abstract fractal underlying the ground-state subspace. This intrinsic abstract fractal is here revealed from a systematic investigation into the entanglement entropy for a linear combination of factorized (unentangled) ground states on a fractal decomposable into a set of the Cantor sets. The entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size, with the prefactor being half the fractal dimension of a fractal, as first noted by Castro-Alvaredo and Doyon for the spin- 1 / 2 ferromagnetic Heisenberg model [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 (2012) 120401], as long as the norm for the linear combination scales as the square root of the number of the self-similar building blocks kept at each step 𝑘 for a fractal, under an assumption that the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen to be around one, and the coefficients in the linear combination are almost constants within the building blocks. Actually, the set of the fractal dimensions for all the Cantor sets forms a dense subset in the interval [0,1]. As a consequence, the ground-state subspace is separated into a disjoint union of countably infinitely many regions, each of which is labeled by a decomposable fractal. Hence, the interpretation of the prefactor as half the fractal dimension is valid for any support beyond a fractal, which in turn leads to the identification of the fractal dimension with the number of type-B GMs for the orthonormal basis states. Our argument may be extended to any quantum many-body systems undergoing SSB with type-B GMs.},

However, due to the presence of noise, the actual state at hand is often corrupted, making its symmetric structures distorted before the execution of quantum measurements. Here, using the methodology of quantum metrology, we identify the optimal measurement that can retrieve maximum information of a symmetric state from its corrupted copies. We show that this measurement can be found by solving a semidefinite program in generic cases and can be explicitly determined for a large class of noise models covariant under the symmetry group in question. The results of this study nicely complement the recent work by providing a method to optimally utilize the distorted symmetric structures of corrupted states for information retrieval.},

Crucial steps of our approach are the efficient identification of useful observables from shadow data, followed by our regularized subspace expansion that is designed to be numerically stable even when using noisy data. We analytically investigate noise propagation within our method, and upper bound the statistical fluctuations due to the limited number of snapshots in classical shadows. In numerical simulations, our method can achieve a reduction in the energy estimation errors in many cases, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude. We also demonstrate that our performance improvements are robust against both coherent errors (bad initial state) and gate noise in the state-preparation circuits. Furthermore, performance is guaranteed to be at least as good—and in many cases better—than direct energy estimation without using additional quantum resources, and the approach is thus a very natural alternative for estimating ground state energies directly from classical shadow data.},

Apart from being fundamentally important, measurement incompatibility is also a powerful resource in the broad quantum science and technologies, with wide applications to cryptography, communication, random number generation, and device-independent tasks. Since every physical system is unavoidably subject to noise, an important, yet still open, question is how to characterize the ability of noisy quantum dynamics to preserve measurement incompatibility. This work fills this gap by providing a resource theory of this ability, termed incompatibility preservability. We quantify incompatibility preservability by a robustness measure. Then, we introduce an operational task, entanglement-assisted filter game, to completely characterize both the robustness measure and the conversion of incompatibility preservability.

A variety of techniques exist that accomplish this task, with the most common technique used so far being Trotterization, which is a special case of the application of a product formula. However, other techniques exist that promise better asymptotic scaling in certain parameters of the theory being simulated, the most efficient of which are based on the concept of block encoding. In this work we study the performance of such algorithms in simulating lattice field theories. We derive and compare the asymptotic gate complexities of several commonly used simulation techniques in application to Hamiltonian lattice field theories. Using the scalar theory as a test, we also perform numerical studies and compare the gate costs required by product formulas and signal-processing-based techniques to simulate time evolution. For the latter, we use the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) construction augmented with the quantum Fourier transform circuit to switch between the field and momentum eigenbases, which leads to immediate order-of-magnitude improvement in the cost of preparing the block encoding. This paper also includes a pedagogical review of the techniques used, in particular product formulas, LCU, qubitization, quantum signal processing, as well as the technique for simulating geometrically-local Hamiltonians developed by Haah, Hastings, Kothari, and Low.},

In this article, we consider typical values of optimal parameters of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for the MAXCUT problem with -regular tree subgraphs and reuse them in different graph instances. We prove symmetries in the optimization landscape of several kinds of weighted and unweighted graphs, which explains the existence of multiple sets of optimal parameters. However, we observe that not all optimal sets can be successfully transferred between problem instances. We find specific transferable domains in the search space and show how to translate an arbitrary set of optimal parameters into the adequate domain using the studied symmetries.

  abstract     = {In analog and digital simulations of practically relevant quantum systems, the target dynamics can only be implemented approximately. The Trotter product formula is the most common approximation scheme as it is a generic method which allows tuning accuracy. The Trotter simulation precision will always be inexact for noncommuting operators, but it is currently unknown what the minimum possible error is. This is an important quantity because upper bounds for the Trotter error are known to often be vast overestimates. Here we present explicit lower bounds on the error, in norm and on states, allowing to derive minimum resource requirements. Numerical comparison with the true error shows that our bounds offer accurate and tight estimates.},

  abstract     = {Quantum nonlocality, rooted in the quantum state discrimination task, contributes to the development of the theory of local distinguishability of quantum states. Recently, Zhu et al. [ Phys. A (Amsterdam, Neth.) 624 , 128956 (2023) ] found that a nonlocal set of orthogonal product states (OPSs) can be perfectly identified by local operations and classical communication after removing a specific quantum state in a bipartite quantum system. They called this phenomenon minimal nonlocality. It is obvious that minimal nonlocality effectively reflects the lower boundary of the elements contained in a nonlocal set of OPSs. In this paper, we generalize the methods of constructing nonlocal sets with minimal nonlocality from bipartite systems to multipartite systems and from orthogonal product states to entangled states. First, we give a method to construct a set of OPSs with minimal nonlocality in the quantum system, and then we extend it to the quantum system for and . In addition, we give a method to construct a nonlocal set of orthogonal states with entanglement relations in the quantum system, and we prove that this set has minimal nonlocality, which can also be extended to the quantum system.},

We also show how bounded light cones can emerge through suitable perturbations in Kitaev's toric code and honeycomb model.

While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous-variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.},

A set of observables based on the Bloch basis is constructed and employed to train the system to recognize unseen features. To assess the protocol's robustness, noise is introduced into the input states, and the system's performance under these noisy conditions is analyzed.

It indicates that the alternating unitary method may be able to find good approximate solutions in quantum annealing applied to hard instances.},

  abstract     = {Nontrivial spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems can give rise to intriguing effects that lack counterparts in Hermitian systems. For instance, when dynamically varying system parameters along a path enclosing an exceptional point (EP), chiral mode conversion occurs. A recent study [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 , 113802 (2024) ] demonstrates the achievability of pure adiabatic state transfer by specifically selecting a trajectory in the system parameter space where the corresponding evolution operator exhibits a real spectrum while winding around an EP. However, the intended adiabatic state transfer becomes fragile when taking into account the effect of the nonadiabatic transition. In this work, we propose a scheme for achieving robust and rapid adiabatic state transfer in time-modulated two-level non-Hermitian systems by appropriately modulating the system Hamiltonian and time-evolution trajectory. Numerical simulations confirm that a complete adiabatic transfer can always be achieved even under nonadiabatic conditions after one period for different initialized adiabatic states, and the scheme remains insensitive to moderate fluctuations in control parameters. Therefore, this scheme offers alternative approaches for quantum-state engineering in non-Hermitian systems.},

It has recently been shown that every BPQS has an associated Kochen-Specker (KS) set. Here, we first prove that any BPQS of minimum input cardinality that can be obtained from a generalized KS set can also be obtained from a KS set of pure states. We address the problem of finding BPQSs of small input cardinality starting from KS sets. We introduce an algorithm that identifies the BPQS with the minimum number of settings for any given KS set. We apply it to many well-known KS sets of small cardinality in dimensions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. In each dimension, the algorithm either recovers the best BPQS known or finds one with fewer inputs.},

  abstract     = {Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a crucial subroutine in many quantum algorithms. It is used to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary operator acting on a target quantum system. Conventional QPE is often expensive to implement because it requires a large number of ancilla qubits and the ability to perform quantum Fourier transform. Recent developments in iterative QPE reduce the implementation cost by repetitive uses of a single ancilla and classical postprocessing. However, both conventional and iterative schemes often require preparation of the target system in an eigenstate of the unitary operator, while it remains ambiguous to achieve QPE of multiple eigenvalues with no need of initial-state preparation. Here we clarify this issue by developing a theoretical framework based on sequential quantum channels for iterative QPE. We find that QPE of multiple eigenvalues can be efficiently realized for arbitrary initial target system state by actively utilizing the measurement backaction of iterative QPE on the target system with a long coherence time. Specifically, we investigate two iterative QPE schemes based on sequential Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) of an ancilla qubit: (a) the repetitive scheme, which conducts repetitive RIMs to achieve the standard quantum limit in estimating the eigenvalues; (b) the adaptive scheme, which adjusts the parameters of each RIM based on prior measurement outcomes to attain the Heisenberg limit. In both schemes, sequential ancilla measurements generate sequential quantum channels on the target system, gradually steering it to the eigenstates of the estimated unitary operator, while the measurement statistics of the ancilla can reveal the embedded information about its eigenvalues with proper postprocessing. We demonstrate the analysis by simulating a central spin model and evaluate the performance and noise resilience of both schemes.},

  abstract     = {We present a fast and robust protocol for realizing topological quantum state transfer in a dimeric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger spin chain. By giving a more general condition sufficient for the resonant adiabatic evolution, we develop a method of constructing time-driving functions for topological quantum state transfer, which makes it possible to shorten the needed operation time via resonant adiabatic passage between topologically protected edge states. Compared with previous protocols, our protocol can shorten the operation time appreciably while maintaining robustness against disorder in the spin chain, thereby avoiding decoherence resulting from long-running evolution and increasing transmission efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our protocol possesses excellent robustness and scalability. Our results provide a promising route for the realization of fast and robust quantum state transfer in spin chain systems.},

  abstract     = {We consider non-Gaussian states generated by photon subtraction (PS) and photon addition (PA) on two-mode squeezed coherent (TMSC) states as resource states for continuous variable quantum teleportation. To this end, we derive the Wigner characteristic function for the family of photon-subtracted and photon-added TMSC states, which is then utilized to calculate the fidelity of teleporting a single-mode coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state. The analysis shows that, while symmetric PS enhances the fidelity of teleportation in an extensive range of squeezing, asymmetric PS enhances the performance marginally and only in the low squeezing regime. The addition operations, however, are less useful, symmetric three-PA leads to a marginal improvement while the other addition operations are useless. We consider the actual experimental setup for PS and PA operations and compute their success probabilities, which should be kept in mind while advocating the use of these operations. We could compute the fidelity of teleportation for a broad range of states because we analytically derive the Wigner characteristic function for these family of states, which we think will be useful for various other applications of these families of states.},

However, the control of the phonon hopping remains difficult because it proceeds among all the local modes through the Coulomb coupling. We propose a method to cancel the phonon hopping among a given set of local modes by applying a sequence of phase shift gates implemented through the modulation of the trap potential. We analyze the error scaling in the algorithm to treat three or more modes and show that the error can be suppressed by repeating the pulse sequence. The duration of the phase shift gate in the present method can be as short as a few microseconds, which is an order of magnitude faster than the laser-based method. This short duration of the phase shift gate facilitates the suppression of the gate error. We finally show how the present method can be applied to the implementation of the beam splitter. The present method can also be applied to the simulation of bosonic systems as well as to the continuous variable encoding of quantum computing using trapped ions.},

The two densities measure the local distinguishability of quantum states and its corresponding quantum resources, respectively. Strikingly, the efficiency is intrinsic in the sense of invariance under reparametrization. Specific to two-level systems, the efficiency is highly anisotropic and has a tetrahedral symmetry.

For these models a genuine charging process can only occur in the transient regime. Indeed, unless the interaction with the environment is cut off, the asymptotic energy of the battery is solely determined by the environment and does not depend on the initial energy of the electromagnetic field. We numerically estimate the fundamental figures of merit for the model, including the time at which the battery reaches its maximum ergotropy, the average energy, and the energy that needs to be used to switch the battery-charger interaction on and off. Depending on the scaling of the coupling between the battery and the charger, we show that the model can still exhibit a subextensive charging time. However, for the Dicke battery, this effect comes with a higher cost when switching the battery-charger interaction on and off. We also show that as the number of battery constituents increases, both the Dicke and Tavis-Cummings models become asymptotically free, meaning the amount of energy that is not unitarily extractable becomes negligible. We obtain this result numerically and demonstrate analytically that it is a consequence of the symmetry under permutations of the model. Finally, we perform simulations for different values of the detuning, showing that the optimal regime for the Dicke battery is off-resonance, in contrast with what is observed in the Tavis-Cummings case.},

  abstract     = {Among the surprising features of quantum measurements, the problem of distinguishing and antidistinguishing general quantum measurements is fundamentally appealing. Unlike classical systems, quantum theory offers entangled states and peculiar state update rule of the postmeasurement state, which gives rise to four distinct scenarios for distinguishing (and antidistinguishing) quantum measurements: (i) probing single systems and without access to the postmeasurement states, (ii) probing entangled systems and without access to the postmeasurement states, (iii) probing single systems with access to the postmeasurement states, and (iv) probing entangled systems with access to the postmeasurement states. In these scenarios, we consider the probability of distinguishing (and antidistinguishing) quantum measurements sampled from a given set in the single-shot regime. For some scenarios, we provide the analytical expressions of distinguishability (and antidistinguishability) for qubit projective measurements. We show that the distinguishability of any pair of qubit projective measurements in scenario (iii) is always greater than its values in scenario (ii). Interestingly, we find certain pairs of qubit nonprojective measurements for which the optimal distinguishability in scenario (ii) is achieved using a nonmaximally entangled state. It turns out that, for any set of measurements, distinguishability (and antidistinguishability) in scenario (i) is always less than or equal to in any other scenario, while it reaches its highest possible value in scenario (iv). We establish that the relations form a strict hierarchy, and there is no hierarchical relation between scenarios (ii) and (iii). In particular, we introduce different variants of the well-known “trine” qubit measurement to construct pairs (and triples) of qubit quantum measurements such that they are perfectly distinguishable (and antidistinguishable) in scenario (ii) but not in scenario (iii) and vice versa. Additionally, we present qubit measurements that are perfectly distinguishable (and antidistinguishable) in scenario (iv) but not in any other scenario.},

In this paper, we first derive some general results regarding the lower bound of estimated precision for a dissipative parameter, which is nonunitarily encoded in open systems, by combining the law of error propagation and the non-Hermitian linear response theory. This lower bound is related to the correlation of the encoding dissipative operator and the evolution time. We next demonstrate the utility of our general results by considering three different kinds of nonunitary encoding processes, including particle loss, relaxation, and dephasing. We finally compare the lower bound with the quantum Fisher information obtained by tomography and find they are consistent in the regime where the non-Hermitian linear response applies. This lower bound can guide us to find the optimal initial states and detecting operators to significantly simplify the measurement process.},

Monitoring is performed by repeated projective measurements with respect to a single quantum state. Our constructive approach is based on a mapping from a set of energy levels and an eigenvector basis onto the monitored evolution matrix. The eigenvalues of the latter are distributed over the complex unit disk and the corresponding transition probabilities decay quickly in the quantum Zeno regime at frequent measurements. A localized basis favors the return to the initial state, while a delocalized basis favors transitions between different states.

Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, applied for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that, even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems.},

The success rate is the standard quantifier of resourcefulness for this task, while robustness-based quantifiers are as operationally motivated and have known general properties. In this work we leverage analytical and numerical tools to estimate robustness of contextuality in POM scenarios under different types of noise. We conclude that for the 3-to-1 case, robustness of contextuality to depolarization as well as a minimization of robustness of contextuality to dephasing over all bases are good quantifiers for the nonclassical advantage of this scenario. Moreover, we obtain a general relation between robustness of contextuality to depolarization and the success rate in any -to-1 POM scenario and show how it can be used to bound the number of bits encoded in this task.},

Conversely, when the system deviates from , the quasidisorder sets in, leading to increased dissipative effects due to the broken of periodicity.

The results reveal that the topological re-entrant phase transition emerges. Through the analysis of a real-space winding number, we divide the emergent topological re-entrant phase transitions into two types. The first is the re-entrant phase transition from the traditional topological insulator phase into the topological Anderson insulator phase, and the second is the re-entrant phenomenon from one topological Anderson insulator phase into another topological Anderson insulator phase. These two types of re-entrant phase transitions correspond to bounded and unbounded cases of quasiperiodic modulation, respectively. Furthermore, we verify the above topological re-entrant phase transitions by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and bulk gap.

  abstract     = {Manipulating the dynamics of open quantum systems is a crucial requirement for large-scale quantum computers. Finding ways to overcome or extend decoherence times is a challenging task. Already at the level of a single two-level atom, its reduced dynamics with respect to a larger environment can be very complex. Structured environments, for instance, can lead to various regimes other than memoryless Markovian spontaneous emission. Here, we consider an atom coupled to an array of coupled cavities in the presence of on-site correlated disorder. The correlation is long-ranged and associated with the trace of a fractional Brownian motion following a power-law spectrum. With the cavity modes playing the role of the environment, we study the dynamics of the spontaneous emission. We observe a change from non-Markovian to Markovian decay in the presence of disorder by tuning the correlation parameter. This is associated with a localization-delocalization transition involving the field modes. Two dissipative models that effectively reproduce the behavior of the non-Markovianity are discussed. The dissipation dynamics of the atom can thus be used to extract information about the phase of the environment. Our results provide a direction in the engineering of disordered quantum systems to function as controllable reservoirs.},

  abstract     = {System-bath correlations play a pivotal role in the study of open quantum systems and have emerged as an important feature in distinguishing between quantum and classical behavior in energy transfer and spectroscopy. A variety of classical models have been constructed to test the limits of purely classical mechanics to capture such effects and, thus, by elimination to identify features that are unique to quantum systems. Yet numerical modeling in such classical frameworks has been largely limited to perturbative approximations, leaving some doubt regarding the extent to which these models are capable of capturing system-bath correlation effects. To overcome this gap, we here apply the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework to examine dynamics under a “classical density matrix” framework that follows strictly Newtonian dynamics. Under the assumption of a Drude-Lorenz spectral density, we show that the resulting HEOM framework becomes identical to the stochastic Liouville equation. By comparing numerically exact dynamical simulations under this model with various “flavors” of the quantum HEOM formalism and with experimental absorption and fluorescence data, we examine the various roles that system-bath interactions play in thermalization and spectroscopic line-shape functions. Although the numerically exact classical simulations do reveal transient system-bath correlations, these are generally weaker than their quantum counterparts and vanish as the system approaches thermal equilibrium to produce a factorized equipartition state. For experimentally relevant parameters, we find that the classical treatment provides a fairly accurate treatment of absorption spectroscopy but that loss of the quantum detailed balance condition leads to a (sometimes dramatic) failure in describing fluorescence spectra.},

  abstract     = {Quantum maps are fundamental to quantum information theory and open quantum systems. Covariant or weakly symmetric quantum maps, in particular, play a key role in defining quantum evolutions that respect thermodynamics, establish free operations in resource theories, and are consistent with transformations of quantum reference frames. To implement quantum maps in the laboratory, one typically engineers a physical dilation, which corresponds to a unitary evolution entangling the system with an environment . This work systematically explores how weak symmetries of quantum maps manifest in their dilations. We demonstrate that for various classes of physical dilations, including Hamiltonian-driven dilations and short-time collision models that simulate Markovian open quantum dynamics, weak symmetries always lead to strong symmetries in the dilated evolution, resulting in conserved quantities in the system-environment space. We also characterize the subspace where these symmetries arise using Krylov subspaces. Moreover, we show that some different types of physical dilations have no constraints on the dilated evolution, requiring no strong symmetry. Finally, we complement our findings with a variety of illustrative and pedagogical examples. Our results provide essential guidelines for constructing physical dilations of quantum maps, offering a comprehensive understanding of how symmetries shape their implementations in a laboratory or on a quantum computer.},

We answer this question positively by bounding various one-shot classical capacities via different energy transmission tasks. Such bounds provide the physical implication that in the one-shot regime, transmitting 𝑛 bits of classical information is equivalent to 𝑛 × 𝑘 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ l n ⁡ 2 transmitted energy. Unexpectedly, these bounds further uncover a dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between transmitting (rather than erasing ) information and energy.

Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable unraveling parameter —interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators—the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.},

As is well known, the updated state at intermediate times is frame dependent and outcome randomness, intrinsic to projective measurements, prevents any information from being acquired on the updated state. Here we will see that when weak measurements are implemented there is instead an interplay between randomness and interference, depending on the number of qubits, so as to maintain consistency between descriptions in arbitrary reference frames. Analytical results are given for a small or infinite number of qubits, while for a finite number of qubits we resort to Monte Carlo sampling in order to simulate numerically the results of weak measurements. As a by-product, we show how a single-shot measurement of the pointers' positions allows us to make quantitative predictions on the outcomes that can be obtained for any observable measured on a distant qubit of the multipartite state.},

This operator is obtained from the full density operator of the composite system involving the system itself, the bath, and the correlations between them, by performing a partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The entanglement between the system and the bath leads to a generalized Liouville evolution that involves, among other things, dissipation and decoherence of the system. In a similar fashion, the time evolution of a physical observable in a classically constrained dynamical system is governed by a generalization of the Liouville equation, in which the usual Poisson bracket is replaced by the so-called Dirac bracket. The generalization takes into account the reduction in the phase space of the system because of constraints that arise either because they are introduced by hand or because of singular Lagrangians. We derive an intriguing but precise classical-quantum correspondence between the aforementioned situations which connects the Lindblad operators to the constraints. The correspondence is illustrated in the ubiquitous example of coupled simple harmonic oscillators studied earlier in various contexts such as quantum optics, dissipative quantum systems, Brownian motion, and the area law for the entropy of black holes.},

We believe that these analyses are the first to suggest that a cavity has an optimal length for the atom-photon gate, providing a fundamental guideline for implementing quantum information processing.},

  abstract     = {We derive a model for a single-mode laser that includes all two-particle quantum correlations between photons and electrons. In contrast to the predictions of semiclassical models, we find that lasing takes place in the presence of quantum bistability between a nonlasing and a nonclassical coherent state. The coherent state is characterized by a central frequency and a finite linewidth and emerges with finite amplitude from a saddle-node bifurcation together with an unstable coherent state. Hence coherent emission in nanolasers originates through a mixing of lasing and nonlasing states. In the limit of a macrolaser with a large number of emitters and nonresonant modes, the laser threshold approaches the prediction of the semiclassical theory, but with the important difference that lasing can be achieved only in the presence of finite-size perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van der Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van der Waals interactions between two Rydberg states, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. On the triangular lattice with repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase with a critical entropy per particle S / N ≈ 0.19 accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We further demonstrate the experimental feasibility by identifying pairs of Rydberg states in Rb 87 realizing the required interactions. Such a lattice supersolid is long lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for hundreds of particles allowing one to directly probe the defect-induced picture of supersolids. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.},

Guided by this mechanism, we design a setup of alkaline-earth-metal atoms to create a spin-orbit-coupled optical lattice, where we identify a triplefold degenerate state with a period-3 coplanar spin ordering within the deep Mott-insulating phase region of the ground-state phase diagram. The state is protected by a finite gap, and its characteristic angle can be finely tuned by specific setup parameters. Moreover, we use the Rabi spectroscopy technique to detect the state. Our work not only shows the feasibility of achieving a period-3 structure via the new mechanism but also suggests its potential applications for exploring other periodic structures in optical lattices.},

Although a recent experiment [R. J. Fletcher et al. , Science 372 , 1318 (2021) ] has realized the geometrically squeezed state of the guiding-center mode, the remaining degree of freedom, the cyclotron mode, remains unsqueezed due to the large energy gap of the Landau levels. To overcome this limitation, in this Letter, we propose a Floquet-based state-preparation protocol by periodically driving an anisotropic potential. This protocol not only facilitates single-cyclotron-mode squeezing, but also enables two-mode squeezing. Such two-mode squeezing offers a richer set of dynamics compared to single-mode squeezing and can achieve a wave-packet width well below the lowest-Landau-level limit. Our work provides a highly controllable knob for realizing diverse geometrically squeezed states in ultracold quantum gases within the quantum Hall regime.},

We document the spatial and temporal origin of the localized hole, which is initiated via strong-field tunnel ionization in the halogen end of the molecule and near the peak of the laser electric field. In bromobutadiyne, we find a range of wavelengths around 1500 nm that consistently leads to the initiation of high-contrast CM. In addition, we show that the inclusion of Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics does not disrupt the creation of the localized hole, nor the subsequent CM motion, in bromobutadiyne or para bromoaniline.},

  abstract     = {Recent measurements of the ionization energies of the Rydberg P 1 states of helium for principal quantum number n = 24 and higher present a new challenge to theoretical atomic physics. A long-standing obstacle to high-precision atomic theory for three-body systems is a rapid loss of accuracy for variational calculations with increasing principal quantum number n . We show that this problem can be overcome with the use of a “triple” basis set in Hylleraas coordinates. Nonrelativistic energies accurate to 23 significant figures are obtained with basis sets of relatively modest size (6744 terms). Relativistic and quantum electrodynamic effects are calculated, including an estimate of terms of order m α 6 from a 1 / n 3 extrapolation, resulting in an estimated accuracy of ± 1 kHz. The calculated ionization energy of 5 704 980.348(1) MHz is in excellent agreement with the experimental value 5 704 980.312(95) MHz. These results establish the ionization energy of the 1 s 24 p P 1 1 state as an absolute point of reference for transitions to lower-lying states, and they confirm an 11 σ disagreement between theory and experiment in the triplet spectrum of helium. Results are also given for the 1 s 24 p P J 3 states, in agreement with a recent experiment on the triplet Rydberg series, thereby confirming the discrepancy. Results are also given for the 1 s 24 p 3 P J states which are in agreement with a recent experiment on the triplet- P Rydberg series, thereby confirming a discrepancy of 0.468 ± 0.055 MHz for the ionization energy of the 1 s 2 s 3 S 1 state.},

In this Letter, we present an example entanglement transition occurring in a system comprised of a one-dimensional (1D) chain of qubits evolving under a random brickwork circuit. After each layer, a fraction p of sites undergo noisy quantum transduction in which quantum information is transferred to a quantum computer but at the cost of introducing noise from an environment. For an entanglement transition to occur, we argue that the environment must obtain the same amount of information as gained by the computer. Under this condition, the circuit shows a transition from volume law to area law entanglement as the rate p is increased above a critical threshold. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-data collection to induce entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework for emergent entanglement phenomena in protocols relevant to quantum machine learning.},

The practical benefits originate from tuning the ancillary gauge degrees of freedom to enhance the quantum algorithm's original functionality in the system registry. For simple but nontrivial short-ranged, infinite long-ranged transverse-field Ising models, and the hydrogen molecule model after qubit encoding, we show improvement in the time to solution by one hundred percent but with higher accuracy through exact state-vector numerical simulation in a digital-analog setting.

We also observe periodic oscillations in the heat absorption and the efficiency of the Stirling QHE, indicating the involvement of quantum coherence in the engine cycles.

  abstract     = {Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibriumlike steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose laboratory-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency, and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.},

  abstract     = {Random number generators play an essential role in cryptography and key distribution. It is thus important to verify whether the random numbers generated from these devices are genuine and unpredictable by any adversary. Recently, quantum nonlocality has been identified as a resource that can be utilized to certify randomness. Although these schemes are device independent and thus highly secure, the observation of quantum nonlocality is extremely difficult from a practical perspective. In this work, we provide a scheme to certify unbounded randomness in a semi-device-independent way based on the maximal violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities. Interestingly, the scheme is independent of the choice of the quantum state and consequently even classical noise like a thermal state or even microwave background radiation could be utilized to self-test quantum measurements and generate unbounded randomness, making the scheme highly efficient for practical purposes.},

  abstract     = {Our article described an experiment that adjudicates between different causal accounts of Bell inequality violations by a comparison of their predictive power, finding that certain types of models that are structurally radical but parametrically conservative—of which a class of superdeterministic models are an example—overfit the data relative to models that are structurally conservative but parametrically radical in the sense of endorsing an intrinsically quantum generalization of the framework of causal modeling. In their comment [ Phys. Rev. A 109 , 026201 (2024) ], Hance and Hossenfelder argue that we have misrepresented the purpose of superdeterministic models. We here dispute this claim by recalling the different classes of superdeterministic models we defined in our article and our conclusions regarding which of these are disfavored by our experimental results. Their confusion on this point seems to have arisen in part from the fact that we characterized superdeterministic models within a causal modeling framework and from the fact that we referred to this framework as “classical” in order to contrast it with an intrinsically quantum alternative. In this Reply, therefore, we take the opportunity to clarify these points. They also claim that if one is adjudicating between a pair of models, where one model can account for strictly more operational statistics than the other, the first model will tend to overfit the data relative to the second. Because this model inclusion relation can arise for pairs of models in a reductionist hierarchy, they conclude that overfitting should not be taken as evidence against the first model. We point out here that, contrary to this claim, one does not expect overfitting to arise generically in cases of model inclusion, so that it is indeed sometimes appropriate to consider overfitting as a criterion for adjudicating between such models.},

Using a variational mean-field approach, we analyze the system's critical behavior and derive analytical expressions that reveal a threshold for the mechanical coupling. Below this threshold, the system allows for higher atomic-radiation couplings before resonant damping occurs, thereby extending the superradiant region compared to a single-cavity optomechanical Dicke model. Additionally, we examine the behavior of relevant observables across all regions of the phase diagram. Our findings suggest that these observables provide a more accurate characterization of the system's critical behavior than the traditionally used coupling parameters.},

Here we investigate coherent competition and control between three-wave mixing (TWM) and four-wave mixing (FWM) in a cyclic Δ -type three-level superconducting quantum system. In the weak control-field regime, strong competition leads to an alternating oscillation between TWM and FWM signals and this oscillation is a signature of strong energy exchange between these two nonlinear processes. In particular, such oscillation is absent from conventional multiwave mixing in atomic systems. Surprisingly, synchronous TWM and FWM processes are demonstrated in the strong control-field regime and, at the same time, their efficiencies can be as high as 42 and 47%, respectively. Our paper shows that these competitive behaviors between TWM and FWM can be manipulated by tuning the control-field intensity.},

It was shown that the main factor that limits the sensitivity of the considered scheme is the interplay of optical losses and the nonlinear self-phase modulation (SPM) effect. Here we show that using the intracavity squeezing of the probe beam in this scheme, it is possible to cancel out the SPM effect. In this case, the sensitivity will be limited only by the available power in the pump beam and by the input/output losses in the signal beam. Our estimates show that using the best optical microresonators currently available, the sensitivity for the intracavity photon number approaching the single-photon one can be achieved. Therefore, this scheme could be of interest for optical quantum information processing tasks.},

The simulated cavity consists of two perfectly conducting mirrors and a dielectric membrane of infinitesimal depth that effectively couples two cavities. The total length of the double cavity , the difference in length between the two cavities , and the electric susceptibility and conductivity of the dielectric membrane are tunable parameters. All four parameters are treated as independent and are allowed to be tuned at the same time, even with different frequencies. We analyze the cavity's energy spectra under different conditions, finding a transition between two distinct regimes that is accurately described by . In particular, a lowest-energy mode is forbidden in one of the regimes while it is allowed in the other. We compare analytical approximations obtained through the multiple-scale analysis method with exact numerical solutions, obtaining the typical results when is not being tuned. However, when the susceptibility is tuned, different behaviors (such as oscillations in the number of photons of a cavity prepared in a vacuum state) can arise if the frequencies and amplitudes of all parameters are adequate. These oscillations might be considered as adiabatic shortcuts where all generated photons are eventually destroyed.},

With the trapped electrons on liquid helium, we specifically demonstrate its feasibility. In addition to the calculation of the von Neumann entropy for the entanglement witness, we show that the generated path-entanglement photons can be experimentally tested by simply measuring the distinguishability of the spontaneously emitted spectra of the photons being detected by the left and right single-photon detectors.

Assuming the qubit is initially prepared in a superposition state and the two oscillators are in arbitrary Fock states, we analytically trace the temporal evolution of this tripartite pure initial state. We identify four broad cases, each further divided into two subcases, and derive exact analytical solutions for most cases. Notably, we obtain perfect transfer of excitations between the oscillators by carefully selecting system parameters. In addition, we extensively examine the manner in which the nonclassicalities of various initial oscillator Fock states, quantified by the volume of negative regions in the associated Wigner functions, evolve under the MPJC Hamiltonian, considering diverse system parameters including environmental effects. Besides producing substantial enhancements in the initial value for higher-photon-number states, our analysis reveals that driven solely by the initial qubit energy, with both oscillators initialized in the vacuum state, the nonlinear MPJC interaction yields a significant amount of nontrivial Wigner negativity in the oscillators. The additional nonlinearity introduced by the multiphoton process plays a pivotal role in surpassing the initial nonclassicalities of the photon-number states.},

  abstract     = {Tripartite entanglement as a remarkable resource in quantum information science has been extensively investigated in hybrid quantum systems, whereas it is generally weak and prone to be suppressed by noise, restricting its practical application in quantum technologies. Here, we propose how to enhance the tripartite entanglement among magnons, photons, and phonons in a hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanical system by exploiting a synergistic effect of the optical parametric amplification (OPA) and mechanical parametric amplification (MPA). We find that in the case of individually applying the OPA or MPA, the tripartite entanglement can be enhanced by several folds. Remarkably, upon suitably tuning the phase matching of the two parametric fields presented simultaneously, the strengths of the entanglement can be further enhanced due to the constructive interference between the OPA and MPA. We also show that our method can improve the robustness of the entanglement against thermal noise. Our work provides a promising method for manipulating the entanglement with easy tunability and may serve as a useful tool for the enhancement and protection of fragile quantum resources.},

  abstract     = {Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled states in continuous variable systems, which have broad applications in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a photon-phonon squeezing protocol assisted by a Kerr magnon within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. We construct an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for photon-phonon squeezing through strong photon-magnon interaction and modulation over the driving on the photon mode. The effective Hamiltonian can be confirmed by the diagonalization of the system's Liouvillian superoperator. With the effective Hamiltonian and quantum Langevin equation, we provide a rigorous theoretical solution for the dynamical process of squeezing generation. Our finding indicates that the asymptotic stationary squeezing can be obtained by optimizing the squeezing quadrature operator, even when the covariance matrix of the system still varies with time. This squeezing level can exceed the maximum value under stable conditions. Moreover, our analysis reveals that a proper Kerr nonlinearity of the magnon can further promote the squeezing generation. Our work provides an extendable framework for generating squeezed states of two Gaussian modes with indirect coupling.},

  abstract     = {Quantum optics with giant atoms provides a new approach for implementing optical memory devices at the atomic scale. Here, we theoretically investigate the relaxation dynamics of a single driven three-level atom interacting with a one-dimensional waveguide via two coupling points. Under certain conditions, after long-time dynamics, we find that the population of the giant atom can either remain stable or exhibit regular periodic oscillations, while photons are trapped within the region of the giant atom. This phenomenon cannot be realized using a two-level atom configured with two coupling points. It is noteworthy that the atomic excitation probability of a stable bound state is a constant value, which is determined by the size of the atom. Importantly, the size of the atom, defined as the distance between the two coupling points, is significantly larger than the wavelength of the light field, which is a necessary condition for the existence of oscillating bound states.},

  abstract     = {Active atomic clocks are predicted to provide far better short-term stability and robustness against thermal fluctuations than typical feedback-based optical atomic clocks. However, continuous laser operation using an ensemble of clock atoms still remains an experimentally challenging task. We study spatial self-organization in a transversely driven ensemble of clock atoms inside an optical resonator and coherent light emission from the cavity. We focus on the spectral properties of the emitted light in the narrow atomic linewidth regime, where the phase coherence providing frequency stability is stored in the atomic dipoles rather than the cavity field. The atoms are off-resonantly driven by a standing-wave coherent laser transversely to the cavity axis, allowing for atomic motion along the cavity axis as well as along the pump. In order to treat larger atom numbers we employ a second-order cumulant expansion which allows us to calculate the spectrum of the cavity light field. We identify the self-organization threshold where the atoms align themselves in a checkerboard pattern, thus maximizing light scattering into the cavity, which simultaneously induces cooling. For a larger driving intensity, more atoms are transferred to the excited state, reducing cooling but increasing light emission from the excited atoms. This can be enhanced via a second cavity mode at the atomic frequency spatially shifted by a quarter wavelength. For large enough atom numbers we observe laser-like emission close to the bare atomic transition frequency.},

Rev. Lett. 128 , 083601 (2022) . Here we provide an extended investigation of this effect, in which we detail the experimental procedure and the variation of the quantum correlation with various parameters of the system. Particularly, we show that the decay rate of the quantum correlations changes with the number of atoms in the sample, providing another indication of its superradiance-like nature. The nonclassical aspects of the signal occur for short timescales, but the long timescales carry as well a lot of information on the classical correlations of the system. This slow classical regime presents also two clearly distinct timescales, which we explain by two different pathways for the creation of biphotons. From the global analysis of the data in all its timescales, we are able to derive an empirical expression to fit the data, resulting in information on, among other parameters, the sample's temperature and superradiant-like acceleration. In general, the reported quantum correlations present a dependence on critical parameters of the system, such as optical depth and excitation power, that is quite different from other systems used for biphoton generation, and are more robust to changes in these parameters. This opens the possibility of exploring this process for efficient generation of narrow-band biphotons or of other quantum-correlated photonic states of higher order.},

One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such -symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides, even without noise.

A periodic dielectric layer can totally reflect a plane incident wave with a particular frequency and a particular wave number. Existing FP-BICs are found when is close to the values deduced from a phase-matching condition related to the reflection coefficient, but they are obtained in FP cavities where the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the periodic direction. In this paper, we further clarify the connection between total reflections and FP-BICs. Our numerical results indicate that if the wave number is zero or the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the periodic direction, FP-BICs can indeed be found near the parameters of total reflections. However, if the wave number is nonzero and the periodic layer is asymmetric (in the periodic direction), we are unable to find a FP-BIC (with a frequency and a wave number near those of a total reflection) by tuning or other structural parameters. Consequently, a total reflection does not always lead to a FP-BIC even when the parameters of the FP cavity are tuned.},

  abstract     = {Ruling a wide range of phenomena, dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) are typically constrained to the short range due to their rapid decay with increasing dipole separations, limiting performance in long-range applications. By judiciously designing the photonic structures that control the two-point Green's functions of the electromagnetic environment, the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (luminescence) and their interactions (e.g., Förster energy transfer) can be conveniently tuned. In this paper, we design a matched nanoparticle-on-mirror antenna pair with enhanced DDI guided by surface plasmon polaritons confined to the metal substrate, which ensures concentrated and enhanced interaction over long ranges of tens of wavelengths. The long-range ( ) DDI between donor-acceptor emitters is enhanced by times respective to bare gold film, and times respective to a vacuum. Our result provides a promising testbed for investigating long-range DDI phenomena on the nanoscale.},

  abstract     = {Optomechanics with semi-transparent membrane multioscillators in a high-finesse cavity is an established solution for designing the dispersive interaction, and reaching many achievements, such as the study of nonlinear dynamics, heat transfer, and so on. The multioscillators are dielectric slabs, usually with low reflectivity, constituting an etalon. Here we propose the theoretical and experimental investigation of a low-finesse optical cavity formed by two (nominally identical) parallel semi-transparent membranes. The experiment consists in laser-driving the cavity, detecting interferometrically the field reflected by the etalon, and measuring the intensity of the transmitted field, for different distances within the two membranes. A complete characterization of the membrane sandwich is provided. Moreover, we develop an analytical model to describe the fields, which reproduces all the experimental results, under specific approximations. As expected, the model reproduces the known results when high-reflectivity, and/or fixed mirrors conditions are restored. This work paves the way for a complete and analytical model to describe multi-oscillators “membrane-in-the-middle” optomechanics.},

We show that by choosing a suitable sign and amplitude for the quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC), one can achieve enhanced and thermally robust stationary bipartite entanglement between the subsystems, improved mechanical ground-state cooling, and -quadrature squeezing of the mechanical mode beyond the 3-dB limit of squeezing. In particular, we find that in the presence of QOC with negative sign and in the resolved sideband regime the bipartite optical-mechanical entanglement can be increased by about 2 orders of magnitude around the temperature of 1 mK, and it can be preserved against thermal noise up to the ambient temperature of 0.1 K. Furthermore, the QOC with positive sign can give rise to the enhancement of the mechanical ground-state cooling by about 1 order of magnitude in the optical and microwave red-detuned regime. We also find that for the positive sign of QOC and near the microwave resonance frequency the squeezing degree of the quadrature of the mechanical mode can be amplified up to 15 dB. Such a hybrid electro-optomechanical system can serve as a promising platform to engineer an improved entangled source for quantum sensing as well as quantum information processing.},

It is well known that atoms subject to optical vortex modes experience both translational and rotational forces acting on the atomic center of mass, leading to atom dynamics and atom trapping. Here we consider the optical forces on atoms immersed in general paraxial higher-order Poincaré optical vector modes. The coupling to atoms gives rise to wide-ranging scenarios involving such modes in which any specific polarization is within a spectrum of wave polarization and all the interactions are treatable within a single formulation. We show that this gives rise to a variety of physical situations, governed by the mode order , the polarization represented by the angular coordinates of the mode on the surface of the unit Poincaré sphere, the atomic transitions involved, and their selection rules. We present the analytical steps leading to the optical forces on sodium atoms and display their variations in various situations.},

Such a separate model corresponds to a richer phase diagram compared to that in which all modes are immersed in a common gain medium, in particular containing a second-order phase transition: the excited oscillator changes its behavior from suppression to absorption of the other oscillator's energy, leading to an obvious cooling by heating phenomenon. The mode competition phase transition also has a good correspondence with the synchronization phenomenon between the self-sustaining dynamics of the phonon modes. Finally, we discuss that the mode competition will be weakened as more modes are present in the system. Our work provides a foundation for related studies such as the self-sustaining dynamics of multibodies with complex structures.},

We focus on the regime close to the optomechanical resonance, where the atoms' refractive index shifts the cavity into resonance, assuming fast cavity relaxation. We derive an effective model for the atomic motion, where the cavity degrees of freedom are eliminated using perturbation theory in the atom-cavity coupling and benchmark its predictions using numerical simulations based on the full model. Away from the optomechanical resonance, perturbation theory in the lowest order (adiabatic elimination) reliably describes the dynamics and predicts chaotic phases with unstable oscillations. Interestingly, the dynamics close to the optomechanical resonance are qualitatively captured only by including the corrections to next order (nonadiabatic corrections). In this regime we find limit-cycle phases that describe stable oscillations of the density with a well-defined frequency. We further show that such limit-cycle solutions are metastable configurations of the adiabatic model. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms that are required to observe dynamical phases and predict their existence in atom-cavity systems where a substantial timescale separation is present.},

In particular, we also discover perfect unidirectional transmission, i.e., the transmission in the opposite direction is completely blocked, and fast-slow light switching by appropriately regulating pump fields, which is optimal for signal isolation and controllable group advance-delay switching. Therefore, our proposed nonreciprocal photonic transistor is an excellent multifunctional device with various amplification-attenuation transmission and fast-slow light nonreciprocities.

  abstract     = {Generally, a gradient force draws a dielectric sphere towards the region of high light intensity. However, this force may repel the sphere when a Rayleigh particle's effective polarizability has a negative real part, or when a dielectric sphere's whispering gallery modes (WGMs) are excited. For a dielectric sphere larger than a Rayleigh particle but not large enough to excite WGMs, the possibility of experiencing this “anomalous” gradient force remains uncertain. Our study employs multipole expansion theory to investigate gradient forces on a dielectric sphere in an evanescent wave. We find that the sphere may be pushed away from the high-intensity region regardless of WGM excitation, due to multipole-incident field coupling. However, the underlying mechanisms differ. For an -polarized incident evanescent wave, WGM excitation limits the contribution to the gradient force from a specific order of multipole. The gradient force is notably stronger for transverse magnetic mode excitation compared to transverse electric mode, due to differences in the electromagnetic energy density gradient's contribution. Without WGMs, multiple multipoles—interestingly, only magnetic ones—contribute to this gradient force. We provide an intuitive explanation for the dielectric sphere experiencing gradient forces in opposite directions by analyzing internal field distributions and the optical force density within the sphere. Additionally, we explore how evanescent wave decay rates and polarizations influence gradient forces by analyzing recoil forces and imaginary Poynting momentum density contributions. These in-depth studies deepen our understanding of near-field optical manipulation mechanisms and provide a theoretical foundation for designing innovative optical devices and systems.},

  abstract     = {The method proposed by Khairulin et al. [ JETP Lett. 117 , 652 (2023) ] for converting the linearly polarized radiation of high-order harmonics of an optical field into the circularly polarized in an optically modulated active medium of a plasma-based x-ray laser has been developed. This method is extended to the case of finite width of spectral lines (finite pulse duration) of high-harmonic radiation and nonlinear interaction of radiation with matter. The transformation of the polarization of the harmonic field is achieved by introducing a phase shift of π/2 between its polarization components, parallel and orthogonal to the polarization of the modulating field, through resonant dispersion on the spectral wings of the induced gain lines of the active medium and is accompanied by an increase in the power of high harmonics. It is shown that for harmonics with a finite bandwidth, the polarization of the output radiation is nonuniform in time. The reasons for such nonuniformity are analyzed and the conditions for its minimization are found. The influence of nonlinearity and amplified spontaneous emission of the active medium on the high-harmonic polarization is investigated. The possibilities for the experimental implementation of this effect in a neonlike active medium of a plasma x-ray laser based on ions with an unperturbed wavelength of the inverted transition at 32.6 nm are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {The Purcell effect describes the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter near a resonant structure. However, evaluating the Purcell factor quantitatively and empirically is difficult due to the difficulties in measuring the electromagnetic near field of an optical resonance for calculation of the exact effective modal volume, especially with non-Hermitian resonators. Therefore, we propose an analytical approach to circumvent the need to measure the near field and predict the Purcell enhancement with spectral parameters, which can be directly measured in the far field or fitted from such spectral measurements. Our proposed model predicts the averaged Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces on a photoluminescent medium, and is verified with experimental measurements and numerical simulations of nanoparticle arrays coupled to a fluorescent thin film. The model directly analyzes the photoluminescence enhancement and extraction efficiency of the metasurface, and can be generalized to work with an arbitrarily shaped photoluminescent medium that is coupled to a resonator. This discovery provides a practical and accessible way to understand the underlying mechanisms of photoluminescence enhancement and will facilitate optimization of metasurfaces for efficient extraction of the enhanced luminescence.},

By utilizing the concept of coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC), we derive the conditions necessary for complete cancellation of back-action force, thereby enhancing force sensitivity. Furthermore, with the gradual increase in the OPA pump gains, we suppress the sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) at a lower value of laser power.

The fluctuations are studied using the linearized quantum fluctuation theory of vector solitons. I show that the interpulse correlations arise in the process of inelastic soliton interactions initiated by the polarization mode dispersion and modulation of the fiber dispersion. The inelastic soliton interactions produce pulses with highly correlated quantum fluctuations in the orthogonal polarization components of the field. In the time domain, the pulses have a four-lobe correlation pattern. In the frequency domain, the correlation functions acquire a “checkerboard” structure with alternating positive and negative regions. Correlations between the separated pulses arise only with appropriate pulse width, group velocity dispersion, and polarization mode dispersion. The generation of pulses with high intrapulse correlations offers the possibility of producing entangled sources for continuous-variable quantum communication and computation.},

Here, we study the possibility of bending a waveguide to enhance the photon pair generation rate in a spontaneous four-wave mixing process. Whereas intuition might suggest that bending makes the process less efficient because the waveguides are more lossy when bent, we show that the increase in the effective nonlinearity outperforms the loss disadvantage for moderate bending radii. That can be explained by a better localization of the guided eigenmodes, leading to a reduced mode area. By studying selected waveguide devices with a fixed length, we demonstrate an improvement in the photon pair generation rate between 5% and 210% for an optimal bending radius. These findings have implications for the future design of integrated photonic devices for quantum optical applications, especially in cases where the chip estate tends to be a limiting factor.},

In this paper, we study how to realize ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode in a Fano-mirror optomechanical setup, which allows for enhanced effective optomechanical interaction but typically works in the (deeply) unresolved-sideband regime. We reveal that for such a two-sided cavity geometry with very different decay rates at the two cavity mirrors, it is possible to cool the mechanical mode down to its ground state within a broad range of parameters by using an appropriate single-sided coherent feedback. This is possible even if the total optical loss is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical frequency and the feedback efficiency is relatively low. Importantly, we show that a more standard double-sided feedback scheme is not appropriate to cooperate with a Fano-mirror system.},

  abstract     = {Cylindrical vector (CV) beams have garnered widespread research interest owing to their polarization symmetry and unique properties. The advent of high-intensity ultrafast CV laser sources is poised to advance ultrafast science and attosecond physics. The type-II phase-matched, wavelength-degenerate optical parametric amplification (OPA) configuration can realize polarization-independent parametric amplification for the signal. When combined with chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) technology, this method shows promise for producing ultrafast vector beams with customizable polarization profiles at ultrahigh intensities. However, in addition to the linear spectral phase retardance introduced by the birefringent OPA crystal, known as the wave-plate effect, the optical parametric phase (OPP) inherently induced in optical parametric CPA (OPCPA) may cause another type of spectral phase retardation between the ordinary and extraordinary polarized components of the signal. This nonlinear spectral phase retardance depends significantly on the parametric process. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive theoretical investigation of nonlinear spectral phase retardance and correlates it with its linear counterpart. The dynamic behavior of nonlinear spectral phase retardance and its impact on the temporal compensation of compressed signal pulses are comprehensively discussed. These findings are expected to guide the design of CV-polarized OPCPA systems and their future applications.},

The control of the magnification ratio results in versatile engineering capabilities on group velocity, beam diameter, and propagation distance.

The setup consists of a hollow hemispherical mirror that controls the light scattered by a dipolar scatterer at high scattering angles outside the hole's region. Control of light scattering at high angles can be used to suppress the corresponding optomechanical backaction, which results in focusing of the measurement information at low angles.

In this work we propose a straightforward way to engineer a one-dimensional density-dependent gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard model in spin-orbit-coupled Raman lattices. We study the model from two perspectives: few-body quantum-walk dynamics and the many-body ground state. From the first perspective, we show that large spin-flipped tunneling can lead to a deep two-body bound state. From the second perspective, mean-field and density-matrix renormalization-group calculations consistently reveal three different phases, i.e., the Mott insulator phase, the superfluid phase, and the magnetic superfluid phase.

  abstract     = {We study the dynamics of vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate within a rotating four-site lattice, which can be effectively described by a multimode model. Such a vortex dynamics develops along the low-density paths that separate the sites, and it is ruled by the phase differences between them. Hence, by appropriately selecting the initial conditions for on-site populations and phase differences, one can access distinct types of evolutions. We show that, by choosing equal populations in alternate sites, one can construct two-mode model Hamiltonians, which allows us to model a large variety of associated vortex orbits. In particular, one can select the type of trajectory of the vortex and predict the creation and annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs near the trap center. Estimates for the periods of closed vortex orbits and for the times that the vortices spend inside the lattice when dealing with open orbits, are obtained in terms of the two-mode models parameters and the rotation frequency only. We believe that the present study establishes a suitable platform to engineer different vortex dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional interacting bosons in an optical lattice after a sudden quench in the weakly interacting (Bose-Hubbard) and strongly interacting (sine-Gordon) regimes. While in a higher dimension, the Mott-superfluid phase transition is observed for weakly interacting bosons in deep lattices, in one dimension an instability is generated also for shallow lattices with a commensurate periodic potential pinning the atoms to the Mott state through a transition described by the sine-Gordon model. The present work aims at identifying the quench dynamics in both the Bose-Hubbard and sine-Gordon interaction regimes. We numerically exactly solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a small number of atoms and obtain dynamical measures of several key quantities. We investigate the correlation dynamics of first and second order; both exhibit rich many-body features in the dynamics. We conclude that in both cases, dynamics exhibits collapse-revival phenomena, though with different timescales. We argue that the dynamical fragmentation is a convenient quantity to distinguish the dynamics especially near the pinning zone. To understand the relaxation process we measure the many-body information entropy. Bose-Hubbard dynamics clearly establishes the possible relaxation to the maximum entropy state. In contrast, the sine-Gordon dynamics is so fast that it does not exhibit any signature of relaxation in the present timescale of computation.},

A thorough exploration of weak contact and dipole-dipole effective interaction parameters leads us to determine the phase diagrams of the 1D Bose clouds affected by three different external fields: free homogeneous, harmonic, and optical lattice confining potentials. These results were used to propose long-life states composed of alternate assemblies of individual species confined in optical lattices that mimics magnetic domains, whose size can be adjusted.

We illustrate how two topological phases with a distinct Zak phase are connected in the pumping process. Such a visual depiction exhibits typical patterns that is directly related to a linking number and to the Chern number, allowing for the construction of Thouless pumping schemes in a practical way. As a demonstration, we present a generalized Creutz model with a tunable Peierls phase, interleg imbalance, and diagonal hopping.

At low optical density of the atomic cloud, the intensity distribution of light in the cavity is ruled by the cavity's mode function, which is determined solely by its geometry. In this regime the dynamics of the coupled atom-cavity system is conveniently described by the open Dicke model, which we apply to calculating normal mode splitting generated by periodically ordered clouds in linear and ring cavities. We also show how to use normal mode splitting as a witness for Wannier-Bloch oscillations in the tight-binding limit. At high optical density the atomic distribution contributes to shaping the mode function. This regime escapes the open Dicke model, but can be treated by a transfer matrix model provided the saturation parameter is low. Applying this latter model to an atomic cloud periodically ordered into a one-dimensional lattice, we observe the formation of photonic bands gaps competing with the normal mode splitting. We discuss the limitations of both models and point out possible pathways to generalized theories.},

The primary propensity rule states that nearly all molecular products conserve the total hyperfine spin of a reactant atomic pair, while molecular products not conserving the total spin are highly suppressed. For the dominant molecular products, there is a secondary propensity to conserve certain spin components of the reactant pair such as the atomic hyperfine spins, or the total electronic or nuclear spins. The second propensity varies across species and depends fundamentally on the interplay between effective electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. The spin sensitivity of product-state distribution can potentially open up new avenues for controlling state-to-state reaction rates in ultracold three-body recombination.},

Here, we theoretically demonstrate a rapid and short-distance deceleration of heavy atoms by using a continuous stimulated force with optical phase compensation and frequency chirping. The scheme effectively overcomes the spatial inhomogeneity of the stimulated force on atoms during deceleration. Our approach employs the numerical solutions of the optical Bloch equations for two-level atoms driven by time-dependent fields, and simulates atom trajectories using a three-dimensional Monte Carlo method. Concerning a buffer-gas-cooled radium atom beam with an initial velocity of 130 m/s, from our simulations it can be decelerated to 5 m/s within 5 cm distance using 40 mW laser power, achieving a deceleration force approximately 35 times stronger than the radiation force and covering an effective velocity range over eight times that of the radiation force. In addition, the deceleration of other heavy atoms, such as francium and thallium, also are applicable. This approach offers an efficient tool for rapidly slowing and cooling complex atoms and molecules, facilitating future precision measurements.},

Their validity is ultimately judged by comparing them to observables obtained within a many-body variational approach. We argue that utilizing a time-dependent optimization process with the effective mass and frequency being fitting parameters leads to an accurate matching on the level of one-body observables with the prediction of the many-body method. Next, we construct two-body effective models, which, in addition to the effective parameters of the single polaron, include a contact interaction potential modeling the induced interactions. It is shown that the instantaneous coupling strength obtained with a time-dependent optimization process allows for an accurate description of the impurities two-body correlation dynamics when compared to the many-body calculations. In this sense, it is possible to describe the dynamical crossover from correlated to anticorrelated impurity patterns related to the transition from attractive to repulsive induced interactions. Our results should facilitate the description of strongly particle-imbalanced mixtures via reduced models and hence their experimental understanding.},

  abstract     = {Even though the one-dimensional contact interaction requires no regularization, renormalization methods have been shown to improve the convergence of numerical calculations considerably. In this work, we compare and contrast these methods: “the running coupling constant” where the two-body ground-state energy is used as a renormalization condition, and two effective interaction approaches that include information about the ground as well as excited states. In particular, we calculate the energies and densities of few-fermion systems in a harmonic oscillator with the configuration-interaction method and compare the results based upon renormalized and bare interactions. We find that the use of the running coupling constant instead of the bare interaction improves convergence significantly. A comparison with an effective interaction, which is designed to reproduce the relative part of the energy spectrum of two particles, showed a similar improvement. The effective interaction provides an additional improvement if the center-of-mass excitations are included in the construction. Finally, we discuss the transformation of observables alongside the renormalization of the potential, and demonstrate that this might be an essential ingredient for accurate numerical calculations.},

However, little attention has been paid to the readout schemes of atom interferometers from the viewpoint of their sensitivity. The difference in sensitivity between readout schemes or their optimization has not been considered in the literature. Herein we analytically calculate the sensitivities of an atom interferometer with typical readout schemes by applying the two-photon formalism, which was developed for optical interferometers to deal with quantum noise. Our calculations reveal that by using sinusoidal phase modulation, the sensitivity can surpass that obtained by the conventional phase sweeping scheme. The superiority of this phase modulation scheme for both cold and thermal atomic beams is demonstrated. In addition, we show that the phase modulation scheme is advantageous for atom-flux fluctuation and resists atom-flux drift. This study performs a general analysis of the sensitivity of atom interferometers and identifies an advantageous readout scheme.},

We apply the adiabatic strong-field approximation (ASFA) method to predict the coherences between ionic states resulting from multiorbital strong-field ionizations. Compared with the standard strong-field approximation, the ASFA method can be applied across a wide range of laser intensities due to the consideration of orbital distortion effects. Based on the ASFA, it is found that there are obvious coherences between ionic states in residual molecular ions. These coherences significantly influence the transitions between ionic states, which finally change the postionization dynamics of molecular ions.

Focusing on the dissociation pathway, we obtain the kinetic-energy release (KER) distributions of the atomic fragments and find very good agreement with experimental results.

In spite of high importance of SO effect its manifestation at interaction with ultrashort and intense ultraviolet (UV) laser pulses is weakly studied. Our simulations confirm clearly manifestations of nonlinear phenomena in SO-splitting fragment spectra as the UV pulse intensity increases. These nonlinear effects in kinetic energy release and photofragment angular distribution spectra clearly reflect the SO splitting of the state and the coupling ( is the nuclear rotational angular momentum and is the projection of total angular momentum on the molecule axis). We show that in case of nonresolved rotational excitation the coupling on doublet-state transitions can be effectively approximated as the coupling, as for a singlet state, yet including actual SO splitting on the potential energy curve of the doublet state. The present investigation not only reveals the nonlinear SO-splitting effects on photodissociation dynamics induced by intense UV pulses, but also provides practical approaches for efficient modeling of the photoinduced ultrafast nuclear dynamics incorporating the SO-splitting phenomena.},

The experiments are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations of the ion trajectories inside the calculated trap potential and allow us to investigate the properties of the sampling method, the role of ion motion coupling, and the impact of residual buffer-gas collisions on the observed results. The technique has also been successfully applied to identify energetic ions produced in an exothermic reaction inside the trap.

  abstract     = {Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [I. S.Wahyutama et al., Phys. Rev. A 106 , 052211 (2022) ] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.},

The superfluorescence is induced by three-photon absorption of an ultrashort 260.5-nm laser pulse that creates coherent and coupled populations in multiple closely spaced and Ar levels. Argon pressure and pump laser focusing parameters are seen to modify the frequency of the quantum beats, which is attributed to the absorption of the self-generated, nonresonant third harmonic of the pump from Ar near the zero of the real part of the overlapping linear susceptibilities of the closely spaced and excited states. The self-absorption of the phase-matched THG photons creates a coherent population of atoms which acts like an atomic excited state ( -induced state). We have also observed a new two-step superfluorescent cascade that results from the population redistribution enabled by the 780-nm probe pulse between the and the -induced state and gives rise to a previously unknown transition that emits on 1587 nm.},

Comparison to theory reveals that this is caused by the Rydberg electron sampling different potential landscapes. The observed difference increases for higher principal quantum numbers, where the extent of the Rydberg electron wave function becomes larger than the optical lattice period.

  abstract     = {We experimentally and theoretically investigate the nondipole shift of the electron momentum distribution in the light-propagation direction in strong-field ionization of Ar atoms using counterrotating circularly polarized two-color laser fields. We observe that the electron mean momentum in the laser propagation direction in bicircular fields is strongly dependent on both the emission angle and the radial momentum of the electron. In low-energy electrons, the mean momentum follows the relation ( is the velocity of light and is the ionization potential), while for high-energy electrons it is significantly suppressed and deviates from the predicted values. Using nondipole-corrected classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations, we identify that the nondipole shift is significantly influenced by the electron scattering process. The dominance of scattered electrons in the high-energy region leads to the reduction of the mean momentum shift. By extracting the angle- and momentum-resolved mean momentum spectrum, we show that the scattered and nonscattered electrons are emitted at different angles in counterrotating circularly polarized fields due to the nondipole shift. The sensitivity of the nondipole effect to the scattering process serves as a promising tool for probing strong-field-driven electron dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The quantum optical description of high-order harmonic generation where both the electrons of the generating medium and the driving and generated light fields are described quantum mechanically has been of significant interest in the past years. The quantum optical formulation leads to equations of motion for the generated light field in which the quantum optical field couples to the time-dependent current of the electronic medium irrespectively of the specifics of the electronic system being an atom, molecule, or solid. These equations of motion are not solvable for any realistic system and accurate and verified approximations are hence needed. In this paper, we present a hierarchy of approximations for the equations of motion for the photonic state. At each level in this hierarchy, we compare it to the previous level justifying the validity using the Fermi-Hubbard model as an example of an electronic system with correlations. This model allows us to perform an accurate simulation of the electron motion of all the required states. We find that for the typical experimental situation of weak quantized-light-matter-coupling constant and at intensities well below the damage threshold, an explicit expression for the generated quantum light, referred to as the Markov-state approximation, captures the high-harmonic spectrum quantitatively and describes the single-mode quantum properties of the generated light as characterized by the Mandel- parameter and the degree of squeezing qualitatively.},

  abstract     = {In the field of chemistry, where nuclear motion has traditionally been a focal point, we now explore the ultrarapid electronic motion spanning attoseconds to femtoseconds, demonstrating that it is equally integral and relevant to the discipline. The advent of ultrashort attosecond pulse technology has revolutionized our ability to directly observe electronic rearrangements in atoms and molecules, offering a time-resolved insight into these swift processes. Prominent examples include Auger-Meitner decay and interparticle Coulombic decay. However, the real challenge lies in interpreting these observations, where theoretical models are indispensable. Building upon the analytical framework introduced by Fasshauer and Madsen [ Phys. Rev. A 101 , 043414 (2020) ], which analyzed the spectra of electrons emitted during electronic decay processes from a purely electronic perspective, we extend this theoretical base to include nuclear dynamics, utilizing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to deepen our understanding of the intricate interaction between electronic and nuclear motion in these processes. We illustrate the impact of incorporating nuclear degrees of freedom in several theoretical cases characterized by different numbers of vibrational bound states in both the electronic resonance and the electronic final state. This approach not only clarifies complex spectral features and unusual peak shapes but also demonstrates a method for extracting the energy differences between multiple vibrational resonance states through their distinctive interference patterns.},

Using a semiclassical model, we identify the influence of the molecular orbital and the long-range Coulombic potential on the alignment-dependent final radial momentum.

  abstract     = {Multiphoton interference measurements in attosecond physics, e.g., the reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABITT), are the typical methods of choice to experimentally access the photoionization delay in atoms and molecules. The exact relation between the measurable multiphoton delays and the theoretical single-photon delays is typically modeled by correction terms, continuum-continuum delays, obtained from a high-energy limit of the theory. However, these are unreliable at photoelectron kinetic energies smaller than about 10 eV, and do not have photoemission angular dependence. In this work we develop an accurate analytic alternative that gives accurate correction terms even at very low energies. Our method is computationally very straightforward, predicts correct multiphoton photoelectron angular distributions as well as the expected angular dependence of the continuum-continuum delay. We validate the approach theoretically against state-of-the-art ab initio calculations as well as experimentally with a two-harmonic RABITT setup, which properly separates different higher-order multiphoton pathways and offers a promising way of analyzing congested molecular photoionization spectra.},

  abstract     = {High-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by infrared laser pulses in Ba and Cs atoms is studied numerically and analytically by solving the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. We show that the energy transfer from the returning electron, ejected from the outer subshell, to the electrons in the fourth shell results in a giant broadband HHG enhancement at frequencies in Ba and Cs similar to that in Xe, where the returning electron is ejected from the outer subshell. The high degree of delocalization of the outer subshell in Ba and Cs slows down the spreading of the laser-driven electron wave packet outside the atom, which ensures high amplitudes of all generated harmonics. We demonstrate that the giant enhancement region can be reached in both Ba and Cs subjected to a low-intensity mid-IR laser pulse. Also, for Ba at high intensity , singly ionized atoms contribute to HHG; thus, the giant enhancement region in Ba can be reached using intense near-IR laser pulses. For this case, the HHG yield in Ba is more than an order of magnitude higher than that in Xe. In addition to the giant enhancement, the rescattering photoelectron excites in Ba and Cs autoionizing states with vacancy on the subshell, which results in the narrowband HHG enhancement at frequencies .},

  abstract     = {We theoretically investigate the multiphoton ionization of the xenon atom by pairs of linearly chirped, time-delayed circularly polarized pulses. The numerical results are obtained by solving the two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation and analyzed by using perturbation theory. By comparing observables such as the ionization probabilities and the energy, momentum, and angular distributions for laser pulses with different chirp rates, we find that the ionization processes have a clear dependence on the pulse chirp. Specifically, the dependence of the energy separation between adjacent interference fringes in the photoelectron energy distributions on the chirp rate is studied in corotating pulses. In counter-rotating pulses, the analysis of the photoelectron angular distributions reveals that the photoelectron ejection angle is sensitive to the chirp rate due to chirp-induced phase difference. Moreover, the critical chirp rates for different multiphoton ionization processes are determined from the multistart spiral structures in photoelectron momentum distributions and applied for control of the photoelectron vortices. The chirp dependence of the emitted electron observables discussed here may provide an ideal diagnostic tool for characterizing the chirped laser pulses.},

Previous studies focused on the linewidth of alkali metal atoms within the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime near zero magnetic field and in strong magnetic fields where Zeeman resonances are well resolved due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. However, the linewidth in the unresolved-Zeeman-resonance regime, which is prevalent in various magnetometer and comagnetometer applications, is not well understood. To address this, we developed a theoretical framework based on the master equation for alkali metal atoms and solved it under the rotating-wave approximation and weak-driving conditions. Our numerical calculations and analytical expressions reveal that the light-narrowing effect occurs only when the ratio of the spin-exchange rate to the spin destruction rate exceeds a critical value. Additionally, we show that the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman-resonance regime is significantly influenced by the mutual coupling of quantum coherence between different Zeeman sublevels. These findings provide a theoretical tool for understanding spin relaxation in alkali-metal atoms and optimizing the performance of atomic magnetometers and comagnetometers operating in this regime.},

Due to the interference effects, the radiation is emitted only into the forward direction, within a narrow cone, and it has a spatial structure that we analyze theoretically and numerically. For circularly polarized incident fields, the structure is also helical, with a helical index which depends on the helical index of the incident radiation and the harmonic order. These structures can be observed experimentally, as each harmonic order is emitted with a different frequency, and within cones of different opening angles.

We report on a new determination of the ionization energy of the metastable state of He. The measurements rely on an approach combining interferometric laser-alignment control, SI-traceable frequency calibration, and imaging-assisted Doppler-free spectroscopy.

  abstract     = {The Dzyaloshinskii-Lifshitz-Pitaevskii (DLP) theory of Casimir forces predicts a repulsion between two material surfaces separated by a third medium with an intermediate dielectric function. This DLP repulsion paradigm constitutes an important example with many applications. We show here that it is broken when the surfaces interact across salted water due to the nonlocal response of the ions in solution. We consider the interaction between silica and gold and show that the zero-frequency contribution, which is the only one affected by the nonlocal response, is dominant for distances in the range near 100 nm and beyond. As a result, the total Casimir force between gold and silica surfaces in salted water is always attractive in spite of the DLP repulsion paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) provide the full available detail of the photoionization process. Careful analysis of the evolving photoelectron angular distribution during the coherent rotation of a nonadiabatically aligned sample of molecules allows the detail which is smoothed out by orientational averaging in the laboratory frame to be resolved. Here we exploit a high flux monochromated HHG lightsource to provide single-photon photoelectron angular distributions of field-free aligned molecules. Our measurements are sensitive to alignment frame variations in even 𝛽 𝑛 parameters up to 𝑛 = 6 in the PADs of the first four ionization channels of OCS, allowing for rigorous benchmarking of the cutting edge theoretical methods used for simulation of MFPADs. We demonstrate that experimentally derived molecular alignment distributions may be combined with theoretical MFPADs to generate theoretical alignment-frame PADs which provide a quantitative comparison to the experimental 𝛽 𝑛 parameters. The experimental data and ePSproc simulated PADs show quantitative agreement and sensitivity to picometer-scale changes in the molecular geometry. This combined methodology therefore provides a versatile way of studying geometry-sensitive continuum structural features for nondissociative ionization processes which may not be studied in the recoil frame. These measurements therefore provide a strict test of the theoretical descriptions and will stand as benchmark measurements for future comparisons to higher-level theory.},

The resonance states are Feshbach resonances located below the ) d threshold energy and radiatively decay into the continuum or bound states. The x-ray spectra having characteristic shapes according to the radial distribution of the two nuclei are obtained using precise three-body wave functions. We carefully examined the convergence of the x-ray spectra and achieved agreements between the length- and velocity-gauge calculations. We revealed a nonadiabatic kinetic energy distribution of the decay fragments, indicating that the radiative decay becomes a heating source of muonic atoms. We also investigated the decay branch that directly results in bound-state muonic molecules. Some resonance states and are found to have high branching ratios to the bound state where intramolecular nuclear fusion occurs. The formation of the muonic molecules in the bound states from metastable muonic atoms can be a fast track in the cycle, which skips a slow path to form the bound state from the ground-state muonic atoms and increases the cycle rate. Although the spectra from the radiative decays are located in the energy range of 1.5–1.997 keV, which is close to the x-ray of 1.997 keV from muonic deuterium atoms, state-of-the-art microcalorimeters can distinguish them.},

A neural-network approach was subsequently utilized to fit the global potential energy surface of the molecule in its state. In contrast to previous methods, the optimization of neural-network parameters in this study was carried out using the trust region framework (TRF). The TRF algorithm exhibits superior performance in parameter optimization and demonstrates reduced dependency on neuron parameters compared to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Utilizing the obtained potential energy surface, three reaction pathways for were identified, confirming that this reaction proceeds as a barrierless exothermic process. To further verify the accuracy of the fitted potential energy surface, the reaction cross section was calculated under the initial condition for this reaction. By integrating the cross section with the relative translational energy, rate coefficients were determined under various initial conditions. Under the initial condition , the rate coefficient is at its maximum, and the trend of the rate coefficient with temperature first decreases and then increases. At a temperature of 100 K, the rate coefficient reaches its minimum value. At low temperatures, the rate coefficient is very high, which is consistent with the characteristics of a barrierless exothermic reaction.},

At increasingly high x-ray intensity, the sensitivity of ultrashort x-ray pulses to specific electronic states and emerging short-lived transient intermediates is of particular relevance for our understanding of fundamental multiphoton absorption processes. In this work, intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses at the European XFEL are combined with a gas cell and grating spectrometer for a high-intensity transmission spectroscopy study of multiphoton-induced ultrafast molecular fragmentation dynamics in . This approach unlocks the direct intrapulse observation of transient fragments, including neutral atoms, by their characteristic absorption lines in the transmitted broadband x-ray spectrum. The dynamics with and without initially producing fluorine -shell holes are studied by tuning the central photon energy. The absorption spectra are measured at different FEL intensities to observe nonlinear effects. Transient isolated fluorine atoms and ions are spectroscopically recorded within the ultrashort pulse duration of a few tens of femtoseconds. An isosbestic point that signifies the correlated transition between intact neutral molecules and charged atomic fragments is observed near the fluorine edge. The dissociation dynamics and the multiphoton absorption-induced dynamics encoded in the spectra are theoretically interpreted. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of high-intensity x-ray transmission spectroscopy to study ultrafast molecular dynamics with sensitivity to specific intermediate species and their electronic structure.},

For the highest resolutions, one tries to minimize saturation effects going to regimes of low excitation probability, where perturbation theory can provide reliable results. Here we describe an analytical approach to the line shape based on perturbation theory accounting for the AC-Stark shift and ionization. The expressions can be used for beam experiments or integrated over the magnetic field profile for a trapped sample. Theses line shapes, providing fast results, allow for studies of many systematic effects that influence the accuracy of the determination of the central frequency.

The trained neural network ensembles demonstrate a limited ability to generalize to molecules not used to train the models. In such cases, the models are able to identify key qualitative features, but struggle to match the quantitative values.

First, it extends the energy-dependent frame transformation (EDFT) treatment, which is needed to map fixed-nuclei electron-molecule scattering matrices into an energy-dependent laboratory-frame scattering matrix with vibrational channel indices. The EDFT mapping can now be carried out even when the target molecule possesses multiple low-energy potential curves, significantly transcending previous applications. Second, it implements a method to extract the rest of the full laboratory-frame scattering matrix, i.e., the columns and rows describing input and/or output dissociation channels. The treatment is benchmarked in this article against the essentially exact solution of a refined two-dimensional model of the singlet gerade symmetry of . Our tests demonstrate that the theory accurately maps fixed-nuclei scattering information, of the type provided by existing electron-molecule computer codes, into a laboratory-frame scattering matrix that includes both ionization and dissociation.

We have also observed molecular-axis orientation-dependent variations in the angle-differential cross sections for the double-electron capture and transfer ionization processes. A simple mathematical model based on Young's optical double-slit experiment has been invoked. The variations are attributed to the molecular double-slit-type interference phenomena arising from the interference between the two outgoing de Broglie waves formed by electron capture. The asymmetry in the interference pattern due to the scattering phase gives insight into the role of the quantum phenomena in characterizing such collision dynamics. Our study thus provides general evidence of the wave-particle duality in low to highly perturbative ion-molecule collisions.},

Here, we demonstrate the importance of proper relativistic treatment of the and shells in Yb-containing diatomics and the inclusion of the transition to obtain accurate spectra of . We focus on state-of-the-art relativistic many-body calculations for the Yb atom's ground and excited states and the potential energy surface. For that purpose, we exploit various quantum many-body methods, namely, a spin-free and four-component implementation of the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) model and its equation-of-motion (EOM) extensions, spin-free complete-active-space self-consistent field, and internally contracted multireference (MR) configuration interaction approaches. We oppose scalar relativistic calculations to four-component variants to support the reliability of our EOM-CCSD study and shed new light on the interplay between these systems' spin-orbit coupling and the proper treatment of relativistic effects. Finally, we provide new reference potential-energy curves for ground and excited states. Additionally, we compute spectroscopic constants and analyze the Einstein coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Several variational quantum circuits for machine learning have been proposed in recent years, with one promising class of variational algorithms involving tensor networks operating on states resulting from local feature maps. In contrast, a random feature approach known as quantum kitchen sinks (C. M. Wilson et al. , Quantum kitchen sinks: An algorithm for machine learning on near-term quantum computers, arXiv:1806.08321 ) provides comparable performance, but leverages nonlocal feature maps. Here we combine these two approaches by proposing a circuit Ansatz where a tree tensor network coherently processes the nonlocal feature maps of quantum kitchen sinks and we run numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the Ansatz on image classification. From the perspective of classification performance, we find that simply combining quantum kitchen sinks with tensor networks yields no qualitative improvements. However, the addition of feature optimization greatly boosts performance, leading to state-of-the-art quantum circuits for image classification, requiring only shallow circuits and a small number of qubits, both well within reach of near-term quantum devices.},

By exploiting translation invariance and potentially other Abelian symmetries of the many-body Hamiltonian, we extend the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach to construct spatially localized quasiparticle states that encode information on the whole excited band, allowing us to achieve quantum parallelism. We benchmark the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations performed on the one-dimension transverse field Ising chain. Our numerical results demonstrate that VQE can capture both the magnon quasiparticles of the paramagnetic phase, and the topologically nontrivial domain wall excitations in the ferromagnetic regime. We argue that the localized quasiparticle states constructed with VQE contain accessible information on the full band of quasiparticles, and provide valuable insight into the way interactions renormalize the bare spin flip or domain wall excitations of the simple, trivially solvable limits of the model. These results serve as important theoretical input towards utilizing quantum simulators to directly access the quasiparticles of strongly interacting quantum systems, as well as to gain insight into crucial experimentally measured properties directly determined by the nature of these quasiparticles.},

We present a theoretical investigation of stimulated Raman scattering involving squeezed states of light. The concept of surface- and quantum-enhanced stimulated Raman scattering is introduced. Furthermore, expressions for the respective SRS transition rates are derived, and their dependence on the quantum states of the optical field is discussed, with particular emphasis on the squeezing parameters characterizing these states.

In the QFE framework, a functional expansion of the solution is encoded into a quantum state and the time evolution of the quantum state is solved with variational quantum simulation (VQS). The quantum functional encoding supports different numerical schemes of functional expansions. If the solution space is infinite-order differentiable, the lower bound of the required number of qubits under the quantum function encoding scheme is the double logarithm of the inverse error bound. Furthermore, a parallel Pauli operation strategy is proposed to significantly improve the scalability of VQS. The number of circuits in VQS is exponentially reduced to only the quadratic order of the number of ansatz parameters. Four example differential equations are solved to demonstrate the generic QFE framework.},

We propose to tailor such transducers by tuning the driving pulse using shortcuts to adiabaticity. We demonstrate the realization of high-fidelity entangling gates of 99% in short timescales of a few tens of nanoseconds, and we show the robustness of this approach to control parameters. Furthermore, our method enables state transfer and remote entanglement between different modules of the hybrid system with fidelity exceeding the fault-tolerance threshold, thus demonstrating the scalability of this approach.

To calculate the ground energy of nuclear systems, we propose a new algorithm that combines classical shadow and subspace diagonalization techniques. Our subspace is composed of matrices, with the basis of the subspace being the classical shadow of the quantum state.

To scale up to larger processors, multimodule designs are employed with various boundary conditions, thereby enhancing the collective yield. These enhancements allow for greater flexibility in processor design by eliminating the need for handpicked orientations.

As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum.

However, there is significant discrepancy between experimental measurements and analytical predictions of the strength of the bit-flip suppression. In this paper we resolve this discrepancy for some of the perturbations, by developing a second-order perturbation theory on top of a nonlinear dissipative Lindbladian. Following this scheme, we derive an analytical expression for the exponentially small bit-flip rate due to single-photon loss, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. We also apply our scheme to other perturbations, such as frequency detuning and the Z gate, and find the corresponding bit-flip rates, which also show good agreement with the numerical simulation.},

These rates are in good agreement with the level of decoherence we extract from qubit-assisted spectroscopic measurements of the SAW resonator. We additionally find that the timescales over which coherent driven dynamics and decoherence occur are comparable, highlighting the need to model the composite device as an open quantum system. We discuss possible sources of decoherence in SAW-based quantum acoustic devices and the application of these devices in future quantum acoustic dissipation engineering experiments.

We investigate entanglement generation between remote qubits and tailor protocols to a variety of physical implementations with different properties.

We show that the capacity-power function for a classical-quantum channel, for both unassisted and private protocol, is concave, and we also prove additivity for unentangled and uncorrelated ensembles of input signals for such channels. This implies that we do not need regularized formulas for calculation. We show that these properties also hold for all noiseless channels when we restrict the set of input states to be pure quantum states. For general channels, we geometrically prove that the capacity-power function is piecewise concave, with further support from numerical simulations.

We explain the physical mechanisms behind these factors enhancing estimation precision of OCS parameter and explore the ideal parameter regions for estimating it. More importantly, the estimation precision obtained by our scheme exhibits stronger robustness against mechanical damping and ambient temperature in comparison with the unassisted case. In addition, we evaluate the performance of heterodyne detection, indicating that the measurement precision obtained through this method can approach the estimation precision obtained by our scheme.

Here, to utilize all the available qubits to boost the coding gain, we propose a generalized version of quantum parity code by using the concatenated structure in a flexible way. Compared to quantum parity code, the generalized one does not increase the hardware overhead but offers superior performance with the continuous increase of code length. The gain comes from optimizing the length distribution of the inner codes.

  abstract     = {High-fidelity and decoherence-insensitive quantum gates are essential for achieving universal quantum computing. In quantum information processing, decoherence arising from excited states significantly contributes to the scheme's infidelity. Therefore, minimizing the average population of the excited state is crucial when designing quantum protocols. A promising approach involves utilizing capture-and-release dynamics to induce a complex phase on the ground state in a two-level system, effectively suppressing the integrated excited-state population. By applying this dynamics protocol to a three-level system, we propose a scheme to construct arbitrary decoherence suppressed single-qubit and nontrivial two-qubit gates; meanwhile, by incorporating the Zeno dynamics process in the construction of two-qubit logic gates, the large detuning and excitation of virtual photons render the scheme insensitive to qubit decoherence and cavity dissipation. Applying our scheme to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center as an example, we prove our scheme with higher fidelity than conventional nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric gates while significantly enhancing the robustness against decoherence and frequency shift errors. These studies provide alternative approaches for constructing robust quantum gate operations. We also emphasize that the scheme is feasible for three-level quantum systems, not limited to NV center systems.},

  abstract     = {Quantum secret sharing (QSS) enables a dealer to securely distribute keys to multiple players. Device-independent (DI) QSS can resist all possible attacks from practical imperfect devices and provide QSS the highest level of security in theory. However, DI QSS requires high-performance devices, especially for low-noise channels, which is a big challenge to demonstrate experimentally. We propose a DI QSS protocol with the advanced random key generation basis strategy, which combines the random key generation basis with the noise preprocessing and postselection strategies. We develop the methods to numerically simulate the key generation rate in an acceptable time. Our DI QSS protocol has some advantages. First, it can increase the noise tolerance threshold from an initial 7.147% to 9.231% (29.16% growth) and reduce the global detection efficiency threshold from 96.32% to 93.41%. The maximal distance between any two users increases to 1.43 km, which is about 5.5 times the initial value. Second, by randomly selecting two basis combinations to generate the key, our DI QSS protocol can reduce the entanglement resource consumption. Our protocol has potential for the experimental demonstration of DI QSS and application in the future.},

  abstract     = {Measurement-device-independent quantum secret sharing (MDI-QSS) can resist all attacks on imperfect measuring devices. However, limited by the exponential increase in fiber loss, MDI-QSS has a low key rate and short communication distance. In this paper, we introduce quantum memory (QM) in MDI-QSS to increase the success probability of the three-photon synchronous projection measurement and propose a memory-assisted (MA) MDI-QSS protocol. In this protocol, the heralded single-photon source and the decoy-state method are also explored. This MA-MDI-QSS protocol has three advantages. First, the QM used here is all optical, and this protocol is feasible under current experimental conditions. Second, combined with the decoy-state method, our protocol can guarantee the security of the transmitted keys under practical experimental conditions. Third, numerical simulation results show that our protocol has a higher secure key rate and longer photon transmission distance than existing MDI-QSS protocols without QM. Our protocol provides a promising way for implementing the long-distance MDI-QSS in the near future.},

Atomic clocks are among the most sensitive quantum sensors, with recent improvements in clock technology allowing for unprecedented precision and accuracy. These clocks are highly sensitive to variations in fundamental constants, making them ideal probes for local ultralight scalar dark matter. Further improvements to the sensitivity are expected in proposed nuclear clocks based on a nuclear transition in the thorium-229 isotope. We investigate the use of various quantum metrology algorithms in the search for dark matter using quantum clocks. We propose a broadband dynamical decoupling algorithm and compare it with quantum metrology protocols that have been previously proposed and demonstrated, namely, differential spectroscopy and narrowband dynamical decoupling. We conduct numerical simulations of scalar dark matter searches with realistic noise sources and accounting for dark matter decoherence.

While various quantum algorithms exist which can prepare the ground state with high precision and provable guarantees from an initial approximation, current devices are limited to shallow circuits. Here we consider the setting where Alice and Bob, in a distributed quantum computing architecture, want to prepare the same Hamiltonian eigenstate. We demonstrate that the circuit depth of the eigenstate preparation algorithm can be reduced when the devices can share entanglement via a coherent link. This is especially so in the case where one of them has a near-perfect eigenstate, which is more efficiently broadcast to the other device. Our approach requires only a single auxiliary qubit per device to be entangled with the outside. We show that, in the near-convergent regime, the average relative suppression of unwanted amplitudes is improved to per run of the protocol, outperforming the average relative suppression of achieved with a single device alone for the same protocol.},

Our approach employs parameterized quantum channels within an equivariant Ansatz . We analyze the channel's capabilities, demonstrate the mitigation of the barren plateau, and provide convergence guarantees for our method. The numerical results highlight the following: (1) Our method achieves higher fidelity and faster convergence than naive methods in various quantum communication scenarios.

We point out a simple mechanism that creates exponentially many low-quality local minima specifically in the barren plateau regime. These local minima are trivial solutions that optimize only a few terms in the loss function, leaving the rest on their barren plateaus. More precisely, we show the existence of approximate local minima, optimizing a single loss term, and conjecture the existence of exact local minima, optimizing only a logarithmic fraction of all loss function terms. One implication of our findings is that many, if not most, regions with large gradients are vicinities of poor local minima.

This technique makes the geometrical properties of the combinatorial optimization problem, encoded as a Hamiltonian, match the properties of the quantum annealing hardware. The embedding itself is a hard computational problem, and therefore heuristic algorithms are required. In this work we present fixed, modular, and scalable embeddings that can be used to embed any combinatorial optimization problem described as an Ising Hamiltonian. These embeddings are the result of an extension of the well-known parity mapping, which has been used in the past to map higher-order Ising Hamiltonians to quadratic Hamiltonians, which are suitable for existing quantum hardware. We show how our new embeddings can be mapped to existing quantum annealers and that the embedded Hamiltonian physical properties match the original Hamiltonian properties.},

  abstract     = {Quantum singular-value transformation (QSVT) is a framework that has been shown to unify many primitives in quantum algorithms. In this work we leverage the QSVT framework in two directions. We first show that the QSVT framework can accelerate one recently introduced quantum power method, which substantially improves its running time. Additionally, we incorporate several elementary numerical integration techniques, such as the rectangular method, Monte Carlo method, and quadrature method, into the QSVT framework, which results in polynomial speedup with respect to the size or the number of points of the grid. Our results thus provide further examples to demonstrate the potential of the QSVT and how it may enhance quantum algorithmic tasks.},

While various techniques have been developed for circuit knitting, we uncover fundamental limitations to the scalability of this technology. We prove that the sampling overhead of circuit knitting is exponentially lower bounded by the exact entanglement cost of the target bipartite dynamic, even with the asymptotic amount of resources using the parallel cut strategy. Specifically, we prove that the regularized sampling overhead assisted with local operations and classical communication of any bipartite quantum channel is lower bounded by the exponential of its exact entanglement cost under separable preserving operations. Furthermore, we develop the faithful lower bounds for the regularized sampling overhead based on channels' 𝜅 entanglement and max-Rains information, providing efficiently computable benchmarks. Our work reveals a profound connection between virtual quantum information processing via quasiprobability decomposition and quantum Shannon theory, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in distributed quantum computing.},

Maximizing the Bell expression with these hybrid measurement settings leads to the violations of local realism in the hybrid system, which is referred to as hybrid nonlocality . We demonstrate the utility of our strategy in a realistic setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics, where an atom interacts resonantly with a single mode of an electromagnetic field under the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We dynamically compute the quenched averaged value of hybrid nonlocality in imperfect situations by incorporating disorder in the atom-cavity coupling strength. In the disordered case, we introduce two kinds of measurement scenarios to determine the Bell statistics—in one situation, experimentalists can tune the optimal settings according to the interaction strength, while such controlled power is absent in the other case. In contrast to the oscillatory behavior observed in the ordered case, the quenched averaged violation saturates to a finite value in some parameter regimes in the former case. We also examine the connection between Wigner negativity and hybrid nonlocality.},

Recently, a novel quantum joint measurement known as the elegant joint measurement (EJM) has been proposed, where the reduced states of the EJM basis have tetrahedral symmetry. In this paper, we first propose a five-parameter entangled state and reveal its inherent symmetry. Based on this, we define a generalized EJM parametrized by z , φ , and θ , and provide the quantum circuits for preparing and detecting these basis states. There are three main results: (i) The previous single-parameter EJM can be directly derived by specifying the parameters z and φ ; (ii) the initial unit vectors related to the four vertices of the regular tetrahedron are not limited to the original choice and not all the unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates are suitable for forming the EJM basis; and (iii) the reduced states of the present EJM basis can always form two mirror-image tetrahedra, robustly preserving its elegant properties. We aim to determine what kind of states the EJM basis belongs to and to provide a method for constructing the generalized three-parameter EJM, which may contribute to the multisetting measurement and the potential applications for quantum information processing.},

  abstract     = {A major thrust in quantum algorithm development over the past decade has been the search for the quantum algorithms that will deliver practical quantum advantage first. Today's quantum computers—and even early fault-tolerant quantum computers—are limited in the number of operations they can implement per circuit. We introduce quantum algorithms for ground-state-energy estimation (GSEE) that accommodate this design constraint. The first algorithm estimates ground-state energies, offering a quadratic improvement on the ground-state overlap parameter compared to other methods in this regime. The second algorithm certifies that the estimated ground-state energy is within a specified error tolerance of the true ground-state energy, addressing the issue of gap estimation that beleaguers several ground-state preparation and energy estimation algorithms. We note, however, that the scaling of this certification technique is currently less favorable than that of the GSEE algorithm. To develop the certification algorithm, we propose an alternative use of quantum computers to facilitate rejection sampling. After a classical computer generates initial samples, the quantum computer is used to accept or reject these samples, resulting in a set of accepted samples that approximate draws from a target distribution. Although we apply this technique specifically for ground-state-energy certification, it may find broader applications. Our paper pushes the boundaries of what operation-limited quantum computers can achieve, bringing the prospect of quantum advantage closer to realization.},

  abstract     = {Probing a quantum system disrupts its state in a phenomenon known as backaction. In this work we investigate the conditions for this disruption to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. The latter case is relevant to the recently introduced quantum-enhanced experiments in which quantum postprocessing is performed on a quantum computer and which can offer an exponential sampling advantage over projective measurements and classical postprocessing. Our framework explicitly considers the effects of an environment using a model of unitary evolution which couples the system, apparatus, and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the Rényi and von Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for studying these quantities. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss the meaning of their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then introduce a generalized notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking such that the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneous breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to a quantum-enhanced experiment probing the unitary dynamics of a Haar brickwork quantum circuit, and we determine that the universality class of the critical point is distinct from that for the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.},

  abstract     = {Quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) is a promising tool to prepare thermal or ground states of Hamiltonians, as convergence is guaranteed when the evolved state overlaps with the ground state. However, its implementation using a a hybrid quantum-classical approach, where the dynamics of the parameters of the quantum circuit are derived by McLachlan's variational principle, is impractical as the number of parameters increases, since each step in the evolution takes state preparations to calculate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). In this work, we accelerate QITE by rapid estimation of the QFIM, while conserving the convergence guarantees to the extent possible. To this end, we prove that if a parameterized state is rotated by a 2-design and measured in the computational basis, then the QFIM can be inferred from partial derivative cross correlations of the probability outcomes. One sample estimate costs only state preparations, leading to rapid QFIM estimation when a few samples suffice. The second family of estimators takes greater liberties and replace QFIMs with averaged classical Fisher information matrices (CFIMs). In an extreme special case optimized for rapid (over accurate) descent, just one CFIM sample is drawn. We justify the second estimator family by proving rapid descent. Guided by these results, we propose the random-measurement imaginary-time evolution algorithm, which we showcase and test in several molecular systems, with the goal of preparing ground states.},

A well-studied approach to demonstrating this on near-term quantum computers is to use random circuit sampling. It has been suggested that a good candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage with random circuit sampling is to use instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits . These are quantum circuits where the unitary it implements is diagonal. In this paper, we introduce improved techniques for exactly classically simulating random IQP circuits. We find a simple algorithm to calculate an amplitude of an -qubit IQP circuit with dense random two-qubit interactions in time , which for sparse circuits (where each qubit interacts with other qubits) runs in for any given polynomial. Using a more complicated stabilizer decomposition approach we improve the algorithm for dense circuits to where . We further discuss how our techniques also lead to improved simulation times for IQP circuits on restricted architectures. We benchmarked our main algorithm and found that we can simulate up to 50-qubit circuits in a couple of minutes on a laptop, with 68-qubit sparse circuits taking a couple of hours. We estimate dense 70-qubit circuits are in range for large computing clusters.},

First, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Second, we analytically show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance, in the hypothesis of negligible external disturbances. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that (1) this system can effectively be used for nonlinear quantum computing under specific conditions and (2) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.},

Three-way- and nonlocal two-way-entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context. Herein we generate genuine three-way entanglement from an initially separable state involving three degrees of freedom of a quantum particle, which evolves via a two-dimensional alternate quantum walk employing a resource-saving single-qubit coin. We achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by the -tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal nonlocal two-way entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle. This prepared architecture using quantum walks can be experimentally realized with a photon.},

  abstract     = {Reliable quantum computation requires systematic identification and correction of errors that occur and accumulate in quantum hardware. To diagnose and correct such errors, standard quantum error-correcting protocols utilize global error information across the system obtained by mid-circuit readout of ancillary qubits. We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on local error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and four-dimensional toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared with a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a subthreshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory. Finally, we discuss the application of the LEC protocol on dissipative preparation of quantum states with topological phases.},

Our formula for matrix permanents and its corresponding quantum expression have enabled better estimation of the average additive error for random Gaussian matrices compared to Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The well-known Ryser formula has been converted into a quantum permanent estimator. When dealing with real random Gaussian square matrices of size , the quantum estimator can approximate the matrix permanent with an additive error smaller than , where is the estimation precision.

  abstract     = {Recently, distributed sensing has been extensively studied using squeezed states. While this is an excellent development, it is desirable to investigate the use of other quantum probes, such as entangled states of light. In this paper, we focus on distributed sensing, i.e., estimating multiple unknown phases at different spatial nodes using multiphoton polarization-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states distributed across different nodes. We utilize tools of quantum metrology and calculate the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM). However, the QFIM turns out to be singular, hindering the determination of quantum Cramér-Rao bounds for the parameters of interest. Recent experiments have contended with a weaker form of the Cramér-Rao bound, which does not require the inversion of the QFIM. It is desirable to understand how relevant these weaker bounds are and how closely they approach the exact Cramér-Rao bounds. We thus analyze the reason for this singularity and, by removing a redundant phase, obtain a nonsingular QFIM, allowing us to derive exact quantum Cramér-Rao bounds. Using the nonsingular QFIM, we show that the arithmetic average of the distributed phases is Heisenberg limited. We demonstrate that quantum metrological bounds can be saturated by projective measurements, enabling us to determine the Fisher information matrix, which is also singular. We then show how this singularity can be resolved.},

In particular, the curvature coefficient measures the bending of the quantum curve traced out by a parallel-transported pure quantum state that evolves in a unitary fashion under a nonstationary Hamiltonian that specifies the Schrödinger evolution equation. In this paper, we present an exact analytical expression of the curvature of a quantum evolution for a two-level quantum system immersed in a time-dependent magnetic field. Specifically, we study the dynamics generated by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. The two parameters specify the constant temporal rates of change of the polar and azimuthal angles used in the Bloch sphere representation of the evolving pure state. To better grasp the physical significance of the curvature coefficient, showing that the quantum curve is nongeodesic since the geodesic efficiency of the quantum evolution is strictly less than 1 and tuning the two Hamiltonian parameters, we compare the temporal behavior of the curvature coefficient with that of the speed and the acceleration of the evolution of the system in projective Hilbert space. Furthermore, we compare the temporal profile of the curvature coefficient with that of the square of the ratio between the parallel and transverse magnetic field intensities. Finally, we discuss the challenges in finding exact analytical solutions when extending our geometric approach to higher-dimensional quantum systems that evolve unitarily under an arbitrary time-dependent Hermitian Hamiltonian.},

Multiple desired paths can be derived by the von Neumann equation for parametric ancillary projection operators. No transition exists among the ancillary basis states during the time evolution. Under various conditions, our control framework reduces to the nonadiabatic holonomic transformation, the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory for invariants, and counterdiabatic driving methods.

  abstract     = {Nonstabilizerness (“magic”) is an essential part of quantum computation, so the quantitative study of nonstabilizerness has become a very important issue. Since researchers have defined the Pauli spectrum of quantum states, they can use it to calculate other nonstabilizerness measures such as stabilizer Rényi entropy and stabilizer nullity. At the same time, the study of the magic-channel resource theory has become a main direction in recent years. In this article we extend the definition of the Pauli spectrum to quantum channels and define the definitions of stabilizer Rényi entropy and stabilizer nullity for quantum channels based on the Pauli spectrum. Meanwhile, we study the properties of stabilizer Rényi entropy and stabilizer nullity of quantum channels and give the corresponding proofs. Additionally, this article gives the necessary and sufficient condition that the depolarizing channel is a completely stabilizer-preserving operation (CSPO), and we can calculate other channels. Furthermore, we verify that stabilizer Rényi entropy of quantum channels satisfies the amortization inequality so that the maximum value of the distillation bounds of the magic channels provided by the stabilizer Rényi entropy can be established. Therefore, we can give an alternative method to calculate the magic-channel distillation bounds. Moreover, we compare the channel distillation rate provided by stabilizer Rényi entropy with that provided by thauma and find that the channel distillation rate proposed in this article has higher distillation efficiency. Finally, the nonstabilizerness cost of the gate synthesis is given.},

Contrary to a previous proposal, there is no need to use an external qubit as the input state to be teleported to one of the qubits within the system. Here we use a pair of nearest-neighbor spins from an infinite spin- chain in equilibrium with a heat bath as the entangled resource of the quantum-teleportation protocol and a third adjacent qubit within the chain itself as the input state to be teleported. For several spin-chain models subjected to an external magnetic field, we show that the efficiency of the teleportation protocol is severely affected as we cross the quantum critical points associated with those spin chains. This abrupt change in efficiency gives us a clear indication of a quantum phase transition.},

  abstract     = {The optimal measurement that discriminates nonorthogonal quantum states with fixed rates of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO) can be decomposed into an assisted separation of the inputs, yielding conclusive and inconclusive outputs, followed by a minimum-error (ME) measurement for the conclusive ones (standard FRIO) or both ones (concatenated FRIO). The implementation of these measurements is underpinned by quantum resources, and here we investigate coherence based on positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) as a resource for both strategies in discriminating equally probable symmetric states of arbitrary dimension. First, we show that the POVM coherence in the assisted separation stage decomposes into the coherence of the ancillary state and the quantum discord between the system and the ancilla, evidencing coherence as a more elementary resource than quantum correlations. Next, it is demonstrated that the POVM coherence for standard and concatenated FRIO decomposes into the POVM coherence measures for state separation and ME measurement, weighted by the probabilities of occurrence of each event. Due to the ME discrimination of inconclusive states, the coherence required for the concatenated scheme is shown to be greater than that of the standard one. We discuss other general aspects of our results by characterizing the POVM coherence in the discrimination of qutrit states, with respect to the distinguishability of the inputs and the inconclusive rate. Finally, by exploiting POVM-based coherence as a quantifier of cryptographic randomness gain, we discuss the standard and concatenated FRIO strategies from the perspective of generating random bits that are secret to an eavesdropper.},

Here, we propose a scheme for conditionally speeding up the generation of quantum entanglement between two coupled qubits by introducing a strong dissipation channel to one of these qubits. The maximal entanglement is established by evenly distributing a single excitation between these two qubits in a probabilistic manner. When the excitation is initially held by the qubit with stronger dissipation, the dissipation accelerates the excitation redistribution process for the quantum state trajectory without quantum jumps. Our results show that the time needed to conditionally attain the maximal entanglement is monotonously decreased as the dissipative rate is increased, at the price of a quickly decreasing success probability. We further show that this scheme can be generalized to accelerate the production of the state for the three-qubit system, where one qubit with strong dissipation is symmetrically coupled to two qubits with weak dissipation.},

  abstract     = {The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) represents a branch of quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems. A specific variant, the Grover-mixer (GM) QAOA, ensures uniform amplitude across states that share equivalent objective values. This property makes the algorithm independent of the problem structure, focusing instead on the distribution of objective values within the problem. In this work we provide an alternative proof for the upper bound on the probability of measuring a computational basis state from a GM QAOA circuit with a given depth, which is a critical factor in QAOA cost. Using this, we derive the upper bounds for the probability of sampling an optimal solution and for the approximation ratio of maximum optimization problems, both dependent on the objective value distribution. Through numerical analysis, we link the distribution to the problem size and build the regression models that relate the problem size, QAOA depth, and performance upper bound. Our results suggest that the GM QAOA provides a quadratic enhancement in sampling probability and requires circuit depth that scales exponentially with problem size to maintain consistent performance.},

The property states that the expectation values of products of observables supported within spacelike separated space-time regions factorize. Actually, in some massive models the factorization is exponentially fast with respect to the distance between the systems possibly involved in actual experiments. It is then often argued that considering the space dependence of the quantities involved in the Bell-like inequalities would eventually not violate them and thus support the reproducibility of the quantum behavior by a suitable local hidden variable model. In this paper, we show when this is actually the case and how nonlocal effects can still be visible.},

In this work we investigate relativistic wave-packet dynamics for an electron tunneling through a potential barrier employing space-time resolved solutions to relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) equations. We prove by linking the QFT property of microcausality to the wave-packet behavior that the tunneling dynamics is fully causal, precluding instantaneous or superluminal effects. We illustrate these results by performing numerical computations for an electron tunneling through a potential barrier for standard tunneling as well for Klein tunneling. In all cases (Klein tunneling or regular tunneling across a standard or a supercritical potential) the transmitted wave packet remains in the causal envelope of the propagator, even when its average position lies ahead of the average position of the corresponding freely propagated wave packet.},

However, the lower bound of the product uncertainty inequality can be null even for two noncommuting operators, i.e., a trivial case. Therefore, for two incompatible operators over the measured system state, the associated URs regarding the sum of variances are valid in a state-dependent manner, and the lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial. Although the sum URs formulated for Hermitian and unitary operators have been affirmed, the general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not yet been investigated. This study presents the sum URs for non-Hermitian operators acting on system states using an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum inequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via the -metric formalism. Concrete examples illustrate the validity of the proposed sum URs in both -symmetric and -broken phases.

We answer this in the positive, describing scenarios and protocols where in principle energy is extracted from a field with randomness but without any randomness being transferred and without energy dissipation. We explain why these protocols do not violate basic physical principles. Such protocols fundamentally outperform existing methods of rectification which dissipate power or demonlike feedback protocols which transfer randomness to the feedback system. The protocols exploit the possibility of the harvesting system taking several trajectories that lead to the same final state at a given time. A key example involves Rabi oscillations between energy levels, exploiting the multitude of rotation axes in the state space. The quantum system is deterministically excited to the highest energy level after interacting with the source for a fixed amount of time, irrespective of the random initial phase of the external potential. These realizations show the value of Rabi-oscillation-type techniques for enhancing energy harvesting.},

A completely self-contained formalism is developed for the purpose of organizing and counting these ontic states, which employs the finite cyclic group Z 2 = { 0 , 1 } , basic set theory, and combinatorics. This formalism is then used to calculate probability distributions associated with particles of arbitrary spin interacting with sequences of two rotated Stern-Gerlach detectors. These calculations are compared with the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and shown to deviate slightly. This deviation can be made arbitrarily small and does not lead to violations of relevant no-go theorems, such as Bell's inequalities, the Kochen-Specker theorem, or the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem.

It admits a closed expression as a Schur concave function of the state of the subsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a bipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex roof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of formation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and upper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem quantified by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive quantum entropy, respectively. The entanglement monotone can be expressed as the minimum total state disturbance due to a nonselective local binary measurement. Finally, we discuss its estimation using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and its connection with strange weak value and quantum contextuality.},

  abstract     = {We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a framework, nonadiabatic quantum optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered nonintegrable model.},

In this paper, we derive trade-off relations for systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on the Margolus-Levitin-type and Mandelstam-Tamm-type bounds, which are originally derived as quantum speed limits in isolated quantum dynamics. While the quantum speed limit for the Mandelstam-Tamm bound in general non-Hermitian systems was derived in the literature, we obtain a Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit for continuous measurement using the continuous matrix product state formalism. Moreover, we derive a Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit in the non-Hermitian setting. We derive additional bounds on the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of an observable, which take the same form as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. As an example, we apply these bounds to the continuous measurement formalism in open quantum dynamics, where the dynamics is described by discontinuous jumps and smooth evolution induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our work provides a unified perspective on the quantum speed limit and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics from the viewpoint of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, extending the results of previous studies.},

  abstract     = {Maximum quantum work extraction is generally defined in terms of the ergotropy functional, no matter how experimentally complicated is the implementation of the optimal unitary allowing for it, especially in the case of multipartite systems. In this framework, we consider a quantum battery made up of many interacting subsystems and study the maximum extractable work via concurrent local unitary operations on each subsystem. We call the resulting functional parallel ergotropy . Focusing on the bipartite case, we first observe that parallel ergotropy outperforms work extraction via egoistic strategies, in which the first agent A extracts locally on its part the maximum available work and the second agent B, subsequently, extracts what is left on the other part. For the agents, this showcases the need of cooperating for an overall benefit. Second, from the informational point of view, we observe that the parallel capacity of a state can detect entanglement and compare it with the statistical entanglement witness that exploits fluctuations of stochastic work extraction. Additionally, we face the technical problem of computing parallel ergotropy. We derive analytical upper bounds for specific classes of states and Hamiltonians and provide recipes to obtain numerical upper bounds via semidefinite programming in the generic case. Finally, extending the concept of parallel ergotropy, we demonstrate that system's free-time evolution and application of local unitaries allow one to saturate the gap with the ergotropy of the whole system.},

  abstract     = {We explore a small quantum refrigerator consisting of three qubits, each of which is kept in contact with an environment. We consider two settings: one is when there is necessarily transient cooling and the other is when both steady-state and transient coolings prevail. Our primary focus, however, is on the transient cooling phenomena. We show that in the transient regime, the temperature of the cold qubit can decrease further compared to the case where all qubits are connected to Markovian environments, by replacing the environment attached to the cold qubit with a finite-size spin environment, modeled by a few quantum spins interacting with the cold qubit. We also consider refrigeration with more than one finite-size spin environment of the three-qubit refrigerating device. As expected, a steady temperature is reached only if there are at least two Markovian baths, regardless of whether the cold qubit is attached to an environment. However, distinct envelopes of temperature oscillations are observed in all cases. We investigate the effects of the finite-size environments on the cooling of the cold qubit when one, two, or all Markovian baths are replaced by finite-size environments. Additionally, we examine this effect in two- and single-qubit self-sustained devices connected to one or more finite-size environments. In deriving the dynamical equations for the qubits connected to finite-size environments, we made no assumptions about the Markovian nature of the environment. As a result, these finite-size environments inherently exhibit information backflow from the environment to the system, a hallmark of non-Markovianity. Hence, we propose a witness to detect non-Markovianity in such systems. Finally, the cooling processes are studied in presence of Markovian noise, and we analyze the response on the refrigeration of the noise strength. In particular, we find the noise strength until which refrigeration remains possible.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of nonlocal phenomena is a key attribute of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical theories. It was recently suggested that state swapping is one such effect that a fundamentally classical gravitational field cannot give rise to. The reasoning was that the phenomenology of classical fields is restricted to local operations and classical communication (LOCC), whereas swapping is a non-LOCC effect, so gravity must not be a classical channel if it can give rise to such a phenomenon. Here, we show that the Hamiltonian of semiclassical gravity results in an evolution of coherent states that is virtually indistinguishable from swapping them, both theoretically and experimentally. Our results indicate that drawing a definitive conclusion about the nature of gravity based solely on its ability to swap a pair of coherent states would be premature. We discuss the implications of these results regarding proposed experimental tests for the quantum nature of gravity and clarify some conceptual issues.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the local friendliness (LF) no-go theorem has attracted considerable interest due to its deep foundational implications. This no-go theorem applies to scenarios which combine Bell experiments with Wigner's friend-type setups, containing spacelike separated superobservers assumed to be capable of performing quantum operations on a local observer, also known as their “friend.” The theorem shows that a set of assumptions termed “local friendliness”—weaker than the set of assumptions required for proving Bell's theorem—constrains the space of probabilistic behaviors in extended Wigner's friend scenarios to the “local friendliness (LF) polytope,” and that quantum correlations can, in principle, violate those constraints. In this work, we extend the study of local friendliness to multipartite scenarios—with arbitrary but finite numbers of superobservers, friends, measurements, and outcomes—and fully characterize the corresponding LF polytopes, their relationships with each other, with the Bell polytope, the no-signaling polytope, and the quantum set of correlations. In particular, we identify, via constructive proofs, all the canonical LF scenarios where the LF polytope coincides with the Bell polytope—hence identifying all the scenarios where “genuine LF inequalities” may arise. Among other results, we also show that whenever the LF polytope is distinct from the Bell and the no-signaling polytope, it also is neither contained in nor contains the quantum set of correlations. Apart from the foundational motivation of better understanding the constraints from local friendliness, our results may also find use in a priori unrelated contexts of device-independent information processing, where the LF polytopes have also been shown to arise, under the name of “partially deterministic polytopes.”},

This activation of hidden Bell nonlocality has been demonstrated in experiments; however, while the certification of Bell nonlocality is conceptional straightforward, a statistically rigorous verification that the initial state is Bell-local has not yet been achieved. This is due to two key obstacles: The lack of a method to establish a suitable confidence region from the measured data and the need for an efficient technique to verify Bell locality of all states within the confidence region. In this work, we address both challenges. We introduce a confidence polytope in the form of a hyperoctahedron and provide a computationally efficient method to verify whether a quantum state admits a local hidden state model, thus being unsteerable and, consequently, Bell-local. Using these methods, we find that a statistically rigorous certification of hidden Bell nonlocality needs of the order of samples.},

  abstract     = {Measurement backaction inherently alters observed dynamics in quantum physics. In the realm of quantum synchronization, this backaction induces a phase bias, making the assessment of synchronization critically dependent on the choice of the observables. In this study we extend the quantum phase reduction approach [W. Setoyama and Y. Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 , 093602 (2024) ] into heterodyne detection, offering a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing quantum synchronization dynamics through uniform continuous measurement over all possible quadrature observables. This method averages out the backaction, allowing for unbiased evaluation of synchronization between quantum oscillators while avoiding measurement-induced phase bias. Furthermore, by defining the phase and limit-cycle solution independently of specific observables, our proposed method consistently adapts to the scenario where the observables are freely modified during the time evolution. Through simulations of noise-induced synchronization, our method reveals that the number of phase clusters between oscillators is restricted by their bosonic levels.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid classical-quantum systems are of interest in numerous fields from quantum chemistry to quantum information science. A fully quantum effective description of them is straightforward to formulate when the classical subsystem is discrete. But it is not obvious how to describe them in the general case. We propose a probability-based approach starting with four axioms for hybrid classical-quantum probability measures that readily generalize the usual ones for classical and quantum probability measures. They apply to discrete and nondiscrete classical subsystems and to finite- and infinite-dimensional quantum subsystems. A generalized Gleason theorem that gives the mathematical form of the corresponding hybrid states is shown. This form simplifies when the classical subsystem probabilities are described by a probability density function with respect to a natural reference measure, for example the familiar Lebesgue measure. We formulate a requirement for the transformations, that is, the finite-time evolutions, of hybrid probability measures analogous to the complete positive assumption for quantum operations. For hybrid systems with reference measure, we prove a generalized Kraus theorem that fully determines the considered transformations provided they are continuous with respect to an appropriate metric. Explicit expressions for these transformations are derived when the classical and quantum subsystems are noninteracting, the classical subsystem is discrete, or the Hilbert space of the quantum subsystem is finite dimensional. We also discuss the quantification of the correlations between the classical and quantum subsystems and a generalization of the quantum operations usually considered in the study of quantum entanglement.},
