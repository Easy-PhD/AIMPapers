  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) crystals proved revolutionary soon after graphene was discovered in 2004. However, 2D amorphous materials down to a single layer of atoms only became accessible in 2020, and they remain largely unexplored. In particular, the thermophysical properties of amorphous materials are of great interest upon transition from 3D to 2D. Here, we probe and simulate thermal transport in monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC). An ultralow cross-plane thermal conductivity ( ) is measured for van der Waals stacked multilayers, which is comparable to that of randomly stacked graphene despite the extra disorder in MAC. This result reveals the predominant role of the weak interlayer interactions in 2D materials. Meanwhile, an unexpectedly high in-plane is obtained for freestanding monolayers, which is a few times higher than what is predicted by conventional wisdom for 3D amorphous carbon with a similar fraction. This observation is primarily attributed to the dimensionality-induced reduction of anharmonicity and the unique low-frequency out-of-plane vibrational modes in MAC. Amorphous materials at the 2D limit open up new avenues for understanding and manipulating heat at the atomic scale.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets that break both space-time reversal and translation-spin-rotation symmetries were recently predicted [L.-D. Yuan, Z. Wang, J.-W. Luo, E. I. Rashba, and A. Zunger, Phys. Rev. B 102 , 014422 (2020) ] to possess splitting between the otherwise spin-degenerate energy bands even without the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we point out that such nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS)—in particular, “spin splitting type 4” (SST-4) symmetry-broken antiferromagnets—can be divided into subgroups having distinct patterns of spin splitting and spin textures, depending on additional auxiliary symmetries of spin interconversion and polarity. These SST-4 subgroups include the -type (no spin-interconverting symmetry) having spin splitting at the Brillouin zone center, as well as the subgroup in which a rotation symmetry is applied and determines the alternating spin texture and the subgroup having exclusively reflection spin-interconverting symmetry. Unlike ferrimagnets, the -type compounds are shown to have tiny net magnetization at finite temperature and thus avoid the adverse effect of the stray field. The and subgroups can be either polar or nonpolar, whereas the subgroup is polar only, providing a basis for possible switching by external fields. The combination of NRSS-enabling and auxiliary symmetries is used here as a filter for identifying previously synthesized compounds as specific prototypes. Their characteristic splitting and spin polarization are calculated by density functional theory to the benefit of potential future experimental testing. Interesting results are as follows: (i) SOC-independent NRSS can exceed the magnitude of the SOC-induced Rashba and Dresselhaus spin splitting in semiconductors. (ii) Examples of predicted -type insulating compounds include (nonpolar) and (polar), the latter having spin splitting of 158 meV and 160 meV in the valence and conduction bands, respectively. (iii) The -type ( and ) and -type compounds ( and ) are distinguished both by their auxiliary symmetries and polarity. The spin textures of -type compounds are mirror reflected with spin degeneracy of the wave vectors on that mirror. These observations will likely broaden the experimental playing field of NRSS physics significantly.},

  abstract     = {Quantum communication is needed to build powerful quantum computers and establish reliable quantum networks. At its basis lies the ability to generate and distribute entanglement to separate quantum systems, which can be used to run remote quantum operations on them or teleport quantum states from one system to another with the help of classical channels. To this end, it is useful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement, since it can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a nonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using standard components. While various aspects of CV-based quantum communication have been successfully demonstrated in the optical domain, some key capabilities, such as entanglement swapping, have been lacking in the microwave domain. Here, we demonstrate three key elements of CV-based microwave quantum communication: (i) a Josephson mixer operating as a nondegenerate two-mode entangler with maximum measured logarithmic negativity , (ii) a quantum teleportation apparatus, capable of teleporting vacuum and coherent states with a maximum fidelity of 73%, which exceeds the 50% classical limit and is mainly limited by intermediate losses in the setup, and (iii) an entanglement-swapping system which generates entanglement between two remote noninteracting modes via entanglement-swapping operations applied to input vacuum and coherent states with maximum measured logarithmic negativity . Such hardware-efficient CV entanglement building blocks that are based on nondegenerate Josephson mixers could enable wide-ranging applications in modular quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high- T c cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: a tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripelike configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models’ phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related t − J model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the t − J Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling t ′ , which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.},

We define the (approximate) complexity of a bosonic state by the minimum size of a circuit that prepares an approximation to the state in trace distance. We propose a new circuit which prepares an approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . Here, κ − 2 is the variance of the envelope, and Δ 2 is the variance of the individual peaks. We show that the circuit accepts with constant probability and—conditioned on acceptance—the output state is polynomially close in ( κ , Δ ) to the state | G K P κ , Δ ⟩ . The size of our circuit is linear in ( log 1 / κ , log 1 / Δ ) . To our knowledge, this is the first protocol for GKP-state preparation with fidelity guarantees for the prepared state. We also show converse bounds, establishing that the linear circuit-size dependence of our construction is optimal. This fully characterizes the complexity of GKP states.},

A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With artificial neural networks gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an artificial neural network performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training—eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.},

In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth; namely, higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of T states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudomagic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.},

While the molecular underpinnings may be complex, the resulting phenomenon, in which a cell decides between one fate or another, is relatively simple. A body of work—rooted in dynamical systems theory—has formalized this notion of cellular decision making as flow in a Waddington-like landscape, in which cells evolve according to gradientlike dynamics within a potential that changes shape in response to a number of signals. We present a framework leveraging neural networks as universal function approximators to infer such a parametrized landscape from gene expression data. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine learning in data-limited contexts, we enforce principled constraints motivated not by physical laws but by this phenomenological understanding of differentiation. Our data-driven approach infers a governing landscape atop a manifold situated within expression space, thereby describing the dynamics of interest in a biologically meaningful context. The resulting system provides an intuitive, visualizable, and interpretable model of cellular differentiation dynamics.},

Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a nonzero doping density, this feature enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Focusing on the vicinity of , we describe a few possible itinerant states, including a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic pair density wave (PDW) superconductor with non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling . Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling , the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases, including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.},

Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (longtime) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e., the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.},

In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems while offering a physically grounded link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This fundamental result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions (JJs) are expected to harbor a novel class of Andreev bound states (ABSs), including topologically nontrivial states in four-terminal devices. In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs and to realize topological Andreev bands.},

  abstract     = {Non-Abelian gauge theories provide the most accurate description of fundamental interactions, showing remarkable agreement with experimental data in cosmology and particle physics. Highly precise predictions can be made using standard techniques, both in the continuum and in the lattice frameworks. However, classical methods have limitations, particularly when attempting to extrapolate the continuum limit from the study of lattice gauge theories. Complementing classical computations or combining them with quantum computational methods, to improve the predictions toward the continuum limit with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators, and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.},

  abstract     = {“Strange” metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ( ) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions, such as large- limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a nonperturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance, large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo simulation and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals’ key experimental signature of linear-in- resistivity with a universal “Planckian” transport scattering rate that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point and, instead, arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: A feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated-electron materials.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in tabletop experiments offers the opportunity to show, for the first time, that gravity is not compatible with a classical description. In all current experimental proposals, such as the generation of gravitationally induced entanglement between two quantum sources of gravity, gravitational effects can be explained solely with the Newton potential, namely, in a regime that is consistent with the weak-field limit of general relativity and does not probe the field nature of gravity. Hence, the Newtonian origin of the effects is a limitation to the conclusions on the nature of gravity that can be drawn from these experiments. Here, we identify two effects that overcome this limitation: They cannot be reproduced using the Newton potential, and they are independent of graviton emission. First, we show that the interaction between two generic quantum sources of gravity, e.g., in wide Gaussian states, cannot be reproduced with the Newton potential nor with a known classical theory of gravity. Second, we show that the quantum commutator between the gravitational field and its canonically conjugate momentum appears as an additional term in the relative phase of a generic quantum source interacting with a test particle. Observing these two effects would give further quantitative information and stronger evidence, compared to experiments only involving the Newton potential, to show that gravity is nonclassical. More broadly, identifying stronger quantum aspects of gravity than those reproducible with the Newton potential is crucial to prove the nonclassicality of gravity and to plan a new generation of experiments testing quantum aspects of gravity in a broader sense than what has been proposed so far.},

Such modulated angular spectra arise as a result of the direct interaction between the ultrarelativistic electron beam and the laser driver in the presence of the wakefield. A constrained theoretical model for the coupled oscillator, assisted by a genetic algorithm, can recreate the experimental electron spectra and, thus, fully reconstructs the longitudinal phase-space distribution of the electron beam with a temporal resolution of approximately 1.3 fs. In particular, it reveals the slice energy spread of the electron beam, which is important to measure for applications such as x-ray free electron lasers. In our experiment, the root-mean-square slice energy spread retrieved is bounded at 9.9 MeV, corresponding to a 0.9%–3.0% relative spread, despite the overall GeV energy beam having approximately 100% relative energy spread.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of biological materials are spatially heterogeneous. Typical tissues are made up of a spanning fibrous extracellular matrix in which various inclusions, such as living cells, are embedded. While the influence of embedded inclusions on the stiffness of common elastic materials such as rubber has been studied for decades and can be understood in terms of the volume fraction and shape of inclusions, the same is not true for disordered filamentous and fibrous networks. Recent work has shown that, in isolation, such networks exhibit unusual viscoelastic behavior indicative of an underlying mechanical phase transition controlled by network connectivity and strain. How this behavior is modified when inclusions are present is unclear. Here, we present a theoretical and computational study of the influence of rigid inclusions on the mechanics of disordered elastic networks near the connectivity-controlled central-force rigidity transition. Combining scaling theory and coarse-grained simulations, we predict and confirm an anomalously strong dependence of the composite stiffness on inclusion volume fraction, beyond that seen in ordinary composites. This stiffening exceeds the well-established volume-fraction-dependent stiffening expected in conventional composites, e.g., as an elastic analog of the classic volume-fraction-dependent increase in the viscosity of liquids first identified by Einstein. We show that this enhancement is a consequence of the interplay between interparticle spacing and an emergent correlation length, leading to an effective finite-size scaling imposed by the presence of inclusions. We outline the expected scaling of the linear shear modulus and strain fluctuations with the inclusion volume fraction and network connectivity, confirm these predictions in simulations, and discuss potential experimental tests and implications for our predictions in real systems.},

Recently, this classification has been extended to the setting of adaptive finite-depth local unitary (AFDLU) circuits, which allow global classical communication. In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all topological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete classification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results on solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with irrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic anyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological phase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition, we introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and symmetry twist defects in solvable anyon theories. We apply our procedure to the quantum double of the group and to several examples that are beyond solvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the Tambara-Yamagami string net, and doubled anyons.},

  abstract     = {Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a nonvanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system’s nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean noninvariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.},

Our results provide direct evidence that ultrafast excitation of LaTe 3 leads to formation of topological vortex strings of the charge density wave. These dislocations of the charge density wave exhibit anomalous, subdiffusive dynamics, slowing the equilibration process, providing rare insight into the nonequilibrium mesoscopic response in a quantum material.

Traditional approaches require complex device architectures, involving separate spin-injection, ferromagnetic, and optically active layers. Recently, the emergence of 2D semiconductor moiré superlattices with flat Chern bands and strong light-matter interactions has established a simple yet powerful platform for exploring the coupling between photon, electron, and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report efficient current control of spontaneous ferromagnetism and associated helicity of light emission in moiré MoTe 2 bilayer—a system which hosts a rich variety of topological phases, including newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators. We show that the current control is effective over a wide range of doping of the first moiré Chern band, implying the uniformity of the Berry curvature distribution over the flat band. By setting the system into the anomalous Hall metal phase, a current as small as 10 nA is sufficient to switch the magnetic order, a substantial improvement over both conventional spin-torque architectures and other moiré systems. The realized current control of ferromagnetism leads to continuous tuning of trion photoluminescence helicity from left to right circular via spin-valley Hall torque at zero magnetic field.

An example is an electrical contrastive local learning network of nodes connected by edges that adjust their conductances during training. When an edge conductance changes, it upsets the current balance of every node. In response, physics adjusts the node voltages to minimize the dissipated power. Learning in these systems is therefore a coupled double-optimization process, in which the network descends both a cost landscape in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances and a physical landscape—the power dissipation—in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. Because of this coupling, the physical landscape of a trained network contains information about the learned task. Here, we derive a structure-function relation for trained tunable networks and demonstrate that all the physical information relevant to the trained input-output relation can be captured by a tuning susceptibility, an experimentally measurable quantity. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations to show that the tuning susceptibility is correlated with functional importance and that we can extract physical insight into how the system performs the task from the conductances of highly susceptible edges. Our analysis is general and can be applied directly to mechanical networks, such as networks trained for protein-inspired function such as allostery.},

This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback’s causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol.

In this paper, we advance arrays of solid-state quantum memories toward their usage as random-access quantum memory. We perform quantum storage of path and time-bin qubits implemented with weak coherent states at the single-photon level, in an array of ten temporally multiplexed memory cells with controllable addressing. The qubits can be stored in arbitrary combinations of memory cells, from which they are read out on demand. We find average fidelities of for path qubits and for time-bin qubits. The measured fidelities violate the classical bounds for both encodings and for all ten cells. We also sequentially store a time-bin qubit in two different memory cells, maintain both qubits simultaneously in the array, and perform a collective readout. The individual control paired with high storage fidelity represents a significant advance toward a solid-state random-access quantum memory for quantum repeaters and photonic quantum processors.},

  abstract     = {We present the theoretical derivation and numerical implementation of the linear-response equations for relativistic quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT). In contrast to previous works based on the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, our approach describes electrons interacting with photonic cavity modes at the four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham level, derived from fully relativistic QED through a series of established approximations. Moreover, we show that a new type of spin-orbit-like (SO) cavity-mediated interaction appears under the relativistic description of the coupling of matter with quantized cavity modes. Benchmark calculations performed for atoms of group 12 elements (Zn, Cd, Hg) demonstrate how a relativistic treatment enables the description of exciton polaritons that arise from the hybridization of formally forbidden singlet-triplet transitions with cavity modes. For atoms in cavities tuned on resonance with a singlet-triplet transition, we discover a significant interplay between SO effects and coupling to an off-resonant intense singlet-singlet transition. This dynamic relationship highlights the crucial role of ab initio approaches in understanding cavity quantum electrodynamics. Finally, using the mercury porphyrin complex as an example, we show that relativistic linear-response QEDFT provides computationally feasible first-principles calculations of polaritonic states in large heavy-element-containing molecules of chemical interest.},

Here, we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to 50 kHz using laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling atomic clocks with reduced systematic errors.

Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations, and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.},

  abstract     = {Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors through electrostatic doping provides crucial insight into the composition of the many excitonic complexes that are routinely observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers (e.g., spin and valley) of the resident carriers with applied magnetic fields and doping levels, as well as by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole ( ) pair through optical polarization. Here, we discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. Based on the carrier density, magnetic field, and light polarization, all optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the broadening and decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moiré heterobilayer semiconductor systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral-exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.},

  abstract     = {The history of astronomy has shown that advances in sensing methods open up new windows to the Universe and often lead to unexpected discoveries. Quantum sensor networks in combination with traditional astronomical observations are emerging as a novel modality for multimessenger astronomy. Here we develop a generic analysis framework that uses a data-driven approach to model the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network to astrophysical signals as a consequence of beyond-the-standard model (BSM) physics. The analysis method evaluates correlations between sensors to search for BSM signals coincident with astrophysical triggers, such as black hole mergers, supernovae, or fast radio bursts. Complementary to astroparticle approaches that search for particlelike signals (e.g., weakly interacting massive particles), quantum sensors are sensitive to wavelike signals from exotic quantum fields. This analysis method can be applied to networks of different types of quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, matter-wave interferometers, and nuclear clocks, which can probe many types of interactions between BSM fields and standard model particles. We use this analysis method to carry out the first direct search utilizing a terrestrial network of precision quantum sensors for BSM fields emitted during a black hole merger. Specifically, we use the global network of optical magnetometers for exotic physics (GNOME) to perform a search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated in coincidence with a gravitational-wave signal from a binary black hole merger (GW200311_115853) detected by LIGO/Virgo on the March 11, 2020. The associated gravitational wave heralds the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts with the spins of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multimessenger astronomy. Our search found no significant events and, consequently, we place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.},

  abstract     = {In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of a renormalization group (RG) map. The traditional way to find the fixed-point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here, we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed-point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations—linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90° rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and three-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension χ = 30 , we find the fixed-point tensors with 10 − 9 accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.},

This result arises from a general relation among dynamical α -Rényi entropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of α close enough to 1, and, moreover, to initial pure states with low entanglement, of the order of log L , that are typically represented by critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an efficient matrix product state representation that persists at least up to times of the order of log L . The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on α -Rényi entropies, and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.},

They can propagate and carry information and energy in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers, and cold atoms, but propagating breathers have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in nonreciprocal, nonconservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations, and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schrödinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear nonreciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided that (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation when a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation is struck and (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Importantly, discrete effects tend to stabilize these nonreciprocal breathers over a wider range of initial conditions. Our work establishes nonreciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter, and superconducting circuits.},

Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fan-outs. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. Experimentally we find that changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV can tune the exchange energy from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {The transport of DNA polymers through nanoscale pores is central to many biological processes, from bacterial gene exchange to viral infection. In single-molecule nanopore sensing, the detection of nucleic acid and protein analytes relies on the passage of a long biopolymer through a nanoscale aperture. Understanding the dynamics of polymer translocation through nanopores, especially the relation between ionic current signal and polymer conformations, is thus essential for the successful identification of targets. Here, by analyzing ionic current traces of dsDNA translocation, we reveal that features up to now uniquely associated with knots are instead different structural motifs: plectonemes. By combining experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that such plectonemes form because of the solvent flow that induces rotation of the helical DNA fragment in the nanopore, causing torsion propagation outwards from the pore. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that plectoneme nucleation is dominated by the applied torque, while the translocation time and size of the plectonemes depend on the coupling of torque and pulling force, a mechanism that might also be relevant for in vivo DNA organization. Experiments with nicked DNA constructs show that the number of plectonemes depends on the rotational constraints of the translocating molecules. Thus, our work introduces plectonemes as essential structural features that must be considered for accurate analysis of dsDNA polymers in the nanopore.},

  abstract     = {Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snakelike self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.},

  abstract     = {The non-Hermitian skin effect characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon—the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect—which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form—a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.},

We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable model and a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the -quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or -edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions.

  abstract     = {Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of binary black-hole (BBH) coalescences are expected to address outstanding questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Inference of BBH parameters relies on waveform models, and realizing the full discovery potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and new ground-based facilities (such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) hinges on the accuracy of these waveform models. Using linear-signal approximation methods and Bayesian analysis, we start to assess our readiness for what lies ahead using two state-of-the-art quasicircular, spin-precessing models: seobnr v5 phm and imrp henom xphm . We find that systematic biases increase with the spin of the BH, with parameter biases being approximately 6 to 8 times likelier, if the primary-spin magnitude exceeds 0.5 compared to when it is less than 0.5. Additionally, we ascertain that current waveforms can accurately recover the distribution of masses in the LVK astrophysical population but not spins. Upon exploring the broader parameter space of BHs, we find that systematic biases increase with detector-frame total mass, binary asymmetry, and spin precession, with a majority of such binaries incurring parameter biases, extending up to redshifts around 3 in future detectors. Furthermore, we examine three “golden” events characterized by mass ratios of approximately 6 to 10, significant spin magnitudes ( ), and high precession, evaluating how systematic biases may affect their scientific outcomes. Our findings reveal that current waveforms fail to enable the unbiased measurement of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter and sky localization from loud signals, even for current detectors. Moreover, highly asymmetric systems within the lower BH mass gap exhibit biased measurements of the secondary-companion mass, which impacts the physics of both neutron stars and formation channels. Similarly, we deduce that the primary mass of massive binaries ( ) will also be biased, affecting supernova physics. Future progress in analytical calculations and numerical-relativity simulations, crucial for calibrating the models, must target regions of the parameter space with significant biases to develop more accurate models. Only then can precision GW astronomy fulfill the promise it holds.},

The “charge insulators” include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin- electrons). We find that charge fluctuations exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the transition: in Landau Fermi liquids and in charge insulators, where is the linear size of the subsystem. In composite Fermi liquids, under certain conditions, we also identify a universal constant term when the subsystem geometry contains a sharp corner, where denotes a function of the corner angle and is the Hall conductivity. At the critical point, provided the transition is continuous, the leading scaling is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution with the same angle dependence , and the universal coefficient is directly related to the predicted universal jumps in longitudinal and Hall resistivities. These results establish fluctuation-transport relations, paving the way for numerical and experimental studies of unconventional quantum criticalities in metals.},

  abstract     = {The bootstrap method aims to solve problems by imposing constraints on the space of physical observables, which often follow from physical assumptions such as positivity and symmetry. Here, we employ a bootstrap approach to study interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level by minimizing the energy as a function of the static structure factor subject to a set of constraints, bypassing the need to construct the full many-body wave function. This approach rigorously lower bounds the ground state energy, making it complementary to conventional variational upper bounds. We show that the lower bound we obtain is relatively tight, within at most a few percent from the ground state energy computed with exact diagonalization at small system sizes, and generally gets tighter as we include more constraints. We also show that, by combining the bootstrap lower bounds with variational Monte Carlo calculations for various quantum Hall states, we can obtain two-sided bounds on the ground state energy that rigorously bounds the error to below a few percentage for large system sizes where exact diagonalization is not accessible. Beyond the energetics, our results reproduce the correct power law dependence of the pair correlation function at short distances and the existence of a large entanglement gap in the two-particle entanglement spectra for the Laughlin states at . We further identify signatures of the composite Fermi liquid state close to half filling. This shows that the bootstrap approach is capable, in principle, of describing nontrivial gapped topologically ordered, as well as gapless, phases. We further study the evolution of the ground state energy and correlation functions as we interpolate between the lowest and first Landau levels at half filling and find indications of a phase transition from a composite Fermi liquid to a non-Abelian state. We also discuss more generally how the geometry of the allowed set of structure factors can be used to diagnose phase transitions. At the end, we discuss possible extensions and current limitations of this approach and how they can be overcome in future studies. Our work establishes numerical bootstrap as a promising method to study many-body phases in topological bands, paving the way to its application in moiré platforms where the energetic competition between fractional quantum anomalous Hall, symmetry broken, and gapless states remains poorly understood.},

  abstract     = {Multi- magnetic structures on two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a key route to realizing topological physics in 2D magnetism. A major experimental challenge is to unambiguously confirm their formation by excluding the possibility of topologically trivial multidomain single- or double- magnetic orders, which cannot be distinguished using conventional diffraction techniques. Here, we propose that long-wavelength spin dynamics offers a universal diagnostic for triangular lattices: Triple- orders that preserve rotational symmetry and single- or double- orders that break it exhibit qualitatively distinct anisotropies in their Goldstone-mode velocities, stemming from fundamental differences in their underlying spin configurations. We validate this concept using the metallic triangular-lattice antiferromagnet , which hosts both a stripe-type single- state and a triple- tetrahedral ordering at different temperatures. Using inelastic neutron-scattering and spin dynamics simulations, we first refine the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the paramagnetic excitation spectra, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. We then show that the observed velocity profiles of the Goldstone modes agree with the high-temperature model’s predictions: markedly anisotropic for the single- phase and near isotropic for the triple- phase. Importantly, this contrast persists across various exchange parameters, highlighting its model-independent nature and suggesting potential applicability to other 2D lattice systems. Beyond the long-wavelength regime, we present a substantial discrepancy between the measured and simulated magnon spectra exclusively in the triple- phase. We attribute this discrepancy to magnon energy renormalization arising from order-of-magnitude-enhanced magnon-magnon interactions in the triple- phase, due to its noncollinear configuration. This work provides universal insight into the dynamical properties of topological multi- magnetic orderings in 2D lattice structures, offering a broadly applicable diagnostic to distinguishing them from topologically trivial single- or double- counterparts. The unequivocal confirmation of the triple- structure in further establishes it as a prominent material platform for exploring topological spin textures in the genuine 2D limit.},

From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory.

We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of nonclassical states, such as high-photon-number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting transition-edge sensors are renowned for their extraordinary photon sensitivity and energy resolution, finding applications spanning quantum information, astronomy, and nanophotonics. Here, we report the development of bolometric superconducting optical nanoscopy (BOSON), a novel platform that integrates bolometric detection at the superconducting transition edges with near-field optical techniques. BOSON enables the mapping of photoinduced changes in superconductivity with unprecedented spatial resolution and photon sensitivity. By incorporating BOSON with low-dimensional materials, we achieved polariton imaging at nanowatt excitation levels—at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the power typically required in prior near-field nanoscopy experiments. Our findings highlight the potential for BOSON to advance scanning-probe-based optical platforms to enable the detection of photons, polaritons, and Cooper pair dynamics at the nanoscale. This paves the way for quantum sensing applications using single-polariton detection and can offer deeper insights into quasiparticle dynamics.},

The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect was recently observed in an RSG-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moiré heterostructure when the conduction electrons were pushed away from the moiré interface by an applied electric displacement field. The question then arises about whether such topological states can also develop in RSG-hBN in a strong moiré potential. Here, we explore the physics in the moiré-proximal limit through capacitance measurements that allow us to determine the electronic compressibility and extract energy gaps of incompressible states. We report the observation of integer and fractional Chern insulator states at low magnetic field in this limit at filling factors ν = 1 , 2 / 3 , and 1 / 3 in addition to numerous trivial and topological charge density waves. We map out a correlated phase diagram that is highly sensitive to both displacement and magnetic fields, establishing the moiré-proximal regime as a tunable platform for studying the interplay between band topology and strong lattice effects.},

We propose a testable microscopic description of these phenomena, based on the notion that as the system ages, the density of local barriers that enable relaxation displays a slowly evolving gap. As a result, the relaxation dynamics is dominated by the activation of the lowest, extremal tail of the distribution. This framework predicts logarithmic creep, as well as correlated bursts of slow activated rearrangements, or “thermal avalanches,” whose size grows logarithmically with their duration. The time interval between events within avalanches obeys a universal power-law distribution, with a cutoff that is simply proportional to the age of the system. We show that these predictions hold both in numerical models of amorphous solids, as well as in experiments with thin crumpled sheets. This analysis suggests that the heterogeneous dynamics occurring during logarithmic creep is related to other phenomena, including dynamical heterogeneities characterizing the glass transition.},

Much insight has been gained by the study of multicomponent FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multicomponent FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature is also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study “hetero-orbital” two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multicomponent interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between and electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-vortex and reverse-vortex attachment composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.},

Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasiadiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.},

Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding gauge field across various flux-crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two nontrivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to U(1), SU(N) lattice gauge theories.},

Predicting and understanding the emergence of fractional Chern insulators in a Chern band, to a large extent, relies on judging the similarity between the Chern band and LLs. In this work, we generalize the notion of LLs to Chern bands to allow for nonuniform quantum geometries while preserving certain geometric invariants. Mathematically, generalized LLs can be understood in terms of holomorphic curves and associated moving frames in the sense of Cartan. This formalism enables a thorough analytical discussion of their associated quantum geometries. In practical terms, generalized LLs allow for a systematic discussion of the geometric stability of fractional Chern insulators and provide useful guidance in material design. Approximating Chern bands as superpositions of a few generalized LLs and employing exact diagonalization, we numerically identify a universal geometric criterion for the non-Abelian Moore-Read state to be stabilized in Chern bands, providing useful guidance for searching for such phase in moiré materials. Moreover, a double-twisted bilayer graphene model at the second magic angle is used to suggest a possible experimental realization of generalized LLs and zero-field non-Abelian phases. More broadly, our results point to generalized LLs being an interdisciplinary research direction connecting Kähler geometry, topologically ordered phases, and moiré materials, which we expect will benefit the study of the geometric aspect of correlated phases in a more general sense.},

First, we demonstrate robust measurement-enhanced tweezer preparation at a record fidelity using site-resolved error detection followed by tweezer movement. Second, using a new hyperfine qubit encoding well suited for use as a quantum memory, we demonstrate site-resolved detection of qubit leakage errors (erasures) induced by blackbody radiation. This approach constitutes the first demonstration of erasure conversion in molecules, a capability that has found recent interest in quantum error correction. Our work opens the door to new possibilities with molecular tweezer arrays: Measurement-enhanced preparation opens access to mesoscopic defect-free molecular arrays that are important for quantum simulation of interacting many-body systems; erasure conversion in molecular arrays lays the technical groundwork for midcircuit detection, an important capability for explorations in quantum information processing.},

Because of interactions and intrinsic dynamics, the system units are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating from quantum physics to systematically reduce multidimensional systems to an effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are able not only to investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study epidemic, ecological, and economic systems.},

Performing a joint fit of all experiments under the assumption of an isotropic flux, the best-fit single-flavor flux normalization is in the 90% energy range of the KM3NeT event. Furthermore, the ultrahigh-energy data are then fit together with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, either with a single power law or with a broken power law, allowing for the presence of a new component in the spectrum. A slight preference for a break in the PeV regime is found for one of the three investigated IceCube samples and no such preference for the other two.

  abstract     = {The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of over 100 NV centers in parallel. We show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 108 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 5778 unique correlation coefficients. We discuss how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable parallelized high-throughput sensing experiments that retain the spatial resolution of single defects and will, thereby, help to unlock advances in applications such as single-molecule NMR and characterization of integrated circuits. In addition, our approach to multiplexing provides a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.},

Here, we design and implement a multiplexed NV sensing platform that allows us to read out many single NV centers simultaneously using a low-noise camera. Using this platform, we coherently manipulate and read out the spin states of hundreds of individual NV centers in parallel, achieving comparable magnetic field sensitivity to confocal measurements. We also implement a parallelized version of spin-to-charge-conversion readout for low NV center spin state readout noise and use it to demonstrate multiplexed covariance magnetometry, in which we measure ten two-point magnetic field correlators from five NV centers simultaneously. From these measurements, we demonstrate the quantitative reconstruction of spatially varying magnetic correlations arising from a current-carrying wire. The number of correlators we can measure is limited only by the available laser power, opening the door to massively multiplexed covariance magnetometry. In contrast to scanning probes for imaging spatially varying magnetic fields, our approach measures the temporal dynamics of the magnetic field at many precisely defined positions simultaneously, from which the local noise spectrum and nonlocal properties such as correlation functions can be computed. This high-fidelity readout platform will find immediate applications in studying condensed matter phenomena that are characterized by the noise spectrum or correlation functions, including quantum phase transitions, dynamics far from equilibrium, magnetic order, and correlated electron phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Network backbones provide useful sparse representations of weighted networks by keeping only their most important links, permitting a range of computational speedups and simplifying network visualizations. A key limitation of existing network backboning methods is that they either require the specification of a free parameter (e.g., significance level) that determines the number of edges to keep in the backbone or impose specific restrictions on the topology of the backbone (e.g., that it is a spanning tree). Here we develop a completely nonparametric framework for inferring the backbone of a weighted network that overcomes these limitations and automatically selects the optimal set of edges to retain using the minimum description length principle. We develop objective functions for global and local network backboning which evaluate the importance of an edge in the context of the whole network and individual node neighborhoods, respectively, and are generalizable to any weight distribution under Bayesian model specifications that fix the average edge weight either exactly or in expectation. We then construct an efficient and provably optimal greedy algorithm to identify the backbone minimizing our objectives, whose run-time complexity is log-linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate our methods by comparing them with existing methods in a range of tasks on real and synthetic networks, finding that both the global and local backboning methods can preserve network connectivity, weight heterogeneity, and spreading dynamics while removing a substantial fraction of edges.},

  abstract     = {Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies, especially those elucidating the correlation between orbital selectivity and magnetism, remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome single crystal, and report the coexistence of orbital-selective dual-band modulations ( , ) within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft x-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, neutron powder diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and density-functional-theory calculations, we identify these dual-band reconstructions as manifestations of the AFM order driven by a (approximately , 0.28, 0) nesting instability of the intercalated Tb orbitals. These orbital-selective modulations induce unusual momentum-dependent band folding and lead to the emergence of Dirac cones only at the point, signaling a topological phase transition in the AFM state. Importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective (approximately , 0.28, 0) AFM order offers crucial insights into the mechanism underlying the fractional magnetization plateau in this kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of ( ) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.},

  abstract     = {We study the emergence of strong interactions between dissipative coherent structures (pulses) in spatially extended systems. Focusing first on a prototypical model problem from fluid dynamics, that of liquid film flowing down a vertical plane, we show that under certain conditions, a two-pulse system undergoes a transition from a regime of decaying oscillatory dynamics to one with self-sustained oscillations. Intriguingly, such a transition is not governed by the standard Hopf bifurcation. Instead, a novel governing mechanism for transition to oscillatory dynamics is unraveled via a peculiar and atypical Hopf bifurcation in which a complex-conjugate resonance pair crosses the imaginary axis in the complex plane. Prior to crossing the essential spectrum (including at the bifurcation point), this resonance pair does not appear in the standard L C 2 -based spectral analysis but reveals itself when appropriate weighted functional spaces are used. We show that such a resonance pair originates from the splitting of a resonance pole of the single-pulse system. While this object is not part of the classical spectrum, it plays a vital role in shaping the system’s dynamics. We further demonstrate that this resonance-pole mechanism extends to a broad range of systems. Specifically, in the generalised Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation—a model prototype applicable across a wide range of fields from fluid dynamics to geophysics and plasma physics—we observe the same bifurcation and resulting oscillatory pulse interactions. By contrast, in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model—a central model prototype in reaction-diffusion systems—the resonance pole splits into real eigenvalues, and monotonic pulse interactions occur. In addition, we illustrate that the resonance pole may induce oscillatory interactions in three-pulse systems and eventually lead to chaotic dynamics in strongly interacting multipulse systems, which can be quantified in terms of a positive Lyapunov exponent.},

However, studying H 2 + experimentally presents significant challenges: Standard control methods such as laser cooling are not applicable due to the long lifetimes of its rotational and vibrational states. Here, we solve this issue by combining buffer gas cooling to quench the H 2 + rovibrational excitation with quantum logic operations between H 2 + and a cotrapped “helper” ion to control the molecule’s hyperfine structure. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control, and nondestructive readout, which we use to demonstrate high-resolution microwave spectroscopy in the hyperfine structure of H 2 + with a precision of 2 Hz. Our results pave the way for high-precision spectroscopy of H 2 + in both the microwave and optical domains. Because of the wide applicability of buffer gas cooling, our method provides a general tool for molecular ion species that are hard to control with quantum logic tools alone.},

  abstract     = {Many hot, diffuse astrophysical plasmas are collisionless, with collision times that exceed dynamical timescales of interest. Without a standard viscosity, the mechanisms by which mechanical energy dissipates into heat via a turbulent cascade are complex and nonuniversal, with important consequences for the partition of heat between different species and directions. Recent theory has argued that in some parameter regimes a barrier to the turbulent cascade of energy forms at small scales, profoundly altering the nature of the heating of the plasma by changing how fluctuations dissipate. The solar wind is an environment, when in this parameter regime, where such a barrier would be expected to form. Here, using data from NASA’s Parker Solar Probe , we find that the shape of the magnetic energy spectrum around ion scales varies with solar wind parameters in a manner consistent with the presence of the barrier. This allows us to identify critical values of parameters necessary for the barrier to form; we show that the barrier appears fully developed for ion plasma beta of below ≃ 0.5 and becomes increasingly prominent with increasing normalized cross helicity (the difference in energy in wave packets propagating parallel and antiparallel to the background magnetic field) for values greater than ≃ 0.4 . As these conditions are frequently met in the solar wind, particularly close to the Sun, our results suggest that the barrier is likely playing a significant role in turbulent dissipation in the solar wind and so is an important mechanism in explaining its heating and acceleration.},

  abstract     = {The recently introduced “fuzzy-sphere” method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the noncommutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor , while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: How finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall state—a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the fractional quantum Hall spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically ordered states.},

  abstract     = {The traditional view of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnets is that it arises from the magnetization perpendicular to the measurement plane and that there is a linear dependence on the latter. Underlying such a view is the thinking that the AHE is a time-reversal symmetry breaking phenomenon and can therefore be treated in terms of a power series in the magnetic order. However, this view is squarely challenged by a number of recent experiments, urging for a thorough theoretical investigation on the fundamental level. We find that for strong magnets, it is more appropriate and fruitful to regard the AHE as a spin-group symmetry breaking phenomenon where the critical parameter is the spin-orbit interaction strength, which involves a much smaller energy scale. In collinear ferromagnets, the spin-orbit coupling breaks the ∞ 2 ′ spin rotation symmetry, and the key to characterizing such symmetry breaking is the identification of spin-orbit vectors which transform regularly under spin-group operations. Born out of our framework is a rich multipolar relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and the magnetization direction, with each pole being expanded progressively in powers of the spin-orbit coupling strength. For the leading order contribution, i.e., the dipole, its isotropic part corresponds to the traditional view, and its anisotropic part can lead to the in-plane AHE where the magnetization lies within the measurement plane. Beyond the dipolar structure, the octupolar structure offers the leading order source of nonlinearity and hence introduces unique anisotropy where the dipolar structure cannot. Our theory thus offers a unified explanation for the in-plane AHE recently observed in various ferromagnets, and further extends the candidate material systems. It can also be generalized to study the anomalous Hall effect in crystals with any periodic spin structure and to study the nonlinear Hall effect and the spin Hall effect. Our theory lays the ground for decoding the coupling between various transport and optical phenomena and the magnetic orders.},

  abstract     = {Spin-forbidden ( Δ S ≠ 0 ) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals ferromagnet (FM) CrI 3 . Previously unreported spin-forbidden ( Δ S = 1 ) A 4 2 g → E 2 g / T 2 1 g Cr 3 + d d excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr 3 + multiplet character is established through complementary Cr L 3 -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements along with charge-transfer multiplet calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series ( Cr X 3 , X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness-dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit, and we observe a significant magnetic-field dependence of the MCD spectrum across the antiferromagnetic-to-FM transition in few-layer samples. We preliminarily attribute this behavior to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI 3 and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.},

  abstract     = {The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wave-function deformations and quantum channels acting on D 4 TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with D 4 symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O(2) loop model in the pure state case and n coupled O(2) loop models for Rényi- n quantities in the decoherence case—corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension 2. In particular, we find that the purity ( n = 2 ) remains deep in the D 4 TO for any decoherence strength, while the n → ∞ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wave-function deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ( n → 1 ) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these statistical mechanical models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the D 4 TO in addition to critical phases with emergent U(1) symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules. This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders and which in an ungauged formulation provides examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.},

  abstract     = {Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently, a strong notion of quantum ergodicity has been proposed, namely, that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity . Here, we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition exhibits universal properties on a quantitative level among a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. For an open system, where the environment is uncontrolled, we predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate between candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. This allows for computationally efficient experimental noise learning and, more broadly, is a new avenue for quantitatively classifying the behavior of noisy quantum systems. Ultimately, our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.},

These multidisciplinary questions range from understanding the vicinity of a black hole to unveiling the nature of neutrino mass, among other topics. Additionally, we critically review the current experimental capabilities and their limitations and, from there, discuss the interplay between different proposed neutrino telescope technologies and analysis techniques. We firmly believe that achieving the immense discovery potential over the next two decades demands a model of global partnership and specialized, complementary detectors.

  abstract     = {The topological understanding of nematic liquid crystals has traditionally centered on defects and their classification via homotopy invariants. Here, we draw upon several aspects of Morse theory to describe a finer approach to topology that characterizes the isotopy invariants within a given homotopy class. This approach unifies various disparate ideas in liquid crystal physics, including the homotopy and Volterra classifications of defects, the winding and self-linking of disclinations, and the Pontryagin-Thom construction. Specifically, we use singularity theory and dividing curves to characterize nematic textures via tomography, as well as to provide a full topological classification of the rewiring and crossing of disclination lines. This process reveals the central role that nonsingular but nontrivial topological solitons—so-called merons—play in mediating interactions between disclination lines. We also clarify the notion of the charge of a disclination line, give a simple method for computing it, and apply this to examples drawn from experiment. In particular, this method shows that restricting a disclination line’s charge modulo 2 is incorrect; we construct examples of disclinations with point defect charges 0 and , which have the same local structure but very different global structures, underscoring the need for a more nuanced topological understanding of nematic systems.},

Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e., a set of quantitative and transferable “ground rules,” remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever—a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation—governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: A structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long-range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of nonallosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally nonlinear and nonreciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and “pseudoproteins”—networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.},

However, existing control and measurement schemes for qudit systems scale unfavorably with qudit dimension since they decompose operations into series of qubitlike rotations and perform measurements on a small number of states [2–6]. Here, we address these challenges by employing simultaneous multifrequency drives to generate rotations and projections in an effective spin- system mapped onto the energy eigenstates of a superconducting circuit. We implement single-shot readout of the eight states using a multitone dispersive readout ( ) and exploit the strong nonlinearity in a high- transmon to simultaneously address each transition and realize a spin displacement operator. Combining this displacement operator with a virtual SNAP gate, we realize arbitrary single-qudit unitary operations in physical pulses and extract spin displacement gate fidelities ranging from 0.997 to 0.989 for virtual spins of size to . We demonstrate the potential of our control scheme in three ways: the direct measurement of the spin qudit Wigner function, randomized benchmarking of a logical qubit encoded into the qudit state, and randomized benchmarking of the full qudit Clifford group. In the latter experiment, we implement the -dimensional quantum Fourier transform with an average gate fidelity of 0.91(6) in . Our multifrequency approach to qudit control and measurement can be readily extended to other physical platforms that realize a multilevel system coupled to a cavity and can become a building block for efficient qudit-based quantum computation and simulation.},

While direct optical-field-driven electron emission and acceleration within the single optical subcycle provides a straightforward solution for ultrafast electron generation, achieving precise control over the emission process to generate high-quality electron beams suitable for practical applications remains challenging. Here, we present THz-driven subcycle electron field emission in a ridged waveguide cavity, achieving the first practical high-energy femtosecond field-emission source. This ridged cavity is engineered to spatially and temporally confine the electric field, effectively minimizing dispersion and suppressing field leakage. Through carrier-envelope phase control of the THz field, we achieve subcycle field emission, generating, for the first time, isolated electron bunches with a 940-fs (FWHM) duration. Using dual ( ) of THz energy, we achieve a peak field strength of approximately , accelerating electrons to a record energy of 46 keV with a charge of 2 pC per bunch, thereby enabling single-shot imaging. The high-field strength suppresses emittance blowup due to space-charge effects, ensuring excellent beam quality. The generated electron pulse exhibits high stability. As an initial application, we investigate transient electric-field dynamics in real time and space using time-resolved schlieren radiography with this field-emission electron source. These proof-of-principle results signify a critical advancement in developing compact, high-performance electron sources for user-oriented applications.},

This analysis applies even in materials with no bulk magnetoelectric response or net surface magnetization. We then demonstrate our arguments for two example antiferromagnets, topological semimetal CuMnAs and rocksalt NiO. We find that the (010) and surfaces of CuMnAs and NiO, respectively, exhibit a series of antiferroically, as well as roughness-sensitive, ferroically ordered, modifications of the surface magnetic dipole moments, via canting or changes in sublattice magnitude, consistent with the bulk ordering of the magnetic multipoles. Our findings demonstrate a universal bulk-boundary correspondence allowing the general prediction of minimal possible surface and interface magnetic modifications, even in materials with no net magnetoelectric response.

Statistical physics provides powerful tools to study the functioning of learning with neural networks and has played a recognized role in the development of modern machine learning. The statistical physics approach relies on simplified and analytically tractable models of data. However, simple tractable models for long sequences of high-dimensional tokens are largely underexplored. Inspired by the crucial role models such as the single-layer teacher-student perceptron (also known as generalized linear regression) played in the theory of fully connected neural networks, in this paper, we introduce and study the bilinear sequence regression (BSR) as one of the most basic models for sequences of tokens. We note that modern architectures naturally subsume the BSR model due to the skip connections. Building on recent methodological progress, we compute the Bayes-optimal generalization error for the model in the limit of long sequences of high-dimensional tokens and provide a message-passing algorithm that matches this performance. We quantify the improvement that optimal learning brings with respect to vectorizing the sequence of tokens and learning via simple linear regression. We also unveil surprising properties of the gradient descent algorithms in the BSR model.},

  abstract     = {Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.},

  abstract     = {It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM), which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-range-entangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our analysis establishes an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: A quantum state respecting anomalous 1-form symmetries must be long-range entangled and have large GEM. Our results also extend to mixed states, such as the -dephased toric code, providing a provably nontrivial class of intrinsically mixed-state phases.},

Here, we investigate the ordering dynamics in a Fermi gas undergoing a density-wave phase transition induced by quenching infinite-range, cavity-mediated interactions. We observe, in real time, the exponential rise of the order parameter and track its growth over several orders of magnitude. Remarkably, the growth rate can exceed the Fermi energy by an order of magnitude, consistent with predictions from a linearized instability analysis. This case contrasts with the ordering process driven by short-range interactions. We then generalize our results to linear interaction ramps, where deviations from the adiabatic behavior are captured by a simple dynamical ansatz. Our study offers a paradigmatic example of the interplay between strong short- and long-range interactions in quantum nonequilibrium dynamics.},

Using this framework, we develop a specific protocol called edge expanded homological measurement for fault-tolerant measurement of arbitrary logical Pauli operators of general quantum low density parity-check codes, requiring a number of ancillary qubits growing only linearly with the weight of the logical operator measured, and guarantee that the distance of the code is preserved. We further benchmark our protocol numerically in a photonic architecture based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits, showing that the logical error rates of various codes are on par with other methods requiring more ancilla qubits.},

  abstract     = {Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effects under the right conditions. On the other hand, these bands are characterized by concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy usually attributed to local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: Can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier orbitals? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for the flat topological bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wave functions that closely approximate those of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at , giving rise to a small parameter that makes the model analytically tractable. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without invoking any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are nonlocal due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We develop a systematic diagrammatic expansion in which the self-energy can be computed exactly to leading order in in the fluctuating moment regime and predict momentum-resolved spectral functions for future experiments to verify. Our key discovery is a charge-neutrality state we refer to as the “Mott semimetal” characterized by high flavor entropy and a Mott gap that exists throughout most of the Brillouin zone but closes at the point. At , the spectral function contains a single Dirac cone per spin per valley and responds to perturbations in an exotic manner that is distinct from any other theoretical picture of TBG. Away from neutrality, the Mott semimetal gaps out in a spectrally imbalanced manner, with one Mott band having zero quasiparticle residue at the point. The model accurately reproduces results from finite-temperature thermodynamic measurements, leads to new experimental predictions, and resolves the problem of the emergence of Hubbard physics in isolated topological bands.},

  abstract     = {This work describes a blueprint for a process that accelerates progress in science by quantitatively answering the following question: What is the optimal combination of fundamental-science and application-driven experiments to maximally reduce pertinent data uncertainties? Answering this question entails solving a high-dimensional and complex optimization problem that is best solved with advanced statistic techniques often classified as machine learning. We apply this process within the framework of nuclear data with the aim to select an experiment combination that will reduce uncertainties in nuclear data for neutron energies between 1 and 600 keV. In this field, fundamental-physics driven data, called differential , look at one nuclear physics observable at a time. They are contrasted to application-driven, integral , data where one or few resulting values inform a broad set of nuclear data across several nuclides and energies. The candidates for integral experiments are criticality measurements that were refined by a genetic algorithm to be maximally sensitive to fission cross sections in the desired energy range. Twenty-three candidate differential experiments were investigated and span multiple nuclear physics observables (e.g., total, capture cross sections) for isotopes appearing in the integral experiments. The optimal combination among these candidate experiments was investigated via generalized least squares fitting, augmented with Gaussian processes to ameliorate statistical irregularities in data, and the D-optimality criterion. The latter evaluates for each pair of candidates the joint reduction in uncertainties of all 12200 nuclear data appearing in the integral experiments compared to the knowledge we have from 168 past experiments, theory, and nuclear data. We chose as differential measurements those that investigate and total cross sections, based on D-optimality rank and feasibility constraints. Two integral (criticality) experiments were selected: An experiment with and graphite interleaved with Pu and a thick Cu reflector explores 1–30 keV, while we target the 30–600 keV range with an experiment that swaps boron in place of graphite with a different geometry.},

  abstract     = {Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its statistical analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorized structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case, the information-theoretic limits and an efficient Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called the rotational invariant estimator, are known. Beyond this setting, few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model (as appearing in high-energy physics) due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. In this paper, we make progress toward the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the hidden signal is a factored matrix X X ⊺ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a denoising-factorization transition separating a phase where denoising using the rotational-invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible, though algorithmically hard. We also argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorization, i.e., estimating X itself, becomes possible up to irresolvable ambiguities. On the theoretical side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations reproducible by the replica approach of Sakata and Kabashima. Using numerical insights, we delimit the portion of phase diagram where we conjecture the mean-field theory to be exact and correct it using universality when it is not. Our complete Ansatz matches well the numerics in the whole phase diagram when considering finite-size effects.},

In parallel, in hard condensed matter physics, the concept of topological phases and topological order has been introduced in the context of spin liquids to investigate emergent phenomena like quantum Hall effects and high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we bridge these two seemingly disparate perspectives on topology in physics. Combining experiments and simulations, we show how topological defects in liquid crystals can be used as versatile building blocks to create complex, highly degenerate topological phases, which we refer to as “combinatorial vortex lattices” (CVLs). CVLs exhibit extensive residual entropy and support locally stable quasiparticle excitations in the form of charge-conserving topological monopoles, which can act as mobile information carriers and be linked via Dirac strings. CVLs can be rewritten and reconfigured on demand, endowed with various symmetries, and modified through laser-induced topological surgery—an essential capability for information storage and retrieval. We demonstrate experimentally the realization, stability, and precise optical manipulation of CVLs, thus opening new avenues for understanding and technologically exploiting higher-hierarchy topology in liquid crystals and other ordered media.},

Here, we systematically study CSMLs and propose a general theory and algorithm using little cogroup and coset representatives, which reveals that 12 elementary kinds of CSMLs, determined by the geometric relation of spins and valleys and the essential symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization, are sufficient to fully represent all possible CSMLs. By combining the proposed algorithm and high-throughput first-principles calculations, we predict 38 magnetic point groups and identify 142 experimentally verified AFMs that can realize CSML. Besides predicting new materials, our theory can naturally reveal underlying mechanisms of CSMLs’ responses to external fields. As an example, two qualitatively different types of piezomagnetism via occupation imbalance or spin tilting are predicted in . The algorithm and conclusions can be directly extended to the locking between valley or momentum and any other pseudovector degree of freedom, e.g., Berry curvature, as exemplified in and the new proposed piezo-Hall effect, where a strain can induce a nonzero anomalous Hall conductance.

For sufficiently small values of w and for circuits involving up to 58 qubits, we demonstrate an exponential speedup, albeit of a lower quality than the speedup predicted for the noiseless algorithm.

Despite significant progress in developing phase-change and ferroelectric materials, achieving highly efficient, reversible, rapid switching of optical properties has remained a challenge. Recently, sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in 2D semiconductors, which also host strong excitonic effects. Here, we demonstrate that these materials enable nanosecond ferroelectric switching in the complex refractive index, substantially modulating their linear optical responses. The maximum index modulation reaches about 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and off switching occur within 2.5 ns, with switching energy at femtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic peak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered Coulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new direction for developing high-speed, nonvolatile optical memories and highly efficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices. Additionally, the demonstrated imaging technique offers a rapid method to characterize domains and domain walls in 2D semiconductors with rhombohedral stacking.},

Scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for defect identification in atomically thin materials, and extending it to multilayer and beam-sensitive materials would accelerate their exploration. Here, we establish a comprehensive defect library in a bilayer of the magnetic quasi-1D semiconductor CrSBr by combining atomic-resolution imaging, deep learning, and ab initio calculations. We apply a custom-developed machine learning work flow to detect, classify, and average point vacancy defects. This classification enables us to uncover several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes, combined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes, and lines of vacancy defects that extend over many unit cells. We show that their occurrence is in agreement with our computed structures and binding energy densities, reflecting the intriguing layer interlocked crystal structure of CrSBr. Our ab initio calculations show that the interstitial defect complexes give rise to highly localized electronic states. These states are of particular interest due to the reduced electronic dimensionality and magnetic properties of CrSBr and are, furthermore, predicted to be optically active. Our results broaden the scope of defect studies in challenging materials and reveal new defect types in bilayer CrSBr that can be extrapolated to the bulk and to over 20 materials belonging to the same FeOCl structural family.},

  abstract     = {A novel two-qubit entangling gate for trapped-ion quantum processors is proposed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. During the gate, double-dressed quantum states are created by applying a phase-modulated continuous driving field. The speed of this quantum gate is an order of magnitude higher than that of previously demonstrated rf controlled two-qubit entangling gates in static magnetic field gradients. At the same time, the field driving the gate dynamically decouples the qubits from amplitude and frequency noise, increasing the qubits’ coherence time by 3 orders of magnitude. The gate requires only a single continuous rf field per qubit, making it well suited for scaling a quantum processor to large numbers of qubits. Implementing this entangling gate, we generate the Bell states | Φ + ⟩ and | Ψ + ⟩ in less than or equal to 313 μ s with fidelities up to 98 − 3 + 2 % in a static magnetic gradient of only 19.09 T / m . At higher magnetic field gradients, the entangling gate speed can be further improved to match that of laser-based counterparts.},

However, probing this conjecture on contemporary classical or quantum computers is challenging. We formulate an efficiently implementable multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz model of AdS/CFT, providing a mapping between a ( )-dimensional critical spin system and a ( )-dimensional bulk theory. Using a combination of numerics and analytics, we show that the bulk theory arising from this optimized tensor network furnishes excitations with attractive interactions. Remarkably, these excitations have one- and two-particle energies matching the predictions for matter coupled to AdS gravity at long distances, thus displaying key features of AdS physics. We show that these potentials arise as a direct consequence of entanglement renormalization and discuss how this approach can be used to efficiently simulate bulk dynamics using realistic quantum devices.},

Our work generalizes and simplifies prior work of Hastings [ Quantum 4 , 237 (2020) ], by building on his quantum algorithm for the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem. We achieve our quantum speedup using a general framework based on the Kikuchi method (recovering the quartic speedup for Tensor PCA), and we anticipate it will yield similar speedups for further planted inference problems. These speedups rely on the fact that planted inference problems naturally instantiate the guided sparse Hamiltonian problem.

Recently, the reports of magnetization plateau and magnetic oscillations in a kagome antiferromagnet (YCOB) have made this material a promising candidate for experimentally realizing quantum spin liquid states. Here, we present measurements of the specific heat in YCOB in high magnetic fields (up to 41.5 T) down to 0.46 K, and the plateau feature has been confirmed. Moreover, the temperature dependence of in the vicinity of plateau region can be fitted by a linear in term which indicates the presence of a Dirac spectrum, together with a constant term, which indicates a finite density of states contributed by other spinon Fermi surfaces. Surprisingly, the constant term is highly anisotropic in the direction of the magnetic field. Additionally, we observe a double-peak feature near 30 T above the plateau which is another hallmark of fermionic excitations in the specific heat. This combination of gapless behavior and the double-peak structure strongly suggests that the plateau in YCOB is nontrivial and hosts fermionic quasiparticles.},

The proximity to a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition was initially proposed as a driving force to triplet-pairing superconductivity. However, we find here that long-range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order is established under pressure. The propagation vector of the antiferromagnetic phase is close to a wave vector where antiferromagnetic fluctuations have previously been observed at ambient pressure. These elements support that is a nearly antiferromagnet at ambient pressure.

When electrons couple to the lattice, uniaxial strain can be used to anchor and control this electronic directionality. Here, we reveal an unusual impact of strain on unidirectional “smectic” CDW orders in kagome superconductors AV 3 Sb 5 using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. We discover local decoupling between the smectic electronic director axis and the direction of anisotropic strain. While the two can generally be aligned along the same direction in regions of a small CDW gap, the tendency for alignment decreases in regions where the CDW gap is the largest. This feature, in turn, suggests nanoscale variations in smectic susceptibility, which we attribute to a combination of local strain and electron correlation strength. Overall, we observe an unusually high decoupling rate between the smectic electronic director of the three-state Potts order and anisotropic strain, revealing weak smectoelastic coupling in the CDW phase of kagome superconductors. This finding is phenomenologically different from the extensively studied nematoelastic coupling in the Ising nematic phase of Ising nematic phase of Fe-based superconductor bulk single crystals, providing a contrasting picture of how strain can control electronic unidirectionality in different families of quantum materials.},

  abstract     = {Spin-boson models involving many interacting spins and bosons are ubiquitous in quantum simulation platforms. At the same time, characterizing the dynamics of these quantum systems represents a significant challenge. Here, we consider general spin-boson models where bosons are subject to Markovian dissipation (e.g., due to cavity loss). We present an exact hybrid quantum-classical stochastic approach where the solution of a classical stochastic equation—mimicking the bosonic modes—is input into a quantum stochastic equation for the spins. Furthermore, the spins are effectively decoupled for each stochastic realization, which nevertheless comes at the expense of sampling over unphysical states. In contrast with existing stochastic approaches based on the influence functional formalism, we place no restriction (factorizability or Gaussianity) on the initial state, or the spin-boson coupling (except that it be linear in the bosonic operator). Markovian dissipation, being at the heart of our approach, renders the stochastic equations Markovian even in the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, it ensures hermiticity (though not positivity) of the density matrix for each realization, thus improving the convergence of stochastic sampling. Interestingly, we find a condition on the classical simulability of the system based solely on the single atom cooperativity even in a many-body setting. We benchmark and showcase the utility of our approach in several examples, specifically in cases where a direct numerical computation is unfeasible.},

Here, we use a scanning tunneling microscope to electrically excite a model QLS, namely, a single ZnPc molecule, and disentangle the interplay of charge transfer and excited state formation. The luminescence spectra reveal two lines, associated to the emission of the neutral (exciton) and positively charged (trion) ZnPc, both exhibiting single-photon source behavior. In addition, we find a correlation between the charged and neutral emission, specifically, the signature of a photon cascade in which the radiative decay of the molecular trion is followed by the formation and decay of the exciton. By adjusting the charging vs discharging rate, we show that we can control these emission statistics. This generic strategy is further established by a comprehensive rate equation model comprising a variety of states that mediate excited state formation in the electrically driven single and cascaded photon emission process, revealing the complex internal dynamics of the molecular junction.},

  abstract     = {Significant progress toward a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been achieved via the study of effective one- and three-band Hubbard models. Nevertheless, material-specific predictions, while essential for constructing a comprehensive theory, remain challenging due to the complex relationship between real materials and the parameters of the effective models. By combining cluster dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory in a charge-self-consistent manner, here we show that the goal of material-specific predictions for high-temperature superconductors from first principles is within reach. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we take on the challenge of explaining the remarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative and families. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of multilayer cuprates, in particular, the dependence of their superconducting properties. The growth of from the single-layer to the trilayer compounds is here explained by the reduction of the charge transfer gap and, consequently, the growth of superexchange as increases. The origin of both is traced to the appearance of low-energy conduction bands reminiscent of standing wave modes confined within the stack of planes. We interpret the ultimate drop of for as a consequence of the inhomogeneous doping between the planes, which prevents the emergence of superconductivity in the inner planes due to their insufficient effective hole doping, as we also highlight the existence of a minimal doping (4%) required for superconductivity to appear in one of the planes. We explain material-specific properties such as the larger propensity of to superconduct compared with . We also find the coexistence of arcs and pockets observed with photoemission, the charge redistribution between copper and oxygen, and the link to the pseudogap. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive studies of high-temperature superconducting cuprates, enables detailed comparisons with experiment, and, through its ab initio settings, unlocks opportunities for theoretical material design of high-temperature superconductors.},

For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance, we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.},

Here we exploit the mathematical formalism of quasiconformal transformations to formulate the problem of “growth pattern selection” quantitatively in the context of 3D shape formation by growing 2D epithelial sheets. We propose that nature settles on growth patterns that are the “simplest” in a certain way. Specifically, we demonstrate that growth pattern selection can be formulated as an optimization problem and solved for the trajectories that minimize spatiotemporal variation in areal growth rates and deformation anisotropy. The result is a complete prediction for the growth of the surface, including not only a set of intermediate shapes, but also a prediction for cell displacement along those surfaces in the process of growth. Optimization of growth trajectories for both idealized surfaces and those observed in nature show that relative growth rates can be uniformized at the cost of introducing anisotropy. Minimizing the variation of programmed growth rates can therefore be viewed as a generic mechanism for growth pattern selection and may help us to understand the prevalence of anisotropy in developmental programs.},

  abstract     = {One of the main interests of 2D materials is their ability to be assembled with many degrees of freedom for tuning and manipulating excitonic properties. There is a need to understand how the structure of the interfaces between atomic layers influences exciton properties. Here we use cathodoluminescence and time-resolved cathodoluminescence experiments to study how excitons interact with the interface between two twisted hexagonal boron nitride ( -BN) crystals with various angles. An efficient capture of free excitons by the interface is demonstrated, which leads to a population of long-lived and interface-localized (2D) excitons. Temperature-dependent experiments indicate that for high twist angles, these excitons localized at the interface further undergo a self-trapping. It consists in a distortion of the lattice around the exciton on which the exciton traps itself. Our results suggest that this exciton-interface interaction causes the broad 4-eV optical emission of highly twisted -BN– -BN structures. Exciton self-trapping is finally discussed as a common feature of hybridized boron nitride polytypes and nanostructures due to the ionic nature of the B—N bond and the small size of their excitons.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of long-distance quantum communication, asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (AMDI-QKD) stands out for its experimental simplicity and high key rate generation. Despite these advantages, there exists a challenge in finding a balance between simplifying the laser system further and achieving high key rates. To address this challenge, we have devised a postmeasurement compensation scheme to accurately estimate the mutual frequency offset between two compact lasers using just the announced quantum-signal detection results, thereby obviating the need for optical reference light. As a result, we demonstrate an AMDI-QKD system operating at 2.5 GHz and achieving secure key rates (SKRs) of 537 and 1 0 1 k b i t / s at distances of 100 and 201 km, respectively, showcasing a significant key rate improvement compared to similar setups. By leveraging ultrastable lasers, we achieve the highest SKRs with measurement-device-independent security within the 100–400-km range. Over 100 km, we reach a remarkable key rate of 1 . 0 3 M b i t / s , which could enable real-time one-time-pad video encryption. These findings render AMDI-QKD as a promising contender for the establishment of high performance and cost-effective large-scale intercity quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction is necessary to perform large-scale quantum computation but requires extremely large overheads in both space and time. High-rate quantum low-density-parity-check (qLDPC) codes promise a route to reduce qubit numbers, but performing computation while maintaining low space cost has required serialization of operations and extra time costs. In this work, we design fast and parallelizable logical gates for qLDPC codes and demonstrate their utility for key algorithmic subroutines such as the quantum adder. Our gate gadgets utilize transversal logical cnot s between a data qLDPC code and a suitably constructed ancilla code to perform parallel Pauli product measurements (PPMs) on the data logical qubits. For hypergraph product codes, we show that the ancilla can be constructed by simply modifying the base classical codes of the data code, achieving parallel PPMs on a subgrid of the logical qubits with a lower space-time cost than existing schemes for an important class of circuits. Generalizations to 3D and 4D homological product codes further feature fast PPMs in constant depth. While prior work on qLDPC codes has focused on individual logical gates, we initiate the study of fault-tolerant compilation with our expanded set of native qLDPC code operations, constructing algorithmic primitives for preparing -qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and distilling or teleporting magic states with space overhead in and logical cycles, respectively. We further generalize this to key algorithmic subroutines, demonstrating the efficient implementation of quantum adders using parallel operations. Our constructions are naturally compatible with reconfigurable architectures such as neutral atom arrays, paving the way to large-scale quantum computation with low space and time overheads.},

We term this behavior “hyperdisordered,” in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scales. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface.

The observed effect suggests the possibility of a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers . We propose the mFTI as a novel candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features. (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons), (2) the minimally charged anyon carries electric charge , together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductance, implying the robustness of the mFTI’s gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation are present, and (3) the mFTI is minimal in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO’s complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique minimal TO that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) The mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled “product TOs” with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs are classified and constructed for a pair of -filled conjugate Chern bands. We further classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.},

Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from decoherence in open quantum systems or disorders in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit average symmetries—symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences, (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence, (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are intrinsically mixed, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average, and (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors—the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation blue spectra.},

This restricts key topological properties and device performance, including sub-meV gap sizes that hinder further experimental investigations and future applications of polariton Chern insulator systems. In this study, we move beyond the traditional Dirac cone framework and introduce two alternative band structures in photonic crystals (PhCs) as promising platforms for realizing polariton Chern bands: bands with symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum and bands with symmetry-protected degeneracies at the points. These band structures are prevalent in various PhC lattices and have features crucial for experimental studies. We show examples of higher Chern number bands, more uniform Berry curvature distributions, and experimentally feasible systems capable of achieving topological gap greater than 10 meV. Our findings show the broad applicability of polariton Chern bands in 2D PhCs and provide design principles for enhancing the functionality and performance of topological photonic devices, opening up exciting possibilities for better understanding and using topological physics.},

Within the LPDO framework, we outline a classification scheme for decohered average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases, consistent with earlier results obtained through spectrum sequence techniques. However, our approach offers an intuitive and explicit construction of ASPT states with the decorated domain-wall picture emerging naturally. We illustrate our framework with ASPT phases protected by a weak global symmetry and strong fermion parity symmetry and then extend it to a general group structure. Moreover, we derive both the classification data and the explicit forms of the obstruction functions using the LPDO formalism, particularly in the case of nontrivial group extension between strong and weak symmetries, where intrinsic ASPT phases may emerge. We demonstrate constructions of fixed-point LPDOs for ASPT phases in both ( 1 + 1 ) D and ( 2 + 1 ) D and discuss their physical realization in decohered or disordered systems.

This behavior had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize nonrigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multiuser quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits and of contracting tensor networks. First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.},

  abstract     = {Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a nonferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric one by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of nonferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both “proximity switching,” where the multilayers collectively switch, and “proximity suppression,” where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in and bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that dielectric-ferroelectric and paraelectric-ferroelectric multilayers can potentially lead to induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of “frozen ferroelectrics,” paraelectrics, and potentially dielectrics with high dielectric constants promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.},

  abstract     = {Achieving quantum speedups in practical tasks remains challenging for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These devices always encounter significant obstacles such as inevitable physical errors and the limited scalability of current near-term algorithms. Meanwhile, assuming a typical architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), realistic applications inevitably require a vast number of qubits, typically exceeding 10 6 , which seems far beyond near-term realization. In this work, to bridge the gap between the NISQ and FTQC eras, we propose an alternative approach to achieve practical quantum advantages on early-FTQC devices. Our framework is based on partially fault-tolerant logical operations to minimize spatial overhead and avoids the costly distillation techniques typically required for executing non-Clifford gates. To this end, we develop a space-time efficient state preparation protocol to generate an ancillary non-Clifford state consumed for implementing an analog rotation gate with an arbitrary small angle θ and a remarkably low worst-case error rate below O ( | θ | p ph ) , where p ph is the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose several error suppression schemes tailored to our preparation protocol, which are essential to minimize the overhead for mitigating errors. Based on this framework, we present several promising applications that leverage the potential of our framework, including the Trotter simulation and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Notably, we demonstrate that our framework allows us to perform the QPE for an ( 8 × 8 ) -site Hubbard model with fewer than 6.8 × 10 4 qubits and an execution time of 10.6 days (or 14 min with full parallelization) under p ph = 10 − 4 , which is significantly faster than recent classical estimation with tensor network techniques (density matrix renormalization group and projected entangled pair states).},

  abstract     = {The observation of delicate correlated phases in twisted heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides suggests that moiré flat bands are intrinsically resilient against certain types of disorder. Here, we investigate the robustness of moiré flat bands in the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model—applicable to both platforms in certain limits—and demonstrate drastic differences between the first magic angle and higher magic angles in response to chiral symmetric disorder that arise, for instance, from lattice relaxation. We understand these differences using a hidden constant of motion that permits the decomposition of the non-Abelian gauge field induced by interlayer tunnelings into two decoupled Abelian ones. At all magic angles, the resulting effective magnetic field splits into an anomalous contribution and a fluctuating part. The anomalous field maps the moiré flat bands onto a zeroth Dirac Landau level, whose flatness withstands any chiral symmetric perturbation such as nonuniform magnetic fields due to a topological index theorem—thereby underscoring a topological mechanism for band flatness. Only the first magic angle can fully harness this topological protection due to its weak fluctuating magnetic field. In higher magic angles, the amplitude of fluctuations largely exceeds the anomalous contribution, which we find results in a physically meaningless chiral operator and an extremely large sensitivity to microscopic details and an exponential collapse of the single-particle gap. Through numerical simulations, we further study various types of disorder and identify the scattering processes that are enhanced or suppressed in the chiral limit. Interestingly, we find that the topological suppression of disorder broadening persists away from the chiral limit and is further accentuated by isolating a single sublattice polarized flat band in energy. Our analysis suggests the Berry curvature hot spot at the top of the K and K ′ valence band in the transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is essential for the stability of its moiré flat bands and their correlated states.},

  abstract     = {The recent laser excitation of the low-lying isomer transition has started a revolution in ultralight dark matter searches. The enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models dominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe coupling strengths 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds from optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings to electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision, observations of the excitation spectrum will soon give the world-leading constraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of by Tiedau et al. [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 , 182501 (2024) ], we present a first dark matter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our detailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently operating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al.

  abstract     = {Materials where flattened electronic dispersions arise from destructive phase interference, rather than localized orbitals, have emerged as promising platforms for studying emergent quantum phenomena. Crucial next steps involve tuning such flat bands to the Fermi level, where they can be studied at low energy scales, and assessing their potential for practical applications. Here, we show that the interplay of highly dispersive and ultraflat bands inherent to these systems can lead to extreme interband scattering-induced electron-hole asymmetry, which can be harnessed in thermoelectrics. Our comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation of kagome metals supports this concept, showing that it could lead to thermoelectric performance on par with state-of-the-art semiconductors such as . In , scattering-induced electron-hole asymmetry is, however, subdued by an exotic conduction mechanism arising from quantum tunneling of charge carriers between Dirac bands, unrelated to the flat band itself. We outline strategies to selectively switch off this tunneling transport through negative chemical pressure or strain. Our study proposes a new direction to explore in topological flat-band systems and vice versa introduces a novel tuning knob for thermoelectric materials.},

Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method to control the coherent electron and lattice excitation in a prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. We show the displacive excitation of two coherent Raman-active phonon modes, which results in a mode-selective renormalization of its topological band structure comparable with previous experimental observations. We subsequently realize an effective manipulation of the coherent lattice vibration, not only for their amplitude, but also a -phase shift by tuning the laser intensity and frequency. We pinpoint that such a phase shift originates from the photoinduced carrier redistribution and can, in turn, determine the quasiparticle renormalization, for example, to induce an ultrafast topological Lifshitz transition, which we anticipate can be detected by pump-probe transport measurements. These results address the requirements for a directional pumping of coherent phonons with laser fields and provide the opportunity to explore exotic nonequilibrium physics.},

  abstract     = {Empirical evidence for a gap between the computational powers of classical and quantum computers has been provided by experiments that sample the output distributions of two-dimensional quantum circuits. Many attempts to close this gap have utilized classical simulations based on tensor network techniques, and their limitations shed light on the improvements to quantum hardware required to frustrate classical simulability. In particular, quantum computers having in excess of approximately 50 qubits are primarily vulnerable to classical simulation due to restrictions on their gate fidelity and their connectivity, the latter determining how many gates are required (and, therefore, how much infidelity is suffered) in generating highly entangled states. Here, we describe recent hardware upgrades to Quantinuum’s H2 quantum computer, enabling it to operate on up to 56 qubits with arbitrary connectivity and 99.843(5)% two-qubit gate fidelity. We define a class of circuits with random geometries that become hard to classically simulate in very low depth and implement them utilizing the flexible connectivity of H2. A careful analysis demonstrating the fast saturation of classical simulation complexity with depth indicates that H2 can yield data well beyond the reach of state-of-the art classical simulation methods at unprecedented fidelities. We find that the considerable difficulty of classically simulating H2 is likely limited only by qubit number, demonstrating the promise and scalability of the quantum charge-coupled device architecture as continued progress is made toward building larger machines.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have transformed many domains of machine learning. To tackle real-world problems, RL often relies on neural networks to learn policies directly from pixels or other high-dimensional sensory input. By contrast, many theories of RL have focused on discrete state spaces or worst-case analysis, and fundamental questions remain about the dynamics of policy learning in high-dimensional settings. Here, we propose a solvable high-dimensional RL model that can capture a variety of learning protocols, and we derive its typical policy learning dynamics as a set of closed-form ordinary differential equations. We obtain optimal schedules for the learning rates and task difficulty—analogous to annealing schemes and curricula during training in RL—and show that the model exhibits rich behavior, including delayed learning under sparse rewards, a variety of learning regimes depending on reward baselines, and a speed-accuracy trade-off driven by reward stringency. Experiments on variants of the Procgen game “Bossfight” and Arcade Learning Environment game “Pong” also show such a speed-accuracy trade-off in practice. Together, these results take a step toward closing the gap between theory and practice in high-dimensional RL.},

Here, we provide a comprehensive picture of how local dissipation due to effective chemical events manifests on large scales in active matter. We start from a microscopic model for a single catalytic particle involving explicit solute molecules and show that it undergoes directed motion. Leveraging stochastic thermodynamics, we calculate the average entropy production rate for interacting particles. We then show how the model of active Brownian particles emerges in a certain limit, and we determine the entropy production rate on the level of the hydrodynamic equations. Our results augment the model of active Brownian particles with rigorous expressions for the dissipation that cannot be inferred from their equations of motion, and we illustrate consequences for wall aggregation and motility-induced phase separation. Notably, our bottom-up approach agrees with the “naive” result from Onsager’s principle for the local dissipation rate.},

The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin-flip excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of strong d -wavelike pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction and persisting up to at least 260 K. The close connection between the physics of cuprate ladders and that of the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.},

  abstract     = {Noise on quantum devices is much more complex than it is commonly given credit. Far from usual models of decoherence, nearly all quantum devices are plagued by both a continuum of environments and temporal instabilities. These induce noisy quantum and classical correlations at the level of the circuit. The relevant spatiotemporal effects are difficult enough to understand, let alone combat. There is presently a lack of either scalable or complete methods to address the phenomena responsible for scrambling and loss of quantum information. Here, we make deep strides to remedy this problem. We establish a theoretical framework that uniformly incorporates and classifies all non-Markovian phenomena. Our framework is universal, assumes no parameters values, and is written entirely in terms of experimentally accessible circuit-level quantities. We formulate an efficient reconstruction using tensor network learning, allowing also for easy modularization and simplification based on the expected physics of the system. This is then demonstrated through both extensive numerical studies and implementations on IBM Quantum devices, estimating a comprehensive set of spacetime correlations. Finally, we conclude our analysis with applications thereof to the efficacy of control techniques to counteract these effects—including noise-aware circuit compilation and optimized dynamical decoupling. We find significant improvements are possible in the diamond norm and average gate fidelity of arbitrary SU(4) operations, as well as related decoupling improvements in contrast to off-the-shelf schemes.},

Using transient sum frequency generation spectroscopy, which is sensitive to electronic polarizations, we observe a transient electronic dipole reduction upon optical excitation which recovers at 0.5 and 10 ps timescale. The time-dependent density functional theory calculation reveals that both ligand-metal charge transfer and local excitation transition occurred upon photo excitation. To reveal the nature of electronic dipole restoration, we employ transient extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectroscopy—an element-specific ultrafast technique that follows charge dynamics of Bi, Fe, and O altogether. The transient EUV dynamics observed both ultrafast free charge carrier relaxation to excitons, as well as polaron formation. However, a timescale comparison suggests that only the polaron formation is responsible for the 0.5 ps electronic dipole restoration, whereas the faster electronic relaxation does not contribute to the ferroelectric property changes. Multireference configuration interaction calculation further corroborates this result by showing both Fe and Bi atoms shift from the ground state equilibrium—leading to the polaron formation. Our result disentangles the multidegrees of freedom in ultrafast ferroelectric modulation and identifies the pivotal motion—a local polaron formation—for the fast ferroelectric recovery. It provides crucial insights on the specific lattice distortion that could modulate properties or phase transitions of condensed matter materials.},

  abstract     = {Defects in crystals can have a transformative effect on the properties and functionalities of solid-state systems. Dopants in semiconductors are core components in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The control of single color centers is at the basis of advanced applications for quantum technologies. Unintentional defects can also be detrimental to the crystalline structure and hinder the development of novel materials. Whatever the research perspective, the identification of defects is a key, but complicated, and often long-standing issue. Here, we present a general methodology to identify point defects by combining isotope substitution and polytype control, with a systematic comparison between experiments and first-principles calculations. We apply this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride ( -BN) and its ubiquitous color center emitting in the ultraviolet spectral range. From isotopic purification of the host -BN matrix, a local vibrational mode of the defect is uncovered, and isotope-selective carbon doping proves that this mode belongs to a carbon-based center. Then, by varying the stacking sequence of the host -BN matrix, we unveil different optical responses to hydrostatic pressure for the nonequivalent configurations of this ultraviolet color center. We conclude that this defect is a carbon dimer in the honeycomb lattice of -BN. Our results show that tuning the stacking sequence in different polytypes of a given crystal provides unique fingerprints contributing to the identification of defects in 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {Network flows are pervasive, including the movement of people, transportation of goods, transmission of energy, and dissemination of information; they occur on a range of empirical interconnected systems, from designed infrastructure to naturally evolved networks. Despite the broad spectrum of applications, because of their domain-specific nature and the inherent analytic complexity, a comprehensive theory of network flows is lacking. We introduce a unifying treatment for network flows that considers the fundamental properties of packet symmetries, conservation laws, and routing strategies. For example, electrons in power grids possess interchangeability symmetry, unlike packages sent by postal mail, which are distinguishable. Likewise, packets can be conserved, such as cars in road networks, or dissipated, such as Internet packets that time out. We introduce a hierarchy of analytical field-theoretic approaches to capture the different scales of complexity required. Mean-field analysis uncovers the nature of the transition through which flow becomes unsustainable upon unchecked growth of demand. Mesoscopic field theory accurately accounts for complicated network structures, packet symmetries, and conservation laws and yet is capable of admitting closed-form solutions. Finally, the full-scale field theory allows us to study routing strategies ranging from random diffusion to shortest path. Our theoretical results indicate that flow bottlenecks tend to be near sources for interchangeable packets and near sinks for distinguishable ones, and that dissipation hinders the maximum sustainable throughput for interchangeable packets but can enhance throughput for distinguishable packets. Finally, we showcase the flexibility of our multiscale theory by applying it in two distinct domains of road networks and the C. elegans neuronal network. Our work paves the way for a more unifying and comprehensive theory of network flows.},

  abstract     = {Quantized lattice vibrations (i.e., phonons) in solids are robust and unambiguous fingerprints of crystal structures and of their symmetry properties. In metals and semimetals, strong electron-phonon coupling may lead to so-called Kohn anomalies in the phonon dispersion, providing an image of the Fermi surface in a nonelectronic observable. Kohn anomalies become prominent in low-dimensional systems, in particular, in graphene, where they appear as sharp kinks in the in-plane optical phonon branches. However, in spite of intense research efforts on electron-phonon coupling in graphene and related van der Waals heterostructures, little is known regarding the links between the symmetry properties of optical phonons at and near Kohn anomalies and their sensitivity towards the local environment. Here, using inelastic light scattering (Raman) spectroscopy, we investigate a set of custom-designed graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, wherein dielectric screening is finely controlled at the atomic-layer level. We demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically that, depending exclusively on their symmetry properties, the two main Raman lines of graphene react differently to the surrounding environment. While the 2D line, which is due to near-zone-edge optical phonons, undergoes changes due to the neighboring dielectric environment, the in-plane, zone-center optical phonons are symmetry protected from the influence of the latter. These results shed new light on the unique electron-phonon coupling properties in graphene and related systems and provide invaluable guidelines to characterize dielectric screening in van der Waals heterostructures and moiré superlattices.},

  abstract     = {The high coercive field ( E c ) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate E c , especially those related to domain nucleation in the nucleation-limited-switching (NLS) model and domain-wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type E c values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant E c in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultrathin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type E c is 0.1 MV / cm arising from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower E c is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV / cm in 60 nm ferroelectric ( HfO 2 ) n / ( ZrO 2 ) n ( n = 3 unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low- E c devices.},

Localized noncoplanar magnetic defects such as skyrmions or merons were found to interact strongly with currents, making them interesting candidates for future spintronics applications. So far, mostly systems with a high rotational symmetry have been investigated where skyrmions were axially symmetric. Here, we study a low-symmetry system by spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and an atomistic spin model using parameters based on first-principles calculations. We demonstrate how a delicate balance between energy terms generates both topologically trivial and nontrivial domain walls, depending on their nonequivalent crystallographic direction. The topological walls consist of alternating merons and antimerons, and the topological charge is 1 for every 6-nm length of the wall. The incorporation of holes in the films facilitates the transition from an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state to a spin-spiral state. Both domain walls and spirals transition into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions in applied magnetic fields. These findings establish low-symmetry systems as a versatile platform for spin-texture engineering.},

  abstract     = {Experiments show that light-matter strong coupling affects chemical properties, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. A major challenge is to perform reliable and affordable simulation of molecular behavior when many molecules are collectively coupled to the same optical mode. This paper presents an ab initio quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster method for the collective strong coupling regime. The model describes electronic and electron-photon correlation within a molecular subsystem, while a simplified description of the collective polaritonic excitations allows for a realistic microscopic light-matter coupling. The developed framework provides a computationally tractable route to accurately simulate a molecule in a collective environment, which is unfeasible when several molecules are treated explicitly. We investigate the properties of the argon dimer under strong light-matter coupling. In the single-molecule regime (large light-matter coupling), the potential energies are substantially modified, weakening the excimer bond. In contrast, in the collective regime (small light-matter coupling, large number of molecules), the ground state potential energy surface and the first vibrational levels of the excited state do not change significantly. However, collective strong coupling produces an abrupt transition in the vibrational landscape of the excimer, causing higher vibrational levels to behave similarly to the vibrations in the ground state. We expect the excimer formation to be inhibited by light-matter strong coupling and conclude that chemical properties are altered via distinct mechanisms in the collective and single-molecule regimes. We also discuss fundamental aspects of polaritonic chemistry, such as resonance conditions and sudden changes of the molecular properties when a critical collective coupling strength is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Coherent phonons, light-induced coherent lattice vibrations in solids, provide a powerful route to engineer structural and electronic degrees of freedom using light. In this manuscript, we formulate an ab initio theory of the displacive excitation of coherent phonons (DECP), the primary mechanism for light-induced structural control in semimetals. Our study—based on the ab initio simulations of the ultrafast electron and coherent-phonon dynamics in the presence of electron-phonon interactions—establishes a predictive computational framework for describing the emergence of light-induced structural changes and the ensuing transient band-structure renormalization arising from the DECP mechanism. We validate this framework via a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of coherent phonons in the elemental semimetal antimony. Via a Fourier analysis of time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, we retrieve information about transient spectral features and quasiparticle renormalization arising from the coherent phonon as a function of momentum, energy, time, and fluence. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between experiment and theory corroborates the first-principles approach formulated in this study. We further apply this formalism to investigate the coherent-phonon dynamics in the topological Weyl semimetal Td - . Besides reproducing the entire spectrum of coherent phonons observed in experiments, our simulations clearly indicate that the shear mode—the mode orchestrating a light-induced phase transition in Td - —is strongly driven by the DECP mechanism and, thus, provide a conclusive explanation for the driving mechanism underpinning the phase transition. Besides advancing the fundamental understanding of electron-phonon interactions mediated by coherent phonons, this study opens new opportunities for predictively engineering structural and electronic degrees of freedom in semimetals via the DECP mechanism.},

The mode-pairing (MP) protocol emerges as a promising solution for long-distance QKD by eliminating the need for a global phase reference while maintaining the repeaterlike rate-loss scaling. Recent implementations have demonstrated its potential, but they either rely on costly ultrastable lasers or struggle with phase fluctuations from commercial lasers, particularly over long distances. As a result, surpassing the repeaterless bound with a practical system remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a practical high-performance MP-QKD system using commercial lasers. To address phase fluctuations, we propose a frequency-tracking scheme based on fast Fourier transformation, enabling us to extend the pairing length to pulses ( ). We propose a model to carefully analyze the phase noise and optimize the system parameters. Our system achieves an optimal secret key rate of over 403 km of standard fiber (76.5 dB loss), exceeding the repeaterless bound by a factor of 2.92. Furthermore, we compare MP-QKD and twin-field QKD under various practical conditions and clarify the distinct application scenarios of the two protocols. These results confirm the feasibility of MP-QKD using cost-effective commercial technologies, paving the way for scalable quantum communication networks.},

High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS)—a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality heterostructure.

This work reports low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single-crystal with coverage both at low , where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal, and at high , covering the region where the magnetic form factor for octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, and , which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high , interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single-crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong Bragg scattering from . The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low- peak consistent with dipolar spin-ice correlations reported in previous work, and an alternation between positive and negative net intensity at higher . These features are consistent with our numerical-linked-cluster calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters previously reported for , and . Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show evidence for increased scattering at high resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperature for our measurements ( ), scattering from octupolar correlations in is not present in the neutron diffraction signal on the level of our observation threshold of around 0.1% of the low- dipole scattering.

  abstract     = {Magnetic skyrmions are emerging as promising candidates for next-generation information technologies, while the realization of scalable skyrmion lattices with tailored configurations is essential for advancing fundamental skyrmion physics and developing future applications. Here we achieved the controllable generation and regulation of a large-area, highly oriented skyrmion track array (STA) in ferromagnet using a vector-magnetic-field manipulation technique. The orientation and ordering of STA, along with the types and density of skyrmions, are precisely controlled by modulating parameters during the manipulation. The critical roles of in-plane magnetic fields and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in STA generation is further confirmed by micromagnetic simulation. Our findings develop a strategy for engineering large-area and highly oriented skyrmion configurations, offering a new pathway for the future application of next-generation spintronic and information technologies.},

Here, we present a detailed study of the RIXS spectra of the Hubbard-Holstein model defined on extended one-dimensional lattices. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we compute the RIXS response while treating the electron mobility, many-body interactions, and core-hole interactions on an equal footing. The predicted spectra exhibit notable differences from those obtained using the commonly adopted Lang-Firsov models, with important implications for analyzing past and future experiments. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how RIXS probes e -ph interactions and set the stage for a more realistic analysis of future experiments.},

  abstract     = {The superconducting state of the heavy-fermion metal UTe 2 has attracted considerable interest because of evidence of spin-triplet Cooper pairing and nontrivial topology. Progress on these questions requires identifying the presence or absence of nodes in the superconducting gap function and their dimension. In this article, we report a comprehensive study of the influence of disorder on the thermal transport in the superconducting state of UTe 2 . Through detailed measurements of the magnetic-field dependence of the thermal conductivity in the zero-temperature limit, we obtain clear evidence of the presence of point nodes in the superconducting gap for all samples with transition temperatures ranging from 1.6 to 2.1 K obtained by different synthesis methods, including a refined self-flux method. This robustness implies the presence of symmetry-imposed nodes throughout the range studied, further confirmed via disorder-dependent calculations of the thermal transport in a model with a single pair of nodes. In addition to capturing the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity up to T c , this model provides some information about the locations of the nodes, suggesting a B 1 u or B 2 u symmetry for the superconducting order parameter. Additionally, comparing the new, ultrahigh conductivity samples to older samples reveals a crossover between a low-field and a high-field regime at a single value of the magnetic field in all samples. In the high-field regime, the thermal conductivity at different disorder levels differs from each other by a simple offset, suggesting that some simple principle determines the physics of the mixed state, a fact which may illuminate trends observed in other clean nodal superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy-fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat-band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. Here, we explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy-fermion physics and MATBG experiments. Our work identifies a key discrepancy between measured and calculated on-site Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider a SB model with a single, renormalized on-site interaction between the f electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy-fermion binding potential on the moiré A A sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two-stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the Γ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moiré K points; at much lower temperatures, Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative timescales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy-fermion materials with that of MATBG, we are led to propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy-fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange-metal physics observed in MATBG.},

  abstract     = {Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled nonlocal cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, the effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids—and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter—remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a ν = 1 / 3 Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the nonlocal cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the U(1) counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultrastrong-coupling regimes, we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasiparticles and a potential instability toward a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Understanding nanoscale electronic and thermal transport of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems in the quantum Hall regime, particularly in the bulk insulating state, poses considerable challenges. One of the primary difficulties arises from the presence of chiral edge channels, whose transport behavior obscures the investigation of the insulating bulk. Using near-field optical and photocurrent nanoscopy, we probe real-space variations of the optical and thermal dynamics of graphene in the quantum Hall regime without relying on complex sample or electrode geometries. Near the charge-neutrality point, we detect strong optical and photothermal signals from resonant inter-Landau-level (LL) magnetoexciton excitations between the zeroth and ± 1 st LLs, which gradually weaken with increasing doping due to Pauli blocking. Interestingly, at higher doping levels and full-integer LL fillings, photothermal signals reappear across the entire sample over an approximately 10 − μ m scale, indicating unexpectedly long cooling lengths and nonlocal photothermal heating through the insulating bulk. This observation suggests that thermal conductivity persists for the localized states even as electronic transport is suppressed—a clear violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our experiments provide novel insights into nanoscale thermal and electronic transport in incompressible 2D gases, highlighting the roles of magnetoexcitons and chiral edge states in the thermo-optoelectric dynamics of the Dirac quantum Hall state.},

  abstract     = {The self-thinning of liquid bridges under the action of capillarity occurs in widespread processes like jetting, dripping, and spraying and gives rise to a strong extensional flow capable of stretching dissolved polymers. If the resulting elastic stress exceeds the viscous stress, an exponential “elastocapillary” (EC) thinning regime arises, yielding a timescale τ EC that is commonly considered equivalent to the longest relaxation time of the polymer λ . A long-standing question is why τ EC depends strongly on the polymer concentration, even at high dilutions where λ should be constant in theory. To date, this is understood in terms of intermolecular interactions that arise due to “self-concentration” effects as polymers stretch. However, λ depends on the polymer molecular weight M , and we show how the concentration dependence of τ EC can be explained by considering the molecular weight distribution (MWD) inherent in real polymer samples, without the need to invoke self-concentration. We demonstrate this by blending low- M and high- M polymer samples with narrow MWDs at dilute concentrations and in different proportions and by measuring τ EC for each blend in capillary thinning experiments. Through a simple model that qualitatively reproduces the experimental results, we show how elastic stresses generated by the polymer build up prior to the EC regime due to the sequential stretching of progressively decreasing molecular weight species in the MWD. Since the elastic stress generated by each species depends on its concentration, the fraction of the MWD that is required to stretch in order to induce the EC regime depends on the total polymer concentration c in the solution. For higher c , the EC regime is induced by stretching of a higher- M (longer λ ) fraction of the MWD and results in a longer measurement of τ EC . Our results have significant implications for the application of capillary thinning measurements to extensional rheometry, for the interpretation of such measurements, and for the understanding of elastocapillary thinning dynamics in general.},

  abstract     = {Quantum nonlocality describes a stronger form of quantum correlation than that of entanglement. It refutes Einstein’s belief of local realism and is among the most distinctive and enigmatic features of quantum mechanics. It is a crucial resource for achieving quantum advantages in a variety of practical applications, ranging from cryptography and certified random number generation via self-testing to machine learning. Nevertheless, the detection of nonlocality, especially in quantum many-body systems, is notoriously challenging. Here, we report an experimental certification of genuine multipartite Bell-operator correlations, which signal nonlocality in quantum many-body systems, up to 24 qubits with a fully programmable superconducting quantum processor. In particular, we employ energy as a Bell-operator correlation witness and variationally decrease the energy of a many-body system across a hierarchy of thresholds, below which an increasing Bell-operator correlation depth can be certified from experimental data. We variationally prepare the low-energy state of a two-dimensional honeycomb model with 73 qubits and certify its Bell-operator correlations by measuring an energy that surpasses the corresponding classical bound with up to 48 standard deviations. In addition, we variationally prepare a sequence of low-energy states and certify their genuine multipartite Bell-operator correlations up to 24 qubits via energies measured efficiently by parity oscillation and multiple quantum coherence techniques. Our results establish a viable approach for preparing and certifying multipartite Bell-operator correlations, which provide not only a finer benchmark beyond entanglement for quantum devices, but also a valuable guide toward exploiting multipartite Bell correlations in a wide spectrum of practical applications.},

With a global U(1) charge, however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of k -fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a k c -design with k c = O ( L d ) for a system in d spatial dimensions with linear dimension L . Second, for k < k c , we derive bounds on the depth τ required for the circuit to converge to an approximate k -design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion k L 2 ln ( L ) ≲ τ . In contrast, without number conservation τ ∼ poly ( k ) L . The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks k U(1) symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound τ ≲ k L d + 2 .},

  abstract     = {Competing interactions in frustrated magnets can give rise to highly degenerate ground states from which correlated liquidlike states of matter often emerge. The scaling of this degeneracy influences the ultimate ground state, with extensive degeneracies potentially yielding quantum spin liquids, while subextensive or smaller degeneracies yield static orders. A long-standing problem is to understand how ordered states precipitate from this degenerate manifold and what echoes of the degeneracy survive ordering. Here, we use neutron scattering to experimentally demonstrate a new “nodal-line” spin liquid, where spins collectively fluctuate within a subextensive manifold spanning one-dimensional lines in reciprocal space. Realized in the spin-orbit-coupled, face-centered-cubic iridate K 2 IrCl 6 , we show that the subextensive degeneracy is robust, but remains susceptible to fluctuations or longer-range interactions which cooperate to select a magnetic order at low temperatures. Proximity to the nodal-line spin liquid influences the ordered state, enhancing the effects of quantum fluctuations that in turn act to stabilize the sublattice magnetization through the self-consistent opening of a large spin-wave gap. Our results demonstrate how quantum fluctuations can act counterintuitively in frustrated materials: Even in a case where fluctuations are ineffective at selecting an ordered state from a degenerate manifold, at the brink of the nodal spin liquid, they can act to protect the ordered state and dictate its low-energy physics.},

When the detector readout is postselected to match a given value, the dynamics is generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with MiPTs characterized by different universal features. Here, we derive a partial postselected stochastic Schrödinger equation based on a microscopic description of continuous weak measurement. This formalism connects the monitored and postselected dynamics to a broader family of stochastic evolution. We apply the formalism to a chain of free fermions subject to partial postselected monitoring of local fermion parities. Within a two-replica approach, we obtain an effective bosonized Hamiltonian in the strong postselected limit. Using a renormalization group analysis, we find that the universality of the non-Hermitian MiPT is stable against a finite (weak) amount of stochasticity. We further show that the passage to the monitored universality occurs abruptly at finite partial postselection, which we confirm from the numerical finite size scaling of the MiPT.

  abstract     = {Quantum critical phenomena are widely studied across various materials families, from high-temperature superconductors to magnetic insulators. They occur when a thermodynamic phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature as a function of some tuning parameter such as pressure or magnetic field. This generally yields a point of instability—a so-called quantum critical point—at which the phase transition is driven exclusively by quantum fluctuations. Here, we show that the heavy fermion metamagnet UTe 2 possesses a quantum phase transition at extreme magnetic field strengths of over 70 T. Rather than terminating at one singular point, we find that the phase boundary is sensitive to magnetic field components in each of the three Cartesian axes of magnetic field space. This results in the transition surface being bounded by a continuous ring of quantum critical points, the locus of which forms an extended line of quantum criticality—a novel form of quantum critical phase boundary. Within this quantum critical line sits a magnetic field-induced superconducting state in a toroidal shape, which persists to fields over 70 T. We model our data by a phenomenological free energy expansion and show how a quantum critical line—rather than a more conventional singular point of instability—anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe 2 .},

Emergent electronic nematicity, which spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry, has been found in the normal state of various types of unconventional superconductors. Here, we exploit the angle-resolved resistivity method to systematically measure the nematicity of the interface superconducting LaAlO 3 / KTaO 3 ( 111 ) ( LAO / KTO ). Compared to the normal state, electronic nematicity is enhanced substantially by superconducting fluctuations around the superconducting temperature T c . More importantly, T c is also anisotropic in plane and angle dependent. The nematicity consists of a dominant C 2 component and a C 4 component, which can be explained by the presence of nematic domains. After the superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field, the uncovered quantum metal state manifests significant nematicity that is contributed by residual nematic superconducting fluctuations. A coherent picture of nematic interface superconductivity can be retrieved from the measured nematicity phase diagram that is crucial for the understanding of quantum metal state, electronic nematicity, and interface superconductivity.},

In this paper, we theoretically analyze noisy analog quantum simulation of geometrically local open quantum systems and provide evidence that this problem both is hard to simulate on classical computers and could be approximately solved on near-term quantum devices. First, given a noiseless quantum simulator, we show that the dynamics of local observables and the fixed-point expectation values of rapidly mixing local observables in geometrically local Lindbladians can be obtained to a precision of ϵ in time that is poly ( ϵ − 1 ) and uniform in system size. Furthermore, we establish that the quantum simulator would provide a superpolynomial advantage, in run-time scaling with respect to the target precision and either the evolution time (when simulating dynamics) or the Lindbladian’s decay rate (when simulating fixed points), over any classical algorithm for these problems, assuming BQP ≠ BPP . We then consider the presence of noise in the quantum simulator in the form of additional geometrically local Lindbladian terms. We show that the simulation tasks considered in this paper are stable to errors; i.e., they can be solved to a noise-limited, but system-size independent, precision. Finally, we establish that, assuming BQP ≠ BPP , there are stable geometrically local Lindbladian simulation problems such that, as the noise rate on the simulator is reduced, classical algorithms must take time superpolynomially longer in the inverse noise rate to attain the same precision as the analog quantum simulator.},

Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.},

Here, we propose a deep-learning (DL) method for generating high-resolution acoustic images. By preparing datasets consisting of many pairs of acoustic and optical-microscope images for the same cells and training them, a high-resolution image comparable to optical microscopy is generated from an acoustic image. Importantly, the most accurate images are generated when three-layer (RGB) images containing not only high-frequency (approximately 180 MHz) images but also lower-frequency (approximately 100 MHz) images are used as the input images, which is attributed to enhanced acoustic absorption in the nucleus because the nucleus resonates in this low-frequency band. The DL scheme with the tri-frequency image input is applied to human mesenchymal stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells, and the high image-generation capability is demonstrated. As a result, high-resolution acoustic microscopy images are obtained for the same cells for over 24 h, without the typical cell damage encountered using optical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star (NS) observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model dependency of individual observations vary. Given their growing number, assessing the various methods is crucial to compare the respective effects on the EOS and discover potential biases. For this purpose, we present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways of how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and x-ray observations of NS masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from binary neutron star coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39 M ⊙ on the TOV mass based on GW170817’s remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4 M ⊙ neutron star to be R 1.4 = 12.2 6 − 0.91 + 0.80 km and the TOV mass at M TOV = 2.2 5 − 0.22 + 0.42 M ⊙ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields R 1.4 = 12.2 0 − 0.48 + 0.50 km and M TOV = 2.3 0 − 0.20 + 0.07 M ⊙ . When comparing these limits to individual data points, we find that the quoted radius of HESS J1731-347 displays noticeable tension with other constraints. Constraining microphysical properties of the EOS proves more challenging. For instance, the symmetry energy slope is restricted to L sym = 48 − 25 + 21 MeV , where this constraint is mainly dominated by our reanalysis of the PREX-II and CREX experiment.},

  abstract     = {Despite their importance in quantum theory, joint quantum measurements remain poorly understood. An intriguing conceptual and practical question is whether joint quantum measurements on separated systems can be performed without bringing them together. Remarkably, by using shared entanglement, this can be achieved perfectly when disregarding the postmeasurement state. However, existing localization protocols typically require unbounded entanglement. In this work, we address the fundamental question: “Which joint measurements can be localized with a finite amount of entanglement?” We develop finite-resource versions of teleportation-based schemes and analytically classify all two-qubit measurements that can be localized in the first levels of the resulting hierarchies. These levels include several measurements with exceptional properties and symmetries, such as the Bell state measurement and the elegant joint measurement. This leads us to propose a systematic classification of joint measurements based on entanglement cost, which we argue directly connects with the complexity of implementing those measurements. We illustrate how to numerically explore higher levels and construct generalizations to higher dimensions and multipartite settings.},

For electron spin-1 registers, dynamical decoupling (DD) quantum gates have been developed that enable the precise control of multiple nuclear spin qubits. However, for the important class of electron spin- systems, this control method suffers from intrinsic selectivity limitations, resulting in reduced nuclear spin gate fidelities. Here, we demonstrate improved control of single nuclear spins by an electron spin- using dynamically decoupled radio-frequency (DDRF) gates. We make use of the electron spin- of a diamond tin-vacancy center, showing high-fidelity single-qubit gates, single-shot readout, and spin coherence beyond a millisecond. The DD control is used as a benchmark to observe and control a single nuclear spin. Using the DDRF control method, we demonstrate improved control on that spin. In addition, we find and control an additional nuclear spin that is insensitive to the DD control method. Using these DDRF gates, we show entanglement between the electron and the nuclear spin with 72(3)% state fidelity. Our extensive simulations indicate that DDRF gate fidelities well in excess are feasible. Finally, we employ time-resolved photon detection during readout to quantify the hyperfine coupling for the electron’s optically excited state. Our work provides key insights into the challenges and opportunities for nuclear spin control in electron spin- systems, opening the door to multiqubit experiments on these promising qubit platforms.},

  abstract     = {Although spin and charge stripes in high- cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. The problem is challenging due to the combined effects of quenched disorder and competition with superconductivity—both significant in cuprates—which add to the inherent difficulty of determining phase boundaries. In (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below , the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin-stripe order is found to extend up to . Here, we investigate (Eu-LSCO) using nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to irrespective of field strength: The stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a nonmagnetic ground state, except very close to . Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase, though the exact nature of this connection has yet to be elucidated. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: Either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to and the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, putative quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.},

In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on demand to implement a continuous range of generators to accomplish linear and nonlinear HAMS dynamics. The spinlike dynamics are verified by demonstration of linear spin coherent [SU(2)] rotations, nonlinear spin rotations, and comparison to other manifolds like simply truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows universal control of a spin cat logical qubit encoding with interpretable drive pulses: We use linear operations to accomplish four logical gates and further show that nonlinear spin rotations can complete the logical gate set.

Unlike cuprates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature ( T c ), the bilayer nickelate La 3 Ni 2 O 7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La 4 Ni 3 O 1 0 in reported T c . Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal T c remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr 4 Ni 3 O 10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset T c of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La 4 Ni 3 O 1 0 . The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below T c , with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.},

  abstract     = {Couplings between biochemical and mechanical processes have a profound impact on embryonic development. However, in vitro studies capable of quantifying these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we investigate a synthetic system where a DNA reaction-diffusion (RD) front is advected by a turbulent flow generated by active matter (AM) flows in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Whereas the dynamics of simple RD fronts solely depend on the reaction and diffusion rates, we show that RD-AM front propagation is also influenced by the confinement geometry. We first experimentally dissected the different components of the reaction-diffusion-advection process by knocking out reaction or advection and observe how RD-AM allows for faster transport over large distances, avoiding dilution. We then show how confinement impacts active matter flow: While changes in instantaneous flow velocities are small, correlation times are dramatically increased with decreasing confinement. As a result, RD-AM front speed increases up to eightfold compared to an RD one, in quantitative agreement with a conveyor-belt reaction-diffusion-advection theoretical model. The RD-AM experimental system described here provides a framework for the rational engineering of complex spatiotemporal processes observed in living systems. It will reinforce our understanding of how macro-scale patterns and structures emerge from microscopic components in nonequilibrium systems.},

  abstract     = {The adhesion between dry solid surfaces is typically governed by contact forces, involving surface forces and elasticity. For surfaces immersed in a fluid, out-of-contact adhesion arises due to the viscous resistance to the opening of the liquid gap. While the adhesion between dry solids is described by the classical Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory, there is no equivalent framework for the wet adhesion of soft solids. Here, we investigate theoretically the viscous adhesion emerging during the separation of a sphere from an elastic substrate. The suction pressure within the thin viscous film between the solids induces significant elastic displacements. Unexpectedly, the elastic substrate closely follows the motion of the sphere, leading to a sticking without contact. The initial dynamics is described using similarity solutions, resulting in a nonlinear adhesion force that grows in time as F ∝ t 2 / 3 . When elastic displacements become large enough, another similarity solution emerges that leads to a violent snap-off of the adhesive contact through a finite-time singularity. The observed phenomenology bears a strong resemblance with JKR theory and is relevant for a wide range of applications involving viscous adhesion.},

Making full use of this many-body platform requires tuning the interaction between the central spin and its spin register. GaAs quantum dots offer a model realization of the central spin system where an electron qubit interacts with multiple ensembles of nuclear spins. In this work, we demonstrate tuning of the interaction between the electron qubit and the nuclear many-body system in a GaAs quantum dot. The homogeneity of the GaAs system allows us to perform high-precision and isotopically selective nuclear sideband spectroscopy, which reveals the single-nucleus electronic Knight field. Together with time-resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear field, this fully characterizes the electron-nuclear interaction for a priori control. An algorithmic feedback sequence selects the nuclear polarization precisely, which adjusts the electron-nuclear exchange interaction in situ via the electronic -factor anisotropy. This allows us to tune directly the activation rate of a collective nuclear excitation (magnon) and the coherence time of the electron qubit. Our method is applicable to similar central-spin systems and enables the programmable tuning of coherent interactions in the many-body regime.},

Modeled as a beam splitter interaction between the system and its environment, the performance of bosonic pure-loss channel can be enhanced by controlling the environment state. We show that by choosing the ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states for the system and its environment, perfect transmission of quantum information through a beam splitter is achievable at arbitrarily low transmissivities. Our explicit constructions allow for experimental demonstration of the improved performance of a quantum channel through passive environment assistance, which is potentially useful for quantum transduction where the environment state can be naturally controlled. In practice, it is crucial to consider finite-energy constraints, and high-fidelity quantum communication through a beam splitter remains achievable with GKP states at the few-photon level.},

  abstract     = {We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable moiré heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moiré potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moiré potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moiré potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moiré heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.},

Our study identifies a distinct kink structure on the α band, observable only in the superconducting phase and closely linked with the superconductivity, indicative of strong electron-boson interactions. Notably, this kink structure corresponds to two distinct bosonic modes at 11 meV and 13 meV, aligning with spin resonance modes previously observed in inelastic neutron-scattering experiments. This alignment underscores the significant role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism of this superconductor. Furthermore, the unique momentum-dependent and orbital-selective properties of the coupling revealed by ARPES provide profound insights into the pairing symmetry, suggesting predominantly s ± -wave pairing facilitated by spin fluctuations. Our findings not only highlight the pivotal role of spin resonance in the superconductivity of CaKFe 4 As 4 but also enhance our understanding of the electron-spin fluctuation interactions in unconventional superconductors.},

Here we present an efficient machine-learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multiobjective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.},

We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we measure the momentum-space shape of the quasiparticle excitations and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau’s theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.},

In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the “boundary-changing operators” (BCO) on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee, and tricritical Ising models, to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. The BCO descendants turn out to be an optimal basis such that truncation in bond dimensions naturally produces comparable accuracies with the leading existing FP algorithms. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door toward understanding CFT in higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced [ Quantum 8 , 1466 (2024) ], we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasilumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasilumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular—a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way, we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work provides a solid ground for a precise nondivergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.},

  abstract     = {Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multipole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over 0.1 s with a mean photon number of only 4. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of , comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat-qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two-thirds) of a cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here, we explore a surprising connection between mixed-state entanglement and ’t Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in d space dimensions with anomalous symmetry G where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology H d + 2 [ G , U ( 1 ) ] . We show that any mixed state ρ that is strongly symmetric under G , in the sense that G ρ ∝ ρ is necessarily ( d + 2 )-nonseparable, i.e., is not the mixture of tensor products of d + 2 states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any ( d + 2 )-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in d ≤ 1 and plausibility arguments in d > 1 . The anomaly-nonseparability connection, thus, allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in d = 1 we find an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze a mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly, in general, does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.},

  abstract     = {We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian symmetries can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, Rényi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U(1) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU ( N ) symmetries, both logarithmic and Rényi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that, while Rényi negativities with n > 2 scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized Rényi negativities with n < 2 ) exhibits a volume-law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems and, hence, also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.},

  abstract     = {Within multicellular living systems, cells coordinate their positions with spatiotemporal accuracy to form various tissue structures and control development. These arrangements can be regulated by tissue geometry, biochemical cues, as well as mechanical perturbations. However, how cells pack during dynamic three-dimensional multicellular architectures formation remains unclear. Here, examining a growing spherical multicellular system, human lung alveolospheres, we observe an emergence of hexagonal packing order and a structural transition of cells that comprise the spherical epithelium. Surprisingly, the cell packing behavior on the spherical surface of lung alveolospheres resembles hard-disks packing on spheres, where the less deformable cell nuclei act as effective “hard disks” and prevent cells from getting too close. Nucleus-to-cell size ratio increases during lung spheroids growth; as a result, we find more hexagon-concentrated cellular packing with increasing bond orientational order. Furthermore, by osmotically changing the compactness of cells on alveolospheres, we observe a more ordered packing when nucleus-to-cell size ratio increases, and vice versa. These more ordered cell packing characteristics are consistent with reduced cell dynamics, together suggesting that better cellular packing stabilizes local cell neighborhoods and may regulate more complex biological functions such as cellular maturation and tissue morphogenesis.},

Strong orbital-lattice coupling was found to induce spontaneous symmetry breaking through the Ti-S octahedral distortions, leading to the formation of a unique 1D order–2D disorder lattice structure. With neuroevolution potentials, molecular dynamics simulation of this structure successfully reproduced the glasslike in-plane lattice thermal conductivity observed in experiments. The predicted out-of-plane thermal conductivity decreases with temperature, exhibiting a crystalline trend that is consistent with our measurements.

  abstract     = {A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges and their weight distribution. The status quo in this context is based on regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity, i.e., abundance of zero weights, with weight “shrinkage.” This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster and simpler to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data, instead of many fits for multiple data splits and choice of regularization parameter. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of reconstructed edges and their weight distribution to be known in advance. In a series of examples, we also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving on the order of species and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of potential interventions and tipping points in the system.},

Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range-entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: Local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a timescale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi’s golden rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain -dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as , where is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in “helical” spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field-theoretic limits.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric domain walls are not just static geometric boundaries between polarization domains; they are, in fact, dynamic and functional interfaces with the potential for diverse technological applications. While the roles of ferroelectric domain walls in dielectric and piezoelectric responses are better understood, their impact on pyroelectric response remains underexplored. Here, the pyroelectric response of (001)-, (101)-, and (111)-oriented epitaxial heterostructures of the tetragonal ferroelectric PbZr 0.2 Ti 0.8 O 3 is probed. These differently oriented heterostructures exhibit the same type of 90° ferroelastic domain walls, but their geometry and density vary with orientation. In turn, piezoresponse force microscopy and direct pyroelectric measurements reveal that (111)-oriented heterostructures exhibit both the highest density of domain walls and pyroelectric coefficients. By varying the thickness of these (111)-oriented heterostructures (from 100 to 280 nm), the density of domain walls can be varied, and a direct correlation between domain-wall density and pyroelectric coefficients is found. Molecular-dynamics simulations confirm these findings and reveal a novel domain-wall contribution to pyroelectric response in that the volume of the material in or near the domain walls exhibits a significantly higher pyroelectric coefficient as compared to the bulk of the domains. Analysis suggests that the domain-wall material has a higher responsivity of the polarization to both external fields and temperature. This study sheds light on the microscopic origin of domain-wall contributions to pyroelectricity and provides a pathway to controlling this effect.},

Here, we present a general solution to the long-standing problem of the avalanche growth rate calculation. We provide a simple formula that accounts for the damping of the growth rate due to pair and photon migration from the region of prolific generation. We apply our model to a variety of 3D field configurations including focused laser beams and show that (i) the particle yield for the full range of intensity able to generate an avalanche can be predicted, (ii) a critical intensity threshold due to migration is identified, and (iii) the effect of migration is negligible at a higher intensity and the local growth rate dominates. Excellent agreement with Monte Carlo and self-consistent particle-in-cell simulations is shown. The growth rate calculation allows us to predict when abundant pair production will induce a backreaction on the generating field due to plasma collective effects and screening. Our model can be applied to study the generation of electron-positron pair avalanches in realistic fields to plan future experiments at ultrahigh-intensity laser facilities.},

The interactions are important to soliton compounds in plasma, Bose-Einstein condensation, and optical systems. In optical microresonators, interactions between counterpropagating (CP) solitons can lead to Vernier frequency locking (VFL), which is invaluable for dual-comb applications. Here, we synthesize CP solitons with VFL in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator and characterize the rhythmic soliton interaction dynamics. Seconds-long mutual coherence between solitons arises passively from the interactions. The interactions also cause the solitons to oscillate periodically. This temporal motion is discerned by frequency-domain measurements of the instantaneous frequency changes and microcomb sidebands. A theory is derived to describe the sideband strength and leveraged to retrieve the motion trajectory. The complex soliton motion trajectory is further measured by optical cross-correlation using a CP soliton trimer state. We further prove that precise dual-comb spectroscopy with a single interferogram and an acquisition time of is feasible using these solitons, but the temporal motion limits the dynamic range. Our work establishes the rhythmic soliton interaction dynamics and reveals the characteristics of VFL solitons in the silicon nitride platform, which can be used to guide the design of integrated dual-comb systems.},

By utilizing ionic liquid gating at room temperature, the ferrimagnetic order can be reversibly switched as a result of the hydrogen injection or extraction under positive or negative gate voltages. Specifically, the hydrogen content pronouncedly modifies the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the Tb sublattice, which subsequently influences the relative magnitude and/or direction of the Fe and Tb sublattice magnetizations, resulting in the switching of ferrimagnetic order. More importantly, we demonstrate a prototype room-temperature three-terminal magnetoelectric memory device by incorporating the giant magnetoresistance effect with electric-field controllable ferrimagnetism.

  abstract     = {Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a -symmetric state: the -cluster state introduced by Brell [ New J. Phys. 17 , 023029 (2015) ]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely, protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how -cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where is a semidirect product of Abelian groups.},

  abstract     = {Biological memory is known to be flexible—memory formation and recall depend on factors such as the behavioral context of the organism. However, this property is often ignored in associative memory models, leaving it unclear how memories can be organized and recalled when subject to contextual control. Because of the lack of a rigorous analytical framework, it is also unknown how contextual control affects memory stability, storage capacity, and information content. Here, we bring the dynamic nature of memory to the fore by introducing a novel model of associative memory, which we refer to as the context-modular memory network. In our model, stored memory patterns are associated to one of several background network states, or contexts. Memories are accessible when their corresponding context is active, and are otherwise inaccessible. Context modulates the effective network connectivity by imposing a specific configuration of neuronal and synaptic gating—gated neurons (synapses) have their activity (weights) momentarily silenced, thereby reducing interference from memories belonging to other contexts. Memory patterns are randomly and independently chosen, while neuronal and synaptic gates may be selected randomly or optimized through a process of contextual synaptic refinement. Through analytic and numerical results, we show that context-modular memory networks can exhibit both improved memory capacity and differential control of memory stability with random gating (especially for neuronal gating). For contextual synaptic refinement, we devise a method in which synapses are gated off for a given context if they destabilize the memory patterns in that context, drastically improving memory capacity and enabling even more precise control over memory stability. Notably, synaptic refinement allows for patterns to be accessible in multiple contexts, stabilizing memory patterns even for weight matrices that alone do not contain any information about the memory patterns, such as Gaussian random matrices. Overall, our model integrates recent ideas about context-dependent memory organization with classic associative memory models and proposes a rigorous theory which can act as a framework for future work. Furthermore, our work carries important implications for the understanding of biological memory storage and recall in the brain, such as highlighting an intriguing trade-off between memory capacity and accessibility.},

Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.},

In this study, we explore quantum systems subjected to a quasiperiodic drive. Leveraging a strongly interacting spin ensemble in diamond, we identify the emergence of long-lived discrete time quasicrystals. Unlike conventional time crystals, time quasicrystals exhibit robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the multifrequency nature of the quasiperiodic drive allows for the formation of diverse patterns associated with different discrete time quasicrystalline phases. Our findings demonstrate the existence of nonequilibrium phases in quasi-Floquet settings, significantly broadening the catalog of novel phenomena in driven many-body quantum systems.},

Here, we report the first detection of a damaging intermolecular relaxation cascade initiated by heavy-ion bombardment of hydrated pyrimidine clusters. The process can significantly contribute to the high biological effectiveness of heavy-ion irradiation and thus might play an essential role in many radiotherapy techniques. Inner-valence ionization of the cluster initiates ICD and triggers proton transfer between water molecules, producing destructive low-energy electrons, HO • radicals, and hydrated protons. Notably, the efficiency of ICD was found to increase dramatically with the number of water molecules, making ICD the dominant decay mechanism after inner-valence ionization. These findings indicate that the biological damage, caused by ICD in aqueous environments, is much more severe than was previously recognized.},

Switching the chirality of a Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral multilayer graphene-based Chern insulators through a topological phase transition. By introducing moiré superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observe a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moiré band with the Chern number tunable from , 1, to 2. Furthermore, integrating monolayer tungsten diselenide at the moiréless interface of rhombohedral decalayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride superlattices stabilizes the Chern insulators, enabling quantized anomalous Hall resistance of . Remarkably, the Chern number can be electrically switched using displacement fields, leading to a topological phase transition from to 2. Our work establishes rhombohedral multilayer graphene moiré superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering, with switchable chirality offering significant promise for integrating chiral edge currents into topological electronic circuits.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid systems of single, trapped ions embedded in quantum gases are a promising platform for quantum simulations and the study of long-range interactions in the ultracold regime. Feshbach resonances allow for experimental control over the character and strength of the atom-ion interaction. However, the complexity of atom-ion Feshbach spectra, e.g., due to second-order spin-orbit coupling, requires a detailed experimental understanding of the resonance properties—such as the contributing open-channel partial waves. In this work, we immerse a single barium ( ) ion in a bath of lithium (Li) atoms spin polarized in their hyperfine ground state to investigate the collision energy dependence of magnetically tunable atom-ion Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate fine control over the kinetic energy of the ion and employ it to explore three-body recombination in the transition from the many- to the few-partial wave regime, marked by a sudden increase of resonant loss. In a dense spectrum—with on average 0.58(1) resonances per Gauss—we select a narrow, isolated feature and characterize it as an -wave resonance. We introduce a quantum recombination model that allows us to distinguish it from higher-partial-wave resonances. Furthermore, in a magnetic field range with no significant loss at the lowest collision energies, we identify a higher-partial-wave resonance that appears and peaks only when we increase the energy to around the -wave limit. Our results demonstrate that hybrid atom-ion traps can reach collision energies well in the ultracold regime and that the ion’s kinetic energy can be employed to tune the collisional complex to resonance, paving the way for fast control over the interaction in settings where magnetic field variations are detrimental to coherence.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using real-time dynamics, perturbation theory, and linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This identification underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-) down-spin-like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional quantum spin liquid, our calculation reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the quantum spin liquids. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in quantum spin liquids but also to generate and control them.},

Based on advanced ab initio many-body theory that includes electron-hole interactions, we report that optical absorption spectroscopy can serve as a sensitive probe of water wires and their ordering. In both liquid and solid water, the main peak of the spectrum is discovered to be a charge-transfer exciton. In water, the charge-transfer exciton is strongly coupled to the H-bonding environment where the exciton is excited between H-bonded water molecules with a large spectral intensity. In regular ice, the spectral weight of the charge-transfer exciton is enhanced by a collective excitation occurring on proton-ordered water wires, whose spectral intensity scales with the ordering length of water wire. The spectral intensity and excitonic interaction strength reaches its maximum in ice XI, where the long-range ordering length yields the most pronounced spectral signal. Our findings suggest that water wires, which widely exist in important physiological and biological systems and other phases of ice, can be directly probed by this approach.},

However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations in this system remains elusive. This challenge is related to the difficulty in determining the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our investigation of the kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant convolutional neural networks—a novel machine learning technique for studying strongly frustrated models. This approach, combined with variational Monte Carlo method, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results’ accuracy for frustrated spin systems in comparison with approaches based on other neural-network architectures. Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, which predicted or Dirac spin-liquid states, our results strongly indicate that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice symmetries. The state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum, and it resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase. This state has significantly lower energy than the lowest-energy states found by the symmetric density matrix renormalization group calculations and other methods.},

Here we investigate the impact of ABSs on the supercurrent through a Josephson junction containing a quantum dot (QD). Additional normal-metal tunneling probes on both sides of the junction unveil the ABSs residing at the semiconductor-superconductor interfaces. Such knowledge provides an ingredient missing in previous studies, improving the connection between theory and experimental data. By varying the ABS energies using electrostatic gates, we show control of the switching current, with the ability to alter it by more than an order of magnitude. Finally, the large degree of ABS tunability allows us to realize a three-site Andreev molecule in which the central QD is screened by both ABSs. This system is studied simultaneously using both supercurrent and spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Because of the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.},

Erasing the mechanical history encoded in disordered materials constitutes a great challenge. Here, we address this problem using experiments and particle dynamic simulations for the case of colloidal glasses made of soft particles densely packed at high volume fractions. We propose a conceptual framework that connects residual stresses, directional memory, and aging of colloidal glasses to the distribution of local shear stresses in the shearing plane. The mean value of the distribution corresponds to the macroscopic stress, the skewness carries information about directional memory, and the standard deviation is related to mechanical aging. Periodically training soft particle glasses near the yield point with a sequence of stress-controlled oscillations provides a fine-tuning of the particle stress distribution. Asymmetric shear stress distributions resulting from previous flow are transformed into symmetric distributions, thereby successfully erasing residual stresses and directional memory. The same methodology is successfully applied to colloidal and polymer gels with thixotropic properties, suggesting that it is general and may be extended to other classes of disordered materials.},

  abstract     = {The disassembly of misfolded protein aggregates is a requirement for the proper functioning of cells. It has implications in multiple neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The active unbundling of fibrillar aggregates has recently been identified as a key rate-limiting step in the disassembly process. However, the nature of the underlying molecular mechanism remains an outstanding question. Here, we develop a coarse-grained computational approach from the atomistic structural information and show that the interactions of molecules tethered to fibrils lead to entropic forces consistent with the unbundling process observed in amyloid α-synuclein disaggregation by Hsp70. We uncover two main types of entropic effects, categorized as intraprotofilament and interprotofilament, which are differentially affected by the system parameters and conditions. Our results show that only highly efficient chaperone systems can overcome the free-energy cost of the lateral association between two protofilaments. Through the analysis of cryoelectron tomography and high-speed atomic force microscopy data, we find that the conditions for highly efficient entropic force generation are those typically achieved with cochaperone networks and ATP hydrolysis, which require energy expenditure but do not provide an enthalpic component to the separation force. We highlight the implications of these results for the design of targeted therapies for the underlying neuropathologies.},

In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we develop techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites.

To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a noncollective to a collective regime of transport, behaves nonmonotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.},

Our detailed magnetization and dilatometry measurements describe the domain selection processes and phase transitions in SrFeO 3 . Spin excitations are investigated using inelastic neutron scattering for all three zero-field phases. In the higher-temperature ordered phases, high-energy magnons increasingly lose coherence, so that spin fluctuations are dominated by a distinct quasielastic component at low energies.

The key device elements, superconducting weak links, are created by conductive atomic force microscope lithography, which can reversibly control the conductivity at the LAO/KTO (110) interface with nanoscale resolution. The periodic modulation of the SQUID critical current I c ( B ) with magnetic field corresponds well with our theoretical modeling, which reveals a large kinetic inductance of the superconducting two-dimensional electron gas in KTO. The kinetic inductance of the SQUID is tunable by electrical gating from the back, due to the large dielectric constant of KTO. The demonstration of weak links and SQUIDs in KTO broadens the scope for exploring the underlying physics of KTO superconductivity, including the role of spin-orbit coupling, pairing symmetry, and inhomogeneity. It also promotes KTO as a versatile platform for a growing family of quantum devices, which could be applicable in the realm of quantum computing and information.},

Typically, phonons dominate the longitudinal thermal conductivity while the thermal Hall effect (THE) is primarily associated with spins, requiring time-reversal symmetry breaking. The coupling between phonons and spins usually depends on spin-orbit interactions and is relatively weak. Here, we propose a new mechanism for this coupling and the associated THE: the skew scattering of phonons via spin fluctuations by the scalar spin chirality. This coupling does not require spin-orbit interactions and is ubiquitous in Mott insulators, leading to a thermal Hall angle on the order of 10 − 3 to 10 − 2 . Based on this mechanism, we investigate the THE in YMnO 3 with a trimerized triangular lattice where the THE beyond spins was recognized, and we predict the THE in the kagome and square lattices.},

Here, we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work sheds light on a subtle aspect of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the long-standing tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.},

  abstract     = {In a multivalley electronic band structure, lifting of the valley degeneracy is associated with rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic fluid and may emerge through spontaneous symmetry breaking order or through a large response to a small external perturbation such as strain. In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sublevels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley’s Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to measure each valley’s low-energy dispersion and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of . The extreme valley polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as approximately 0.1% strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.},

We determine the core of the orbital angular momentum vortex to host an almost movable, twofold, spin-degenerate Weyl nodal line, a topological feature predicted to occur in certain nonsymmorphic crystals. These results establish bimodal dichroism in SX-ARPES as a robust approach to trace 3D orbital textures.

Despite their central role in quantum information, their relations to quantum chaotic evolution and, in particular, to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) are still largely debated issues. This work provides a bridge between the latter and designs through free probability theory. First, by introducing the more general notion of -freeness, we show that it can be used as an alternative probe to designs. In turn, free probability theory comes with several tools, useful, for instance, for the calculation of mixed moments or the so-called -fold quantum channels. Our second result is the connection to quantum dynamics. Quantum ergodicity and, correspondingly, ETH apply to a restricted class of physical observables, as already discussed in the literature. In this spirit, we show that unitary evolution with generic Hamiltonians always leads to freeness at sufficiently long times but only when the operators considered are restricted within the ETH class. Our results provide a direct link between unitary designs, quantum chaos, and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and shed new light on the universality of late-time quantum dynamics.},

The vibrational anomalies in glass at low temperatures are recovered in the stable solid limit, and floppy modes lacking restoring forces are predicted in unstable states below the jamming transition. Near the unjamming transition, the speed of sound v 0 ⊥ vanishes with ∝ − ε , where ε denotes the distance from the critical point. Additionally, the density of states develops a plateau, independent of ε above a frequency ω * which vanishes at the transition, ω * ∝ | ε | . We identify a characteristic length scale in the unjammed phase, λ − ⊥ ∝ 1 / ε , indicating the distance over which injected momentum remains correlated. We confirm the theoretical predictions with numerical solutions of a scalar ERM model, demonstrating overall good qualitative and partly quantitative agreement.},

  abstract     = {Atomic nuclei exhibit multiple energy scales ranging from hundreds of MeV in binding energies to fractions of an MeV for low-lying collective excitations. As the limits of nuclear binding are approached near the neutron and proton drip lines, traditional shell structure starts to melt with an onset of deformation and an emergence of coexisting shapes. It is a long-standing challenge to describe this multiscale physics starting from nuclear forces with roots in quantum chromodynamics. Here, we achieve this within a unified and nonperturbative quantum many-body framework that captures both short- and long-range correlations starting from modern nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. The short-range (dynamic) correlations which account for the bulk of the binding energy are included within a symmetry-breaking framework, while long-range (static) correlations (and fine details about the collective structure) are included by employing symmetry projection techniques. Our calculations accurately reproduce—within theoretical error bars—available experimental data for low-lying collective states and the electromagnetic quadrupole transitions in Ne 20 − 30 . In addition, we reveal coexisting spherical and deformed shapes in Ne 30 , which indicates the breakdown of the magic neutron number N = 20 as the key nucleus O 28 is approached, and we predict that the drip line nuclei Ne 32 , 34 are strongly deformed and collective. By developing reduced-order models for symmetry-projected states, we perform a global sensitivity analysis and find that the subleading singlet S -wave contact and a pion-nucleon coupling strongly impact nuclear deformation in chiral effective field theory. The techniques developed in this work clarify how microscopic nuclear forces generate the multiscale physics of nuclei spanning collective phenomena as well as short-range correlations and allow one to capture emergent and dynamical phenomena in finite fermion systems such as atom clusters, molecules, and atomic nuclei.},

Because of the confinement of the quasiparticles by a vortex, it exhibits a circular-shaped pattern of bound states with discrete energy levels, as predicted by the Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon theory in 1964. Here, however, we report a completely new type of vortex pattern which is necklacelike in an iron-based superconductor KCa 2 Fe 4 As 4 F 2 . Our theoretical analysis shows that this necklacelike vortex pattern arises primarily from selective off-shell interference between vortex bound states of opposite angular momenta in the presence of rotational symmetry breaking due to disorders. This fascinating effect can be observed in a system with a small Fermi energy and wave vector, conditions fortuitously met in our samples. Our results not only disclose a novel vortex structure, but also unravel a completely new quantum phenomenon in the superconducting condensate.},

While the early phase of pattern formation can be understood on the basis of linear stability analyses, the longtime dynamics can only be described by accounting for the interactions between the excitations generated by the drive. Here, we observe the stabilization of square patterns in an interaction-driven, two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These patterns emerge due to inherent high-order processes that become relevant in the regime of large phonon occupations. Theoretically, this can be understood as the emergence of a stable fixed point of coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, which include phonon-phonon interactions. We experimentally probe the predicted flows toward such a stable fixed point, as well as repulsion from a saddle fixed point, using the experimental control unique to quantum gases.},

In this work, we propose a way to realize a U(1) quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of U(1) gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of “magnetic” monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of “electric” charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.},

  abstract     = {Quantum key distribution offers a promising avenue for establishing secure communication networks. However, its performance is significantly hampered by the conventional two-level information carriers (i.e., qubits) due to their limited information capacity and noise resilience. A fundamental approach to overcoming these limitations involves the adoption of high-dimensional qudits. Practical qudit platforms require robust propagation, outstanding controllability, and extreme compactness, to which integrated photonics provides a promising solution. Here, we achieved, for the first time, microlaser-enabled high-dimensional quantum communication through leveraging spin-orbit photon qudits, where the dynamical generation and manipulation of these multi-degrees-of-freedom complex quantum state are realized by a non-Hermitian-physics-driven integrated microlaser quantum transmitter. Such a microlaser photon manipulation, as a novel route towards high-dimensional quantum state generation, promises high energy efficiency, along with fast, compact, and precise qudit state reconfigurability. The four spin-orbit eigenstates emitted by the microlaser possess the same spatial-temporal structures, ensuring homogeneity between all qudit states used for key distribution, which effectively eliminates propagation dephasing and walk-off problems, thereby delivering the high-dimensional spin-orbit secret key generation to construct a robust quantum link. The demonstrated long-term system stability showcases the practical potential of the microlaser quantum transmitter, providing a critical step towards compact, high-information-capacity quantum communication networks.},

However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here, we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such nontrivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wave function, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.},

While it may proceed through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-piece-like particles, many other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together. These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles. Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large aggregates. In addition, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates tend to be anisotropic and fiberlike. Our results are preserved in a more complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates that generic proteinlike characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design principles for artificial self-assembling structures.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special nonequilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally symmetric limit . First, we numerically establish that, despite the fact that spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal , the towers of energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as is increased and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor nonlinearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analytically solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for (with ). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for an arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g., near dynamical critical points or in the presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a by-product, we find a predictive criterion for the presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for , beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.},

  abstract     = {Plasmon polaritons are formed by coupling light with delocalized electrons. The half-light and half-matter nature of plasmon polaritons endows them with unparalleled tunability via a range of parameters, such as dielectric environments and carrier density. Therefore, plasmon polaritons are expected to be tuned when in proximity to polar materials since the carrier density is tuned by an electrostatic potential; conversely, the plasmon polariton response might enable the sensing of polarization. Here, we use infrared nanoimaging and nanophotocurrent measurements to investigate heterostructures composed of graphene and twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-BN), with alternating polarization in a triangular network of moiré stacking domains. We observe that the carrier density and the corresponding plasmonic response of graphene are modulated by polar domains in t-BN. In addition, we demonstrate that the nanometer-wide domain walls of graphene moirés superlattices, created by the polar domains of t-BN, provide momenta to assist the plasmonic excitations. Furthermore, our study establishes that the plasmon of graphene could function as a delicate sensor for polarization textures. The evolution of polarization textures in t-BN under uniform electric fields is tomographically examined via plasmonic imaging. Strikingly, no noticeable polarization switching is observed under applied electric fields up to , at variance with transport reports. Our nanoimages unambiguously reveal that t-BN with triangular domains acts like a ferrielectric rather than a ferroelectric as claimed by many previous studies.},

  abstract     = {In all van der Waals layered antiferromagnetic semiconductors investigated so far, a negative magnetoresistance has been observed in vertical transport measurements, with characteristic trends that do not depend on applied bias. Here, we report vertical transport measurements on a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor that exhibit a drastically different behavior, namely, a strongly bias-dependent, positive magnetoresistance that is accompanied by pronounced oscillations for devices whose thickness is smaller than 10 nm. We establish that this unexpected behavior originates from transport being space-charge limited and not injection limited as for the layered antiferromagnetic semiconductors studied earlier. Our analysis indicates that the positive magnetoresistance and the oscillations only occur when electrons are injected into in-gap defect states, whereas when electrons are injected into the conduction band, the magnetoresistance vanishes. We propose a microscopic explanation for the observed phenomena that combines concepts typical of transport through disordered semiconductors with known properties of the magnetic state, thus capturing all basic experimental observations. Our results illustrate the need to understand, in detail, the nature of transport through vdW magnets in order to extract information about the nature of the order magnetic states and its microscopic properties.},

What determines the shape of the interface between such domains—which, in turn, influences the interactions between cells and overall community function? Here, we address this question by developing a continuum model of a 2D spatially structured microbial community with two distinct cell types. We find that, depending on the balance of the different cell proliferation rates and substrate friction coefficients, the interface between domains is either stable and smooth or unstable and develops fingerlike protrusions. We establish quantitative principles describing when these different interfacial behaviors arise and find good agreement with both the results of previous experimental reports as well as new experiments performed here. Our work, thus, helps to provide a biophysical basis for understanding the interfacial morphodynamics of proliferating microbial communities as well as a broader range of proliferating active systems.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermalization in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e., whether thermalization in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here, we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems that are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e., local random circuits. In particular, we introduce random permutation circuits (RPCs), which are circuits comprising gates that locally permute basis states, as a counterpart to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. RPCs represent a model for generic microscopic classical reversible dynamics but, interestingly, can be interpreted both as classical or as quantum dynamics. We show that, upon averaging over all circuit realizations, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement entropies. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. We, thus, discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum or classical) RPCs. Our results indicate that, despite the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their many-body dynamics exhibits remarkably similar behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that off-resonant coupling between light and the intermembrane cavity can lead to coherent mechanical noise cancellation. On-resonance coupling of light with both the Fabry-Pérot and intermembrane cavities, predicted to enhance the single-photon optomechanical coupling, have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-Pérot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double-membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly fourfold enhancement for the collective motion of double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.},

  abstract     = {We use supervised machine learning together with the concepts of classical density functional theory to investigate the effects of interparticle attraction on the pair structure, thermodynamics, bulk liquid-gas coexistence, and associated interfacial phenomena in many-body systems. Local learning of the one-body direct correlation functional is based on Monte Carlo simulations of inhomogeneous systems with randomized thermodynamic conditions, randomized planar shapes of the external potential, and randomized box sizes. Focusing on the prototypical Lennard-Jones system, we test predictions of the resulting neural attractive density functional across a broad spectrum of physical behavior associated with liquid-gas phase coexistence in bulk and at interfaces. We analyze the bulk radial distribution function g ( r ) obtained from automatic differentiation and the Ornstein-Zernike route and determine (i) the Fisher-Widom line, i.e., the crossover of the asymptotic (large distance) decay of g ( r ) from monotonic to oscillatory, (ii) the (Widom) line of maximal correlation length, (iii) the line of maximal isothermal compressibility, and (iv) the spinodal by calculating the poles of the structure factor in the complex plane. The bulk binodal and the density profile of the free liquid-gas interface are obtained from density functional minimization and the corresponding surface tension from functional line integration. We also show that the neural functional describes accurately the phenomena of drying at a hard wall and of capillary evaporation for a liquid confined in a slit pore. Our neural framework yields results that improve significantly upon standard mean-field treatments of interparticle attraction. Comparison with independent simulation results demonstrates a consistent picture of phase separation even when restricting the training to supercritical states only. We argue that phase coexistence and its associated signatures can be discovered as emerging phenomena via functional mappings and educated extrapolation.},

The encoded GKP qubit is robustly protected against all dominant decoherence channels plaguing superconducting circuits but quasiparticle poisoning. In particular, noise from ancillary modes leveraged for dissipation engineering does not propagate at the logical level. In a state-of-the-art experimental setup, we estimate that the encoded qubit lifetime could extend 2 orders of magnitude beyond the break-even point, with substantial margin for improvement through progress in fabrication and control electronics.

  abstract     = {Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent, say A , may attract another agent B while B repels A . These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and nonbraided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that nonreciprocal interactions result in a nonreciprocal phase transition to time-crystalline traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, signatures of the time-crystal phase can still be identified by inspecting equal-time or two-time correlation functions. Remarkably, continuous monitoring of the output field of the waveguides induces a quantum traveling-wave state: a time-crystalline state of a finite-size quantum system, in which parity-time symmetry is spontaneously broken. Our work lays the foundation to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.},

  abstract     = {Highly excited Rydberg states and their interactions play an important role in quantum computing and simulation. These properties can be predicted accurately for alkali atoms with simple Rydberg level structures. However, an extension of these methods to more complex atoms such as alkaline-earth atoms has not been demonstrated or experimentally validated. Here, we present multichannel quantum defect models for highly excited Yb 174 and Yb 171 Rydberg states with L ≤ 2 . The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous Förster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in Yb 171 using F = 3 / 2 Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable F = 1 / 2 state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled- z gate fidelity of F = 0.994 ( 1 ) , with the remaining error fully explained by known sources. This work establishes a solid foundation for the continued development of quantum computing, simulation, and entanglement-enhanced metrology with Yb neutral atom arrays.},

  abstract     = {The detailed understanding of electronic coherence in quantum systems requires measurements on the attosecond timescale. Attosecond x-ray pulses enable the study of electronic coherence in core-excited molecular systems. Here we report on the coherent motion of electrons in the 1,1-difluoroethylene ion following ionization of the shell of the two nonequivalent carbon sites with a subfemtosecond x-ray pulse. Using the angular streaking technique to track the Auger-Meitner decay, we observe temporal modulations of the emission, indicating the electronic coherence of the core-excited ionic states, and extract a average lifetime of the core-level vacancies. A quantum-mechanical model is employed to interpret the measurement, and we find the observed temporal modulations are independent of charge density oscillations. This work opens a new regime of coherent electronic motion, beyond charge migration, where electronic coherence manifests in the nonlocal quantum correlation between atomic sites while charge density oscillation is absent. Our results broaden the landscape of electronic coherence in molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {Charge order pervades the phase diagrams of quantum materials where it competes with superconducting and magnetic phases, hosts electronic phase transitions and topological defects, and couples to the lattice generating intricate structural distortions. Incommensurate charge order is readily stabilized in manganese oxides, where it is associated with anomalous electronic and magnetic properties, but its nanoscale structural inhomogeneity complicates precise characterization and understanding of its relationship with competing phases. Leveraging atomic-resolution variable-temperature cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the thermal evolution of charge order as it transforms from its ground state in a model manganite system. We find that mobile networks of discommensurations and dislocations generate phase inhomogeneity and induce global incommensurability in an otherwise lattice-locked modulation. Driving the order to melt at high temperatures, the discommensuration density grows, and regions of order locally decouple from the lattice periodicity.},

In this work, we fabricate an LaAlO 3 / KTaO 3 interface superconductor patterned with a nanohoneycomb array of insulating islands. Little-Parks-like magnetoresistance oscillations are observed, which are dictated by the superconducting flux quantum h / 2 e . Moreover, an anomalous negative magnetoresistance (ANMR) appears under a weak magnetic field, suggesting magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. By examining their dependences on temperature, measurement current, and electrical gating, we conclude that both phenomena are associated with superconducting order parameter: The h / 2 e oscillations provide direct evidence of Cooper-pair transport, and the ANMR is interpreted as a consequence of multiple connected narrow superconducting paths with strong fluctuations.},

Combining the theory of skew-product dynamical systems with topological data analysis, we show that simultaneous recurrence events across multiple time series reveal the structure of their shared unobserved driving signal. We introduce a physics-based unsupervised learning algorithm that reconstructs causal drivers by iteratively building a recurrence graph with glasslike structure. As the amount of data increases, a percolation transition on this graph leads to weak ergodicity breaking for random walks—revealing the shared driver’s dynamics, even from strongly corrupted measurements. We relate reconstruction accuracy to the rate of information transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that effective reconstruction proceeds through gradual approximation of the driver’s dynamical attractor. Through extensive benchmarks against classical signal processing and machine learning techniques, we demonstrate our method’s ability to extract causal drivers from diverse experimental datasets spanning ecology, genomics, fluid dynamics, and physiology.},

In the absence of electronic interactions, our analysis provides a systematic rule to find the Chern number of the superlattice-induced miniband starting from the harmonics of the applied potential and a few material-specific coefficients. Our method also applies to anomalous (interaction-generated) bands, for which we derive an efficient algorithm to determine all Chern numbers compatible with a self-consistent solution to the Hartree-Fock equations.

  abstract     = {Natural communities display a rich variety of dynamics, including global stability, multistability, periodic oscillations, and chaotic fluctuations in species abundances. While phenomenological models (e.g., generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics) can replicate these dynamic behaviors, understanding biological reasons behind the phenomena requires modeling mechanistic interactions. In this study, we employ a simple mechanistic framework wherein numerous species compete for various resources. We discover that a broad spectrum of dynamics emerges when species consume resources that minimally contribute to their own growth—a scenario absent in the traditional MacArthur resource-consumer model. As the discrepancy between growth-promoting resources and those predominantly consumed increases, the traditional regime of global stability transitions into a dynamic regime characterized by fluctuating species abundances and the presence of alternative stable states. We pinpoint the onset of instability through random matrix analysis, finding that the critical discrepancy between growth and consumption depends on the ratio of the number of species to the number of resources. By defining growth-promoting resources as the niches of species, we find a clear mechanistic interpretation: Communities lose stability when resource consumption overlaps more with the niche of species with similar resource preferences, indicating consumption outside one’s own niche. Furthermore, we reveal fundamental symmetries of stability in such systems and extend the stability criterion beyond the scope of random matrix analysis. The overlap between consumption and niche effectively captures the diversity and sizes of attraction basins across different attractor types beyond the instability transition. Thus, our framework offers predictive insights and mechanistic explanations for the complex dynamics arising from resource competition.},

Despite the importance of failure resistance in network design and utility, no existing physical model effectively links strand mechanics and connectivity to predict bulk fracture. Here, we reveal a scaling law that bridges these levels to predict the intrinsic fracture energy of diverse stretchable networks. Simulations and experiments demonstrate its remarkable applicability to a breadth of strand constitutive behaviors, topologies, dimensionalities, and length scales. We show that local strand rupture and nonlocal energy release contribute synergistically to the measured intrinsic fracture energy in networks. These effects coordinate such that the intrinsic fracture energy scales independent of the energy to rupture a strand; it instead depends on the strand rupture force, breaking length, and connectivity. Our scaling law establishes a physical basis for fracture of homogeneous networks with uniform strand mechanics and lattice connectivity throughout. The scaling also extends generally for fabricating tough materials from homogeneous networks across multiple length scales.},

  abstract     = {We explore the relationship between higher-form symmetries and entanglement properties in lattice gauge theories with discrete gauge groups, which can exhibit both topologically ordered phases and higher-form symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Our study centers on a generalization of the Fradkin-Shenker model describing Z 2 lattice gauge theory with matter, where the Gauss law constraint can be either emergent or exact. The phase diagram includes a topologically ordered deconfined phase and a nontrivial SPT phase protected by a 1-form and a 0-form symmetry, among others. We obtain the following key findings: First, the entanglement properties of the model depend on whether the 1-form symmetries and the Gauss law constraint are exact or emergent. For the emergent Gauss law, the entanglement spectrum (ES) of the nontrivial SPT phase exhibits degeneracies, which are robust at low energies against weak perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry. When the Gauss law and the 1-form symmetry are both exact, the ES degeneracy is extensive. This extensive degeneracy turns out to be fragile and can be removed completely by infinitesimal perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry while keeping the Gauss law exact. Second, we consider the ES in the topologically ordered phase where 1-form symmetries are spontaneously broken. In contrast to the ES of the nontrivial SPT phase, we find that spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking removes “half” of the ES levels, leading to a nondegenerate ES in the topologically ordered phase, in general. Third, we derive a connection between spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking and the topological entanglement entropy (TEE). Using this relation, we investigate the entanglement entropy that can be distilled in the deconfined phase of the original Fradkin-Shenker model using gauge-invariant measurements. We show that the TEE is robust against the measurement when the 1-form symmetry is emergent but it is fragile when the 1-form symmetry is exact. Our results demonstrate the advantage of higher-form symmetries for understanding entanglement properties of gauge theories.},

  abstract     = {Conventional hydrodynamics describes systems with few long-lived excitations. In one dimension, however, many experimentally relevant systems feature a large number of long-lived excitations and conserved quantities even at high temperature, because they are proximate to integrable limits. Such models cannot be treated using conventional hydrodynamics. The framework of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) was recently developed to treat the dynamics of one-dimensional models: It combines ideas from integrability, hydrodynamics, and kinetic theory to come up with a quantitative theory of transport. GHD has successfully settled several long-standing questions about one-dimensional transport; it has also been leveraged to study dynamical questions beyond the transport of conserved quantities and to systems that are not integrable. In this article, we introduce the main ideas and predictions of GHD, survey some of the most recent theoretical extensions and experimental tests of the GHD framework, and discuss some open questions in transport that the GHD perspective might elucidate.},
