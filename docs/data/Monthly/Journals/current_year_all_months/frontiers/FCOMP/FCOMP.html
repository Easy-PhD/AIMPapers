Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has emerged as a leading choice among IoT communication technologies due to its long-range, low-power, and cost-effective capabilities. However, the rapid proliferation of IoT devices has intensified the challenge of efficient resource management, particularly in spreading factor (SF) allocation for LoRaWAN networks. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based Adaptive Data Rate (ML-ADR) approach for SF management to address this issue. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was trained on a dataset generated using ns-3 for optimal SF classification. The pre-trained LSTM model was then utilized on the end-device side for efficient SF allocation with newly generated data during simulation. The results demonstrate improved packet delivery ratios and reduced energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer is among the most common cancers globally, which calls for timely and precise diagnosis for successful therapy. Conventional methods of diagnosis, including dermoscopy and histopathology, are significantly dependent on expert judgment and therefore are time-consuming and susceptible to inconsistencies. Deep learning algorithms have shown potential in skin cancer classification but tend to consume a substantial amount of computational resources and large training sets. To overcome these issues, we introduce a new hybrid computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that integrates Stem Block for feature extraction and machine learning for classification. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin cancer dermoscopic images were collected from Kaggle, and essential features were collected from the Stem Block of a deep learning (DL) algorithm. The selected features, which were standardized using StandardScaler to achieve zero mean and unit variance, were then classified using a meta-learning classifier to enhance precision and efficiency. In addition, a digital twin framework was introduced to simulate and analyze the diagnostic process virtually, enabling real-time feedback and performance monitoring. This virtual replication aids in continuous improvement and supports the deployment of the CAD system in clinical environments. To improve transparency and clinical reliability, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods were incorporated to visualize and interpret model predictions. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our system reduced training complexities without compromising high classification precision. Our proposed model attained an accuracy level of 96.25%, demonstrating its consistency and computationally efficient status as a screening tool for detecting skin cancer.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Methodological Approach This article is an opinion-based conceptual piece that draws on a targeted selection of peer-reviewed sources to develop a conceptual discussion on digital anthropomorphism in generative AI tutors. To ground our argument in current scholarship, we searched Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science for literature published between 2019 and 2025, using terms such as "AI trust," "digital anthropomorphism," and "generative AI in education." We focused on works that explicitly addressed human–AI interaction, trust psychology, or anthropomorphism in educational contexts, and excluded purely technical studies and noneducational applications. Approximately 45 relevant papers were identified. Rather than conducting a systematic review, we engaged in an informal thematic grouping of recurring ideas— such as perceived authority, emotional reassurance, automation bias, and epistemic vigilance— which informed the structure of this article. The aim here is not to provide exhaustive coverage, but to integrate converging insights from cognitive psychology, human–computer interaction, and educational technology into a coherent, opinion-driven perspective on trust calibration in AI-mediated learning. Introduction: When the Machine Feels Human Today's students interact more with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini as conversational partners rather than as disembodied software. When these systems respond with fluency, politeness, and encouragement, they create a subtle but potent illusion: the AI appears to "understand" the user (Cohn et al., 2024; Karimova & Goby, 2020). This phenomenon, known as digital anthropomorphism, leads students to attribute human-like qualities—such as empathy, intelligence, and trustworthiness—to non-human systems (Jensen, 2021; Placani, 2024). This article offers a conceptual, opinion-based synthesis of recent peer-reviewed literature on this topic, drawing on insights from cognitive psychology, human–computer interaction, and educational technology. Our aim is not to provide an exhaustive or systematic review but to integrate converging findings into a coherent framework for understanding trust calibration in AI-mediated education. We structure the discussion around the conceptual pathway illustrated in Figure 1, which traces how anthropomorphic design cues may foster affective trust, reduce epistemic vigilance, and influence learner dependency, while also considering contexts in which anthropomorphism can enhance engagement and confidence when ethically designed. The Cognitive Basis of Digital Anthropomorphism Digital anthropomorphism is not a failure of rationality, but rather a manifestation of human social cognition (Fakhimi et al., 2023). Developmental psychology has demonstrated that even children ascribe intention and moral status to animated forms if they move in goal-oriented manners. Adults too habitually treat chatbots, GPS, and voice assistants as being quasi-social actors—to thank them, apologize, or obey their instructions. Generative AI amplifies this impact with linguistic anthropomorphism. Its natural language proficiency activates people's social brain mechanisms— soliciting empathy, engagement, and even perceived moral agency (Alabed et al., 2022; Q. Chen & Park, 2021). Human-computer interaction studies show that individuals are more willing to take advice from a friendly, courteous chatbot than from a direct or technical interface, even when the information is the same. This has its roots in what Clifford Nass called the "media equation": the hypothesis that people treat computers and media as if they were actual people and places. The conversational AI's design—affirmative statements, natural turns, emotional tone—invokes this illusion more powerfully than any earlier model of education technology (Inie et al., 2024). As outlined in Figure 1, these interface features can initiate a sequence from perceived empathy and authority to emotional trust, which may, in turn, lower epistemic vigilance. In the teaching environment, this has significant implications. A student made to feel "helped" or "seen" through interaction with an AI tutor is more likely to feel motivated and emotionally secure—but less apt to scrutinize the system's correctness and fairness. Its emotional trust will countervail the critical examination of the user, even when the AI tutor emulates reassurance and confidence (Chinmulgund et al., 2023). While these tendencies are well-documented in human–computer interaction and consumer research, their expression in formal educational settings is likely to be context-dependent. Factors such as learners' age, subject matter, prior exposure to AI, and cultural norms may moderate the strength of anthropomorphic responses. In this article, we treat such effects as plausible tendencies supported by adjacent literature, rather than as universal outcomes, and highlight the need for empirical validation within classroom environments. Perceived Authority and the Illusion of Understanding Belief in AI tutors is frequently influenced through perceived epistemic authority. When an AI system provides clear, assertive, and technical definitions, students might conclude that "it knows" as a human expert might. But AI systems do not know—they respond based upon statistical relationships, not conceptual understanding. This pretense of knowledge is a pernicious epistemic trap (Lalot & Bertram, 2024). It causes learners to take AI responses as authoritative, particularly when they have no pre-existing knowledge to analyze them with. Additionally, if AI response is written in didactic pedagogical tones or affective supportive tones, it reinforces the image of a wise and well-meaning tutor (Troshani et al., 2020). Educational psychology experiments demonstrate that students often rate feedback as more useful when delivered with confidence, even if the information is inaccurate. This link between confident tone and perceived expertise represents a plausible mechanism consistent with experimental findings in both educational and broader HCI contexts (Lalot & Bertram, 2024; Troshani et al., 2020), though its generalizability to all classroom settings remains to be confirmed. Such a 'confidence heuristic' is problematic when used with AI systems trained to optimize fluency and not epistemic truth. This aligns with findings by Atf and Lewis (2025), who demonstrate that user trust in AI systems is often driven by surface fluency and not correlated with explainability, especially in educational domains(Maeda, 2025). Figure 1. Conceptual synthesis — Psychological Pathway Linking Digital Anthropomorphism to Epistemic Vulnerability in AI-Mediated Learning. This diagram illustrates how interface design features that evoke human-like qualities can lead to affective trust, which in turn may reduce learners' epistemic vigilance, resulting in over-reliance, diminished critical thinking, and role confusion. Note: This is a conceptual synthesis derived from the thematic literature review and is not an empirically estimated model. Trust, Dependency, and the Erosion of Epistemic Vigilance From a psychological perspective, trust in learning is both required and dangerous. Students need to trust instructors to direct them, but they must also cultivate epistemic vigilance—the capacity to evaluate the believability of information sources. When students anthropomorphize AI tutors, their epistemic filters could weaken. Emotional trust in AI can be expressed as: • Over-reliance on AI feedback over teacher guidance. • Inadequate effort to cross-check or challenge AI-produced responses. • Acceptance of imperfect or slanted results, particularly if they come with persuasive voice (A. Chen & Wan, 2023). These tendencies are echoed in research about automation bias—the tendency to over-rely on machines even when their projections contradict good sense. When AI-mediated learning takes place, this is the way it has the ability to bring about lower levels of something called self-efficacy, less critical thinking, and dependence upon external feedback. And students tend to feel a kind of role confusion. When the AI is perceived as supportive, affectively responsive, and all-knowing, the student is apt to take on a receiving role, sacrificing their cognitive agency. Losing watchfulness is not only cognitive—it is emotional. When the machine comes across as friendly, students feel guilty questioning it. When the machine provides speedy responses, they feel impatient with complex questions. While such emotional reactions have been observed anecdotally in educational technology contexts, systematic empirical evidence for these specific effects in AI tutoring environments is still emerging. We therefore present these as conceptual extrapolations, grounded in related work on social responses to media and automation bias (Pergantis et al., 2025; Ryan, 2020), rather than as universally established findings. This quiet process from doubt to submission is a pivotal moment in the psychology of trust (Ryan, 2020). This accords with Pergantis et al.'s (2025) research, which shows that extensive AI interactions have the potential to move cognitive control processes underlying autonomous learning. Even though such flaws require close analysis, no less true is the fact that anthropomorphic indicators have, in certain scenarios, the potential to render useful pedagogical roles if appropriately and responsibly conceptualized. Productive Anthropomorphism and Ethical Design Although much of the debate about anthropomorphism in AI tutors centers on its possible dangers, it is valuable to note that human-like signals can have positive teaching outcomes as well, when implemented sensitively. Anthropomorphic design features can improve students' engagement, minimize feelings of loneliness in online classrooms, and give emotional comfort to students who are anxious or self-doubting. For instance, learners who have mathematical anxiety or who have limited exposure to human tutors may respond positively to an AI tutor's persistent, nonjudgmental feedback (Polydoros et al., 2025). Others who are shy or socially fearful may be more at ease conversing with an amicable AI interface than with colleagues or teachers in live classes. Ethical calibration is the answer: balancing motivational advantages of anthropomorphism with characteristics that maintain critical thinking and epistemic vigilance. Characteristics like that may be achieved through the use of transparency prompts, source citations that are visible, and infrequent "reflection nudges" which get students to stop and double-check information. In combination with instructional guidance, design strategies like these hold promise for making anthropomorphic cues function as a learning scaffold, not a shortcut to mere passive acceptance. Toward a Psychology of Critical Trust in AI Tutors To enter this psychological territory of anthropomorphism in the digital age, teachers must encourage students to cultivate critical trust—a mindset to be open to the affordances, yet cautious about the limits, of AI. Even technical literacy won't suffice; psychological sensitivity is needed (Mulcahy et al., 2023). Educational interventions might include: ➢ AI debriefs: Short reflection exercises that get students to present an AI-generated response that was utilized and answer three guiding questions: (1) What was the chief argument of the AI? (2) What sources, if any, did it reference? (3) How did you test or refute it? This helps students be mindful of their uses of AI intentionally. ➢ Counter-anthropomorphism exercises: Students reword an AI's polite, human-sounding response in purely technical terms, removing social signals. This helps students contrast how tone and style affect their perception of authority and reliability. ➢ Trust calibration training: Checklists or short classroom protocols that encourage students to ask, before accepting an AI's response: (1) Is there a legitimate source? (2) Is my explanation consistent with my prior knowledge? (3) Have I checked it elsewhere? This training induces the habit of separating interface ease from epistemic reliability. Educators can model critical trust through transparent and explainable use of AI in class, revealing its benefits and its limitations. Guided classroom debates about issues like algorithm bias, hallucinations, and surface fluency versus deep knowledge can "immunize" students against excessive faith. Classroom activities that engage students in collaborative tasks can further erode passive dependence: for instance, group debates where students are asked to argue against an answer generated by an AI, or collaborative projects where human and AI readings of the same content are evaluated side by side for nuance, tone, and cultural reference. These exercises tie directly to earlier interventions like AI debriefs, counter-anthropomorphizing, and calibration of trust, building upon them through active exercise. In the long run, establishing critical trust may even necessitate interface redesigns—with features like visible source quotation, easy-to-understand explainability tools, and interactive prompting that invite reflection before accepting an AI's answer. Research Pathways for Calibrating Trust in Generative AI Tutors Future research should explore the psychology of anthropomorphism in AI tutors across diverse educational contexts (Létourneau et al., 2025). We propose two complementary tracks: Track A – Affective Trust Calibration ❖ Investigate how learners distinguish between the emotional tone and epistemic validity of AI responses. ❖ Test interventions such as meta-cognitive prompts, counter-anthropomorphism training, and AI explanation auditing to determine their effectiveness in sustaining critical vigilance (Chakraborty et al., 2024; Israfilzade & Sadili, 2024). ❖ Explore the impact of interface features (e.g., source citations, uncertainty indicators, reflection nudges) on trust calibration over time. Track B – Population and Context Variance ❖ Examine differences in anthropomorphic responses across developmental stages, from adolescents with still-developing critical thinking skills to adult learners. ❖ Assess the unique effects on language learners, students with math anxiety, and those with varying degrees of self-confidence (Polydoros et al., 2025). ❖ Investigate how neurodiverse learners respond to AI tutors — identifying where consistent feedback supports learning versus where the absence of genuine empathy may hinder it. ❖ Anticipate the effects of multimodal AI (voice, facial expressions, haptics) on perceptions of agency, authority, and moral status. Pursuing these research tracks will help identify how to leverage the motivational benefits of anthropomorphism while minimizing the risks of epistemic over-reliance. Such insights are essential for co-designing ethical AI systems that inform, augment, and empower learners without compromising intellectual autonomy. Limitations and Scope Limitations and Scope. This article is presented as an opinion-based conceptual synthesis rather than a systematic review or empirical study. The thematic grouping of sources reflects a targeted but non-exhaustive selection of peer-reviewed literature published between 2019 and 2025. While many of the mechanisms discussed—such as automation bias, trust heuristics, and the influence of anthropomorphic cues—are supported by existing studies in related domains, some affective and behavioral claims are hypotheses requiring further empirical validation in classroom contexts. Findings and interpretations should therefore be considered context-dependent and provisional, intended to inform ongoing scholarly and design conversations rather than to offer definitive causal conclusions. Conclusion: Learning with the Non-Human Other Generative AI is not a neutral tool. Its linguistic fluency, affective tone, and interactive style are designed to mimic human-like interactivity, eliciting anthropomorphic responses from students who may greet AI tutors as intelligent guides, caring listeners, or moral figures (Hossain & Islam, 2024; Sarfaraj1, 2025). Such responses can enrich the learning experience when they foster motivation, confidence, and a sense of social presence (Polydoros et al., 2025). However, they also carry the risk of distorting teacher–student dynamics and encouraging uncritical trust (Vanneste & Puranam, 2024; Yuan & Hu, 2024). The challenge is not to eliminate trust in AI tutors but to calibrate it—ensuring that trust is informed, tentative, and tempered by awareness of the system's non-human constraints (Okamura & Yamada, 2020). This means leveraging the productive aspects of anthropomorphism while embedding safeguards such as transparency features, reflection prompts, and guided debriefs that preserve epistemic vigilance (Chakraborty et al., 2024; Mulcahy et al., 2023). In an algorithmically mediated educational future, the goal is to develop learners who can recognize when AI offers valuable support and when its persuasive surface masks the need for independent reasoning. Ultimately, critical trust allows students to use AI as a partner in learning without surrendering their intellectual autonomy (Ryan, 2020).},

  abstract     = {Multimodal large-scale language modeling has become the mainstream approach in natural language processing tasks and has been applied to various cross-modal fields such as image description and visual question answering. However, large-scale language modeling has high computational complexity and a large operational scale, which presents significant challenges for deployment in many resource-constrained scenarios. To address such problems, a lightweight multimodal framework, LLaVA-GM, is proposed, based on LLaVA, which can be deployed on devices with low resource requirements and has greatly reduced model parameters. It can also be tested on common VQA tasks and achieves good performance. The main contributions and work are as follows: First, it is found that the backbone of the Vicuna language model in LLaVA is too redundant. When fine-tuning downstream tasks, a very small amount of data sets is difficult to affect the language model. It is replaced with a new Gemma language model, thereby achieving fast task-specific adaptation with fewer parameters and data. Second, in response to the problem of information redundancy, the MoE mixed expert model is introduced. This model can be used in combination with itself, combining the MoE mixed expert model with Gemma to reduce the amount of computation while maintaining performance. Directly training the entire model will lead to a decline in performance. A multi-stage training strategy is adopted to maintain performance. First, the MLP layer is trained for visual adaptation, then the entire Gemma model is trained to improve multimodal capabilities, and finally only the MoE layer is trained for sparsification to ensure a smooth transition from dense models to sparse models. The experiment was tested on multiple VQA datasets and achieved good performance, confirming the potential of this compact model in downstream multimodal applications.},

  abstract     = {Smart contracts are software that runs in blockchain and expresses the rules of an agreement between parties. An incorrect smart contract might allow blockchain users to violate its rules and even jeopardize its expected security. Smart contracts cannot be easily replaced to patch a bug since the nature of contracts requires them to be immutable. More problems occur when a smart contract is written in a general-purpose language, such as Java, whose executions, in a blockchain, could hang the network, break consensus or violate data encapsulation. To limit these problems, there exist automatic static analyzers that find bugs before smart contracts are installed in the blockchain. This so-called off-chain verification is optional because programmers are not forced to use it. This paper presents a general framework for the verification of smart contracts, instead, that is part of the protocol of the nodes and applies when the code of the smart contracts gets installed. It is a mandatory entry filter that bans code that does not abide by the verification rules. Consequently, such rules become part of the consensus rules of the blockchain. Therefore, an improvement in the verification protocol entails a consensus update of the network. This paper describes an implementation of a smart contracts application layer with protocol-based verification for smart contracts written in the Takamaka subset of Java, that filters only those smart contracts whose execution in blockchain is not dangerous. This application layer runs on top of a consensus engine such as Tendermint and its derivatives Ignite and CometBFT (proof of stake), or Mokamint (proof of space). This paper provides examples of actual implementations of verification rules that check if the smart contracts satisfy some constraints required by the Takamaka language. This paper shows that protocol-based verification works and reports how consensus updates are implemented. It shows actual experiments as well as limits to its use, mainly related to the fact that protocol-based verification must be fast and its complexity must never explode, or otherwise, it would compromise the performance of the blockchain network.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThis research addresses the security weaknesses in SOAP-based web services, with a particular focus on authentication vulnerabilities resulting from XML-based attacks, such as Signature Wrapping or Replay Attacks. With an emphasis on the fact that an increasing number of cloud services are utilizing SOAP, this study aims to develop a formally verified model that can more effectively identify and address these vulnerabilities.MethodWe propose and execute a TulaFale-based verification framework that formally models SOAP authentication scenarios by introducing the standard constructs, UsernameToken, Timestamp, and X.509 digital certificates. These scripts are transformed into the applied pi-calculus and verified using the ProVerif verification tool to check for properties such as authentication, confidentiality, and message integrity.ResultsBy examining XML web services security problems and consulting with security professionals, a number of key risks were identified and discussed. The research contributes to developing a comprehensive language design for cloud security and vulnerabilities using Blanchet’s ProVerif. A controlled experimental testbed was set up to emulate client–server SOAP communication streams and to evaluate the model’s effectiveness in identifying an XML-based attack performed on the web services security framework. The framework was experimentally examined for verification time and scalability for concurrency, and for accuracy of identification. The results confirmed our success in identifying attack patterns and confirming secure message exchanges built to the standards set by WS-Security.DiscussionThe proposed approach addresses and allows for the addition of automated, formal verification to realistic SOAP deployments. By modeling and verifying a security protocol before the deployment, developers can be confident that their implementation is resilient against protocol-level vulnerabilities, improving the trust in the security of web services deployed within cloud applications.},

Building on research showing that physiological synchrony relates to social bonding, we speculate about an interpersonal musical biofeedback system that promotes synchrony by allowing users to attune to each other’s physiological rhythms. We propose a two‑stage AI training framework for an interpersonal musical biofeedback system: (1) a Foundational Model trained on diverse listeners’ physiological responses to a music library, and (2) Individualized Tuning, where the system fine-tunes itself to each user’s unique physiological responses. By analyzing musical features alongside real-time physiological responses, the proposed system illustrates a feasible architecture for dynamically personalizing music to facilitate nonverbal, embodied communication between users. This approach highlights the potential for AI-driven personalization that move beyond individual optimization to actively enhance physiological synchrony which may promote deeper emotional bonding and expand the role of music as a medium for AI-mediated social connections.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the highest-ranking type of cancer, with 2.3 million new cases diagnosed each year. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the gold standard “examination” for determining the expression of cancer malignancies in patients with the ultimate goal of determining prognosis and therapy. Immunohistochemistry refers to the four WHO standard biomarkers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, and Ki-67. These biomarkers are assessed based on the quantity of cell nuclei and the intensity of brown cell membranes. Our study aims to detect the expression of breast cancer malignancy as an initial step in determining prognosis and therapy. We implemented homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble learning models. The homogeneous ensemble learning model uses the majority vote technique to select the best performance between the Xception, ResNet50V2, InceptionResNet50V2, and ConvNextTiny models. The heterogeneous ensemble learning model takes the ConvNextTiny model as the best model. Feature engineering in ConvNextTiny combines convolution and cell-quantification features as feature fusion. ConvNextTiny, which applies feature fusion, can detect the expression of cancer malignancy. Heterogeneous ensemble learning outperforms homogeneous ensemble learning. The model performs well for accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.997, 0.973, 0.991, 0.982, and 0.994, respectively. These results indicate that the model can classify the malignancy expressions of breast cancer well. This model still requires the configuration of the visual laboratory device to test the real-time model capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of autonomous and Connected Vehicles (CVs) has led to a massive increase in Vehicular Big Data (VBD). While this data is transforming the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), it also poses significant challenges in processing, communication, and resource scalability. Existing cloud solutions offer scalable resources; however, incur long delays and costs due to distant data communication. Conversely, edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source; however, struggles to scale with the high volume and velocity of VBD. This paper introduces a novel Regional Computing (RC) paradigm for VBD offloading, with a key focus on adapting to traffic variations during peak and off-peak hours. Situated between edge and cloud layers, the RC layer enables near-source processing while maintaining higher capacity than edge or fog nodes. We propose a dynamic offloading algorithm that continuously monitors workload intensity, network utilization, and temporal traffic patterns to smartly offload tasks to the optimal tier (vehicle, regional, or cloud). This strategy ensures responsiveness across fluctuating conditions while minimizing delay, congestion, and energy consumption. To validate the proposed architecture, we develop a custom Python-based simulator, RegionalEdgeSimPy, specifically designed for VBD scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces processing latency, energy usage, and operational costs compared to traditional models, offering a scalable and effective alternative for next-generation vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionDespite all the efforts to successfully implement DevOps practices, principles, and cultural change, there is still a lack of understanding on how DevOps team structure formation and performance differences are related. The lack of a ground truth for DevOps team structure formation and performance has become a persistent and relevant problem for companies and researchers.MethodsIn this study, we propose a framework for DevOps team Formation–Performance and conduct a survey to examine the relationships between team formations and performance with the five metrics we identified, two of which are novel. We conducted an empirical study using a survey to gather data. We employed targeted outreach on a social media platform along via a snowball sampling and sent 380 messages to DevOps professionals worldwide. This approach resulted in 122 positive responses and 105 completed surveys, achieving a 69.7% response rate from those who agreed to participate.ResultsThe research shows that implementing the DevOps methodology enhances team efficiency across various team structures, with the sole exception of “Separate Development and Operation teams with limited collaboration”. Moreover, the study reveals that all teams experienced improvements in Repair/Recovery performance metric following DevOps adoption. Notably, the “Separate Development and Operation teams with high collaboration” formation emerged as the top performer in the key metrics, including Deployment Frequency, Number of Incidents, and Number of Failures/Service Interruptions. The analysis further indicates that different DevOps organizational formations do not significantly impact Lead Time, Repair/Recovery, and Number of Failures/Service Interruptions in terms of goal achievement. However, a statistically significant disparity was observed between “Separate Development and Operation teams with high collaboration” and “A single team formation” regarding the Deployment Frequency goal achievement percentage.DiscussionThe analysis confirms that DevOps adoption improves performance across most team formations, with the exception of “Separate Development and Operation teams with limited collaboration” (TeamType1), which shows significant improvement only in Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Standardized effect size calculations (Cohen’s d) reveal that TeamType2 (“Separate Development and Operation teams with high collaboration”) consistently achieves large effects in Deployment Frequency (DF), Number of Incidents (NoI), and Number of Failures/Service Interruptions (NoF/NoSI), while TeamType3 shows strong results for Lead Time (LT) and NoF/NoSI. MTTR improvements are large across all formations, with TeamType4 performing best in this metric. These findings suggest that collaboration intensity is a critical determinant of performance gains. While team formation type does not significantly influence LT, MTTR, or NoF/NoSI goal achievement, DF goal achievement is significantly higher for TeamType2 compared to TeamType4, highlighting the potential competitive advantage of high-collaboration structures.},

This study examines the SELFEX platform, an augmented reality (AR)–based training system enabling junior operators to learn autonomously by replicating recorded performances of senior operators. Using a mixed-methods design, the research combined a technical analysis of AR’s functionality, benefits, and constraints with an empirical evaluation in an industrial setting. Seventeen participants completed training tasks using either conventional screens or AR headsets, with subjective measures including satisfaction, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and flow state, alongside objective performance metrics. Results showed that AR training was particularly beneficial for novices, enhancing engagement, understanding, and perceived ease of learning, though no statistically significant performance differences with screen-based training were found. Correlation analyses revealed strong links between flow, satisfaction, and ease of learning, highlighting the importance of intuitive, well-integrated design. Challenges in integrating AR into professional workflows—such as technical stability and user adoption—were also identified. These findings position AR as a promising tool for accessible and immersive industrial training, capable of supporting both initial skill acquisition and potential future upskilling. Further longitudinal studies are recommended to evaluate long-term impacts on performance, retention, and cost-effectiveness, and to refine system usability for diverse user profiles.},

Using the keywords ‘cyberbullying’, ‘students’, and ‘perceptions’, we narrowed down 6,271 initial articles to 14 that met our inclusion criteria. Additionally, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 193 Portuguese students aged between 10 and 19 to understand their perceptions of cyberbullying. Our analysis revealed cyberbullying as a growing concern with significant negative impacts on students’ mental and emotional wellbeing. The correlation between our questionnaire results and the scoping study findings emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive intervention strategies. Our research indicates that effective cyberbullying prevention requires a multi-faceted approach including: development of social and emotional skills among students; promotion of appropriate technology use beyond technical literacy; targeted teacher training programs; establishment of clear intervention protocols within schools; empowerment of cyber-observers as active prevention agents; and recognition that cyberbullying often functions as an extension of face-to-face aggression rather than anonymous attacks. This study brings into focus the critical importance of fostering digital citizenship within educational settings, with teachers and school administrators playing pivotal roles in creating safe digital environments. The findings underscore how properly structured educational interventions can significantly increase reporting rates and decrease cyberbullying incidents, thereby promoting students’ overall wellbeing in the digital age.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a fundamental role in reshaping modern industry, transforming it into a realm characterized by high performance, safety, and sustainability. By optimizing manufacturing workflows and minimizing operational expenses and product flaws, AI-driven technologies are becoming essential tools in industrial innovation. The deployment of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods allows for an effective processing and interpretation of massive datasets, which is critical for informed decision-making and strategic control. As we enter the era of Industry 5.0, the focus shifts toward integrating human capabilities with sophisticated, decentralized automation platforms. This emerging collaboration between people and machines promises a new level of customization, efficiency, and sustainability in the industrial output. Such synergy is essential for building adaptive systems that align with both economic goals and societal values. Furthermore, global efforts are accelerating the development of intelligent manufacturing systems, where interconnected machines equipped with sensor networks facilitate real-time communication and automation. These advancements significantly contribute to the realization of environmentally conscious and economically viable production models.As industries pursue smarter and more sustainable operations, DL methods are being explored for autonomous decision-making through machine-to-machine communication. This approach leverages edge and IoT technologies for scalability, energy efficiency, and reduced latency. However, deploying models on resource-limited devices requires balancing performance and real-time constraints. Understanding how these systems operate under real-world conditions is essential. Moreover, industries like robotics, manufacturing, and autonomous transport require trustworthy, reliable AI systems to gain user confidence. Combined with modern sensors, communication and big data analytics platforms, DL methodologies will play a key role in assisting human operators and increasing overall productivity. In this scenario, designing intelligent systems capable of integrating sensors, controllers, wireless and communication technologies in an effective orchestration is essential for a sustainable production. Thus, AI researchers are focusing on methods to support smart factories in designing flexible, adaptable and modular production lines.This research topic on \textit{Deep Learning for Industrial Applications} aims to explore recent breakthroughs that are shaping the future of automated and responsive industrial operations. The collection of research articles spans a variety of implementations, each demonstrating how DL techniques are reshaping the way industrial problems are tackled. Core themes include sparse neural networks, human-in-the-loop AI, augmented reality, and sophisticated computer vision algorithms, to address diverse real-world challenges such as optimizing industrial processes, enhancing security, improving urban mapping, and advancing public health education. \cite{10.3389/fcomp.2025.1563942} investigate sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to reduce the high computational demands of DL models for resource-constrained industrial edge devices, aiming for greater sustainability and efficiency. The study compares pruning techniques on ANNs for anomaly detection and object classification, finding that sparse ANNs, especially with the SET method, save energy without losing accuracy, making them ideal for industrial use. \cite{10.3389/frai.2025.1518850} introduce a novel human-in-the-loop hybrid augmented intelligence approach to boost the safety, reliability, and efficiency of security inspection systems by integrating human and machine intelligence. It combines AI's strengths in routine contraband detection with human reasoning for complex situations. The method demonstrates that an hybrid method enhances risk perception, reduces human labor, and improves overall efficiency and decision-making for contraband detection.\cite{10.3389/fcomp.2024.1420965} address Salient Object Detection (SOD) challenges using a novel cGAN-based method, which employs an encoder-decoder generator to improve feature extraction and salient object segmentation. Key enhancements include Wasserstein-1 distance for stability and a spatial attention gate for intricate saliency cues, overcoming issues like training instability and poor context capture. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show superior performance, demonstrating lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values compared to other state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for precise object detection in various applications.\cite{10.3389/fcomp.2023.1143945} present a generalizable data-driven pipeline for mapping transparent urban features like fences using standard segmentation models, tackling the challenge of transparent object detection. The proposed method uses street view imagery with a novel multi-line-based annotation style. \cite{10.3389/fcomp.2019.00001} introduce an augmented reality (AR) app designed to teach users how to interpret carbohydrate information on real packaged food labels. The app guides users to nutritional data and explains ``carb choices''.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and related technologies, human-smart object relationships have become increasingly diversified. As smart object become deeply embedded in human society, this has given rise to emerging ethical issues—particularly human-smart object attachment—whose characteristics and influencing pathways remain unclear. This study focuses on the context of wearable smart devices and adopts a two-stage mixed-methods approach: First, based on assemblage theory and existing literature, we construct a three-phase theoretical framework encompassing human-smart object assemblage formation, experience, and attachment. Subsequently, using grounded theory, we conduct in-depth interviews with users of wearable smart objects and employ a three-tier coding process to clarify the conceptualization, typology, and formation pathways of human-smart object attachment. The findings reveal that human-smart object attachment is essentially a psychological bond formed through “self-extension” and “self-expansion,” facilitated by human-smart object capability synergy. It encompasses cognitive, affective, and conative dimensions and is influenced by three key factors: the user, the smart object, and the interaction process. Furthermore, the study explores the impact of human-smart object attachment on user attitudes and behaviors. As a unique phenomenon, the complexity of human-smart object attachment calls for HCI scholars to adopt multidisciplinary perspectives to investigate its mechanisms and effects. Such insights can assist enterprises and communities in developing technology products that better align with user needs.},

  abstract     = {The risk of fires in both indoor and outdoor scenarios is constantly rising around the world. The primary goal of a fire detection system is to minimize financial losses and human casualties by rapidly identifying flames in diverse settings, such as buildings, industrial sites, forests, and rural areas. Traditional fire detection systems that use point sensors have limitations in identifying early ignition and fire spread. Numerous existing computer vision and artificial intelligence-based fire detection techniques have produced good detection rates, but at the expense of excessive false alarms. In this paper, we propose an advanced fire and smoke detection system on the DetectNet_v2 architecture with ResNet-18 as its backbone. The framework uses NVIDIA’s Train-Adapt-Optimize (TAO) transfer learning methods to perform model optimization. We began by curating a custom data set comprising 3,000 real-world and synthetically augmented fire and smoke images to enhance models’ generalization across diverse industrial scenarios. To enable deployment on edge devices, the baseline FP32 model is fine-tuned, pruned, and subsequently optimized using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to generate an INT8 precision inference model with its size reduced by 12.7%. The proposed system achieved a detection accuracy of 95.6% for fire and 92% for smoke detections, maintaining a mean inference time of 42 ms on RTX GPUs. The comparative analysis revealed that our proposed model outperformed the baseline YOLOv8, SSD MobileNet_v2, and Faster R-CNN models in terms of precision and F1-scores. Performance benchmarks on fire instances such as mAP@0.5 (94.9%), mAP@0.5:0.95 (87.4%), and a low false rate of 3.5% highlight the DetectNet_v2 framework’s robustness and superior detection performance. Further validation experiments on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Xavier NX platforms confirmed their effective real-time inference capabilities, making them suitable for deployment in safety-critical scenarios and enabling human-in-the-loop verification for efficient alert handling.},

  abstract     = {The computer-aided diagnosis helps medical professionals detect and classify lung diseases from chest X-rays by leveraging medical image processing and central server-based machine learning models. These technologies provide real-time assistance to analyze the input and help efficiently detect the abnormalities at the earliest. However, traditional learning models are not suitable for live scenarios that require privacy, data diversity, and decentralized processing. The Federated learning-based model facilitates the protection of medical data privacy while processing a large volume of medical images, aiming to improve the overall efficiency of the model. This paper proposes a Federated Learning based Ensemble Model (FLEM) framework for an efficient diagnosis of lung diseases. The FLEM utilizes explainable AI techniques, including SHAP, Grad-CAM, and Differential Privacy, to provide transparency and interpretability of predictions while maintaining the privacy and security of medical data. We applied InceptionV3, Conv2D, VGG16, and ResNet-50 models on the COVID-19, TB, and pneumonia datasets and analysed the performance of the models in FLEM and Central Server-based Learning Model (CSLM). The performance analysis shows that the FLEM model outperformed the traditional CSLM model in terms of accuracy, training time, and bandwidth consumption. CSLM witnesses a quicker convergence time than FLEM. Although the CSLM model converged after a considerable number of epochs, it resulted in a 5, 8, 9, and 10% accuracy reduction compared to the FLEM-based training of InceptionV3, Conv2D, VGG16, and ResNet50 that achieved accuracies of 91.8, 88, 92.5, and 95.5%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in computer vision tasks. Current adversarial detections are ineffective against white-box attacks and inefficient when deep CNNs generate high-dimensional hidden features. This study proposes MeetSafe, an effective and scalable adversarial example (AE) detection against white-box attacks. MeetSafe identifies AEs using critical hidden features rather than the entire feature space. We observe a non-uniform distribution of Z-scores between clean samples and adversarial examples (AEs) among hidden features and propose two utility functions to select those most relevant to AEs. We process critical hidden features using feature engineering methods: local outlier factor (LOF), feature squeezing, and whitening, which estimate feature density relative to its k-neighbors, reduce redundancy, and normalize features. To deal with the curse of dimensionality and smooth statistical fluctuations in high-dimensional features, we propose local reachability density (LRD). Our LRD iteratively selects a bag of engineered features with random cardinality and quantifies their average density by its k-nearest neighbors. Finally, MeetSafe constructs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with the processed features and detects AEs if it is seen as a local outlier, shown by a low density from GMM. Experimental results show that MeetSafe achieves 74%, 96%, and 79% of detection accuracy against adaptive, classic, and white-box attacks, respectively, and at least 2.3× faster than comparison methods.},

As a case study, we explored the umarell phenomenon, a deeply rooted tradition in the Emilia Romagna region, where retired men spend their time observing construction sites and offering unsolicited advice.MethodsOur intervention was designed using Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) methods, involving 15 young adults in a focus group and 73 participants in a survey. To engage digital natives in urban spaces, we developed an in-situ experience that combines tangible artifacts with interactive 3D digital content accessible through Augmented Reality (AR) on a mobile application. Our approach leverages smartphone sensors, including GPS and gyroscopes, to dynamically adjust and contextualize the 3D building model within the real environment, enhancing spatial awareness and immersion. To assess the effectiveness of our solution, we involved approximately 125 teenagers and young adults in a public demonstration.ResultsThe findings show that the umarell concept is more familiar to adults, who also recognize its territorial value, whereas younger participants were drawn primarily to the app's digital features (AR function and 3D model).DiscussionThis study extends existing research by showing how hybrid strategies, combining mobile AR with tangible elements, enhance engagement with cultural heritage among younger audiences. The intergenerational co-design process helped identify meaningful features while mitigating risks of cultural flattening and commodification. Overall, technology emerges not as a substitute but as a bridge for intergenerational cultural transmission.},

While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for its recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through vocal tone and behavior rather than explicit text, relying on language alone is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and map them to text-based LLMs for further processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a question and answer set to grant authorized knowledge to LLMs. Our approach yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original paper.

However, the impact of varying *fixed* theta values, especially the trade-off between performance and efficiency on tasks like character-level modeling, remains under-explored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RoPE with fixed theta values (ranging from 500 to 50,000) on a character-level GPT model across three datasets: Tiny Shakespeare, Enwik8, and Text8, compared against the standard θ = 10, 000 baseline. However, all non-default theta configurations incur significant computational overhead: inference speed is approximately halved across all datasets, suggesting implementation—specific bottlenecks rather than theta—dependent costs. This study quantifies a critical performance—efficiency trade-off when tuning fixed RoPE theta. Our findings emphasize the practical need to balance generalization gains with computational budgets during model development and deployment, contributing empirical insights into RoPE hyperparameter sensitivity and demonstrating that optimal theta selection is highly dataset-dependent. These insights suggest that future positional encoding designs could benefit from adaptive θ scheduling or dataset-specific θ optimization strategies to maximize both performance and computational efficiency.},

The work presented in this article aims to answer two interrelated questions: what is forgiveness in HMI, and how do we forgive an erring technology? Relying on a literature review of both forgiveness and HMI studies, the article offers a holistic definition of the concept, according to which forgiveness in HMI is a shift in the users’ feelings, from negative to positive, that prevents the users from abandoning the erring technology and allows them to keep using it without resentment. Based on a pioneering focus groups study with a convenience sample of 27 young adults, four forgiveness mechanisms are illustrated: (1) evaluating the cost of the error against the benefits of using the technology; (2) transferring responsibility for technology errors to humans (either those “behind the technology” or the users); (3) communicating with or about the technology; and (4) accepting the technology’s faults. The results suggest that users undergo complex cognitive and emotional processes when faced with a technological error. As forgiveness is one of the most critical aspects of every relationship, the conceptualization and preliminary study presented here may serve as a starting point for a new area of research and as a springboard for an essential scholarly discussion.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of modern artificial intelligence-based chatbots has revolutionised human–computer interactions. The use of these tools confirms reading as one of the primary ways of accessing information. The grapheme–phoneme conversion process is fundamental in learning to read and justifies the research for the development of tools capable of facilitating it. In the special case of a dyslexic student, the design choices related to a digital textual content cannot be a direct result of the aesthetic sense of the content creator. In this paper GreekDyslexic is presented, a Greek letter font that attempts to meet the characteristics proposed by the literature on high readability design. The production phases of GreekDyslexic are described, from the choice of elementary forms for their composition to the homogenisation process. This endeavour is driven by four key motivations: its application for native Greek speakers, its utility for learners of classical or modern Greek, the use of Greek letters in mathematics and physics, and its integration into digital museum materials. To achieve these objectives, a caption-based test is structured in which GreekDyslexic is compared to some of the most widely used fonts or those regarded as highly readable due to their sans serif nature. The test was administered to 98 Greek-speaking adults from Cyprus and Greece, 19 of whom reported a diagnosis of dyslexia. Despite being in the minority, a part of the sample rated GreekDyslexic positively. As a result, several potential solutions for future design interventions that effectively improve readability are suggested.},

Boundary-making strategies include categorical distinctions, authority allocation, and process-oriented boundaries that allow AI contributions while restricting final product generation.

  abstract     = {IntroductionWearable robotics for lower-limb assistance is increasingly investigated to enhance mobility in individuals with physical impairments and to augment performance in able-bodied users. A major challenge in this domain is the development of accurate and adaptive control systems that ensure seamless human-robot interaction across diverse terrains. While neural networks have recently shown promise in time-series analysis, no prior work has tackled the combined task of classifying ground conditions into five terrain classes and estimating high-level locomotion parameters such as ramp slope and stair height.MethodsThis study presents an experimental comparison of eight deep neural network architectures for terrain classification and locomotion parameter estimation. The models are trained on the publicly available CAMARGO 2021 dataset using inertial (IMU) and electromyographic (EMG) signals. Particular attention is given to evaluating the performance of IMU-only inputs versus combined IMU+EMG data, with an emphasis on cost-efficiency and sensor minimization. The tested architectures include LSTM, CNN, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models, among others. Model explainability is assessed via SHAP analysis to guide sensor selection.ResultsIMU-only configurations matched or outperformed those using both IMU and EMG, supporting a more efficient setup. The LSTM model, using only three IMU sensors, achieved high terrain classification accuracy (0.94 ± 0.04) and reliably estimated ramp slopes (1.95 ± 0.58°). The CNN-LSTM architecture demonstrated superior performance in stair height estimation, achieving a accuracy of 15.65 ± 7.40 mm. SHAP analysis confirmed that sensor reduction did not compromise model accuracy.DiscussionThe results highlight the feasibility of using lightweight, IMU-only setups for real-time terrain classification and locomotion parameter estimation. The proposed system achieves an inference time of ~2 ms, making it suitable for real-time wearable robotics applications. This study paves the way for more accessible and deployable solutions in assistive and augmentative lower-limb robotic systems.

  abstract     = {Metropolitan Lima faces a serious citizen security situation, reflected in high rates of crime and violence in several districts. The development of a mobile application to identify and predict areas of high crime incidence is proposed. Using historical data of criminal incidents and reports registered by users in the application, models capable of predicting the occurrence of crimes in real time are trained. The data mining process follows the KDD methodology, which includes the stages of selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, evaluation and knowledge consolidation. Machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, were used to make these predictions. Visualization techniques, such as heat maps, were also used to represent crime events and facilitate their understanding by users. The results show an accuracy of 88% for the Random Forest algorithm and 91% for Gradient Boosting in predicting the occurrence of crimes, which demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models to improve citizen security in Metropolitan Lima, therefore these findings have significant implications for crime prevention and suggest that the application of these technologies can be fundamental to address security challenges in the city.},

For instance, schools or universities could leverage these devices to track rising stress levels or detect signs of illness among students. Advances in sensing accuracy and utility design in wearables might make this feasible; however, real-world adoption faces challenges, as users often fail to wear or use these devices consistently and correctly. Additionally, institutional monitoring raises privacy concerns.MethodsIn this study, we analyze real-world data from a cohort of 103 Japanese university students to identify periods of cyclical stress while ensuring individual privacy through aggregation. We identify potential stress patterns by observing elevated waking heart rate (HR) and maximum waking HR, supported by related metrics such as sleep HR, sleep heart rate variability (HRV), activity patterns, and sleep phases.ResultsThe physiological changes align with significant academic and societal events, indicating a strong link to stress.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate the potential of consumer wearables to detect collective changes in stress biomarkers within a cohort using in-the-wild data, i.e., data that is noisy and has gaps. Furthermore, we explore how universities could implement such monitoring in practice, highlighting both the potential benefits and challenges of real-world application.},

In this work, we examine how neural audio-based artificial intelligence, when embedded in digital musical instruments (DMIs), shapes embodied musical interaction. While DMIs have long struggled to match the physical immediacy of acoustic instruments, neural audio methods can magnify this challenge, requiring data collection, model training and deep theoretical knowledge that appear to push musicians toward symbolic or conceptual modes of engagement. Paradoxically, these same methods can also foster more embodied practices, by introducing opaque yet expressive behaviors that free performers from rigid technical models and encourage discovery through tactile, real-time experimentation. Drawing on established perspectives in DMI embodiment literature, as well as emerging neural-audio-focused efforts within the community, we highlight two seemingly conflicting aspects of these instruments: on one side, they inherit many “disembodying” traits known from DMIs; on the other, they open pathways reminiscent of acoustic phenomenology and soma, potentially restoring the close physical interplay often missed in digital performance.},

  abstract     = {Collaboration between improvising musicians requires a dynamic exchange of subtleties in human musical communication. Many musicians can intuit this information, however, translating this knowledge to embodied computer-driven musicianship systems—be they robotic or virtual musicians—remains an ongoing challenge. Methods of communicating musical information to computer-driven musicianship systems have traditionally been accomplished using an array of sensing techniques such as MIDI, audio, and video. However, utilizing musical information from the human brain has only been explored in limited social and musical contexts. This paper presents “BrAIn Jam,” utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor human drummers' brain states during musical collaboration with an AI-driven virtual musician. Our system includes a real-time algorithm for preprocessing and classifying brain data, enabling dynamic AI rhythm adjustments based on neural signal processing. Our formative study is conducted in two phases: (1) training individualized machine learning models using data collected during a controlled experiment, and (2) using these models to inform an embodied AI-driven virtual musician in a real-time improvised drumming collaboration. In this paper, we discuss our experimental approach to isolating a network of brain areas involved in music improvisation with embodied AI-driven musicians, a comparative analysis of several machine learning models, and post hoc analysis of brain activation to corroborate our findings. We then synthesize findings from interviews with our participants and report on the challenges and opportunities for designing music systems with functional near-infrared spectroscopy, as well as the applicability of other physiological sensing techniques for human and AI-driven musician communication.},

To address these limitations, we introduce Multi3Net+, an advanced framework leveraging cross-modal, multitask representations of text, pose, and IMU data. Building on its predecessor, Multi3Net, it uses improved pre-training strategies and a mixture of experts classifier to effectively learn robust joint representations. By leveraging refined contrastive learning across modalities, Multi3Net+ bridges the gap between video and wearable sensor data, enhancing HAR performance for complex, fine-grained activities. Our experiments validate the superiority of Multi3Net+, showing significant improvements in generating high-quality synthetic IMU data and achieving state-of-the-art performance in wearable HAR tasks.

  abstract     = {Trust, mental workload, and situation awareness (TWSA) are cognitive states important to human performance and human-autonomy teaming. Individual and team performance may be improved if operators can maintain ideal levels of TWSA. Predictions of operator TWSA can inform adaptive autonomy and resource allocation in teams, helping achieve this goal. Current approaches of estimating TWSA, such as questionnaires or behavioral measures, are obtrusive, task-specific, or cannot be used in real-time. Psychophysiological modeling has the potential to overcome these limitations, but prior work is limited in operational feasibility. To help address this gap, we develop psychophysiological models that can be used in real time and that do not rely on operator-specific background information. We assess the impacts of these constraints on the models' performance. Participants (n = 10) performed a human-autonomy teaming task in which they monitored a simulated spacecraft habitat. Regression models using LASSO-based feature selection were fit with an emphasis on model stability and generalizability. We demonstrate functional model fit (Adjusted R2: T = 0.67, W = 0.60, SA = 0.85). Furthermore, model performance extends to predictive ability, assessed via leave-one-participant-out cross validation (Q2: T = 0.58, W = 0.46, SA = 0.74). This study evaluates model performance to help establish the viability of real-time, operator-agnostic models of TWSA.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionWith the rise of digital transformation, the concept of the smart city has emerged as a key pillar of modern urban development. However, as smart cities increasingly rely on the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and real-time data processing, they also face an expanded attack surface and growing cybersecurity threats.MethodsThis paper presents a comprehensive threat modeling and risk assessment approach tailored to smart city environments. It begins by identifying the core components and data flows within a typical smart city architecture covering domains such as surveillance, transportation, and healthcare. A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is constructed to visualize the interactions and pinpoint critical assets. The STRIDE methodology, supported by the Microsoft Threat Modeling (MTM) tool, is employed to systematically uncover threats including spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. To enrich the analysis and align with real-world adversarial behavior, the MITRE ATT&CK framework is also utilized to map identified threats to known tactics and techniques. Each discovered threat is evaluated through a detailed risk assessment using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and a 5 by 5 risk matrix, allowing a quantifiable estimation of impact and likelihood.ResultsThe analysis revealed 21 threats across smart city domains, with spoofing, tampering, and denial of service being the most frequent. Five threats were rated as critical based on CVSS, particularly targeting cloud services and web applications.DiscussionFurthermore, the paper introduces a dedicated case study involving the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), applying the Cyber Kill Chain model to demonstrate the progression of a cyber-attack targeting connected vehicle systems, with a focus on identifying less common yet critical ATT&CK techniques at each phase. The study concludes by proposing targeted mitigation strategies and architectural recommendations aimed at enhancing the cyber resilience of smart city infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {This research paper investigates the efficiency of cryptographic algorithms within graph-based encryption models such as star graph, focusing on their computational performance and security robustness. In this study, we analyze the performance of RSA and ElGamal cryptographic algorithms by evaluating time and space complexity across various file types, including text, image, audio, and data of different sizes. The encryption process is modeled using graph structures such as the Star graph, along with other well-known algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall for comparative analysis and performance benchmarking. Consequently, this research conducts a comparative analysis of RSA and ElGamal cryptographic algorithms by applying them to mixed data, including binary, text, and image files. The CPU's internal clock was employed to record the execution time of encryption and decryption operations, facilitating the assessment of time complexity for both algorithms. The CPU's internal memory was employed to monitor and record memory usage during the encryption and decryption operations performed on mixed datasets. Accordingly, the evaluation of the encryption algorithms was conducted using criteria such as encryption time, decryption time, and throughput to determine their relative performance. In evaluating cryptographic approaches, factors such as response time, confidentiality, bandwidth, and integrity are considered. Experimental results indicate that RSA demonstrates superior time efficiency and resource utilization, whereas the ElGamal algorithm exhibits greater memory efficiency and resourcefulness. This study evaluates RSA and ElGamal encryption on text, image, audio, and data files of varying sizes using graph-based models. The Star graph algorithm is adopted for its simplicity and low computational cost, and its performance is compared against A*, Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford algorithms. Results show that the Star model offers near-optimal paths with significantly reduced processing time, demonstrating high confidence in efficiency for lightweight encryption tasks. We have added computational performance, logical confidence, and optimality conditions of the proposed Star-based encryption model. The Star algorithm, integrated with RSA/ElGamal encryption, is benchmarked against classical pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford, commonly used for routing and shortest-path computations. Computational performance of (i) the worst-case time complexity of star algorithm (proposed) is O(bd) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth and space complexity is O(E + V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes, high (central node access) traversal efficiency, excellent (centralized graph encoding) suitability for graph-based encryption, very high structural simplicity, (ii) the worst case time complexity of A* Algorithm is O(bd) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth and space complexity is O(E + V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes, high (with good heuristic) traversal efficiency, good (needs proper graph abstraction) suitability for graph-based encryption, moderate structural simplicity, (iii) the average case time complexity and best case time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is O((V + E) log V) and the worst case time complexity is O((V2) logV) and space complexity is O(V) where V is the number of vertices, moderate to high traversal efficiency, fair (efficient in weighted graphs) suitability for graph-based encryption, moderate structural simplicity, and (iv) Bellman-Ford Algorithm is O(V*E) time complexity and O(V) space complexity where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, low traversal efficiency, limited (computationally expensive) suitability for graph-based encryption, moderate structural simplicity.},

  abstract     = {Although increasingly sophisticated in cognitive adaptability, current educational virtual assistants lack effective integration of real-time emotional analysis mechanisms. Most existing systems focus exclusively on static cognitive adaptation or incorporate superficial emotional responses, without dynamically modifying pedagogical strategies in response to detected emotional states. This structural limitation reduces the potential for generating personalized, empathetic, and sustainable learning experiences, particularly in complex domains such as critical reading comprehension. To address this gap, this study proposes and evaluates an educational assistant based on conversational artificial intelligence, which integrates natural language processing, real-time emotional analysis, and dynamic cognitive adaptation. The system was implemented in a controlled experimental setting with university students over a period of two weeks, utilizing a Moodle-based virtual learning platform. The evaluation methodology combines quantitative and qualitative techniques, including pre- and post-tests to assess academic performance, sentiment analysis of chat conversations to track emotional evolution, structured surveys to measure user perception, and semi-structured interviews to collect in-depth, experiential feedback. All interactions were logged for semantic and affective analysis. The architecture, organized using microservices, enables real-time semantic analysis of student messages, emotional inference, and adaptive adjustment of feedback strategies at the cognitive, emotional, and metacognitive levels. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in academic performance, with an average increase of 32.5% in correct answers from the pre-test to the post-test, particularly in inference and critical analysis skills. In parallel, the error correction rate during the sessions increased from 60 to 84%, while engagement levels and emotional perceptions showed progressive improvement. Integrating cognitive and emotional adaptation mechanisms with a rigorous multimodal evaluation process positions this assistant as an innovative advance in emotionally intelligent educational technologies.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the interaction between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of affordance theory, focusing on how Indonesian users experience and interpret ChatGPT in their daily lives. Adopting a socioconstructivist approach to affordance, the research investigates how users perceive, adapt to, and assign meaning to ChatGPT’s capabilities beyond its technical design. Using a qualitative descriptive method with light netnographic observation, this study examines user interactions and discussions within online communities. The findings reveal that affordances are not solely embedded in the AI system but emerge relationally, shaped by users’ intentions, contexts, and social interpretations. ChatGPT is variously perceived as a thinking assistant, productivity enhancer, confidence booster, and reflective partner. These perceptions are informed by diverse user motivations, such as improving work efficiency, overcoming cognitive barriers, or seeking emotional support in moments of solitude. The study identifies a dynamic interaction between technological features and human agency, highlighting how users’ lived experiences co-construct the functional and symbolic value of AI. This research contributes to the evolving discourse on human–AI relationships by emphasizing the subjective and socially situated nature of affordances, offering insights into how users domesticate AI tools in everyday contexts. Ultimately, the study challenges deterministic views of technology by demonstrating that the perceived value of AI is co-created through experiential engagement rather than solely defined by its technical affordances.},

  abstract     = {In the current era of interactive digital applications, Serious games are designed with a primary purpose to educate, train, raise awareness and for developmental purposes. Unlike traditional video games, the purpose of serious games is to focus on learning outcome, behavior change and skill development rather than just fun. Typically for children with cognitive, emotional, or social challenges, serious games can be very helpful as it offers customizable, engaging and a motivating environment that normally is not found in a traditional teaching environment. As per the study its observed that children with disabilities often face difficulties in expressing emotions, they sometime find it difficult to adapt to standardized learning tools and few also face challenges due to limited social interaction. The above challenges hence highlight the need for having personalized approaches during development of customized serious games. Therefore, the role and involvement of parents in the design and customization of serious games becomes critical as they are the ones who possess deep insights into the unique need of their child as per their daily experience. Their feedback can help the game designers to ensure that the games being designed are both emotionally resonant as well as accessible to their children. The article explores how parents can be empowered to actively contribute to the design of serious games which will surely enhance the social and emotional development of children with disabilities.As per the recent studies, there is a growing interest in the usage of serious games as effective tools especially for supporting children with disabilities across physical, socio-emotional and also cognitive domain. In a study conducted and published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (Lopez et al. 2025), it was found that serious games like "Secret Agent Society" was helping children with ASD by significantly improving their social communication abilities. This particular game was designed in a way in which children were put in role play missions and they had to recognize emotions, engage in conversations, and also handle anxiety. The children who played these games showed a measurable improvement in few of their skills when compared with traditional interventions.. A serious game DysEggxia (Rauschenberger et al. 2022) was designed specifically for dyslexic children. It was reported that the children who played the game for a span of 6 weeks showed a good amount of improvement in fluent reading and also with accurate spellings. A study conducted on game REThink (David et al., 2019) showed that strategies for emotional regulation were learned more effectively by children with ADHD rather than through traditional therapy sessions alone. Therefore, for promoting both academic and non-academic skills, serious games are seen as good tools. The personalization and adaptability are the crucial features that must be considered during the design of these games as they will keep the motivation and engagement level of children high at all times. The summarizes few recent serious games that are designed for children with special needs is presented in table 1 and the types of serious games w.r.t different disabilities visualize in figure 1. Children with disabilities usually have several weaknesses like the inability to express emotions and an inability to use standardized educational instruments, therefore indicating the necessity to develop custom and inclusive interventions (Smith et al., 2021). The involvement of the parents can be instrumental in creating serious game design in this respect. Parents provide original information about the daily life of their children, emotional drivers, and their communication patterns and make games more informative. For example, they may help in crafting the culturally relevant character and scenarios in the game so that its more relatable to the child. They may even assist in drafting the storylines that they feel their child encounters more frequently such as making friends, talking with a stranger, expressing frustration etc. Furthermore, the parents may also give inputs when it comes adjusting the elements of gameplay, like reward system, difficulty level so as to better align it with child's motivation and individual pace of learning. Therefore, it would be beneficial to treat parents as collaborators during the design of serious games rather than just as passive consumers. This will surely result in designing serious games that are more holistic, culturally aware as well as emotionally intelligent which will ultimately result in more effective and impactful learning tools for children with disabilities.As the parents understand their child's behavior, preferences and learning style more than anyone else, it's truly beneficial when parents are involved during the design process. This helps to get deeper insights into the child's need. The contribution made by parents during creation of storyline, cultural elements etc. in a game can make it more engaging and emotionally resonant for the child. Also, as they are the part of the game design process it's more likely that they will encourage its use consistently at home thereby maximizing learning and therapy outcomes. However, involvement of parents is not without its challenges. A common problem is that of the lack technical skills. Parents may not be aware of digital platforms or educational technology or maybe unsure about how to provide useful feedback on design and content. Additionally, there may be cases where parents' opinion can vary widely and this may pose a challenge for developers trying to create scalable solutions. Also, many parents of children with disabilities may have limited energy and time as they may already be balancing work, managing other responsibilities along with caregiving to their child with special needs. Therefore, the key here is to include the parents as valued partners by not burdening them with many tasks and not compromising on child's independence. Structured way for giving feedback, easy to use customization tools and a simple and usable design practice can help the developers to bridge this gap with the families.New information technology will provide access to future educational games for children with special needs by equipping parents to customize educational gaming experiences. People in the game development sector will encounter wide-ranging disruptions from AI-powered no-code platforms and wearable assistive devices and no-code technology platforms.AI-powered no-code platforms represent a radical development because they grant parents ability to create games even though they lack programming expertise. No-code platforms use artificial intelligence functions to create automated complex graphics that deliver automated characters with movement features alongside adaptive intelligent scene transition capabilities that react to detected obstacles. Parents access two options through a single-button interface enabling them to select pre-made templates or upload their own content to start designing games by choosing between written dialogue or spoken exchange inputs for personalized game development.Custom-designed games built by caregivers function to meet academic specifications while maintaining emotional assistance for their children.The development of serious games demands precise decorative features which should integrate with assistive technology for better performance. Through integration of motion sensors and eyetracking and speech interpretation technologies the AI system collects essential game information about child movement and pays attention to focus span and emotional status. Through this technological platform special needs children can build superior communication connections with other individuals. The evaluation of real-time data lets professionals establish personalized therapy methods through their analysis of collected information.Involving parents in the design of serious games for children with disabilities can prove to be a powerful resource that still remains underutilized. The contribution of a parent towards this can help create games that are more engaging and deeply personal rather than being just educational. The games designed with such collaboration between developers and parents may in effect be more relatable and support the transfer of skills into real life situations. With some structured training programs and few workshops, we can further empower parents to take an active role in shaping educational technologies and ensure that serious games continue to evolve as an effective tool for learning and development tasks.},

This article aimed to determine the level of knowledge about the different aspects of digital transformation in a HEI, encourage the adoption of disruptive technologies and facilitate an effective transition to digital educational environments through an analysis based on 6 dimensions such as: important principles and definitions, technological support for DT, Digital tools, disruptive technologies in DT, Security in Information Technologies and Digital Culture, applying two surveys as instruments to teachers, students and graduates of the university community. A quantitative approach with quasi-experimental design was used, evaluating a pre-test and post-test with a total of 34 questions distributed among the six dimensions analyzed using a Likert scale and applying the Wilcoxon statistical test for related samples. The initial findings indicate that in the first dimension “important principles and definitions” with 6 questions, two of them do not present adequate significance with values of 0.06505 and 0.051, respectively. On the other hand, the dimensions technological support (6 questions), Disruptive technologies (9 questions), Digital tools (6 questions) and Information Technology Security (ICTs; 4 questions), obtained significant results in each of their questions, finally the Digital Culture dimension (4 questions) presents a question with a p-value of 0.24 presenting no significant difference, that is, the answers of the participants did not vary. In addition, at the dimension level, the one that shows the best results is Disruptive Technologies with a p-value of 9.08×10−17, which indicates that after the training, significant improvements were obtained in this dimension as opposed to the rest. Finally, performing the global analysis of the dimensions in terms of gender the scores in women are higher with respect to men, in addition, considering the analysis based on roles it was determined that teachers show better results and students have lower scores.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionSocial interactions incorporate various nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of the effectiveness of these models.MethodsTo address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user—centric metrics-emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality—in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N = 48), we systematically examine perceived emotional quality for three state-of-the-art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two specific emotions: happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions.ResultsOur results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states.DiscussionGenerative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.},

  abstract     = {This study examines how musical expertise, tempo, and beat division influence synchronization accuracy and regularity in two movement tasks: finger tapping (discrete movements) and arm swing (continuous movements). Using a markerless motion capture system, we analyzed synchronization metrics across different rhythmic conditions. Motion data were extracted via AI-based pose estimation, and synchronization was computed by aligning movement peaks with beat times detected from audio stimuli. Results show that musicians exhibit higher synchronization accuracy and consistency than non-musicians, particularly in finger tapping tasks. Furthermore, simpler beat structures (binary rhythms) and moderate tempos facilitate better synchronization, whereas increased rhythmic complexity and tempo variability reduce performance. Interestingly, finger tapping leads to more precise synchronization than arm swing, suggesting that movement type significantly impacts rhythmic alignment. These findings support applications in therapy, training, and interactive systems, and demonstrate the value of AI-based motion tracking for scalable rhythm analysis.},

  abstract     = {Traditional 3D content creation paradigms present significant barriers to meaningful creative expression in XR environments, limiting designers' ability to iterate fluidly between conceptual thinking and spatial implementation. Current tools often disconnect the designer's creative thought process from the immersive context where their work will be experienced, creating a gap between design intention and spatial realization. This disconnect particularly impacts the iterative cycles fundamental to effective design thinking, where creators need to rapidly externalize, test, and refine concepts within their intended spatial context. This research addresses the need for more intuitive, context-aware creation systems that support the iterative nature of creative cognition in immersive environments. We developed Dream Space, a spatial computing system that bridges this gap by enabling designers to think, create, and iterate directly within XR contexts. The system leverages generative AI for rapid prototyping of 3D content and environments, allowing designers to externalize and test creative concepts without breaking their cognitive flow. Through multimodal interaction design utilizing Vision Pro's spatial computing capabilities, creators can manipulate virtual artifacts through natural gestures and gaze, supporting the fluid iteration cycles characteristic of established design thinking frameworks. A mixed-methods evaluation with 20 participants from diverse creative backgrounds demonstrated that spatial computing-based creation paradigms significantly reduce cognitive load in the design process. The system enabled even novice users to complete complex creative tasks within 20-30 minutes, with real-time feedback mechanisms supporting rapid iteration between ideation and implementation. Participants reported enhanced creative flow and reduced technical barriers compared to traditional 3D creation tools. This research contributes to understanding how XR interfaces can better support creative cognition and iterative design processes, offering insights for developing tools that enhance rather than hinder the natural flow of creative thinking in immersive environments.},

Grad-CAM visualization was employed to provide insights into the model’s interpretability.ResultsThe 3-branch CNN architecture demonstrated superior performance, achieving an overall test accuracy of 91%, precision of 96%, and recall of 98%, with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.9896. Its multi-scale feature extraction pathways were pivotal in effectively addressing overlapping red reflex patterns and subtle variations between classes.ConclusionThis study establishes the feasibility of smartphone-based photorefractive assessment integrated with artificial intelligence for scalable and cost-effective vision screening.

Existing methods, including skeleton sequence-based and RGB video-based models, have achieved impressive accuracy but often suffer from high computational costs and limited effectiveness in modeling human interaction behaviors.MethodsTo address these limitations, we propose a lightweight Convolutional Spatiotemporal Sequence Inference Model (CSSIModel) for recognizing human interaction behaviors. The model extracts features from skeleton sequences using DINet and from RGB video frames using ResNet-18. These multi-modal features are fused and processed using a novel multiscale two-dimensional convolutional peak-valley inference module to classify interaction behaviors.ResultsCSSIModel achieves competitive results across several benchmark datasets: 87.4% accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 (XSub), 94.1% on NTU RGB+D 60 (XView), 80.5% on NTU RGB+D 120 (XSub), and 84.9% on NTU RGB+D 120 (XSet). These results are comparable to or exceed those of state-of-the-art methods.DiscussionThe proposed method effectively balances accuracy and computational efficiency. By significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining high performance, CSSIModel is well-suited for real-time applications and provides a valuable reference for future research in multi-modal human behavior recognition.},

  abstract     = {The mainstream development of AI for artistic expression thrives on predictive models that are supposedly capable of abstracting creative ideas and actions into computable features. The assumption is that creativity can be measured, modeled, and computationally reproduced solely by examining digital representations of artistic outputs, such as images or pieces of music. Embodiment and its role in art and music making is largely ignored. But as any practicing artist knows, the act of creating an artwork and the fact of being a body are inseparable. This essay is concerned with nurturing a rapprochement of embodiment and AI in music and performing arts. To that end, it suggests it is necessary to transgress norms in engineering, musical composition, and bodily performance; to engage with modes of expression lying beyond the formal boundaries of those disciplines. The key questions are: What are the strategies needed to create embodied approaches to AI that can open up new areas of corporeal knowledge? How to create musical AI systems that allow to transgress musical and bodily borders, systems that allow learning beyond the edges of normative corporeal experience? These issues are broached by means of a transdisciplinary framework combining insight from feminist phenomenology, critical disability studies, and the posthuman with resources from physiological computing, movement-based music technology, and sound studies. Leveraging these assets, I offer an analysis of corporeal knowledge: a pre-cognitive form of perceiving and experiencing the world rooted in the somatics of incorporation, rhythm, and automaticity. Understanding this visceral way of knowing serves to discuss three strategies for transgression taken from my own artistic practice with robotics, prosthetics, sensors, and sound. By designing AI instruments and prosthetics that alter and are influenced by a performer’s somatic states, one can develop forms of artistic expression where body and instrument are co-dependent. I refer to this relation as a “configuration” of human and machine parts that, through training in sensorial and vibrational intensities, shapes not only music and performance but embodiment itself.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an innovative approach to designing soundwalks in educational group settings by harnessing AI, particularly ChatGPT, to inspire collaborative auditory imagination and soundscape creation. By serving as an interlocutor during a group script formulation process, ChatGPT aids in transforming student recollections of a city's sound marks into a textual description of the group's collective auditory imagination. This imagination is refined through a social, collaborative prompt engineering exercise into a concise soundwalk script. Over the course of a week, students then individually bring the co-created script to life, through an embodied practice that includes capturing the required sounds in the field and assembling them in digital audio workstations, before presenting their interpretations to the class. Conducted at California State University, San Bernardino, in Spring 2023 with a group of four students, this pedagogical experiment showcases an adaptable method for teaching collaborative creativity at the intersection of human perception and emerging technologies such as AI. Highlighting the interplay between auditory experiences, collective vs. individual imagination, and language, the research underscores AI's dual role as facilitator and collaborator, supporting varied creative expressions beyond a singular AI-generated narrative. Participants recognized AI's usefulness for streamlining the collaborative process of crafting a script but noted its limitations in emotional depth, sparking a discussion on the necessity of human involvement in refining AI content. Within this paper, the authors suggest an AI-assisted pedagogical model designed to facilitate student participation in both collective and individual modes of learning and creativity. They critically assess both the advantages, limitations, and ethics of their pedagogical experiment in the creative arts and contribute to the larger discourse of human-AI collaboration within creative media education. In spite of the small sample size of the experiment, the account offers a reflexive practice in rethinking how technology has the potential to innovate learning. This research effectively advances social innovation by integrating emerging technologies, especially artificial intelligence, into group learning settings in digital media creation.},

This study investigates whether combining uncertainty estimates with explanations enhances human-AI interaction effectiveness, particularly examining the interplay between model uncertainty and users' self-confidence in shaping reliance, understanding, and trust.MethodsWe conducted an empirical study with 120 participants across four experimental conditions, each providing increasing levels of model assistance: (1) prediction only; (2) prediction with corresponding probability; (3) prediction with both probability and class-level recall rates; and (4) all prior information supplemented with feature importance explanations. Participants completed an income prediction task comprising of instances with varying degrees of both human and model confidence levels. In addition to measuring prediction accuracy, we collected subjective ratings of participants' perceived reliance, understanding, and trust in the model. Finally, participants completed a questionnaire evaluating their objective model understanding.ResultsUncertainty estimates were sufficient to enhance accuracy, with participants showing significant improvement when they were uncertain but the model exhibited high confidence. Explanations provided complementary benefits, significantly increasing both subjective understanding and participants' performance with respect to feature importance identification, counterfactual reasoning, and model simulation. Both human confidence model confidence played a role in shaping user's reliance, understanding, and trust toward the AI system. Finally, the interaction between human and model confidence determined when AI assistance was most beneficial, with accuracy gains occurring primarily when human confidence was low but model confidence was high, across three of four experimental conditions.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that uncertainty estimates and explanations serve complementary roles in human-AI collaboration, with uncertainty estimates enhancing predictive accuracy, and explanations significantly improving model understanding without compromising performance. Human confidence acts as a moderating factor influencing all aspects of human-AI interaction, suggesting that future AI systems should account for user confidence levels. The results provide a foundation for designing AI systems that promote effective collaboration in critical applications by combining uncertainty communication with explanatory information.},

  abstract     = {Securing cloud-native infrastructures that integrate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via FIDO2, container orchestration with Kubernetes, and Dockerized microservices remains a complex challenge due to interdependent vulnerabilities and escalating adversarial threats. To address this, we propose a web-based cybersecurity framework that combines Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP), Domain Mapping Matrix (DMM), and fuzzy inference to perform multi-attribute risk assessment tailored to containerized environments. The method involves aggregating expert judgments to prioritize six key CIA-AAN criteria-Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Authorization, and Non-repudiation-followed by structural complexity quantification using DMM enhanced with Singular Value Decomposition. These are then fused into a Complexity Resilience Index and used in a fuzzy logic system that incorporates CVE-derived indicators such as base score, impact, and exploitability. When applied to five real-world adversarial techniques, the framework produced differentiated risk outcomes: Data Destruction and Resource Hijacking emerged as High-Level Risks with scores of 70.47 and 74.60 respectively, while Endpoint DOS, Network DOS, and Inhibit System Recovery were classified as Medium-Level Risks. These results illustrate how layered threat propagation and component interdependence increase vulnerability in FIDO2-integrated orchestration settings. Compared to conventional frameworks like EBIOS and NIST RMF, our approach offers enhanced granularity in quantifying risk and simulating threat propagation. By enabling practitioners to understand not only which adversarial activities are most damaging but also why, this framework empowers more informed and proactive cybersecurity decisions-bridging the gap between technical risk modeling and real-world defense planning.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel and efficient approach to accurately assess post-sowing rice plant density by leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution RGB cameras. In contrast to labor-intensive and spatially limited traditional methods that rely on manual sampling and extrapolation, our proposed methodology uses UAVs to rapidly and comprehensively survey entire paddy fields at optimized altitudes (4, 6, 8, and 10 m). Aerial imagery was autonomously acquired 17 days post-sowing, following a pre-defined flight path. The robust rice plant density estimation process incorporates two key innovations: first, a dynamic system of 12 adaptive segmentation thresholding blocks that effectively detects rice seed presence across diverse and variable background conditions. Second, a tailored three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately classifies vegetative situations. To maximize the training efficiency and performance, we implemented both a pretrained model and a deep learning model, conducting a rigorous comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art YOLOv10. Notably, under favorable imaging conditions, our findings indicate that a 6-m flight altitude yields optimal results, achieving a high degree of accuracy with rice plant density estimates that closely align with those obtained through traditional ground-based methods. This investigation unequivocally highlights the significant advantages of UAV-based monitoring as an economically viable, spatially comprehensive, and demonstrably accurate tool for precise rice field management, ultimately contributing to enhanced crop yields, improved food security, and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThere is a growing need for advanced systems to monitor patients in both hospital and home settings, but existing solutions are often costly and require specialized hardware. This article presents a method for building “Intellectual Rooms,” a cost-effective and intelligent environment based on Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The objective is to enhance patient care by using machine learning to process data from readily available devices.MethodsWe developed a method for creating Intellectual Rooms that utilize a complex model integrating medical domain knowledge with machine learning for image processing. To ensure cost-effectiveness, data were gathered from various sources including public cameras, smartphones, and medical sensors. Machine learning tasks were distributed across edge devices, fog, and cloud platforms based on technical constraints. The system's effectiveness was evaluated using simulated test data representing various patient scenarios and abnormal actions, comparing four conditions with incrementally added data sources (public camera, smartphone, sensors, and environmental objects).ResultsThe system demonstrated a significant increase in the speed of providing assistance, with an average improvement of over 25%. The integration of multiple data sources progressively reduced false alarms: adding smartphone camera data reduced false alarms by 6.15%, incorporating sensor data led to a further 5.82% reduction, and considering surrounding objects achieved an additional 6.52% reduction. The cumulative effect of using all data sources resulted in a 23% overall improvement in the accuracy of identifying patient states.DiscussionThe results validate that the proposed method for building Intellectual Rooms is a feasible and effective approach for patient monitoring. By leveraging existing, low-cost hardware, the system offers a non-intrusive and intelligent solution suitable for both hospitals and home care. This study successfully demonstrated the core functionalities using simulated data; future work will involve deployment and evaluation in real-world clinical environments to confirm its practical utility.},

  abstract     = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution, driven by rapid AI advancements, presents significant challenges and opportunities for psychologists. As these dynamics evolve, it is crucial to prepare practitioners adequately, yet current accreditation frameworks seem insufficient. This qualitative study explored work readiness (WR) perceptions among fully registered psychologists in Australia within this shifting technological landscape. Semi-structured interviews with six participants, analysed using reflexive thematic analysis and a social constructionist approach, revealed three themes: (1) Human-Centric WR Skills Are Irreplaceable by AI, (2) AI Will Enhance Psychological Practice, and (3) Education Must Adapt to Emphasise AI-Integration and Human-Centric Qualities. The study identifies a critical gap between current accreditation, which often prioritises technical skills, and the humanistic capacities valued by psychologists. These findings advocate for a re-evaluation of psychology’s accreditation pathway, promoting a more holistic approach to preparing future psychologists for an AI-integrated profession. This research contributes foundational insights to the discourse on WR in psychology, emphasising the balance between technological proficiency and essential human skills in navigating AI integration. It also encourages dialogue between accreditation bodies and psychologists to reconcile differing WR perspectives and ensure the future preparedness of practitioners.},

Furthermore, the article offers a practical dimension to this theoretical understanding by providing a comprehensive example of code written in JavaScript for generating an animation, also using HTML and CSS. This code example is designed to be easy to comprehend, even to those with limited programming experience, fostering the integration of animations into life science education. We synthesized findings from various studies to underscore the proven advantages of this new teaching tool, and by reviewing them, we reaffirm that animations have a demonstrable impact on improving the learning experience, making complex physiological processes more comprehensible and engaging. This highlights the critical role of animations as a pedagogical tool in science classrooms, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the mathematical and computational principles that support their creation.

However, this integration introduces new challenges, with dependability–defined by reproducibility, resiliency, and security and privacy–emerging as a central concern for building trustworthy systems that provide an advantage to the users. This paper proposes a framework for dependable QHPC system design, organized around these three pillars. We identify integration challenges, anticipate roadblocks, and highlight productive synergies across QC, HPC, cloud platforms, and network security. Drawing from both classical computing principles and quantum-specific insights, we present a roadmap for co-design that supports robust hybrid architectures. Our approach offers concrete metrics for assessing dependability, provides design guidance for engineers working at the QC-HPC interface, and surfaces new engineering questions around complexity, scale, and fault tolerance. Ultimately, designing for dependability is key to realizing practical, scalable QHPC systems and accelerating the broader quantum ecosystem capable of translating quantum promises into actual application delivery.},

Although existing methods combine unencrypted statistical features, e.g., average packet length, with machine learning algorithms to achieve encrypted malicious traffic detection, it is difficult to escape the influence of artificially forged noise, e.g., adding dummy packets. In this study, we propose a novel encrypted malicious traffic detection method named RobustDetector (RD) for obfuscated malicious traffic detection. The core of the proposed method is to use the dropout mechanism to simulate the process of original features being disturbed. By introducing noise during the training phase, the robustness of the model is improved. To validate the effectiveness of RobustDetector, we conducted extensive experiments using public datasets. Our results demonstrate that RobustDetector achieves an average F1-score of 90.63% even when random noise is introduced to the original traffic with a probability of 50%. This performance underscores the potential of our proposed method in addressing the challenges of obfuscated malicious traffic detection.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {The concept of digital transformation is, without a doubt, the most sought-after way for today's organizations to become and remain relevant, nimble, and in the lead through the innovation of technology and the increasing reliance on digital ecosystems-such is the reality of an era characterized by the ever-growing technological surge (Portion et al., 2023;Wang, 2023). Right from government institutions and multinational corporations to healthcare systems and educational entities, the way we work, the way we communicate, as well as the way we provide services to end-users everything changed dramatically and is being reshaped through digital transformation initiatives (Radenković et al., 2023). However, as the digitization process is getting faster, the complexity and range of cyberattacks grow in parallel (Sanmorino, 2023). The coexistence of two technologies, namely digital transformation, and cybersecurity, can pose several threats and opportunities; hence, it is remarkable that life is made better with the application of these innovative trends and, at the same time, it is the primary cause of generative threats that require urgent readiness to respond, prevent, and protect in this era of digitization (Irmak et al., 2023).The title 'Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity Challenges,' designed specifically for this issue, is an early, good look into the changing landscape of technology advances, and the various security implications that come with all of the emergent issues (Zatnika and Safariah, 2023). The successful implementation of digital transformation goes beyond only technology-it implies a profound change in organizational culture, process reengineering, data strategy, and enduser communication (Davaasuren, 2023). The transformation encompasses many other technologies as well, like cloud computing, IoT, artificial intelligence for decision-making, blockchain, remote work infrastructure, and many others (Autsadee et al., 2023). Nonetheless, as the journey is taken toward digital maturity, organizations increase their attacks' surface and make them vulnerable to more sophisticated cyberattacks (Multazam and Widiarto, 2023).Recent global incidents are pieces of evidence of the severe impact of cyber threats on the business, administrative, and user data leakage; however, they are also a demonstration of the continuous search for identification by the attackers (Kuczewska et al., 2023). Although we do witness technological development at lightning speed, the bad actors in the cyber world are always ahead of the innovations (Oluwaseun Augustine Lottu et al., 2023). No longer are ransomware, phishing, deceitful inducement, advanced persistent threats, and insider attacks all conjectures that you do not have to worry about (Belkhamza, 2023). These risks have become day-to-day events no longer based on a technicality only, but have shown signs of the vulnerability of human beings, the gaps in the organization, and the weak governance frameworks (Ha and Chuah, 2023).As companies are making their way through digital transformation, cybersecurity is not just a matter of the periphery but now become a strategic pillar (Nazari and Musilek, 2023). This matter seeks to give a clear idea of how urgent the necessity of creating a cybersecurity structure that fits in with digital innovation in society (Desta Lesmana et al., 2023). Although security professionals are the most important and valuable people as they make us feel safe, today their role needs to be fulfilled with a multidisciplinary approach that involves psychology, law, moral philosophy, and cultural diversity (Mijwil et al., 2023).This collection of articles reveals one of the most crucial topics in cybersecurity: human influence (Housawi and Lytras, 2023). There are a lot of studies that conclude that the number one weakness in the cyber domain is the human factor, and at the same time, it is the first protected one. The fact that all these threat vectors, such as social engineering attacks, poor password behavior, phishing, insider threats, etc., are derived from the user, perpetuates the necessity to make people more secure first by awareness, training, and the cultivation of user-centric security frameworks. It is necessary to deep-dive into the aspect of people's perceptions and behaviors when they deal with the risks during cyber incidents; the issue is especially important when organizations are trying to raise awareness of security issues as well as building a high level of security-conscious culture (Saeed et al., 2023).Besides, there is an issue of similar importance that needs to be raised-ensuring the privacy of personal information in the new world of data-as-coin (Alenezi and Akour, 2023). As the digital services that users gain access to become more individual-oriented, concerns about privacy, consent, and data misuse are becoming ever more acute. The legislation, for example, GDPR, has had a crack at making the data analytics industry conduct business in a morally responsible manner, but many issues still have been raised, mainly due to differences in the public and system culture and technical gaps (Tavana et al., 2022).Moreover, the content of the journal issue demonstrates that it is forward-looking by matching the courses of some emerging paradigms in the industry with the development of cybersecurity, such as quantum computing and machine learning (Alsaywid et al., 2023). An example of quantum computing is a technology that can potentially overthrow old encryption models, making businesses have to change their security architecture. The inclusion of a zero-trust model in the organization's design, as a precautionary measure, is increasing as a response to security threats and changes in organizations. At the same time, machine learning, and AI present a dual use case where they are not only used for threat detection and mitigation but at the same time, they raise new ethical and security issues such as bias, explainability, and misuse.The special issue of the magazine is an opportunity for the community to discuss the readiness of organizations and the implications of policies. The translation of an organization to be cyber-ready in a digital world is the conversation starter. How do regulations, rules, and governance structures adapt to the constant technological changes in the evolving technological environment? The necessity of cross-sector collaboration, cyber threat intelligence sharing, and the availability of an integrated response mechanism cannot be overestimated. Furthermore, there is always one issue that needs to be studied, which is cybersecurity from a sociocultural perspective. This is to ascertain how the community perceives threats, deals with technology, and gives priority to security.The special issue comprises various scholarly contributions and entails some theories, cases, practices, and different disciplines. This issue has been put into print for the main reason that it is informative and will provide readers with a deep understanding of the subject matter, that is, citizen engagement in cybersecurity, ethical dilemmas in data handling, legal frameworks for digital security, and the role of culture that is instrumental in the formation of cybersecurity awareness are some of the topics included in the magazine.The kind of blog that we were allowed to work on, we hope, can be highly useful to researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and technologists at the same time. At a point in time, when cyber-readiness edges subsume digital convenience, and cyber threats are more of a certainty, a call for strong, inclusive, and flexible cybersecurity measures is really loud. We encourage our readers to share these discoveries, to give a thought to the current problems, and to join in the worldwide effort aimed at keeping the digital future secure.In this special issue, eight articles bring the newest research trends at the intersection of digital transformation and cybersecurity. Diverse in number, starting from quantum threats to blockchain, phishing detection, machine learning in intrusion detection, and the evolving roles in offensive cyber operations, these studies are the drivers of solving the current problems and those that might emerge in the future for the digital future's safety. The summaries of these papers are described below:In the first article (Almuhammadi and Alghamdi, n.d.), the authors discussed in a paper the new peril that can influence a cryptocurrency, which, through the usage of blockchain, has secured its place as one of the most important digital innovations of the 21st century. Since blockchain is so much connected to public-key cryptography, the use of quantum computing to attack the networks can leave blockchains vulnerable. The paper is a threat assessment to the $2.7 trillion cryptocurrency market and a study about which ways for the cryptocurrency industry to switch from being quantum-hackable to quantum-resistant. The paper introduces a novel transition protocol that is less disruptive by conducting a soft fork for the entire migration process, rather than having a hard fork. The success of the protocol is tested through theoretical analysis and it is also statistically compared with other existing solutions, thus confirming the practicality and the best move for blockchain migration after quantum computers.The second paper (Kour et al., 2024) is devoted to ensuring the cybersecurity of Industry 5.0, where human-centricity, resilience, and sustainability are priorities. This paper is grounded on the cyber security issues within Industry 5.0 that have interconnection and intelligence as their main paradigm. The authors consider the issue not only from a theoretical perspective but also from the empirical one where they run the systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology and consensus algorithms. The study emphasizes that AI, blockchain technology, and IoT appear to be the primary cybersecurity measures, while the lack of observability, measurability, or traceability has been slowing the growth of engineering and technology in this field. These are the technologies that should, according to the authors, have trans-paradigmatic capability and therefore be multi-paradigm in interpreting and controlling the industry of sustainable and resilient systems by assuring security, trustworthiness, and traceability of the industrial system as a whole. In this case the authors from Z. Zheng and W. Chen (2019) article does not agree with the development of cybersecurity paradigms, the technologies of today are somewhat un-matured, further pressing the claim of the authors in Wei T. (2016) article. Still, the tip of the iceberg in securing the systems of Industry 5.0 is the vendor-oriented solutions that can not fit in the collaboratively observing, measuring, and tracking algorithms, thus deteriorating the most important features of an engineering and technology system that is its cell: the synergy and observability of sustainability, its measurability, and the historical facts that it has. A new security technology for cyber-physical systems (CPS) in manufacturing, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT'-Fog Assisted LoRa) enabled by a fog-computing platform with long-range IoT radios (LoRa) used in conjunction with fog-assisted IIoT is developed by X. Cheng and C. Sidhu.))The third paper (Tamal et al., 2024) is concerned with the serious problem of phishing attacks, which have grown in complexity and gravity. The authors of the paper present a complete anti-phishing solution that combines an Optimal Feature Vectorization Algorithm (OFVA) and supervised machine learning classifiers. They mine 41 features from a large dataset which contains about 270,000 URLs and compare 15 machine learning algorithms across multiple performance metrics. The model that is based on the random forest technique is the best one as it reaches an accuracy rate of more than 97%. This work solves the problem of a great amount of data that is difficult to mine. However, the model is also easy to implement in real environments, and thus, it offers an excellent direction for further research of practical anti-phishing tools that can be put into operation.The fourth paper (Ali et al., 2024) makes a very thorough survey of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and the increasing contribution of machine learning and deep learning in boosting their efficiency. This paper outlines new Machine Learning/Deep Learning-based IDS approaches that are required to substitute the outdated IDS-augmented techniques due to higher false identification and lower adaptability towards unknown threats. The coverage is particularly focused on crucial aspects related to IDS, for instance, the datasets, the metrics, the indicators of performance, and the new trends. By weighing up the good and the bad of the current IDS research, possibilities for the future are identified and it is shown how cyber defenses of institutions are improved when AI is proffered as the solution to their security risks.The fifth paper (Arik et al., 2024) discusses the involvement of Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) in national and corporate cybersecurity which still is an area hardly touched upon but of utmost importance. The case study presented in this paper is a qualitative one on the issue of OCO that takes the position of the people planning the OCO training as the central actors. Hybrid plainness is the trait of the learning sequences that have been drawn up in the case study. Besides this, the partner version of the company's cyber range and the delegating of cognitive strategies to it are also some of the main components that are mentioned. The research provides a clear insight into the issue of dual competencies-technical and strategic-arguing that for cyber planners to successfully execute cyber campaigns, they must be correctly trained with standardization in OCO training being the solution The sixth paper (Rana et al., 2024) outlines a novel, real-life, tagged dataset that is made for the detection of phishing only using intra-URL features. A focus of 250000 examples is on the detection of URL anomalies, like in the case of typosquatting, misleading subdomains, and unusual extensions for which only observable features can be exploited. The authors performed OFVA to get 42 features that have a high potential for preventing being used by phishers. Also, by sharing this dataset with the community, the article has made a big step in this area of research and at the same time, this way are being encouraged to establish such security tools that are data-driven, scalable, robust, and efficient.A seventh paper (Rana et al., 2024) covers the use of attack trees for modeling cyber threats that exist on organizational networks, further developing the traditional method by the association of the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) framework. The technique presented in this way can describe the risk involved with it, at each level of the attack tree, thus enabling the analysis of the dependency among the assets and also allowing for more detailed risk evaluation. The study conducted a comparison of the various techniques of threat modeling, and it is demonstrated that the FAIR-enhanced attack tree is quite preferable since it provides more details and can be construed with ease; these are the factors that make it possible for the management or higher authorities to take some initiatives. This way of paper can be even more useful for those who are involved in information security risk management and seek systematic collection and processing of data on the attacked cyber risks according to their nature, size, and location.In the Eighth paper (Saran, 2024), the authors conduct a comprehensive review of password hashing algorithms and their ability to defend against time-memory trade-off (TMTO) attacks. Although password hashing is the main step of the authentication and key derivation process, it is also the part that is most targeted by the advanced schemes of cryptanalysis. The paper covers the measures that have been recently developed to be taken for TMTO attacks and how modern hashing schemes are much more resistant to the same. To help developers and the staff members of information systems make decisions on the selection, implementation, and migration of secure hashing algorithms, the work is of real, practical value., With changes in the way the central authentication system works, the insights that have been offered at the end of this review will be important as far as keeping the system simple and also building the structures of the authentication used for the future are concerned.All in all, these eight papers together present a very good and detailed view of cybersecurity difficulties and clever ideas in the environment of data conversion. From basic security technologies to the strategies of organizations and policy implications, the special issue gives us a set of knowledge that is strong and good for scientists, professionals, and policymakers who are seeking to build secure and resilient digital ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, robotics has transformed various industrial processes but has also influenced teaching methodologies. Although there are literature reviews on its application in professional training, many are outdated or lack a current focus on its impact in higher education. Addressing this gap, the present mini review examines the impact, challenges, and opportunities of this technology in the university setting. To this end, a search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, APA PsycNet, and Web of Science databases, selecting 11 studies that addressed diverse applications of robotics, including educational robotics, robotic telepresence, human-robot interaction, and artificial intelligence applications. Their effects on teaching, the factors influencing their adoption, and the strategies used to optimize their implementation were analyzed. The findings show that educational robotics enhances student motivation and engagement, with prediction models reaching an accuracy of 98.78% in assessing academic engagement. Additionally, robotic telepresence emerges as an effective alternative for hybrid education, and social robots and AI-based tutors demonstrated their potential to personalize learning. However, methodological and structural challenges persist, such as the need to develop more accurate evaluation metrics and ensure accessibility and educational equity. Future research should focus on improving these aspects, enabling more efficient integration to enhance teaching processes. This study was registered in the Open Science Framework under the code: 10.17605/OSF.IO/KHDTU.},

  abstract     = {Due to their fragility and uniqueness, valuable works of art are largely unavailable for direct interaction with the public. They are usually displayed in conditions that restrict access, which inevitably limits the visitor experience, particularly for audiences with reduced mobility and visual impairments. Furthermore, related information is not easily conveyed because of the limited time visitors have to browse the museum, and because it is usually presented in jargon that assumes scientific knowledge, or is presented out of context. In this paper, we aim to address all these aspects simultaneously, using the painting The Scream (1910?) from the MUNCH Museum in Oslo as a case study. A combination of high-resolution imaging and computer vision algorithms was used to identify and separate the color surface features for two areas of the painting. The information was then presented to visitors by 3D printing the two areas and placing the color surface features at different heights, creating a relief structure that could be touched and inspected up close. The novel and highly accessible experience was evaluated at the InArt24 conference and at the KHM Museum in Oslo, Norway. During the evaluations, participants reported that interacting with the physical 3D replicas stimulated their interest and motivation, and increased their satisfaction when learning about the painting's color characteristics. These initial findings suggest that presenting information about art objects through multisensory experiences can greatly enhance accessibility and engagement for diverse audiences.},

This article reviews recent advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction toward enabling various aspects of realistic dance, and examines potential paths toward a fully embodied dancing agent. We begin by outlining the essential abilities required for a robot to perform human-like dance movements and the resulting aesthetic qualities, summarized under the terms expressiveness and responsiveness. Subsequently, we present a review of the current state-of-the-art in dance-related robot technology, highlighting notable achievements, limitations and trade-offs in existing systems. Our analysis covers various approaches, including traditional control systems, machine learning algorithms, and hybrid systems that aim to imbue robots with the capacity for responsive, expressive movement. Finally, we identify and discuss the critical gaps in current research and technology that need to be addressed for the full realization of realistic dancing robots. These include challenges in real-time motion planning, adaptive learning from human dancers, and morphology independence. By mapping out current methods and challenges, we aim to provide insights that may guide future innovations in creating more engaging, responsive, and expressive robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the dynamics of user feedback for two prominent mobile language learning applications, Babbel and Duolingo, through the lenses of Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) and Sociocultural Theory (SCT). By employing a mixed-methods approach that integrates sentiment analysis, network analysis, and linguistic features analysis, a dataset of 190 user reviews for each application collected from app review platforms has been analysed. The research reveals distinct sentiment clusters, network metrics, and user engagement patterns, highlighting how sociocultural factors and user experiences shape perceptions of app functionality and effectiveness. Findings indicate that Duolingo users predominantly appreciate the gamified elements and simplicity of lessons, while Babbel users emphasize structured methodologies and cultural context. The application of network analysis using Gephi software elucidates the interconnectedness of user sentiments, identifying influential nodes and feedback trends that inform app design and development. This study contributes to the field of applied linguistics by demonstrating the potential of user feedback to enhance the usability and pedagogical efficacy of language learning technologies, ultimately advocating for a more learner-centered approach in the design of educational tools. The insights garnered from this research not only bridge the gap between linguistic theory and technological application but also underscore the importance of integrating user perspectives in the continuous evolution of language learning platforms.},

This research introduces a novel forecasting model that forecasts the most profitable months to harvest different crops, to optimize agricultural productivity.

To be more specific, we train and evaluate predictive models using 3 years' worth of agricultural data from Krushi Utpanna Bazar Samiti in Haveli Pune using several machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), Linear Regression (LR), and others. After a thorough study using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score, it was determined that the DT model performed the best, with an outstanding R2 score of 99%. Furthermore, we use Streamlit to create an easy-to-use web application that lets farmers input crop types, years, and desired price estimates to determine the best months to harvest. Our approach gives farmers a data-driven means to make informed decisions that increase revenue and improve the sustainability of agriculture. By developing precision agriculture and decision support systems, we want to enhance agricultural productivity and enable more efficient crop management techniques.},

A dynamic offloading strategy is designed to select the optimal computing tier based on network conditions and resource availability. To validate the proposal, we used EdgeCloudSim. Simulation results demonstrate that the RC layer reduces end-to-end processing delays by approximately 80%, lowers operational costs by up to 5× compared to cloud computing, and achieves lower task failure rates relative to edge computing. These findings establish Regional Computing as an efficient and scalable solution bridging the gap between edge and cloud paradigms for UAV big data management.},

While deep learning can automate confluence estimation, research on cost-effective dataset curation and the role of foundation models in this task is limited. We investigate effective strategies for AI-based confluence estimation by studying active learning, goal-dependent labeling, and foundation models that require no training or labeling effort (zero-shot). Here, we show that zero-shot inference with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves excellent confluence estimation without any task-specific training, outperforming even fine-tuned and specialized models. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that active learning does not significantly enhance training and performance compared to the random selection of training samples in homogeneous cell datasets. We demonstrate that streamlined labeling approaches tailored to specific goals yield results comparable to those of exhaustive, time-consuming annotation methods. Our results challenge common assumptions about dataset curation and model training: neither active learning nor extensive fine-tuning provided significant benefits in our real-world scenarios. Instead, we found that leveraging SAM's zero-shot capabilities and goal-dependent labeling offers the most cost-effective approach for AI-based confluence monitoring. Our study provides practical guidelines for implementing automated cell quality control in MSC manufacturing, demonstrating that extensive dataset curation may be unnecessary when foundation models can effectively handle the task right out of the box.},

  abstract     = {In the context of digitalization, work processes are subject to constant change. To achieve overall process efficiency, it should be ensured that employees have a deep understanding of the work processes in which they are involved. Preliminary research has shown that the utilization of virtual reality (VR) environments, which visualize employees' workspaces and present VR avatars that demonstrate work process steps, can enhance employees' understanding of (future) work processes. However, implementing such virtual environments entails certain challenges, such as the necessity of training employees in the utilization of VR technology. Thus, the delivery of VR avatar simulations in a video format (VR-based avatar video) may present a flexible alternative solution. Focusing on related work, it can be assumed that VR-based avatar videos (VRA videos) help learners build a coherent mental model of their work processes by providing contextualized visual information that is close to real life. Furthermore, the visual design elements included in a VRA video (e.g., the VR avatar and virtual workspace) may increase employees' motivation to learn. Despite the potential benefits of VRA videos, critics may argue that these videos contain an excessive amount of visual detail, thus increasing learners' cognitive load. Due to these contradicting opinions, the present study investigates the potential advantages of a VRA video in enhancing employees' understanding of work processes compared to a schematically designed voice-over slides video (VOS video). Furthermore, the study compares the motivational impact of both videos. In an online experimental study, participants (N = 121) were randomly assigned to either the VRA or the VOS video group. One-way ANOVAs revealed that the VRA video group achieved significantly better transfer scores than the VOS video group. Results of the motivation questionnaires (based on the ARCS model) demonstrated that attention (ARCS-A), relevance (ARCS-R), and satisfaction (ARCS-S) were significantly higher in the VRA video group than in the VOS video group.},

The classifiers are involved in training and recognizing the face or text class label. After the prediction of class labels, the distance matrix-based technique is used to identify the style or pose name. Finally, the experiments are conducted with the help of the ORL dataset (40 classes and 10 poses in each class) and character dataset (36 characters and 10 font styles in each character). The experimental results indicated that the proposed methodology accurately classifies hierarchically organized data and demonstrates superiority over KNN and Bayesian-based classification when compared to support vector machine (SVM). The system provides classification outcomes with up to 100% accuracy for outlier-removed data, and up to 98% for basic features. Unlike traditional flat classification approaches, our system leverages hierarchical structures to enhance classification accuracy, scalability, and interpretability.},

  abstract     = {The cloud-based environments in which today's and future quantum computers will operate raise concerns about the security and privacy of user's intellectual property, whether code, or data, or both. Without dedicated security protections, quantum circuits submitted to cloud-based quantum computer providers could be accessed by the cloud provider, or malicious insiders working in the cloud provider's data centers. Furthermore, data embedded in these circuits can similarly be accessed as it is encoded using quantum gates inside the circuit. This study presents various hardware and architecture modifications that could be deployed in today's quantum computers, based on superconducting qubits, to protect both the code and data from potentially untrusted quantum computer providers or malicious insiders. Motivated by existing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in classical computers, this study introduces the notion of Quantum Trusted Execution Environments (QTEEs) which leverage trusted hardware to hide or obfuscate quantum circuits executing on a remote, cloud-based quantum computer. This study presents multiple, different approaches to design of QTEEs and considers both hardware and architecture, as well as system software and operating system support necessary for realization of QTEEs. Overall, this study presents three hardware architectures, namely, QC-TEE, SoteriaQ, and CASQUE, that have been designed to protect users' circuits and data from potential threats originating from both malicious quantum computer cloud providers or insider attackers. This study further outlines a roadmap for other possible QTEEs that can be developed in the future, to account for different threat models or to support different types of quantum computer architectures.},

  abstract     = {Immersive technologies allow for the collection of objective data from typically subjective experiences, by offering fully controllable environments that enable conducting controlled experiments, while still eliciting an arguably ecologically valid experience for the participant. Given the above, the scope of the present Research Topic is to highlight novel uses of immersive technologies for better understanding human factors in built environments. Contributors address themes from traditional architectural validation such as spatial and social density, and navigation-related experiments, as well as aspects from health and cognitive psychology, interior design, new forms of work, and workplace productivity. In addition, this Research Topic contains investigations into individual differences, such as culture, personality, and social economics. Specifically, the Research Topic collection contains the following contributions:Without taking individual and group differences into account, one can argue that we can never achieve universal design. In the perspective article "How interior design responds to neurodiversity: implementing wearable technologies in neurodesign processes," Kwon et al. discuss the benefits and challenges of using virtual environments and wearable technologies in interior design and related fields. They argue that neurodiversity plays a key role in the invisible human-environment interaction, and that measuring, analyzing, and understanding affective, perceptual, and cognitive experiences is a challenging process. After a review of the relevant work spanning from theories e.g., phenomenology, and practical implementations of e.g., eye tracking in VR to study cognitive differences in spatial perception including dementia, authors contextualize a novel process model in the context of their work, Participatory Neurodesign (PND) framework from wayfinding literature, along with other opportunities for neurodesign research.A social science perspective in technology development can provide crucial insights. In "The praxis of radical placemaking," Gonsalves et al. propose a new digital placemaking design practice called Radical Placemaking, involving "marginalized bodies highlighting social issues through the ephemerality and spectacularity of digital technologies in public spaces" based on a 3-year design study. Authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through three design interventions (participatory action research, slow design, and open pedagogies) and offer a conceptual framework with nine key strategies for codesigning within the triad of people-place-technology.As XR technology advances in scope, wearables (XR googles) are getting lighter, and more and more of them are coupled with artificial intelligence (AI), many questions about security and privacy are raised. Such concerns warrant questions around technology acceptance. Can we transition to these new technologies without creating an "ad nightmare" around us? In "Evaluation of the extended TAM for digital signage augmented roadshow (DiSAR) using PLS-SEM," Tan et al. propose an extended Technology Acceptance Model incorporating System Quality, Perceived Interactivity, and Perceived Enjoyment as antecedents. They empirically analyze the performance of this model in modeling the user acceptance of 203 participants, and identify key factors influencing the user acceptance, in a Digital Signage Augmented Roadshow. Their findings show a nuanced relationship between that System Quality and Perceived Interactivity have a significant relationship with the Perceived Ease of Use of DiSAR, Perceived Enjoyment has a significant relationship with the Perceived Usefulness of DiSAR; demonstrating that the rethinking classical TAM with new dimensions can reveal new correlations that are informative in designing immersive content.Utilizing XR, especially VR as a laboratory, is an attractive concept due to its affordance of control. In "The effects of social density, spatial density, noise, and office views on perceived personal space in the virtual workplace," Jicol et al. investigate how different variables influence Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and perceived personal space in shared office environments. They employ virtual reality to simulate shared and single occupancy offices and devise a novel measure of personal space estimation. Authors demonstrate that "participants experienced greater perceived personal space when (1) in a sparsely populated rather than a dense office, (2) in a private office rather than an open plan office, and (3) having any view outside of the office", and the fact that they can demonstrate this stands as a testimonial that the changes in virtual space creates a relative difference in people's reactions, and VR can be a viable tool to study research topics such as personal space.Complementary to Jicol et al.'s study, finally, in "Differences in office-based personal space perception between British and Korean populations," Richardson et al. present a study that takes also a cultural view into account and compare the perception of personal space in South Korean and United Kingdom workplaces. They employ virtual reality to simulate shared and single occupancy offices and obtain personal space estimations using a retractable/extendable virtual disc around the participant, use the disk size as a measure, and compare it to the results of a questionnaire. While participants in either cultural group "perceived personal space (1) when in a sparse rather than dense office and (2) having a view of the city outside the office", British participants had significantly higher personal space estimations in single occupancy offices than in shared offices while Korean participants did not. This study further demonstrates that VR can be a medium to examine cultural differences and attitudes towards space. Richardson et al. state that " future research would benefit from comparing VR to actual workspaces", which is also a valid statement for Jicol et al. study, even though relative differences give interesting new information also within a VR study.Taken together, these articles in our Research Topic demonstrate the potential of immersive technologies to transform the field of design and highlight the importance of considering human factors in built environments. We believe immersive technologies, specifically XR coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) will have a transformative effect in all fields related to design, including the studies of built environments. As we continue to develop and refine these technologies, it is essential that we prioritize research on their impact on human behavior, cognition, and emotion.},

  abstract     = {Due to the widespread use and variety of wireless networks and their applications in open environments, security techniques need to be more robust, reliable, and flexible, incorporating multi-stage and interfered secret key (Skey) capabilities. This research article presents an efficient cryptographic approach through the construction of a cascaded series of processes. It proposes a multi-number of encrypting processes (N-round chaos-based) cryptosystem containing N secret keys based on data classification and the environment. The article also outlines the simple criteria for determining the number of rounds (N-round). Several chaos-based encryption techniques have been utilized to construct the proposed algorithm, and various scenarios of the N-round mechanism over different classified images have been presented. In the majority of relevant published studies, two critical issues have been overlooked: the selection criteria for required and suitable security levels and the rules and conditions for robust security keys. These essential issues have been discussed in this research article. Various grayscale images are used in the computer simulation experiments conducted to demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and applicability of the proposed cryptographic algorithm. The experiments consider the presence of various attacks, such as speckle, salt-and-pepper, and Gaussian noise. Based on the results from the standard database (Hlevkin, USA CANVAS), the proposed algorithm is robust and suitable for applications in noise/attack environments. As clarified by the results, the similarity of extracted images is 100% to the original plaintext in the absence of attacks, while in the presence of noise and attacks, the similarity remains above 99%. The quality of the decrypted images is superior to that of the majority of existing cryptosystems.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionGenerative AI tools can produce programming code that looks very similar to human-written code, which creates challenges in programming education. Students may use these tools inappropriately for their programming assignments, and there currently are not reliable methods to detect AI-generated code. It is important to address this issue to protect academic integrity while allowing the constructive use of AI tools. Previous studies have explored ways to detect AI-generated text, such as analyzing structural differences, embedding watermarks, examining specific features, or using fine-tuned language models. However, certain techniques, like prompt engineering, can make AI-generated code harder to identify.MethodsTo tackle this problem, this article suggests a new approach for instructors to handle programming assignment integrity. The idea is for instructors to use generative AI tools themselves to create example AI-generated submissions (pseudo-AI submissions) for each task. These pseudo-AI submissions, shared along with the task instructions, act as reference solutions for students. In the presence of pseudo-AI submissions, students are made aware that submissions resembling these examples are easily identifiable and will likely be flagged for lack of originality. On one side, this transparency removes the perceived advantage of using generative AI tools to complete assignments, as their output would closely match the provided examples, making it obvious to instructors. On the other side, the presence of these pseudo-AI submissions reinforces the expectation for students to produce unique and personalized work, motivating them to engage more deeply with the material and rely on their own problem-solving skills.ResultsA user study indicates that this method can detect AI-generated code with over 96% accuracy.DiscussionThe analysis of results shows that pseudo-AI submissions created using AI tools do not closely resemble student-written code, suggesting that the framework does not hinder students from writing their own unique solutions. Differences in areas such as expression assignments, use of language features, readability, efficiency, conciseness, and clean coding practices further distinguish pseudo-AI submissions from student work.},

  abstract     = {Modern sensor and gesture tracking technologies (e.g., Myo armbands) allow us access to novel data measuring musical performance at a nuanced level: allowing us to “see” otherwise unseen musical techniques. Meanwhile, advances in machine learning have given us the ability to create accurate predictions from often complex data capturing such techniques. At the same time, instrumental music education in the UK has seen great challenges regarding accessibility, caused by factors such as cost, standardized (non-personalized) curricula, and health issues as barriers to learning. As e-learning becomes a low-cost and personalized alternative to mainstream education, gamification is being used in popular music education apps (e.g., Yousician) to leverage game design principles and teach abstract musical concepts, such as timing and pitch, and stimulate learning. This ongoing project seeks to understand the challenges and opportunities in pairing modern sensor technologies with AI to develop an accessible AI guitar assistant. To do this, our work collects and analyses survey data from 21 guitarists across the UK to understand such accessibility issues and how we may design an AI system to address them. Our results show there is clear scope for developing a flexible and adaptive approach to music tuition via our developing AI guitar assistant, with the ability to address specific accessibility issues regarding the needs of individuals who feel excluded by expensive, standardized and homogeneous music education systems. Our contribution is a set of thematic insights, captured from survey data, for building an AI guitar assistant, which adjacent fields using AI can also benefit from. Our survey insights inform and stimulate a developing conversation around how to effectively integrate AI into music education. Our insights also indicate potential alternative approaches to mainstream and longstanding music education when leveraging emerging technologies, such as AI, to solve pressing social issues.},

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze the mediating roles of perceived empathy and trust in this relationship.ResultsDirect effects of anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence on UX were nonsignificant. However, their combined influence was significantly mediated by perceived empathy and trust (β = 0.48, *p* < 0.01). Specifically, highly anthropomorphic avatars correlated with elevated empathy (β = 0.32) and trust (β = 0.27), which in turn improved UX.DiscussionThese findings underscore the importance of emotional engagement over mere intelligence in designing effective chatbots.

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are integral to securing modern IoT networks but often suffer from a lack of transparency, functioning as “black boxes” with opaque decision-making processes. This study enhances IDS by integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), improving interpretability and trustworthiness while maintaining high predictive performance. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, comprising over 2.5 million records and nine diverse attack types, we developed and evaluated multiple ML models, including Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. By incorporating XAI techniques such as LIME, SHAP, and ELI5, we demonstrated that XAI-enhanced models provide actionable insights into feature importance and decision processes. The experimental results revealed that XGBoost and CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 87%, with a false positive rate of 0.07 and a false negative rate of 0.12. These models stood out for their superior performance and interpretability, highlighting key features such as Source-to-Destination Time-to-Live (sttl) and Destination Service Count (ct_srv_dst) as critical indicators of malicious activity. The study also underscores the methodological and empirical contributions of integrating XAI techniques with ML models, offering a balanced approach between accuracy and transparency. From a practical standpoint, this research equips human analysts with tools to better understand and trust IDS predictions, facilitating quicker responses to security threats. Compared to existing studies, this work bridges the gap between high-performing ML models and their real-world applicability by focusing on explainability. Future research directions include applying the proposed methodology to more complex datasets and exploring advancements in XAI techniques for broader cybersecurity challenges.},

  abstract     = {Quantum fingerprinting is a technique that maps a classical input word to a quantum state. The obtained quantum state is much shorter than the original word, and its processing uses fewer resources, making it useful in quantum algorithms, communication, and cryptography. One of the examples of quantum fingerprinting is the quantum automata algorithm for MODp={ai·p∣i≥0} languages, where p is a prime number. However, implementing such an automaton on current quantum hardware is not efficient. Quantum fingerprinting maps a word x∈{0, 1}n of length n to a state |ψ(x)〉 of O(logn) qubits, and uses O(n) unitary operations. Computing quantum fingerprint using all available qubits of the current quantum computers is infeasible due to many quantum operations. To make quantum fingerprinting practical, we should optimize the circuit for depth instead of width, in contrast to the previous works. We propose explicit methods of quantum fingerprinting based on tools from additive combinatorics, such as generalized arithmetic progressions (GAPs), and prove that these methods provide circuit depth comparable to a probabilistic method. We also compare our method to prior work on explicit quantum fingerprinting methods. We provide a series of numerical experiments with implementation of the quantum automata for MOD17 language on noisy simulators of IBMQ quantum devices. We show that shallow implementation based on GAPs produces results with much smaller computational error compared to standard deep circuit implementation. Despite the fact that on the ideal quantum computational device, the opposite situation arises. We show that the shallow circuit for the quantum automaton is better for near-future quantum computational devices.},

  abstract     = {Modern distributed systems store thousands of gigabytes of information in persistent relational database management systems. It is the core storage component for microservice-based architectures. Due to the peculiarities of internal storage mechanisms, the total query processing time may exceed the service level agreement value. A common solution is to add a caching layer between the database management system and the service. However, maintaining the cache in a consistent state across all service replicas is a challenging task. We believe we can design a caching system with a consensus algorithm to meet modern service level agreement requirements. Firstly, we outline the role of caching in a distributed systems context. Secondly, we clarify our consistency model choice. Thirdly, we analyze existing distributed systems and their consistency guarantees to outline the absence of a solution that can fit our requirements. Finally, we develop the architecture of the caching system.},

  abstract     = {Introductory programming courses are considered difficult and challenging for students. They have to focus on and develop different skills related to problem-solving and programming domains concurrently. However, most programming courses spend more time teaching programming syntax. Therefore, this study developed and introduced an application, OOP-SOLVE, which focused on algorithmic thinking skills in the object-oriented programming (OOP) domain. The pseudo-code technique is used to create this application. Most of the teaching topics of the OOP course, such as classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism, are covered in this application. Moreover, the application presents each programming question in different sections such as class diagram, main class, test class, execution process, and output. A technology acceptance model (TAM) was used to investigate the acceptance of the OOP-SOLVE application in the OOP course. Moreover, the perceptions of the OOP course lecturers regarding the OOP-SOLVE application were collected by conducting a semi-structured interview. 224 students participated in the survey, and six lecturers participated in the interviews. Results show a positive impact of perceived ease of use, usefulness, and enjoyment on students’ attitudes toward their intention to use the application in the course. Lecturers also agreed that the application supported students in the OOP course. Moreover, it promotes students’ engagement and enhances collaboration and interaction among students in class activities. In addition to the solution of the given programming statement, the OOP-SOLVE application also presents the execution process of the program along with the output of each programming question. Lecturers also agreed that the application can be a supporting teaching tool in the OOP course.},

However, today's public-key cryptography, which is the basis of digital signatures, is vulnerable to quantum attacks. Therefore, there is a significant risk to the 2.7 trillion dollar market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector in the Quantum Era. In this paper, we review the current risk of quantum attacks on the blockchains of cryptocurrencies. We also discuss the migration of existing cryptocurrencies from classical to quantum-resistant blockchains and review some of the existing transition protocol algorithms. The main contribution of this work is to propose a new transition protocol algorithm that allows smooth and safe migration to post-quantum blockchains without delay. The proposed algorithm requires a soft fork of the original blockchain, which makes it more desirable than other hard-fork solutions. We also prove the soundness and completeness properties of the proposed algorithm and discuss its advantages compared to the existing ones. We conclude by highlighting our recommendations based on this study.},

  abstract     = {Online shopping has become common, but fitting clothes purchased online remains a challenge for both consumers and merchants. Two digital solutions are available: virtual fitting to try on clothes or using a 2D anthropometric measurement system to select the correct size. However, consumers’ experiences and perceptions of 2D measurement systems vary. To understand consumers’ willingness to adopt 2D anthropometric systems, this study reviewed the current use of these systems in China and abroad and created a model to identify the factors that influence adoption. The model was based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), with consumer perception as the mediator. Hypotheses were proposed based on this framework. A questionnaire survey was conducted to test these factors. A total of 410 valid responses were analyzed using SPSS to confirm the reliability and validity of the measurement dimensions. Then, structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses, and the results showed good model fit. Finally, path analysis and mediation tests revealed that consumer perceptions mediate the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and adoption attitudes. These findings highlight the importance of these factors in predicting consumer adoption of new systems. Fashion managers and designers should adjust marketing strategies and technology development based on factors like perceived usefulness, ease of use, and consumer perceptions (e.g., enjoyment, value, and risk) to encourage adoption.},

  abstract     = {Despite the widespread application and empirical success of deep neural networks, the theoretical 10 development of these networks remains an under-explored area. The lack of theory prevents rigorous 11 explanation and prediction of networks' performance and hinders confident deployment of the 12 networks especially in safety-critical applications. Geometric analysis provides a unique perspective 13 to bridge this gap between the practice and the theory of deep neural networks. As complex real-14 world data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, geometries of these underlying structures provide 15 informative insights for understanding the behavior of networks fitting to the data. 16In this Research Topic of Frontiers in Computer Science on Geometries of Learning, we aim to 17 present the latest advances on inspecting deep learning through the lens of geometry. We have 18 followed a rigorous peer review process and collected twelve articles that showcase the depth and 19 breadth of current approaches across applications of geometric analysis across diverse problem 20 domains from adversarial defense to object pose estimation. A summary of the collection is 21 introduced below. 22In the paper titled "Leveraging linear mapping for model-agnostic adversarial defense" Jamil et al. serve the core of recent developments in language modeling, promoting geometric and topological 97 interpretation of learning with direct links to semantics, and expanding the study for a wide range of 98 applications involving diverse data manifolds at real-world complexities. 99The guest editor team would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all the authors, reviewers and the 100 editorial team for their valuable contribution to this Research Topic.

  abstract     = {From a higher standpoint, the contribution lies within the broad AI-driven surveillance topic and enriches it by providing a new technique for more effective monitoring of public spaces. Detection is among the most featured keywords in AI and ML articles due to the excellent inference capabilities proven by several techniques and approaches. The contribution, "OSPS-MicroNet: a distilled knowledge micro-CNN network for detecting rice diseases", stands out as a lighweight deep learning approach to identifying rice plant diseases. OSPS-MicroNet is conceived to find a tradeoff between detection accuracy rates and computational resource constraints. The proposed approach relies on CNNs in a limited-resource setting. A teacher-student learning framework is used to work around the given challenge. The knowledge is transferred from a more sophisticated and bigger-sized 'teacher' model to the lighter-weighted OSPS-MicroNet 'student' model. Data labelling is a well-known challenge in AI and Computer Vision. The article "Automatic labeling of fish species using deep learning across different classification strategies" addresses the labelling of a dataset collecting images from 19 fish species. Pretrained CNNs represent the basis upon which stacking supervised classification layers. In greater detail, Transfer learning specifies pre-trained CNNs on features from the given dataset. Afterward, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Linear Discriminant Anaysis (LDA) are used as final classificators. The article "Deep learning-based classification of eye diseases using Convolutional Neural Network for OCT images" lays out a method to detect retinal disease from OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images. A preprocessing step based on Gaussian Blur Filtering is carried out before running OCT classification. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) runs OCT image classification into four categories: normal retina, Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Choroidal Neovascular Membranes (CNM), and Agerelated Macular Degeneration (AMD). The article titled "EfficientNet Family U-Net Models for Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation of Kidney Tumors on CT Images" presents a novel biomedical image segmentation method. Kidney cancer segmentation from CT (Computed Tomography) scans is approached combining U-Net and EfficientNet. The latter is opted due to its capabilities in image details extraction. The features detected by EfficientNet are paramount in accurately detecting the region of interest contours. Integrating the two architectures (U-Net and EfficientNet) delivers a more accurate segmentation of the kidney regions and the corresponding suspicious areas. The method is tested over KiTS19, a dataset of CT scans.In summary, the collection of research topics hosts seven contributions presenting methods and techniques in optimisation, image classification, labelling, deep learning, and interdisciplinary applications. Compelling scenarios arise from the latest development oflarge multimodal language models (LMLs), which will probably lead to ripple effects on computer vision and AI applications. That might pave the way for new case studies and techniques to be developed and tested.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) field have seen significant growth in the last couple of years. IoT is revolutionizing manufacturing, transportation, oil \& gas, and logistics sectors. However, developing IIoT applications poses several challenges, including the limited computational, memory, and energy resources of IoT devices. These devices generate a large amount of data at the network edge, making cloud-based processing impractical due to bandwidth constraints, latency, and security risks. Edge computing, which brings data processing closer to the source, offers a viable solution to these challenges. Despite its promise, edge computing faces significant hurdles. One of the primary challenges lies in the diversity of sensor types deployed across different environments, which adds complexity to the system's architecture.Furthermore, the large-scale deployment of edge devices and the inherent resource constraints of these devices complicate the task of optimizing performance. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to address these issues, particularly in domains like robotics and natural language processing, where it helps optimize task allocation, improve decision-making processes, and enhance the overall efficiency of edge systems. This Research Topic features four articles that explore diverse and cutting-edge applications within the IIoT, including resource management and enhancing security in IoT systems. The first article, \textit{"An enhanced whale optimization algorithm for task scheduling in edge computing environments"} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2024.1422546} {Han et al.}, focuses on addressing the challenges in real-time execution due to limited resources in edge computing environments. The authors proposed an enhanced whale optimization algorithm incorporating a multi-objective model considering CPU, memory, time, and resource utilization for optimizing task scheduling in edge computing. By leveraging chaotic mapping and a nonlinear convergence factor, the algorithm balances local and global search, significantly reducing costs (by 29.22\%), completion time (by 17.04\%), and improving resource utilization (by 9.5\%). This work significantly addresses the increasing demand for real-time processing capabilities in resource-constrained edge environments.The second contribution is the comprehensive review titled \textit {"Unveiling the core of IoT: comprehensive review on data security challenges and mitigation strategies"} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2024.1420680}{Kaur et al.}, which examines the security challenges posed by the increasing complexity of IoT environments. The authors identified key security threats, including spoofing, distributed denial of service, and man-in-the-middle attacks. This paper reviews various mitigation strategies such as machine learning, deep learning, lightweight encryption, intrusion detection systems, and advanced security protocols. The evaluation of IoT technology, the accompanying security progress, and the need for continued development are discussed. The paper also identifies IoT's application areas, such as healthcare, smart cities, smart homes, and industrial IoT, highlighting specific security challenges each faces. This review provides valuable insights into current vulnerabilities and presents strategies that could significantly enhance the resilience and security of IIoT systems. In the third article, \textit {"'Below 58 BPM,' involving real-time monitoring and self-medication practices in music performance through IoT technology"} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2024.1187933}{Merendino et al.}, the authors explored the development of an Internet of Musical Things system designed to assist an opera singer with a carotid aneurysm during performances. This system monitors the singer's heart rate in real-time and promotes self-healing by providing non-intrusive feedback. The project combined healthcare and performance arts to help the singer manage stress. The system is an example of "inclusive design," presenting a model for integrating assistive technology into arts. The project focuses on accessibility and environmental sustainability, and the results showed it could potentially reduce heart rate peaks during performances. Finally, the fourth article, \textit {"GPS-free synchronized pseudo-random number generators for internet-of-things"} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2023.1157629}{Rahman and Chakrabartty (2023)} introduces a security solution to IoT device's wireless communication without relying on GPS. The conventional random number generator (RNG) based approach is unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT devices due to their limited energy and computational capabilities. The authors propose an architecture utilizing a synchronized pseudo-random number generator (SPRNG) that combines a fast linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR)-based PRNG with a secure seed generator using self-powered timers. These timers operate based on quantum-mechanical tunneling, making them tamper-resistant and able to provide dynamic seeds that enhance the randomness of the output. The SPRNG system facilitates the secure exchange of encryption keys between IoT devices using synchronized timers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted the random number tests and validated this approach. This approach is suitable for use in resource-constrained and adversarial environments, with potential applications ranging from healthcare to military-grade IoT systems.The research presented in this topic drives advancements in IIoT across various industries. From task scheduling and security to real-time monitoring and secure communication, the articles exemplify the breadth of research addressing critical challenges in the field. By providing solutions that improve efficiency, enhance security, and address domain-specific needs, this Research Topic lays the groundwork for future innovations that will further transform IIoT systems.},
