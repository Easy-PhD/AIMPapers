  abstract     = {Optical character recognition (OCR) plays a crucial role in digitizing archives and documents. However, recognizing complex Chinese characters remains challenging owing to their intricate structures and sequential patterns. This study introduces an advanced OCR model that integrates EfficientNetV2 as the backbone within a transformer-based architecture to enhance feature extraction. To address the limitations of traditional adaptive feature selection, we propose a dynamic collaborative channel–spatial attention (DCCSA) module. This module combines channel attention, spatial attention, and channel shuffling to dynamically capture global dependencies and optimize feature representations across both spatial and channel dimensions. Additionally, rotational position encoding (RoPE) is incorporated into the transformer to accurately capture the spatial relationships between characters and radicals, ensuring precise representation of complex hierarchal structures. Further, the model adopts a multitask learning framework that jointly decodes characters and radicals, enabling cross-task optimization and significantly enhancing recognition performance. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements on both printed and handwritten Chinese text. Moreover, the model shows strong generalization capabilities on challenging scene-text datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in addressing the OCR challenges associated with intricate scripts.},

To address these challenges, we propose SCUX-Net, a novel lightweight convolutional neural network designed to facilitate the segmentation of intracranial aneurysms. SCUX-Net builds upon the 3D UX-Net by introducing two key innovations: (1) a spatial adaptive feature module, integrated before each 3D UX-Net block, enabling multi-scale feature fusion for long-range information interaction; (2) a convolutional block attention module, applied after each downsampling block to emphasize important features across channel and spatial dimensions, suppressing irrelevant information. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of SCUX-Net in segmenting intracranial aneurysms on CTA images, achieving a dice similarity coefficient of 80% on the test set. Notably, SCUX-Net excels in detecting small aneurysms ( 3 mm) and multiple aneurysms, showcasing its potential for clinical application.},

  abstract     = {Crop diseases and adverse field conditions threaten global food security, particularly in resource-limited regions. Current deep-learning models for disease detection suffer from insufficient accuracy, high prediction instability under field noise, and a lack of integration with environmental context. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid deep learning architecture combining EfficientNetV2, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformers, augmented with attention mechanisms and multiscale feature fusion. Optimised for edge deployment via TensorFlow Lite and integrated with IoT sensors for real-time soil and field monitoring, the model achieved state-of-the-art performance with 99.2% accuracy, 0.993 precision, 0.993 recall, and a near-perfect AUC of 0.999998, outperforming benchmarks like DenseNet50 (88.4%) and ShuffleNet (95.8%). Training on 76 classes (22 diseases) demonstrated rapid convergence and robustness, with validation accuracy reaching 98.7% and minimal overfitting. Statistical validation confirmed superior stability, with 69% lower prediction variance (0.000010) than DenseNet50 (0.000035), ensuring reliable performance under real-world noise. Bayesian testing showed a 100% probability of superiority over DenseNet50 and 85.1% over ShuffleNet, while field trials on 249 real-world images achieved 97.97% accuracy, highlighting strong generalisation. IoT integration reduced false diagnoses by 92% through environmental correlation, and edge optimisation enabled real-time inference via a 30.4 MB mobile application (0.094-second latency). This work advances precision agriculture through a scalable, cloud-independent framework that unifies hybrid deep learning with edge-compatible IoT sensing. By addressing critical gaps in accuracy, stability, and contextual awareness, the system enhances crop health management in low-resource settings, offering a statistically validated tool for sustainable farming practices.},

Existing dehazing methods often struggle with non-uniform haze distributions, limited detail restoration, and poor generalization across diverse scenes. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a deep learning-based dehazing framework that jointly restores image clarity and detail. Unlike conventional algorithms that often neglect fine structure recovery, our architecture incorporates four specialized sub-modules: (i) a noise attention module for enhancing noise suppression and feature preservation; (ii) an adaptive ConvNet module; (iii) a feature extraction module for capturing salient image features; and (iv) a detail refinement module to enhance spatial fidelity. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner to restore both structural integrity and colour consistency under challenging conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, including indoor, outdoor, underwater, night-time, and remote sensing scenarios, demonstrate superior generalization capability. In the SOTS indoor dataset, our method achieves a PSNR of 28.44 dB and an SSIM of 0.967, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. Evaluations using additional metrics such as CIEDE2000 and MSE confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling dense and heterogeneous haze while preserving fine textures and visual fidelity.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has substantially advanced the single image super-resolution (SISR). However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of “Universality” and its associated definitions which extend the traditional notion of “Generalization” to encompass the modules' ease of transferability. Then we propose the universality assessment equation (UAE), a metric which quantifies how readily a given module could be transplanted across models and reveals the combined influence of multiple existing metrics on transferability. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules, cycle residual block (CRB) and depth-wise cycle residual block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets and other low-level tasks, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83 dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity. Similar optimization approaches could be applied to a broader range of basic modules, offering a new paradigm for the design of plug-and-play modules.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep learning has greatly advanced medical image segmentation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in capturing local image features, whereas ViT adeptly models long-range dependencies through multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Despite their strengths, both CNN and ViT face challenges in efficiently processing long-range dependencies in medical images and often require substantial computational resources. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid model combining Mamba and Transformer architectures. Our model integrates ViT's self-attention modules within a pure-vision Mamba U-shaped encoder, capturing both global and local information through nested Transformer and Mamba modules. Additionally, a multi-scale feed-forward neural network is incorporated within the Mamba blocks to enhance feature diversity by capturing fine-grained local details. Finally, a channel-adaptive feature (CAF) fusion module is introduced at the original skip connections to mitigate feature loss during information fusion and to improve segmentation accuracy in boundary regions. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted on two public datasets: breast ultrasound image (BUSI) and clinic. The Dice score, Intersection over Union (IoU) score, recall score, F 1 score and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) of the proposed model on the BUSI dataset were 0.7918, 0.7016, 0.8508, 0.7919 and 12.04 mm, respectively. On ClinicDB, these metrics reach 0.9239, 0.8671, 0.9278, 0.9239 and 5.49 mm, respectively.

  abstract     = {Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) mainly consist of three components: environmental perception, decision planning, and motion control. As a fundamental component of the ADAS environmental perception system, 3D object detection enables vehicles to avoid obstacles and ensure driving safety only through accurate and real-time prediction and localization of three-dimensional targets such as vehicles and pedestrians in road scenes. Therefore, to improve both the real-time performance and accuracy of 3D object detection, we propose a lightweight depth prediction-based 3D object detection model with multi-scale fusion—SPWS-Transformer. First, to enhance the model's accuracy, we propose a feature extraction network incorporating multi-scale feature fusion and depth prediction. By designing a multi-scale feature fusion module, we effectively combine multi-scale semantic and fine-grained information from feature maps of different scales to enhance the network's feature extraction capability. To capture spatial information from the feature maps, we apply convolution, group normalization, and nonlinear activation operations on the fused feature maps to generate depth feature maps. Both the fused feature maps and depth feature maps serve as inputs for subsequent network stages. To further improve accuracy, we leverage the long-range modelling advantages of Transformers by designing a feature enhancement encoder to strengthen the representation capability of depth feature maps. We incorporate a dilated encoder to perform positional encoding on depth feature maps and utilize multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships within the input scene, thereby enhancing the detection capability of the 3D object detection network. Then, to improve real-time performance, we design a decoder structure with scale-aware attention. By predefining masks of different scales, we adaptively learn a scale-aware filter using depth and visual features to enhance object queries. Finally, on the KITTI dataset, the improved algorithm achieves an AP of 24.66% for the car category, with more significant improvements in detection accuracy under the ‘hard’ difficulty level. The model achieves an inference time of 24 ms.},

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, this systematic review critically evaluates and analyses the effectiveness of recent enhancement strategies developed to optimize the performance of the traditional U-Net architecture in attaining accurate tumour segmentation in CT and MRI images. The strategies have been divided into five main areas: U-Net architectural enhancements, including U-Net backbone optimization; skip connection refinements; bottleneck optimizations; transformer-based integrations; and metaheuristic algorithms as a self-adaptive optimization technique. Afterward, each category is thoroughly examined to determine how the strategies address specific limitations inherent to the traditional U-Net model. In addition, this paper reviews the pivotal role of preprocessing techniques in determining segmentation performance. This review identifies persistent research gaps and offers valuable insights for future research to improve the robustness, accuracy, and clinical applicability of the U-Net model.},

Unlike conventional systems that rely on in-cabin facial or physiological analysis, the proposed architecture prioritizes privacy by inferring fatigue through vehicle dynamics and road interaction alone. Built upon the YOLOP deep learning model, the system performs lane segmentation and object detection to extract two critical indicators: lane deviation and inter-vehicle distance, both computed from monocular vision. These signals are interpreted via a fuzzy logic module that incorporates trapezoidal, triangular, and Gaussian membership functions, enabling context-sensitive and explainable fatigue assessment. Comparative evaluation of these functions illustrates trade-offs in responsiveness and generalization. Initial validation against expert human assessments shows promising alignment in perceived fatigue levels, suggesting the system can meaningfully approximate fatigue-related judgments. By aligning with emerging ethical frameworks for non-intrusive AI in mobility, the system marks a step toward socially responsible and practically deployable fatigue monitoring in intelligent transportation.},

Many efforts either try to validate the global model with trusted clients, or try to make it difficult or costly to upload malicious updates. Unfortunately, the existing solutions are still challenged in defending against stealthy backdoor attacks or negative impacts brought to the aggregation. Especially in the non-independent and identically distributed setting. Moreover, these methods overlook the threat of adaptive attacks, that is, attackers fully know the defense implementation. To address these issues, we propose a novel run-time defense against diverse backdoor attacks, dubbed HoneyFL . It differs from previous works in three key aspects: (1) effectiveness - it is capable of defending against stealthy backdoors through leveraging honeypot clients; (2) aggregation - it promises effective aggregation since only a limited number of honeypot clients are used; (3) robustness - it can handle adaptive backdoor attacks based on differential prediction. Compared with five state-of-the-art defense baselines, extensive experiments show that HoneyFL produces a higher backdoor detection success rate above 97% and a lower false positive rate below 3%, where seven attacks generate backdoor examples. Its impact on the aggregation results of the main task is negligible. We also show that the defense success rate of HoneyFL against adaptive attacks is approximately 3.52 of the baselines on average.},

This paper introduces a novel multi-scale dual-attention network (MSDA-Net) for quantification of intracranial aneurysms in MRA images. The proposed framework includes a context aware patch (CAP) module, multi-scale convolutional blocks, and a dual-attention block, where the CAP module extracts center-line patches to address foreground-background imbalance, the multi-scale and dual-attention blocks enable feature extraction of anatomical dependencies for fine-grained segmentation. The framework leverages three morphological features such as locations of aneurysms, vascular bifurcations, and vessel topology using a multi-task learning scheme for better segmentation. MSDA-Net surpasses state-of-the-art models such as U-Net, residual U-Net, attention U-Net, and nnU-net with an improved dice similarity coefficient of 0.71 and a volume similarity of 0.85. Experiments conducted on the publicly available ADAM challenge dataset and a private post-treatment database demonstrate the reliability and performance of this approach.

To address this issue, a visual perception-based quality assessment method for stitched panoramic images is proposed. Existing no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods often struggle to accurately model the HVS and its subjective perception of stitching distortions, leading to significant discrepancies between predicted and actual quality scores. Therefore, we use the learnt perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) to capture perceptual similarity from the HVS, thereby generating a high-quality pseudo-reference image (PRI). To further improve its perceptual quality, the PRI is refined using a visual restoration network (VRN) to reduce residual distortions. Subsequently, both the pseudo-reference and distorted images are fed into a quality assessment network with shared parameters to extract deep feature representations. To improve distortion-aware quality evaluation, we design an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, where features from the pseudo-reference and distorted images are first enhanced through an attention mechanism and then adaptively fused via learnt weights for more effective quality assessment. Finally, the fused features are processed through fully connected layers for regression, predicting the perceptual quality score of the stitched panoramic image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Omnidirectional images reveal advantages when addressing the understanding of the environment due to the 360-degree contextual information. However, the inherent characteristics of the omnidirectional images add additional problems to obtain an accurate detection and segmentation of objects or a good depth estimation. To overcome these problems, we exploit convolutions in the frequency domain, obtaining a wider receptive field in each convolutional layer, and convolutions in the equirectangular projection, to cope with the image distortion. Both convolutions allow to leverage the whole context information from omnidirectional images. Our experiments show that our proposal has better performance on non-gravity-oriented panoramas than state-of-the-art methods and similar performance on oriented panoramas as specific state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and for monocular depth estimation, outperforming the sole other method which provides both tasks.},

Most of them focus on pixel-level processing and ignore intrinsic sparsity and low-rank properties of noise and objects, respectively, in images. To argue this issue, a novel image enhancement model is proposed to eliminate or suppress noise, which integrates robust principal component analysis with kernel dictionary learning (KDL). Specifically, the Kernel trick is introduced to nonlinearly map image data and low-rank dictionary to be learned to high-dimensional spaces so as to separate sparsity noise from contaminated images. The proposed model is abbreviate as RSKDL. In RSKDL, the intrinsic structural characteristic of images is unclosed by adaptively learning the affinity graph of image data so as to ensure the enhanced images inheriting the manifold structure of original images. Meantime, the non-convex sparsity regularization on the residual between original images and enhanced ones is imposed to exclude noise from original data. Extensive experiments on several image datasets show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods for image denoising.},

The network self-identifies and prunes redundant features by analysing the statistical properties of the images and objects in the datasets, leading to a leaner and more efficient SSD network. This dataset-informed reduction of feature maps and anchor boxes accelerates training and inference speeds and enhances detection precision, which is crucial for accurate part identification in high-throughput production.

To address the above problems, we propose a novel representation approach for stop-lines that balances high precision with real-time detection requirements. Inspired by the prevalence of line features in road markings, we propose SLSDNet—a stop-line segment detection network that fuses image data with line features to prioritise line-rich regions for detection. Furthermore, we employ a multi-task learning scheme to extract stop-line features across multiple dimensions and incorporate a verification mechanism to ensure robust performance. In addition, to address the lack of a stop-line dataset, we collected images from multiple sources and published our stop-line dataset at https://github.com/ChengkangLiu/Stop-Line-Dataset .

We propose the square funnel network (SF-Net), a novel network structure with significantly fewer parameters but comparable performance, in this paper. SF-Net follows a unique configuration that increases the third dimension of the input frames in deeper layers instead of increasing the number of filters, which results in a more efficient and more compact model. Our model makes use of a maximum of 64 filters in nearly all of its layers, except for the last two layers, which employ 128 filters each. With both objective and subjective evaluation, SF-Net has outstanding visual quality and efficiency, which makes it suitable for low-computational-resource applications. The paper depicts a good direction of VFI, which is to decrease the number of parameters without sacrificing performance.},

  abstract     = {Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems have difficulties with computing efficiency, illumination robustness and noise sensitivity. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features or monolithic deep learning architectures, which either lack adaptability to diverse image domains or suffer from high computational complexity. To bridge this gap, a unique two-tier deep learning system is presented in this research to overcome these drawbacks. First, a supervised neural network (SNN) reduces dimensionality and improves interpretability by converting HSV colour space into semantic 2D colour labels through pixel-level classification. This addresses the inefficiency of processing raw RGB data while preserving illumination-invariant colour semantics. Second, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) greatly increases computing efficiency by processing these labels rather than raw images. By operating on compressed 2D representations, the system achieves faster inference compared to standard 3D CNN pipelines. The framework presents Variable Weight Overall Similarity (VWOS), a versatile similarity metric that combines semantic (softmax) and structural (MaxPool3) elements with dynamically predicted weights using a neural network to automatically optimise retrieval performance based on image content. This adaptive fusion resolves the limitations of fixed-weight similarity measures in handling heterogeneous query types. The system has achieved a performance with precision@10 scores of 0.9-1.0 and classification accuracies of 0.85-0.98 when tested on the PH 2 , Oxford Flowers, Corel-1k, Caltech-101 and Kvasir datasets. Notably, it outperforms current handcrafted, deep learning and hybrid approaches, achieving 1.0 precision@10 on four datasets and 0.96 accuracy on medical Kvasir images. Quantitative comparisons show 9%–14% higher precision than handcrafted methods, 3%–35% improvement over deep learning baselines, and 12% better than hybrid systems. This approach is especially promising for applications involving multimedia retrieval and medical imaging, where interpretability and accuracy are crucial.},

To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical fine-grained regression (HFGR) model, which employs a multi-level structure that categorizes visibility into coarse-to-fine ranges and refines these estimated values with a fine-grained regression. Specifically, our designed hierarchical model perceives a global continuity weights, swiftly narrowing down the prediction range, while the small interval regression can also capture local features, achieving a satisfying fine-grained perception. By the proposed hierarchical regression, we can differentiate the subtle varieties between different visibility levels.

Instead of involving numerous training examples, PAIR only considers small samples and utilizes a sample augmentation technique to create new instances with balanced attributes. Meanwhile, it also uses an upsampling interpolation method to resolve the high distortion issue of recovery images. In contrast, PAIR reduces reliance on the target model's architecture while still requiring certain prior knowledge, such as the model's input features and attack objectives. PAIR's performance is evaluated across a variety of settings and datasets. The experiments demonstrate that PAIR has performance benefits in image recovery and significantly outperforms representative privacy attacks.

Therefore, we propose a multimodal semantic enhancement (MSE) module, which jointly analyzes the visual-semantic relationship between category names and example samples through a multimodal large model. By leveraging visual information to guide the generation of discriminative category descriptions, MSE effectively mitigates semantic polysemy issues. To mitigate the issue of insufficient support set data, we introduce a multimodal image generation (MIG) module, which utilizes the image generation capability of text-to-image models and generates diverse images based on various textual information. Additionally, we draw inspiration from the prototypical networks and combine it with gaussian discriminant analysis to build a training-free visual-textual classifier.

To address these problems, we propose a multiscale feature fusion and multiscale context-aware aggregation (MSCA) framework using You Only Look Once Version 9 (YOLOv9) for TSD. Multiscale feature fusion helps filter out less useful features, leading to more informative representations, and combines fine-grained lower-level features with semantically rich higher-level features. In addition, MSCA fusion captures broader contexts without compromising spatial resolution and increases the receptive field without increasing parameters or computational cost, unlike methods that involve increasing kernel size or pooling. The MSCA-YOLO method enhances the extracted features, focusing more on meaningful input areas, minimising the effects of size and weather differences, and improving the overall robustness of the system.

  abstract     = {Smartphones capturing images in outdoor environments are often affected by adverse weather conditions, resulting in low-quality images. This paper introduces the Parallel Concatenated Feature Pyramid Network (C-FPN) to address the challenge of dehazing single smartphone images. Dehazing a single image on smartphones is considered an ill-posed problem. While the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is widely used in computer vision tasks, its feature extraction is limited by the max-pooling operator. Furthermore, it cannot retain the hazy feature and restore the image at the same time, which fails to preserve critical hazy image features. Additionally, most existing methods struggle to balance preserving haze-relevant information with effective image restoration. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel parallel concatenated FP architecture that estimates atmosphere light and calculates transmission information on smartphones. The key contributions of this paper include (1) designing a parallel concatenated FP architecture capable of retrieving hazy features across various environments in deeper layers, (2) incorporating a concatenation structure to retain hazy information, enabling depth estimation and the generation of a transmission map, (3) using the transmission map as an input for a convolutional neural network with a dehazing loss function to calculate atmosphere light under different environments, and (4) implementing a skipping connection in the C-FPN to retain essential features, facilitating an end-to-end learning structure. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on the SOTS, NH-HAZE 2, and synthetic hazy image indoor datasets. The PSNR/SSIM achieve 26.58/0.948, 26.28/0.966 and 17.15/0.761, respectively.

  abstract     = {Gene selection is critical for cancer diagnosis because the ability to discover specific biomarkers has a major impact on diagnostic accuracy. Traditional approaches frequently struggle with high-dimensional genomic data, where irrelevant or redundant characteristics might impair machine learning algorithms. Despite advances in computational approaches, there is a gap in the optimization of deep learning models for gene selection, particularly in terms of selecting the best model architecture and hyperparameters. This paper addresses three critical challenges in genomic biomarker discovery for cancer diagnosis: (1) the high-dimensional nature of gene expression data, (2) the need for biologically interpretable feature selection, and (3) the optimization of deep learning architectures for genomic analysis. We present a novel hybrid approach combining modified genetic algorithms with deep neural networks to overcome limitations of traditional methods in handling feature redundancy and computational complexity. Our methodology introduces three key innovations: a dynamic mutation operator that adapts to population diversity, multi-objective optimization balancing classification accuracy with biological pathway relevance, and simultaneous co-evolution of both gene subsets and neural network architectures. The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 99.1% accuracy, 98.9% AUC-ROC, and 99.0% F1-score on the ISIC 2020 dataset, while maintaining clinically relevant sensitivity (98.0%) and specificity (98.5%). Extensive validation across six benchmark datasets demonstrates consistent improvements over existing machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly in handling rare cancer subtypes and low-resolution images.

  abstract     = {Generating photo-realistic images from natural language descriptions is a challenging task at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision. Text-to-image synthesis involves generating visual images in a way which naturally matches the semantic meaning of the input text. Recent diffusion-based models have demonstrated strong performance in image fidelity but are slow in inference and exhibit coarse semantic alignment. To overcome the two problems above and allow images to be more faithful (realistic) to texts and semantics in the wild, we propose a novel hybrid architecture called DM-GAN+ATT+CL (dynamic memory GAN + contrastive learning and attention mechanisms). Our method proceeds in a two-step manner: we first produce low-resolution images based on the DM-GAN model with dual attention modules and then refine the results through a memory-based feature refinement mechanism. Contrastive learning was then utilized on a separate dataset with high resolution image-text pairs to enhance feature discrimination and strengthen semantic consistency. The result is richer semantic relevance, stronger image variation and better visual quality. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets—CUB, Oxford-102, MS-COCO, and MM-CelebA-HQ—demonstrate that the proposed DM-GAN+ATT+CL framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, it achieved an R-precision of 95.24, an inception score (IS) of 38.43, and a Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 11.30 on the MS-COCO dataset, with similarly strong and consistent performance observed across the other datasets. These findings indicate that our approach substantially enriches the diversity and reality of synthetic images, promising a better future for text-image matching.},

To mitigate the impact of the complex underwater environment on imaging quality, data-driven methods for underwater image enhancement have emerged as an effective strategy. However, convolutional neural networks exhibit limitations in processing global information interactions due to their inductive biases. Concurrently, transformers often overlook local details. To address these challenges, we propose FCUnet, a hybrid network designed to enhance the quality of underwater images. First, we propose a colour deviation preprocessing module that incorporates a multi-scale channel-wise attention for the fusion feature map to capture differences in rich spatial hierarchical information across channels. Second, we design the cross-attention block guided by multiple features to efficiently acquire local fine details and global scene characteristics. Finally, a universal feature fusion unit and a colour loss term are proposed to enhance the network's sensitivity to colour and texture deviation information. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each individual component. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FCUnet outperforms other competitive methods, achieving superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.},

We propose DyLoFViT, a light-weight vision transformer specifically optimized for industrial SLM defect classification. DyLoFViT makes four significant architectural contributions: (1) dynamic positional encoding that retains spatial coherence and facilitates translation invariance, (2) dynamic sparse gating that adaptively filters the most informative tokens, (3) Nyström-based sparse self-attention that estimates long-range dependencies with lower computation, and (4) frequency-domain compression with discrete cosine transform that filters high-frequency noise with preservation of low-frequency structure vital for defect classification. Experiments on an industrial test set of 1320 high-resolution images of four melt quality classes show that DyLoFViT achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 96.1% and an F1-score of 95.6% with merely 13.2M parameters and 2.9 GFLOPs. Compared with the prior CNN and transformer architectures, DyLoFViT achieves superior precision with an order of magnitude lower inference latency (0.3 ms/image), making it extremely well-suited for real-time, edge-device deployment in additive manufacturing.

  abstract     = {The rise in cyber threats to digital images over networks is a primary problem for both private and government organisations. Image encryption is considered a useful way to secure the digital image; however, it faces critical challenges such as weak key generation, chosen-plaintext attacks, high overhead, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the DNA-Dynamic Concurrent Permutation-Diffusion Algorithm (DNA-DCP-DA), which introduces four advanced encryption mechanisms. Firstly, new scaling chaotification models are introduced to enhance chaotic properties, achieving superior results in bifurcation, Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Sample Entropy (SEn), Kolmogorov Entropy (KEn) and key generation. Secondly, a Key Vectorisation Method (KVM) is proposed to optimise execution time and reduce the computational overhead of chaotic map iterations. Thirdly, robust non-commutative DNA operations are introduced, including DNA hybrid and circular shift operations to enhance encryption security. Finally, integrate permutation and dynamic diffusion processes, strengthening security and improving efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments have been conducted, and results have been compared with the latest encryption algorithms. This shows the proposed encryption algorithm is better, with superior results for correlation results close to zero and Information Entropy (IE) larger than 7.999. The Number of Pixel Change Rates (NPCR) exceeds 99.6%, and the Uniform Average Change Intensity (UACI) is above 33.4%. The algorithm encrypts an image of size 256 × 256 in 0.1255 s, with a key space reaching 2 697 . As a result, the proposed system establishes a new benchmark for secure and efficient image encryption against cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in detecting defects in transmission line insulators using aerial imagery. However, the application of these methods in complex power environments continues to face challenges such as intricate backgrounds, small target sizes, multiple scales and varied morphologies. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi-defect detection model for transmission line insulators (MDM-TLI). Firstly, MDM-TLI incorporates a hybrid attention model based on a channel separation strategy, which enhances the model's focus on defect regions, effectively mitigating the difficulty of extracting small target features amidst complex backgrounds. Secondly, the model employs a scale-balanced loss function, that introduces a scale balance factor designed to eliminate discrepancies in the position and shape calculations of bounding boxes across different scales. Lastly, an adaptive feature fusion module is utilised, allowing the model to dynamically adjust the fusion ratios of various features during the integration of multi-level features. This reinforces the model's capability to represent multi-morphological features comprehensively. Experimental results demonstrate that MDM-TLI significantly enhances the performance of insulator defect detection. Specifically, the detection accuracies for insulator shedding, damage, and flashover defects reached 97.6%, 84.5% and 80.7%, respectively. These results outperform those of existing models, highlighting the effectiveness of MDM-TLI and providing robust technical support for the intelligent maintenance of transmission lines.

In hand-crafted features, we extract the key points using a well-known scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Then, we create two different representations for the signature image: (1) a graph representation, which shows the structural relationship between keypoints; and (2) a visual word histogram representation, which ignores the structural knowledge. In data-driven features, we fed a raw image into two pre-trained residual network (ResNet) and VGGNet to extract local structural features from the images. Then, models were fine-tuned by our data. Two well-known datasets, the MCYT-75 and the UT-Sig, datasets, are used to assess the approach. The obtained results show that the graph representation for the sign image has a more discriminative ability to differentiate the original signatures from the forgeries.In this paper, we have done a comparative study investigating how hand-crafted and data-driven-based features could impact signature identification.

To address these issues, a lightweight end-to-end model LiteZSSR is proposed for super-resolution reconstruction of fundus images, incorporating a residual information distillation module to extract multi-scale features within a shallow network architecture, effectively retaining both local and global contextual information. In addition, a multi-feature fusion group composed of multiple large kernel attention blocks is designed to strengthen feature representation while minimizing redundancy and computational overhead. Unsupervised training based on internal image learning is adopted to eliminate dependence on large-scale datasets and to suppress artifacts commonly produced by CNN-based SRR methods. Extensive experiments on publicly available fundus image datasets, including DRIVE, STARE, and CHASEDB1, demonstrate that LiteZSSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while significantly reducing model parameters.

This framework included three core innovations: (1) the pixel dynamic convolution attention module (PDCA), which enhanced small target detection capabilities in complex backgrounds through direction-sensitive convolution and a dual-stage attention mechanism; (2) the adaptive channel attention network (ACAN), which optimized multi-scale feature fusion and suppressed background interference via dynamic weight allocation and channel recalibration; (3) the pyramidal wavelet attention fusion block (PWAFB), which synergistically integrated wavelet multi-resolution analysis with composite attention mechanisms to model spatial details and channel relationships in remote sensing images through a collaborative decomposition and reconstruction workflow.

Compared with other detection models, PAP-YOLOv8 achieves a balanced trade-off between network size and detection capability, demonstrating superior overall performance with an F1 score of 83.1%.

  abstract     = {Arbitrary style transfer, a highly flexible technique with broad application potential, has gained significant attention recently. However, effectively disentangling content and style to synthesize novel stylized images remains a major challenge in arbitrary style transfer tasks. Existing methods primarily perform content and style disentanglement in either a single spatial domain or the frequency domain. We propose a style transfer method based on frequency-matching and spatial attention called FMSA. FMSA consists of two components: frequency feature matching (FFM) and adaptive spatial attention (ASA). In the spatial domain, an attention mechanism is employed to learn attention scores from the content and style feature maps. These scores are then used to perform point-wise normalization, generating synthesized features. In the frequency domain, filters are first applied to process the content and style features. The style-transferred features are subsequently aligned with the magnitude of the style features and the phase of the content features, thereby achieving content-style disentanglement and reconstruction. We introduce a frequency domain loss to reinforce content consistency in the stylized image while effectively transferring the style patterns to improve image synthesis quality. In addition, we design a decoder based on fast fourier convolution (FFC) that can efficiently decode both global and local information to produce the output. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method exhibits superior performance in style transfer tasks, generating results with enhanced stylistic patterns and visual quality.

  abstract     = {Images captured by underwater robots often suffer from issues such as blurring and colour distortion, which hinder effective feature extraction and target recognition in underwater environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel underwater image enhancement method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), termed multiple colour space underwater generative adversarial network (MCS-UGAN). The proposed method is built upon a GAN framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator. The generator comprises two main modules: a deblurring module and a colour correction module. The deblurring module innovatively incorporates an efficient multi-scale feature extraction technique and an attention mechanism, which enhances object contours while preserving fine image details. The colour correction module integrates residual blocks into the U-Net architecture, effectively mitigating the problems of gradient vanishing and explosion during backpropagation in underwater image enhancement networks, thereby enhancing the network's feature learning capability. This design corrects colour distortions while preserving edge information in the image. The discriminator adopts the PatchGAN structure, which focuses on the local regions of the image, significantly improving the generator's ability to restore high-frequency details and thus enhancing the quality of the generated images. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, MCS-UGAN achieves superior performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, underwater image quality measure, and underwater colour image quality evaluation, with average values of 26.24, 0.91, 3.13, and 0.64, respectively. Results from real-world applications further show that MCS-UGAN effectively increases the number of extracted corner points, validating its practicality and effectiveness.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), secure processing of color traffic images has become critical for traffic management, safety monitoring, and flow analysis. However, ITS are increasingly susceptible to malicious attacks and data tampering. To address this, we propose an advanced visual encryption method specifically for color traffic images. Our approach employs discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to represent images sparsely, followed by dynamic three-dimensional spiral disruption for encryption. Chaotic systems then compress the encrypted data, embedding it into a carrier image via least significant bit (LSB) techniques. Experimental results demonstrate robust visual security, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 42 dB, strong resilience against common attacks, and a substantial a key space of 2 512 ×10 60 , effectively resisting brute-force attacks. Neighboring pixel correlation coefficients drop below 0.15, compared to original images (>0.87), and under shear resistance attack with 128×128 data loss, PSNR remains above 23 dB. Additionally, employing P-tensor product compressed sensing significantly reduces measurement matrix dimensionality, enhancing transmission efficiency. This method offers a viable solution for secure storage and transmission in modern ITS, significantly bolstering privacy and system robustness.

Therefore, research on image restoration has significant practical value. Traditional matrix-based algorithms struggle with high-dimensional data, often failing to preserve spatial structures and risking overfitting. In this paper, we investigate tensor recovery problems under the tensor singular value decomposition framework. We introduce a non-convex surrogate for the tensor rank—the tensor truncated Schatten- norm—and propose two recovery models based on this theory: a tensor completion model and a tensor robust principal component analysis model. Efficient solutions based on the alternating direction method of multipliers are developed for both models. Moreover, we provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity and convergence behavior of our algorithms. At last, extensive experiments on synthetic data, color images, video sequences, multispectral images, and medical images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.},

To address this critical issue, this study proposes S-YOLOv8n, a lightweight intelligent detection model designed for the automated and precise identification of micro-cracks in shaft linings. The proposed framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) A lightweight convolutional downsampling enhancement (CDE) module that synergistically combines standard convolution, depthwise separable convolution, and ECA attention mechanisms. This architecture effectively mitigates complex background interference while preserving crack features during downsampling, enhancing shallow network feature extraction capabilities. (2) A GS-C2f feature fusion module that optimizes both spatial characteristics of crack morphology and semantic representations of crack severity, concurrently improving inference efficiency. Experimental validation on a custom shaft lining dataset demonstrates that S-YOLOv8n achieves 1.4% higher detection accuracy than baseline YOLOv8n while reducing model parameters and computational costs by 32.0% and 27.8%, respectively.

However, the quality of digital pathology slides is often limited by scanner resolution, which can compromise diagnostic precision and patient care. To address this challenge, we conducted a comparative study evaluating four state of the art image enhancement methods: real enhanced super resolution generative adversarial network (Real-ESRGAN), SwinIR, multi scale image restoration network v2 (MIRNet-v2) and super resolution CNN (SRCNN). Our assessment focused on both quantitative metrics peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) and qualitative visual analysis to evaluate detail preservation. The experimental results revealed that SwinIR achieved the best quantitative performance among all evaluated methods, attaining the highest PSNR (35.81) and SSIM (0.95) for lung images from the LC2500 dataset at a 2 upscaling factor. In contrast, real-ESRGAN excelled in perceptual quality, preserving finer image details more effectively, though it recorded slightly lower numerical scores (PSNR: 33.53, SSIM: 0.92) on the same dataset. These outcomes highlight essential trade off between perceptual fidelity and reconstruction quality, indicating that the optimal choice of enhancement method may vary depending on clinical or diagnostic priorities. The MIRNetv2 method delivered reasonable performance but ranked below both real-ESRGAN and SwinIR. Specifically, it achieved PSNR/SSIM scores of 30.67/0.94 on PR-IHC patches, 32.90/0.95 on lung images, and 31.87/0.95 on colon images, while scoring 29.11 for PR-IHC images in a separate evaluation. SRCNN demonstrated a balanced performance across datasets, achieving PSNR/SSIM values of 31.45/0.88 for lung images, 30.76/0.87 for PR-IHC patches, 32.62/0.93 for colon images, and 33.76/0.91 for PR-IHC. These findings underscore the real ESRGAN as the most effective method for improving the resolution and quality of histopathology images, supporting its potential integration into digital pathology workflows to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.},

The existing ranking-based methods face two challenges: (1) The density calculation using nearest neighbours only considers distances between bands, ignoring shared neighbours. Thus, it fails to reflect the local distribution of bands. (2) The high dimensionality of the bands limits the effectiveness of the Euclidean distance-based metric in accurately capturing their similarity. To address the issues, we've proposed an innovative approach for selecting bands, grounded in a mass-based metric and shared nearest neighbours called MBSNN. Initially, we leverage a mass-based metric computation technique to supplant the conventional distance metric between disparate bands. This substitution mitigates the distortions that high-dimensional data can inflict on distance calculations. Subsequently, the natural nearest neighbour method is combined to calculate the local density of the band, reflecting its local distribution characteristics. Finally, an information entropy and peak synergy band selection technique is constructed. To substantiate the merits of our proposed approach, we executed experiments utilising support vector machines across four benchmark datasets. The results of these experiments affirm the effectiveness of our band selection approach.},

Despite the achieved success by existing methods, two problems still persist in automated segmentation of MS lesions, namely the lack of an effective feature enhancement approach for capturing locality context and the lack of global coherence in prediction for pixels. Hence, we propose a correlation learning network for both local and global context in this work. Specifically, we propose a sparse spatial correlation module to learn the spatial correlations within neighbours for local context. Besides, we propose a global coherence module to encode long-range dependencies for global context.

These errors in the teacher models are a significant part of knowledge distillation that cannot be ignored. In order to facilitate the acquisition of more accurate knowledge by students, we propose the implementation of adaptive logit reconstruction knowledge distillation (ALRKD). ALRKD corrects errors by using the standard deviation, which represents the fluctuation degree of the logit distribution. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the loss of information that occurs during the correction process, an additional branch is designed to provide supplementary knowledge regarding the relationships between other classes.

With the global population of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) falling below 600, innovative conservation strategies are critically needed. Traditional monitoring methods have fallen short in accuracy and efficiency, leading to a shift towards leveraging big data and artificial intelligence for effective wildlife surveillance. Existing re-identification techniques struggle with natural habitat challenges like occlusions, changing poses, varying light, and limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose the pose-guided dual branch re-identification network (PDBRNet). Our approach integrates pose estimation to guide feature disentanglement and alignment, crucial for accurate re-identification, while an image preprocessing method considering illumination factors mitigates lighting variations' impact on accuracy. Through validation on the occluded and illumination-varying amur tiger (OIAT) dataset, PDBRNet demonstrates exceptional performance. Specifically, in single-camera scenarios, PDBRNet achieves an outstanding mean average precision (mAP) of 79.4, surpassing the performance of PGCFL (51.6) and PPGNet (69.7). Moreover, in cross-camera scenarios, PDBRNet maintains its superiority with a remarkable mAP of 54.0, along with Rank-1 and Rank-5 scores of 97.8 and 98.9, respectively, showcasing its robustness in real-world surveillance applications.

  abstract     = {The super-resolution (SR) task aims to reconstruct high-resolution content from low-resolution images, and its core challenge is to solve the problem of ill-posedness while balancing the fidelity and perceptual quality of the generated images. Although flow-based SR models have made significant progress in modelling high-resolution image distributions, their generated images still have shortcomings in terms of detail representation. To address the issues above, this paper proposes an optimised method that incorporates a conditionally learnt prior (latent module). Specifically, a Dual-Dimensional Feature Co-Enhancement (DFCE) module is developed to perform joint optimisation on the channel and spatial dimensions of the features. The experimental results on the public datasets show that this framework effectively improves the generation quality of images with almost no increase in the amount of computation. Furthermore, this framework can be seamlessly integrated into fixed-scale and arbitrary-scale streaming models without the need to modify their pre-training weights or architecture, which provides efficient and flexible solutions for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) enables secret data embedding within encrypted images while allowing for the lossless recovery of the original image after data extraction. This technique holds significant applications in various domains such as cloud storage and data security. However, many existing RDHEI methods suffer from limited embedding capacity. To address this limitation, we present a novel and high capacity RDHEI algorithm via bit-plane block rearrangement and intra-block compression coding (hereafter BRBCC algorithm). First, the prediction error (PE) image is generated by using a median edge detection predictor, and the high-order zero-valued bit-planes are compressed. The non-zero-valued bit-planes are then separated into non-overlapping blocks that can be classified as all-zero blocks, embeddable blocks, or non-embeddable blocks. These blocks are then sorted and grouped in terms of block type for block coding. Finally, a new intra-block compression coding technique with small coded data for locating block elements is proposed to conduct effective compression and thereby reserve more space for embedding secret data. Experimental results indicate that the embedding rates of the BRBCC algorithm reach 3.9381 and 3.8436 bpp on the public datasets of BOSSbase and BOWS-2, respectively, outperforming some state-of-the-art RDHEI algorithms and exhibiting good application potential.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised anomaly localization aims to identify anomalous regions that deviate from normal sample patterns. Most recent methods perform feature matching or reconstruction for the target sample with pre-trained deep neural networks. However, they still struggle to address challenging anomalies because the deep embeddings stored in the memory bank can be less powerful and informative. Specifically, prior methods often overly rely on the finite resources stored in the memory bank, which leads to low robustness to unseen targets. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace-guided feature reconstruction framework to pursue adaptive feature approximation for anomaly localization. It first learns to construct low-dimensional subspaces from the given nominal samples, and then learns to reconstruct the given deep target embedding by linearly combining the subspace basis vectors using the self-expressive model. Our core is that, despite the limited resources in the memory bank, the out-of-bank features can be alternatively “mimicked” to adaptively model the target. Moreover, we propose a sampling method that leverages the sparsity of subspaces and allows the feature reconstruction to depend only on a small resource subset, contributing to less memory overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach generally achieves state-of-the-art anomaly localization performance.},

In this paper, we present Speech2Face3D, a novel two-stage transfer-learning framework that pretrains on large-scale pseudo-3D facial data derived from 2D videos and subsequently finetunes on smaller yet high-fidelity 3D datasets. This design leverages the richness of easily accessible 2D resources while mitigating reconstruction noise through a simple temporal smoothing step. Our approach further introduces a Multi-Scale Hierarchical Audio Encoder to capture subtle phoneme transitions, mid-range prosody, and longer-range emotional cues. Extensive experiments on public 3D benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on lip synchronization, expression fidelity, and temporal coherence metrics.

For this goal, we propose A 2 TNet, an attention augmentation-based transformer network, wherein the attention augmentation is achieved via combining the spatial attention and channel attention together. Meanwhile, a shifted window mechanism is introduced to further reduce the calculation complexity of the proposed attention module.

Additionally, we integrate modules inspired by residual networks into the neck structure, improving training adaptability and ensuring robust information transmission. This design highlights key target features while minimising feature attenuation. We also establish the satellite key element (SAKE) dataset under simulated real space conditions, including image noise and jitter blur. This dataset features components such as satellite bodies and solar panels and uses an encoder–decoder network architecture to refine context information. By merging this with a branch preserving high-resolution details, we enhance dataset expressiveness. Experiments demonstrate that the enhanced algorithm achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 78.98% on the SAKE dataset, a 2.57% improvement over the original YOLOv8.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) for medical image segmentation poses critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, limited access to labelled annotations, and stringent privacy constraints across institutions. To address these, we propose FUSION (Federated Unified Semi-Supervised Optimisation Network), a novel dual-path training framework that integrates both Federated Labelled Data Learning (FLDL) and Federated Unlabelled Data Training (FUDT). Central to FUSION is a two-stage pseudo-label refinement strategy designed to ensure robustness under real-world federated constraints. First, synthetic label denoising is performed using Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation, enabling clients to identify and exclude low-confidence predictions. Second, prototype-based correction is applied to further refine pseudo-labels by aligning them with class-specific feature centroids, mitigating errors caused by domain shifts and inter-client variability. These refined labels are used for localised training on unlabelled clients, while a dynamic aggregation scheme modulated by a reliability-based hyperparameter μ adjusts the influence of labelled versus unlabelled clients during global model updates. This tightly coupled interaction between pseudo-label quality and federated optimisation ensures stability, accelerates convergence, and enhances generalisation across heterogeneous clients. FUSION is evaluated on three diverse datasets: TCGA-LGG (brain MRI), Kvasir-SEG (colonoscopy), and UDIAT (ultrasound) and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL models in Dice, IoU, HD95, and ASD metrics. Results confirm the critical role of synthetic label refinement in enhancing segmentation accuracy, boundary precision, and model scalability. FUSION provides a technically grounded, privacy-preserving, and label-efficient solution for real-world multi-institutional medical image segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection is critical to improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a widely used imaging modality for identifying lung tumours. However, limitations in imaging resolution and the complexity of cancer characteristics make detecting small lesions particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine detection framework to reduce missed diagnoses of small lung lesions in PET/CT images. Our method integrates a stacked detection structure with a multi-attention guidance mechanism, effectively leveraging spatial and contextual information from small lesions to enhance lesion localisation. Experimental evaluations on a PET/CT dataset of 225 patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving remarkable results with a precision of 81.74%, a recall of 76.64%, and an mAP of 84.72%. The proposed framework not only improves the detection accuracy of small target lesions in the lung but also provides a more reliable solution for early diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks deployed on UAVs have made significant progress in data acquisition in recent years. However, traditional algorithms and deep learning models still face challenges in small and unevenly distributed object detection tasks. To address this problem, we propose the MCD-YOLOv10n model by introducing the MEMAttention module, which combines EMAttention with multiscale convolution, uses Softmax and AdaptiveAvgPool2d to adaptively compute feature weights, dynamically adjusts the region of interest, and captures cross-scale features. In addition, the C2f_MEMAttention and C2f_DSConv modules are formed by the fusion of C2f with MEMAttention and DSConv, which enhances the model's ability of extracting and adapting to irregular target features. Experiments on three datasets, VisDrone-DET2019, Exdark and DOTA-v1.5, show that the evaluation metric mAP50 achieves the best detection accuracy of 32.9%, 52.9% and 68.2% when the number of holdout parameters is at the minimum value of 2.24M. Moreover, the mAP50-95 metrics (19.5% for VisDrone-DET2019 and 45.0% for DOTA-v1.5) are 1.1 and 1.2 percentage points ahead of the second place, respectively. In terms of Recall, the VisDrone-DET2019 and DOTA-v1.5 datasets improved by 1.0% and 0.7% over the baseline model. These results validate that MCD-YOLOv10n has strong adaptability and generalization ability for small object detection in complex scenes.},

  abstract     = {Transforming fashion design sketches into realistic garments remains a challenging task due to the reliance on labor-intensive manual workflows that limit efficiency and scalability in traditional fashion pipelines. While recent advances in image generation and virtual try-on technologies have introduced partial automation, existing methods still lack controllability and struggle to maintain semantic consistency in garment pose and structure, restricting their applicability in real-world design scenarios. In this work, we present CG-VTON, a controllable virtual try-on framework designed to generate high-quality try-on images directly from clothing design sketches. The model integrates multi-modal conditional inputs, including dense human pose maps and textual garment descriptions, to guide the generation process. A novel pose constraint module is introduced to enhance garment-body alignment, while a structured diffusion-based pipeline performs progressive generation through latent denoising and global-context refinement. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CG-VTON significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, pose consistency, and computational efficiency. By enabling high-fidelity and controllable try-on results from abstract sketches, CG-VTON offers a practical and robust solution for bridging the gap between conceptual design and realistic garment visualization.},

  abstract     = {The exponential growth of imaging technology has led to a surge in visual content creation, necessitating advanced image denoising algorithms. Conventional methods, which frequently rely on predefined rules and filters, are inadequate for managing intricate noise patterns while maintaining image features. In order to tackle the issue of real-world image denoising, we investigate and integrate a new novel technique named recursive context fusion network (RCFNet) employing a deep convolutional neural network, demonstrating superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. RCFNet consists of a coarse feature extraction module and a reconstruction unit, where the former provides a broad contextual understanding and the latter refines the denoising output by preserving spatial and contextual details. Deep CNN learns features instead of using conventional methods, allowing us to improve and refine images. Dual attention units (DUs), in conjunction with the multi-scale resizing Block (MSRB) and selective kernel feature fusion (SKFF), are incorporated into the network to ensure efficient and reliable feature extraction. To demonstrate the advantages and challenges of combining many configurations into a single pipeline, we take a more detailed look at the results. By leveraging the complementary properties of these networks and computational models, we prefer to contribute to the creation of techniques that enhance image restoration while preserving crucial information, therefore encouraging further research and applications in image processing and artificial intelligence. The RCFNet achieves a high structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.98 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 43.4 dB, outperforming many state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets (DND and SIDD) and demonstrating its superior real-world image denoising ability.},

Rough set theory is a set of theories that study the representation, learning, and induction of incomplete data imprecise knowledge, and so on. Rough set theory has good applicability in image segmentation because of its good ability to deal with vague and uncertain problems and its characteristics of fast convergence and avoiding local minima in solving optimization problems. The main content of this paper is to review the existing methods for image segmentation based on rough sets, categorize them, and describe the main ideas, advantages, disadvantages, and conditions of use of each method. Some of the methods for image segmentation based on rough sets utilize only rough sets, but most of them combine rough sets with other theories or methods. Therefore, this paper classifies existing methods for image segmentation based on rough sets according to whether they combine with other theories or methods, and what kind of theories or methods they combine with. This paper also provides an outlook on the development trends of the methods for image segmentation based on rough sets.

Therefore, the recognition of swimming postures is considered as an important section the coaches implement training plans. Usually, the recognition of swimming postures is achieved through coach observation; however, this approach is inefficient and lacks sufficient accuracy. To address this issue, a novel recognition method is proposed. In the proposed method, different swimming postures are assigned a different score via using a two-stage scoring mechanism. The feature regions of swimming postures can be accurately identified. Following that, the assigned score is put into the Softmax layer of the proposed convolutional neural networks. Finally, 4000 images including six swimming postures are used as an experimental set. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 92.73% testing accuracy and 89.03% validation accuracy in the recognition of the six swimming postures, defeating against the opponents. Meanwhile, our method outperforms some competitors in terms of training efficiency. The proposed two-stage scoring mechanism can be used for image recognition in large-scale scenarios. Moreover, the two-stage scoring mechanism is independently of specific scenarios in process of assigning a score value for feature regions of images. Not only that, the two-stage scoring mechanism can replace complex network structures, so as to reduce the work of training parameters.},

  abstract     = {Accurate land cover classification of urban aerial imagery presents significant challenges, particularly in recognising small objects and similar-appearing features (e.g., flat land, prepared land for cultivation, crop growing areas and built-up regions along with ground water resource areas). These challenges arise due to the irregular scaling of extracted features at various rates from complex urban scenes and the mismatch in feature information flow across channels, ultimately affecting the overall accuracy (OA) of the network. To address these issues, we propose the scale-wise interaction fusion network (SIFN) for land cover classification of urban scene imagery. The SIFN comprises four key modules: multi-scale feature extraction, scale-wise interaction, feature shuffle-fusion and adaptive mask generation. The multi-scale feature extraction module captures contextual information across different dilation rates of convolutional layers, effectively handling varying object sizes. The scale-wise interaction module enhances the learning of multi-scale contextual features, while the feature shuffle-fusion module facilitates cross-scale information exchange, improving feature representation. Lastly, adaptive mask generation ensures precise boundary delineation and reduces misclassification in transitional zones. The proposed network significantly improves boundary masking accuracy for small and similar objects, thereby enhancing the overall land cover classification performance.},

In this research, we propose an image compression algorithm tailored for UAV communication, termed region of interest extraction for UAV communication (ROIE-UC). First, image pixels are clustered into super pixel blocks using the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC). Second, these super pixels are grouped into regions of interest (ROI) using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The image is then segmented into ROI and non-ROI areas based on these clusters. Lossless compression is applied to the ROI, while lossy compression with a high ratio is used for non-ROI regions. At the receiving end, the image is decompressed and reconstructed. Experiments show ROIE-UC gets a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 46.37 dB and an feature similarity index (FSIM) of 99.99% for ROI. It outperforms JPEG in PSNR (up to 28.52% improvement), FSIM (0.15% improvement), and compression ratio. When PSNR and FSIM are similar, its max compression ratio is 5.89 times that of JPEG. It also has up to 51.49% higher PSNR than other methods. ROIE-UC is an effective solution for UAV image processing and data compression.},

Existing methods predict the homography matrix either indirectly by evaluating the 4-key-point coordinate deviation in paired images with the same visual content or directly by fine-tuning the 8 degrees of freedom numerical values that define the matrix. However, these approaches often fail to effectively incorporate coordinate positional information and overlook optimal application scenarios, leading to significant accuracy bottlenecks, particularly for paired images with differing visual content. To address these issues, we propose an approach that integrates both methods in a staged manner, leveraging their respective advantages. In the first stage, positional information is embedded to enhance convolutional computations, replacing serial concatenation in traditional feature fusion with parallel concatenation, while using 4-key-point coordinate deviation to predict the macroscopic homography matrix. In the second stage, positional information is further integrated into the input images to refine the direct 8 degrees of freedom numerical predictions, improving matrix fine-tuning accuracy. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, yielding a root mean square error as low as 1.25 and an average corner errror as low as 14.1 in homography transformation of competitive sports image pairs.},

The model improves the performance through the following improvements: first, the SPD-Conv module is introduced to replace the traditional convolution in the backbone and neck sections to reduce the information loss caused by excessive down-sampling, thus enhancing the detection of small targets. Second, the neck section C2f-EMA module is introduced, in which the efficient multiscale attention module (EMA) enhances feature extraction by redistributing weights and prioritizing relevant features to improve the perception and recognition of small target defects (hot spots). Finally, we add a small target detection layer and increase the MultiSEAM detection header, so that the model can capture and detect small targets more efficiently at the output stage. The experimental results show that the mAP of the improved model reaches 93.8%, among which the mAP of small target defects reaches 83%, which is an improvement of 2.23% and 7.62% compared with YOLOv8. In addition, compared with the mainstream models (RT-DETR, YOLOv9s, YOLOv10n, and YOLOv11), the detection accuracies in terms of overall and small-target defects are significantly improved, which further validates the effectiveness of the model.},

  abstract     = {Deepfake, as a popular form of visual forgery technique on the Internet, poses a serious threat to individuals' data privacy and security. In consumer electronics, fraudulent schemes leveraging Deepfake technology are widespread, making it urgent to safeguard users' data privacy and security. However, many Deepfake detection methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to achieve satisfactory performance on mainstream datasets, especially with heavily compressed images. Observing that tampered images leave traces in the frequency domain, which are imperceptible to the naked eye but detectable through spectrum analysis, this study proposes a novel face forgery detection framework integrating spatial and frequency domain features. The framework introduces three innovative modules: the cross-attention fusion module (CAFM), the guided attention module (GAM), and the multi-scale feature fusion module (MSFFM), Specifically, CAFM combines spatial and frequency-domain features through cross-attention to enhance feature interaction. GAM generates attention maps to refine the integration of spatial and frequency features, while MSFFM fuses multi-scale hierarchical features to capture both global and local tampering artifacts. These modules collectively improve the richness and discrimination of the extracted features, contributing to the overall detection performance. The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority in forgery detection tasks, achieving a 3.9% average improvement in AUC compared to the state-of-the-art method GocNet [1] on FaceForensics++ (FF++) and WildDeepfake datasets. Extensive experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose MBSM-Net, a new multi-branch structure-enhanced model for pneumoconiosis screening and grading based on X-ray images. MBSM-Net introduces an adaptive feature selection and fusion module to achieve synchronous extraction and hierarchical fusion of global and local features. In the local feature extraction module, we designed a CNN-Mamba module. This module integrates prior information through a detailed enhancement module to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional convolutions and significantly enhances the expression of subtle lesion information. Meanwhile, the Mamba module simulates pixel-level long-range dependencies to extract finer-grained texture features. In the global feature extraction module, we cleverly utilize the windowed multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) mechanism, enabling the model to better understand the overall distribution and degree of fibrosis of pulmonary lesions. We validated the MBSM-Net model on 1,760 real anonymized patient X-ray chest films. The results showed that the accuracy of the MBSM-Net model reached 78.6%, and the F 1 score reached 79%, both of which are superior to existing models.},

  abstract     = {Images captured with poor hardware and insufficient light sources suffer from visual degradation such as low visibility, strong noise, and color casts. Low-light image enhancement methods focus on solving the problem of brightness in dark areas while eliminating the degradation of low-light images. To solve the above problems, we proposed a hybrid CNN-transformer multi information fusion network (HCTMIF) for low-light image enhancement. In this paper, the proposed network architecture is divided into three stages to progressively improve the degraded features of low-light images using the divide-and-conquer principle. First, both the first stage and the second stage adopt the encoder–decoder architecture composed of transformer and CNN to improve the long-distance modeling and local feature extraction capabilities of the network. We add a visual enhancement module (VEM) to the encoding block to further strengthen the network's ability to learn global and local information. In addition, the multi-information fusion block (MIFB) is used to complement the feature maps corresponding to the same scale of the coding block and decoding block of each layer. Second, to improve the mobility of useful information across stages, we designed the self-supervised module (SSM) to readjust the weight parameters to enhance the characterization of local features. Finally, to retain the spatial details of the enhanced images more precisely, we design the detail supplement unit (DSU) to enrich the saturation of the enhanced images. After qualitative and quantitative analyses on multiple benchmark datasets, our method outperforms other methods in terms of visual effects and metric scores.},

The impact of malignant perturbations on deep learning-based systems, especially in safety-critical applications, highlights a significant security concern. While most research has focused on artificially generated adversarial attacks–crafted through optimization algorithms and constrained perturbations, it is important to note that adversarial examples can also occur naturally, without any artificial manipulation, during the prediction of real-world images. These naturally occurring adversarial examples pose unique challenges, as they are harder to detect and interpret. Despite their importance, the study of natural adversarial examples remains in its early stages. Fundamental questions remain unanswered: Do natural adversarial examples exhibit similar behaviours or properties as artificially generated ones? How should models be adapted to improve their robustness against such natural inputs? To address these questions, this work proposes an in-depth analysis of activation maps to compare the internal behaviour of neural networks when processing clean images, artificially perturbed inputs and natural adversarial examples. A set of quantitative metrics is extracted from activation heatmaps at various network layers, including mean activation intensity, centroid displacement and standard reference image quality metrics. These measurements enable a systematic comparison of how the network attends to different image regions under varying conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that natural adversarial examples exhibit statistically significant differences in activation patterns compared to their artificial counterparts, suggesting that they may require distinct strategies for detection and defence.},

However, dynamic image rendering often suffers from significant noise, which compromises clarity and realism. Dynamic-Neural Radiance Fields (D-NeRF), an extension of the original NeRF model, addresses this challenge by enabling the rendering of dynamic images. Despite its advantages, D-NeRF often generates significant noise in the rendered images. Addressing this limitation, this paper proposes a Transformer-based model, Multi-Scale Attention Fusion Denoise Transformer (MSAF-DT), designed to enhance the clarity of rendered images. MSAF-DT constructs a deep neural network by stacking multiple Transformer blocks, with each block adaptively extracting complex features and dependencies from the data. The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism effectively captures long-range dependencies, which is crucial for processing sequences in dynamic radiance fields. Additionally, the model supports parallel processing of the entire sequence, significantly enhancing training efficiency. This design enables MSAF-DT to handle the noise present in D-NeRF outputs while preserving essential features. Experimental results on the Nerf_Synthetic dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms D-NeRF in both image clarity and processing efficiency, achieving higher PSNR scores and faster convergence during training.},

Traditional object detection in UAV images is particularly challenging due to the high altitude of the cameras, which results in small object sizes and varying viewing angles. To address these challenges, the algorithm incorporates an additional prediction head to detect objects across a wide range of scales, a channel feature fusion with involution (CFFI) block to minimize information loss, a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to highlight the crucial spatial and channel features, and a C3 structure with a Transformer block (C3TR) to capture contextual information. The algorithm additionally employs soft non-maximum suppression to enhance the bounding box scoring of overlapping objects in dense scenes. Extensive experiments were conducted on the VisDrone-DET2019 dataset, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results showed improvements with precision scores of 55.0%, recall scores of 44.6%, mean average precision scores of mAP50 = 50.9% and mAP50:95 = 33.0% on the VisDrone-DET2019 validation set, and precision of 50.8%, recall of 37.3%, mAP50 = 44.2%, and mAP50:95 = 27.3% on the VisDrone-DET2019 testing set.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while popular, often miss critical hierarchical and spatial structures essential for accurate diagnosis. Capsule networks (CapsNets) address some of these issues but struggle with extracting information from complex datasets. We propose the Expanded Attention and Contraction Enhanced Capsule Network with Attention (AEC-CapsNet), designed specifically for medical imaging tasks. AEC-CapsNet leverages attention mechanisms for improved feature representation and expansion-contraction modules for efficient management of global and local features, enabling superior feature extraction.

Additionally, on the general CIFAR-10 dataset, it achieves 83.48% accuracy, demonstrating robustness and generalisability. To ensure a comprehensive complete assessment, we applied cross-validation for each experiment, which allowed us to evaluate the model's stability and performance across different training datasets. The model was trained for multiple epochs (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 epochs) to examine its learning and convergence patterns.

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in image denoising. However, the complexity of advanced methods' systems is also increasing, which will increase the calculation cost and hinder the convenient analysis and comparison of methods. Therefore, a lightweight model based on invertible networks is proposed. The invertible network has great advantages in image denoising. It is lightweight, memory-saving, and information-lossless in backpropagation. To effectively remove the noise and restore a clean image, the high-frequency part of the image is resampled and modeled to remove the impact of noise better. The channel context block is proposed to better focus on useful channels and improve the network's perception of useful information in images while ensuring the complexity and computing cost. At the same time, the residual structure with channel correlation modeling is used to extract the features in the convolutional flow, to effectively retain the details and texture of the image, and learn more details of the spatial features of the image, so as to prevent the blur and distortion of the image in the denoising process. The proposed method allows the model to enjoy lower computational complexity on the premise of ensuring performance.},

  abstract     = {One of the major challenges in medical image registration is balancing computational efficiency with the ability to capture large deformations in complex anatomical structures. Existing methods often struggle with high computational costs due to the need for extensive feature extraction and attention computations at various levels of the network. Moreover, some methods do not take into account the spatial relationships of the feature images during registration, and the loss of these spatial relationships leads to suboptimal results for these methods. To this end, we introduce a novel medical image registration network, PSMamba-Net, which leverages optimized iteration and the Mamba framework within a dual-stream pyramid architecture. The network reduces the computational burden by narrowing attention computations at each decoding level, while an optimized iterative registration module at the bottom of the pyramid captures large deformations. This approach eliminates the need for repeated feature extraction, significantly accelerating the registration process. Additionally, the SMB module is incorporated as a decoder to enhance spatial relationship modelling and leverage Mamba's strengths in long-sequence processing. PSMamba-Net balances efficiency and accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods across LPBA40, Mindboggle, and Abdomen CT datasets.

While many existing deep learning-based image quality enhancement algorithms require low- and high-quality image pairs for training, such pairs are often difficult to obtain in practice. On the other hand, unpaired image enhancement algorithms tend to struggle in preserving small structures and suppressing artefacts, which are crucial for medical applications. To address these issues, we propose an unpaired structure-preserving cycle quality alternating network for low-quality fundus image enhancement. Our method consists of three main components: (1) a cycle quality alternating framework to provide pixel-wise supervision for unpaired image enhancement, (2) a quality-aware disentangle module to enhance the extrinsic representation of the low-quality image with the high-quality reference image, and (3) an instance normalized skip to improve the network's structure-preserving capability. We tested our method on both synthetic and authentic clinical images with pathological structures and found it to be superior to state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of improving image quality while preserving delicate structures. Additionally, the proposed network demonstrated strong generalization ability in improving the quality of unseen images, as tested on 135-degree neonatal fundus images.},

Current detection technologies, such as human inspections and PCR-based procedures, are time-consuming and costly, limiting scalability. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet50 and VGG16 have shown promise for automating disease identification, but they struggle with generalization and collecting fine-grained local and global information. In this study, we propose a deep learning solution based on a hierarchical vision transformer (HViT) model to detect poultry diseases from fecal images. We compare the performance of our HViT model with traditional CNNs (ResNet50, VGG16), lightweight architectures (MobileNetV3_Large_100, XceptionNet), and standard vision transformers (ViT) (ViT-B/16). The experimental results demonstrate that our HViT model outperforms other models, achieving an average validation accuracy of 90.90% with a validation loss of 0.2647. The HViT's ability to balance local and global feature recognition highlights its potential as a scalable solution for real-time poultry disease detection. These findings underscore the significance of hierarchical attention in addressing complex image analysis tasks, with implications for broader applications in agriculture and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Shadows are common in many types of images, causing information loss or disturbance. Shadow removal can help improve the quality of the digital image. If there is no effective information available to restore the original image in the shaded area, the interpolation-based inpainting technique can be used to remove the shadow from the digital image. This image inpainting technique typically involves establishing and solving partial differential equations (PDEs), an iterative solving process that is very time-consuming. To solve the time-consuming problem, a method that introduces the fast marching method (FMM) into the vorticity transport equation (VTE) is demonstrated. VTE is a type of partial differential equation describing two-dimensional fluids. FMM is a numerical scheme for tracking the evolution of monotonically advancing interfaces via finite difference solution of the eikonal equation. The proposed method contains three main steps: (a) by investigating the relationship between VTE and the traditional PDE-based image inpainting method, a new image inpainting model using VTE is developed;(b) the area to be inpainted is divided into boundaries that shrink in layers from the outside inwards using FMM; and (c) the VTE image inpainting model is converted into a weighted average form to coordinate with FMM. The visual and quantitative evaluation of the experimental results of shadow removal shows that the proposed method outperforms PDE-based and state-of-the-art methods in terms of shadow-removal effect and running time. The results also show that our method excels at inpainting images with near-smooth textures and simple geometric structures and where the pixels to be inpainted are continuous with neighbouring pixels.},

While adopting the variational auto-encoders (VAEs) to learn disentangled representations holds great promise, these models are prone to suffer from the poor disentanglement capability in complicated datasets, for example, colourful portrait images. These datasets often contain strong correlation among attributes, making it difficult to disentangle them. To alleviate this issue, a novel approach named group and individual priors-based VAE (GAIP-VAE) is proposed, which constrains the semantic attributes by customizing prior information to improve the disentanglement capability of the VAE. Specifically, we start from modelling the joint distribution of the observed data, and then derive three compatible loss terms in the objective function. The first one is the reconstruction term, utilizing the Laplace distribution to improve the image quality. The second one is the individual prior regularizer, encouraging the model to learn more interpretable factors via dimensional-level regularizer. The third one is the group prior regularizer, constraining the approximate posterior distribution through multivariate normal distribution with the tailored correlation. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that GAIP-VAE can achieve a great balance between image quality and disentanglement capability.},

In this work, we make three key contributions to address these challenges.

Experimental results on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACDR-CRAFF consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy and setting a new benchmark for complex remote sensing scene classification tasks.

Achieving a robust object detection network under all weather conditions (e.g., sunny, fog, nighttime, rain and snow) is highly significant for autonomous driving systems, which ensure safety by recognising pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights, etc. This paper proposes a robust multi-object detection network named All Weather-You Only Look Once (AW-YOLO) based on YOLOv8, with a trade-off between precision and lightweightness. Considering the blurring or absence of the salient object features of the image under all weather conditions, we propose a developed dilation-wise residual (D-DWR) module. Specifically, it combines the dilatation-wise residual module with the dilated re-param block using a large kernel convolution to see wide without going deep, greatly improving the feature extraction ability. Moreover, we introduce an efficient dynamic upsampler (DySample) that formulates upsampling from the viewpoint of point sampling and avoids dynamic convolution, which can improve the network's ability to feature fusion. Lightweight is an essential requirement for autonomous driving. To this end, we adopt a multi-scale shared detection head (MSSD-Head) to achieve lightweight deployment in autonomous vehicles. Experimental results show that the mAP50-95 values of AW-YOLO on the KITTI and Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC) datasets exceed the baseline model YOLOv8 by 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the parameters and model size of AW-YOLO have decreased by 21.4% and 20.4%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {As the volume of digital data increases, there is an increasing need for effective compression methods to address storage demands. Concurrently, the importance of robust image watermarking for authentication and ownership verification cannot be overstated. This work tackles the dual challenge of optimizing image compression for storage conservation and implementing strong image watermarking for copyright protection. The suggested approach integrates the K-means clustering compression algorithm to enhance storage efficiency along with a resilient image watermarking technique based on spatial-domain embedding. We introduce a blind robust watermarking approach that uses zero-frequency coefficient alteration independently in the spatial domain instead of using the discrete cosine transformation (DCT) to verify the ownership of colored images. To enhance the robustness of the system, we have incorporated two watermarks into the cover image. This precaution ensures that even if one watermark undergoes deterioration due to attacks, authentication can still be assured by recovering the other watermark. Compared to frequency-domain approaches, our scheme yields better robustness and reduced computing complexity. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for the test images using our approach is above 39 dB with a compression ratio equal to 5.9978, removing up to 83% of the redundancy of the host image. After comparing our approach with several state-of-the-art methods, its robustness is exposed by the values of normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) close to one and bit error rate (BER) values close to zero. Besides, the scheme is able to embed a total of 8192 watermark bits in the host image of size 512 × 512 × 3. Experimental results affirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, marking it as a valuable contribution to the domains of image processing and information security.},

  abstract     = {As an essential part of traditional Chinese handicrafts, Qinghai embroidery embodies rich cultural connotations and unique artistic value. However, with the development of modern society, traditional handicrafts face severe challenges in inheritance and protection. To effectively address these challenges and promote Qinghai embroidery's digital safety and inheritance, this study realizes the automatic classification and identification of Qinghai embroidery images based on the SE-ResNet152V2 model. First, we constructed an image dataset containing five kinds of Qinghai embroidery patterns, including Tu nationality Pan embroidery, Huangzhong Dui embroidery, Hehuang embroidery, Mongolian embroidery, and Tibetan Guinan embroidery. The regions that contribute the most when the model judges the image categories are revealed by the GRAD-CAM technique, and the data are preprocessed by the image enhancement technique to enhance the data diversity and improve the model's generalization ability. For the complexity and detailed features of Qinghai embroidery patterns, this paper introduces the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention module to enhance the model's ability to capture key features. By systematically comparing the effects of multiple optimizers and attention mechanisms combination models, the optimal combination of the Nadam optimizer and SE attention mechanism is finally selected. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the optimized SE-ResNet152V2 model on the self-built Qinghai embroidery image dataset is 91.73%, which is 11.43% higher than that of the original ResNet152V2 model. Further experiments show that the SE-ResNet152V2 model is better than other popular neural network models such as MobileNetV1, EfficientNetB2, vision transformer (VIT), and swin transformer, regarding classification accuracy. It has proven its effectiveness and superiority in processing Qinghai embroidery pattern recognition tasks and provided strong technical support for digital protection and inheritance of traditional crafts.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models require large training datasets. Incorporating additional data into small training datasets can enhance the model's performance. However, acquiring additional data may sometimes be challenging or beyond one's control. In such situations, data augmentation becomes essential to overcome the limited supply of labeled data by generating new data that preserves the essential properties of the original dataset. The primary objective of our research is to develop an iterative data distillation and augmentation (IDDA) method that enlarges the size of a limited image training dataset while preserving its properties. At every iteration, our method distills a set of images from the training set of the previous iteration utilizing the kernel inducing point (KIP) method, and the union of the training and distilled sets creates the new training set. However, our experiments show that IDDA is computationally expensive, increasing processing time by approximately 17%–27 for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, 31%–39 for CIFAR-10, and up to 48%–49 for CIFAR-100 compared to state-of-the-art augmentation methods, due to the additional step of applying KIP for image distillation. We have experimentally determined that for a few iterations the classification accuracy increases and then drops afterward. We validate the IDDA capabilities by comparing it with conventional augmenting methods and MixUp on the following publicly available image datasets: MNIST digit, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Our approach proves highly effective for very limited datasets, addressing the challenge of database expansion for improved performance of deep learning models.},

  abstract     = {The technology for target recognition in remote sensing satellite images is widely applied in daily life, and research on detecting and recognizing targets in remote sensing images holds significant academic and practical importance. To address the challenges of extreme scale variations, dense target distributions, and low-resolution artefacts in remote sensing images, this paper proposes a new multi-object detection network based on the YOLOv8 architecture—MD-YOLOv8. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) the design of the multi-frequency attention downsampling module, which integrates the ADown module with Haar wavelet transforms and pixel attention; (2) the proposal of the adaptive attention network (DMAA) module, an enhanced multiscale feature extractor based on the multiscale feature extraction attention mechanism; (3) the integration of both modules into the YOLOv8 backbone to achieve superior performance in remote sensing image detection. Based on the DOTA-1.0 dataset for training, experimental results show that the MD-YOLOv8 network achieves improvements in precision, recall rate, and mAP@0.5, reaching 82.69%, 78.28%, and 82.05%, respectively; these represent increases of 3.76%, 3.43%, and 4.37% compared to the original model. In practical image detection, MD-YOLOv8 demonstrates higher recognition quality and can flexibly respond to various target types. The MD-YOLOv8 network effectively meets the accuracy requirements for target detection in remote sensing satellite images.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, image restoration has witnessed remarkable advancements. However, reconstructing visually plausible textures while preserving global structural coherence remains a persistent challenge. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches are inherently limited by their local receptive fields, often struggling to capture global structure. Previously proposed methods mostly focus on structural priors to address the limitation of CNN's receptive field, but we believe that texture priors are also critical factors that influence the quality of image inpainting. To tackle semantic inconsistency and texture blurriness in current methods, we introduce a novel multi-stage restoration framework. Specifically, our architecture incorporates a dual-stream U-Net with attention mechanisms to extract multi-scale features. The mixed attention-gated feature fusion module exchanges and combines structure and texture features to generate multi-scale fused feature maps, which are progressively merged into the decoder to guide the Transformer to generate more realistic images. Additionally, we propose a feature selection feedforward network to replace traditional MLPs in Transformer blocks for adaptive feature refinement. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ and Paris StreetView datasets demonstrate superior performance both qualitatively and quantitatively compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose PartConverter, a novel part-oriented point cloud transformation framework emphasizing flexibility and precision in 3D model transformations. PartConverter leverages attention mechanisms and autoencoders to capture crucial details within each part while modeling the relationships between components, thereby enabling highly customizable, part-wise transformations that maintain overall consistency.

To address these two issues, we propose a semi-supervised ICH segmentation model and a dedicated ICH segmentation backbone network. Our approach aims at leveraging semi-supervised modelling so as to alleviate the challenge of limited labelled data availability, while the dedicated ICH segmentation backbone network further enhances the segmentation precision. An augmented multiple perturbation dual mean teacher model is designed. Based on it, the prediction accuracy may be improved by a more stringent confidence-weighted cross-entropy (CW-CE) loss, and the feature perturbation may be increased using adversarial feature perturbation for the purpose of improving the generalization ability and efficiency of consistent learning. In the ICH segmentation backbone network, we promote the segmentation accuracy by extracting both local and global features of ICH and fusing them in depth. We also fuse the features with rich details from the upper encoder during the up-sampling process to reduce the loss of feature information. Experiments on our private dataset ICHDS, and the public dataset IN22SD demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art ICH segmentation models, achieving a maximum improvement of over 10% in Dice and exhibiting the best overall performance.},

However, conventional imaging captures only 2D spatial information, which limits the realism of VR content. Advanced technologies like light field (LF) imaging can overcome this limitation by capturing both 2D spatial and 2D angular information in 4D LF images. This paper proposes a depth reconstruction model through LF imaging to aid in creating realistic VR content. Comprehensive calibrations are performed, including adjustments for camera parameters, depth calibration, and field of view (FOV) estimation. Aberration corrections, like distortion and vignetting effect correction, are conducted to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. To achieve realistic scene reconstruction, experiments were conducted by setting up a scenario with multiple objects positioned at three different depths. Quality assessments were carried out to evaluate the reconstruction quality across these varying depths. The results demonstrate that depth reconstruction quality improves with the proposed method. It also indicates that the model reduces LF image size and processing time. The depth images reconstructed by the proposed model have the potential to generate realistic VR content and can also facilitate the integration of refocusing capabilities within VR environments.},

A self-supervised rotation prediction task enables SSL-MCE to focus on intrinsic data structures rather than domain-specific details, learning robust domain-invariant features. To mitigate class imbalance, we incorporate adaptive focal attention loss (AFAL), which dynamically emphasizes challenging and rare instances, ensuring improved accuracy on difficult samples. Furthermore, SSL-MCE adopts a dynamic loss-based weighting scheme to prioritize more reliable classifiers in the final prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets, including PACS and DomainNet, indicate that SSL-MCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior generalization and resource efficiency through its streamlined ensemble framework.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic adversarial domain adaptation model based on Wasserstein distance (EMD_DAAN). The EMD_DAAN model enhances the existing dynamic adversarial domain adaptation framework by incorporating an adaptive layer, further aligning the feature distributions between the source and target domain datasets. The Wasserstein distance is employed to optimize this adaptive layer, minimizing the distributional discrepancy between the feature spaces of the two domains by constructing the least-cost transport path. This approach improves the model's cross-domain generalization ability and robustness to noise interference. Through dual feature alignment via the adaptive layer and adversarial learning, the model's classification performance on breast ultrasound images is significantly enhanced. Experimental results demonstrate that the EMD_DAAN model achieves an accuracy of 82.75% on breast ultrasound images, substantially outperforming typical adversarial domain adaptation models such as DAAN in terms of classification performance.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of modern camera technology, the resolution and quality of images have been significantly improved. High-resolution images can provide more detailed and clearer information, but they may also introduce more noise, which interferes with the detection and localization of salient objects. To address this issue, existing high-resolution salient object detection methods either design complex network structures or adopt multi-modal fusion. However, these approaches often consume significant computing and storage resources. This leads to redundancy of irrelevant features and loss of critical details. In this paper, we propose a network called bidirectionally guided multi-scale feature decoding network for high-resolution salient object detection. The model incorporates a bidirectional guidance method to explore the complementarity between encoding and decoding features, thereby achieving a comprehensive combination and enhancement of features. Additionally, in the decoder, multi-scale encoding features are obtained and utilized sequentially to enhance feature learning and improve the accuracy of salient object detection. Specifically, our model consists of an encoder, a guided multi-scale feature enhancement (GMFE) module, a guided feature fusion (GFF) module, and a multi-scale feature decoder (MFD) module. First, multi-scale encoding features are extracted through the encoder. These features are then fed into the GMFE module to enhance the multi-scale encoding features under the guidance of saliency map derived from the decoding features of the previous layer. Subsequently, in the GFF module, the enhanced encoding features are fused with the decoding features from the previous layer. Finally, in the MFD module, the bidirectionally guided multi-scale encoding features is integrated to generate an accurate saliency map. Experiments on two high-resolution and two low-resolution datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms on high-resolution datasets while maintaining competitive performance on low-resolution datasets, underscoring its effectiveness across varying image qualities.},

  abstract     = {In the metaverse, video text retrieval is an urgent and challenging need for users in social entertainment. The current attention-based video text retrieval models have not fully explored the interaction between video and text, and only brute force feature embedding. Moreover, Due to the unsupervised nature of attention weight training, existing models have weak generalization performance for dataset bias. Essentially, the model learns that false relevant information in the data is caused by confounding factors. Therefore, this article proposes a video text retrieval method based on causal attention transformer. Assuming that the confounding factors affecting the performance of video text retrieval all come from the dataset, a structural causal model that conforms to the video text retrieval task is constructed, and the impact of confounding effects during data training is reduced by adjusting the front door. In addition, we use causal attention transformer to construct a causal inference network to extract causal features between video text pairs, and replace the similarity statistical probability with causal probability in the video text retrieval framework. Experiments are conducted on the MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC datasets, which proves the effectiveness of the retrieval model proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Automated detection of gastric polyps has been proven crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy. However, when there is a domain shift in the data, deep learning-based detection methods may not perform well. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been demonstrated as a good approach to address this issue. However, existing unsupervised domain adaptation detection methods struggle to handle the problem of foreground–background similarity and the diverse appearances of polyps at different scales in gastric polyp images. In this paper, we propose a boundary-guided transferable attention module and a transferable prototype alignment module to address the foreground–background similarity issue, and a multi-scale enhanced alignment method to tackle the problem of information loss when aligning polyps at multiple scales. The boundary-guided transferable attention module fully explores spatial information of the image with a boundary-guided multi-field attention mechanism while considering the transferability of features to mine the easily transferable foreground regions. The transferable prototype alignment module adopts a prototype-based method to facilitate the transfer of difficult-to-align regions. The multi-scale enhanced alignment method prevents information loss across feature maps and scales with an attention filtering module, enhancing features at each scale. In experiments, this work outperforms advanced domain adaptation detection methods like SIGMA and CAT in polyp detection.},

This paper proposes a quantum long short - term memory (QLSTM)-based quantum image encryption method to enhance chaotic sequences and achieve chaos synchronisation control. The QLSTM network improves the Lorenz chaotic sequence, increasing its unpredictability. An adaptive synchronisation control algorithm, using the enhanced chaotic sequence from QLSTM, ensures sender-receiver synchronization. Optimised through deep neural networks, the system maintains stable synchronization under interference. New cryptographic quantum infrastructure (NCQI) was constructed, and images were encrypted using third-order radial diffusion, quantum generalised Arnold transform, and quantum W transform. The QLSTM-improved chaotic sequence showed excellent LLE and 0–1 test results. Information entropy was near 8, with R, G and B channels exceeding 7.999. Anti-attack analysis revealed high information entropy, strong attack resistance, and number of pixels change rate/unified average changing intensity (NPCR/UACI) values of 99.698% and 33.460%, respectively, indicating significant pixel-level changes. Combining quantum chaotic system prediction with the QLSTM model enhanced quantum communication stability and anti-interference ability. This QLSTM-based quantum encryption method, with chaos synchronisation control, significantly improves encryption security and reliability, maintaining high information entropy and complexity under attacks, proving its effectiveness in image encryption.},

The C2f module in YOLOv8's backbone is enhanced by incorporating DCNv2, which improves the model's ability to handle irregular shapes and geometric transformations during feature extraction. An auxiliary training head (Aux Head) is added to capture multi-scale and multi-level features, significantly boosting small defect detection. Additionally, the traditional CIoU loss function is replaced with the Wise-SIoU loss, accelerating convergence and enhancing both detection and regression accuracy. Experimental results on the Alibaba Tianchi aluminum surface defect dataset show that DAS-YOLO achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.3%. Compared to YOLOv8n, mAP50 improves by 3%, while precision and recall increase by 1.1% and 4.6%, respectively. Furthermore, to validate the model's performance on small defects and its generalization ability, it achieves a detection accuracy of 94.8% on the PCB dataset, with an mAP increase of 3.1% compared to YOLOv8n.

  abstract     = {The core challenge of fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) tasks is distinguishing highly similar subclasses within the same base category. Most CNN-based deep learning methods typically focus on extracting information from local regions while overlook the inherent structure between subclasses and the complex relationships between features. This paper presents a two-stage feature selection method based on partial order analysis (POA) and heterogeneity evaluation (HE) for FGIR tasks, guiding the model to focus on distinctive features while reducing uncertainty caused by interfering information. Specifically, in the POA stage, clustering first groups similar subcategories into a medium-granularity category. Formal concept analysis then models their hierarchical partial order, identifying “shared features” among subcategories and “exclusive features” unique to each. This structured representation highlights key contrastive cues. In the HE stage, a novel heterogeneity index is introduced to measure the fluctuation of low-level features within each fine-grained category. This index guides the model to suppress pseudo-discriminative features with high heterogeneity, mitigating the impact of noisy and unstable information on decision-making. We perform comprehensive experiments on three commonly used benchmark datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms classic FGIC methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.},

A custom dataset comprising 4260 images was constructed and annotated using a hybrid approach involving edge detection and expert labeling.

The results demonstrate the model's robustness, accuracy, and suitability for complex geological environments.

  abstract     = {Against the backdrop of constantly upgrading maritime security requirements and dynamic marine environments, satellite based ship detection has become a key technology for national maritime surveillance, resource management, and environmental protection. However, existing methods often struggle to address ongoing challenges, including insufficient sensitivity to small vessels and susceptibility to errors or missed detections in complex ocean backgrounds caused by wave reflections, cloud cover, and lighting changes. To address these limitations, this study proposes YOLOv8 ResAttNet, an enhanced model that integrates residual learning and attention mechanisms into the YOLOv8 framework. The core innovation lies in a custom designed backbone network that combines multi-scale feature aggregation with an improved ICBAM attention module to achieve precise localization of ship targets while suppressing irrelevant background noise. This architecture dynamically recalibrates feature channel weights through residual attention blocks, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish subtle ship features (such as hull contours and superstructures) in different maritime scenarios. Extensive experiments on high-resolution HRSID datasets have demonstrated the superiority of this model: the average accuracy (mAP50) of YOLOv8 ResAttNet is 95.2%, which is 4.9% higher than the original YOLOv8 and over 4% higher than state-of-the-art models such as YOLO SENet and YOLO11. These improvements highlight its robustness in handling scale changes and complex background interference. The research results emphasize the effectiveness of combining residual connectivity with attention driven feature refinement for maritime target detection, especially in small target scenes. This work not only advances the technological frontier of remote sensing image analysis, but also provides a scalable framework for real-world applications such as illegal fishing monitoring, maritime traffic management, and disaster response. Future research directions include extending the model to multimodal satellite data fusion, optimizing the computational efficiency of edge device deployment, and further bridging the gap between theoretical innovation and maritime surveillance systems.},

To address this problem, this work proposes dual-path fusion attention-based UNet (DPFA-UNet) that leverages a dual-path attention block (DPA) and a concurrent attention fusion block (CAF) within a U-shaped architecture. Specifically, DPA enhances adaptability to lesions of varying sizes by using multi-scale branches that capture fine details and global features. CAF fuses high- and low-level semantic features using a parallel attention mechanism, effectively focusing on the focal regions. It also incorporates a mask generated by deep supervision mechanism to further guide feature fusion. Additionally, to reduce demand for hardware resources, we incorporate depthwise separable convolution into the model. Experiments are conducted on public BraTS 2021 and BraTS 2019 datasets. The results verify that DPFA-UNet outperforms existing brain tumor segmentation methods, particularly in segmenting TC and ET regions.},

Inspired by the principles of memory function in brain neuroscience, this paper proposes a motion-aware scene generation model named SMG based on motion-aware temporal style modulation (SMG-MATSM), which ensures temporal consistency by redesigning the temporal latent representation and constructing a motion matrix to guide the motion of intermediate latent variables. The motion matrix preserves motion consistency in the scene memory through both the cosine similarity and the Mahalanobis distance of intermediate latent variables of adjacent frames. Additionally, SMG-MATSM uses a style-based approach and enhances conditional features through the motion matrix during the scene memory synthesis process. Experimental results show that SMG-MATSM has better effect of action-enriched scene memory generation, and has varying degrees of efficiency improvement on different datasets with Frechet video distance and Frechet inception distance evaluation metrics.},

In contrast, single-view reconstruction methods are designed to extract certain features of the image even under limited input conditions. However, the majority of current single-view methods demand considerable graphics card performance for rendering at high resolutions and attaining high-fidelity image reconstruction at lower resolutions remains a formidable challenge. To enhance the fidelity of reconstructed images while considering the constraints of graphics card performances, we propose a novel pipeline based on novel-view synthetic (NVS), super-resolution (SR) and 3D-GS, named RSINS-GS. First, we introduce a divide-and-conquer strategy tailored to reap pixel-reinforced novel sequential views to render the reconstruction result without overburdening the graphics card, maintaining optimal performance and visual fidelity. Furthermore, to enhance the high fidelity of reconstructed images both in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures, we integrate 2D prior images with their corresponding geometric structural complements. Additionally, we introduce an innovative, generalised noise-added strategy to refine the overall reconstruction process. Extensive experimental evaluations on Nerf_synthetic datasets and Google scanned datasets show that our method achieves high quality results.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of consumer-level panoramic cameras, panoramic projection is increasingly used in various industries, such as social communication, entertainment, and education. The utilization of image information, particularly in panoramic projection, predominantly depends on image matching. This technology involves extracting key features from images to meet the requirements of subsequent tasks. However, due to the distortion caused by geometric deformation in panoramic projection, traditional planar image matching methods encounter challenges in key point detection, matching accuracy, and pose estimation, often leading to failure or suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, a novel detector-free matching method is proposed. Pano-matching introduces two key innovations: a clustering-based dynamic pruning scheme to accelerate attention convergence by focusing on valid feature pairs, and a redesigned fine-level matching approach that effectively leverages both the central feature vector and its local neighbourhood. These innovations allow pano-matching to handle the distortions in panoramic images and outperform existing convolutional neural network-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that pano-matching achieves state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and feature matching, significantly improving over current panoramic and planar matching methods.},

  abstract     = {The existing image dehazing algorithms perform suboptimal in non-homogeneous and/or dense haze scenarios. The loss of feature information and alteration of color distribution cause images to deviate from real-world scenes when haze suppresses image details. To address these issues, we design a dual-branch non-homogeneous dehazing network integrating discrete wavelet transform (DWT), multi-scale feature fusion, and color constraints to achieve dehazed images with more realistic edges, textures, and colors. Specifically, we first introduce DWT into a multi-scale encoder–decoder network structure to capture more details and edge information. Then, a feature supplement and enhancement module (FSEM) combining features from hazy images at different scales and features from the previous stage is devised to enhance the multi-scale feature capture capability of rich textures in complex scenes. Finally, we propose a pixel-wise color consistency loss that combines pixel similarity and angular difference to constrain the dehazed images to closely match the color distribution of clear images. Experimental results indicate that the proposed dehazing network outperforms the state-of-the-art non-homogeneous dehazing methods on relevant public benchmarks and has more realistic edges, textures, and colors.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a global gaze following method using the patched-based multi-task multi-scale reborn network (MMRGaze360) specifically designed for panorama images. Unlike existing approaches that rely on spherical networks or process only local regions, our architecture thoroughly accounts for the distortions introduced by the sphere-to-plane projection, enabling gaze following in comprehensive 360-degree images. MMRGaze360 incorporates field-of-view (360-FoV) and sight line (360-Gaze) generators to model gaze behaviours and scene information in 360-degree images. A multi-task multi-scale module is introduced to capture features from multiple patches centred around the estimated points located in the 360-Gaze, using multi-scale attention maps. These features, along with the 360-FoV, are fused to produce a final heatmap. Additionally, we employ multi-layer perceptions and convolutional networks using the reborn mechanism to enhance information usage and feature representation. Moreover, we establish a novel dataset, SRGaze360, which contains more conditions of the sphere-to-plane distortion. Experimental results on the GazeFollow360 and SRGaze360 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous works. It can be validated that our approach effectively addresses the limitations of 2D gaze following in handling out-of-frame gaze positions and distortions in 360-degree images.},

This paper presents an unsupervised learning-based exposure control method, providing a novel approach to improving image quality under diverse lighting conditions.

Finally, to enhance global perception and discriminative power, HC attention fuse local and global features which captured by the two ALST.

  abstract     = {Person ReID aims to match images of individuals captured from different camera views for identity retrieval. Traditional ReID methods primarily rely on clothing features, assuming that individuals do not change clothes in a short time frame. This assumption significantly reduces recognition accuracy when clothing changes, particularly in long-term ReID tasks cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). Thus, achieving effective re-identification in clothing-change scenarios has become a critical challenge. This paper proposes an automatic perception model (APM) to address the break posed by clothing changes. The model uses a dual-branch with a dynamic perception learning (DPL) strategy and a perception branch, minimizing the bias introduced by clothing on identity recognition while preserving semantic features. The DPL strategy dynamically adjusts training weights to enhance the model's ability to learn from varying sample difficulties and feature distributions. The perception branch captures deeper feature relationships, alleviating the impact of clothing bias and improving the model's ability to distinguish intra-class transformations. Validated on Celeb-Reid and Celeb-Reid-light datasets, APM achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 22.6% and 25.9%, with Rank-1 accuracy of 77.3% and 79.5%, respectively. It also excels in short-term ReID, achieving 90% mAP and 96.3% Rank-1 accuracy on Markt1501, demonstrating robustness across scenarios.},

The model employs a dual-branch architecture that integrates the strengths of both convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer networks. The proposed high-frequency extraction block (HEB) effectively captures high-frequency information from the enhanced image. Furthermore, a multi-directional attention mechanism is incorporated into the transformer branch to comprehensively learn latent features and details, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. For attention computation, we propose a dynamic parameter-sharing mechanism that adaptively adjusts parameter sharing based on local image features, significantly reducing the model's parameter count. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IEMT achieves superior performance on five benchmark datasets, with a significantly reduced parameter count, computational complexity, and memory usage.},

As a special case of p , q ∈ { 1 , 2 } $p,q\in \lbrace 1,2\rbrace$ , we design an optimization framework to accommodate the combined effect of different noise sources. An initial impulse noise pre-detection phase decouples the raw noisy HSI data into impulse and Gaussian corrupted pixels. Gaussian corrupted pixels are handled by data-fidelity term in while impulse corrupted pixels possess more Laplacian like behavior; modeled using . Solutions of problems involving in data fidelity and regularization terms complicate the optimization process but are less sensitive to the outlier pixels. On the other hand, the least square solutions for the data misfit are computationally efficient but generates solutions which are quite sensitive to the outlier pixels; which is the characteristic of impulse corrupted pixels. Therefore, in this paper, we decouple the set of pixels into two distinct parts; handled using two separate data fidelity terms. Total variation (TV) is used on the Casorati matrix representation of the input data to exploit similarity along both spatial and spectral dimensions. The resulting optimization problem is reformulated as iteratively reweighted least square for the general -norm problem for for data fidelity terms and for the TV regularization term. Experiments conducted over synthetically corrupted HSI data and images obtained from real HSI sensors confirm the suitability of the proposed weighted norm optimization framework (WNOF) over a wide range of degradation scenarios.},

However, in Siamese networks employed for metric learning, individual branches may exhibit discrepancies in their interpretation of semantic information from input data, resulting in semantically inconsistent feature representations. To address this issue, a method is designed to enhance significant region consistency within multi-view spaces by integrating feature consistency enhancement (FCE) and multi-level feature mining (MLFM) techniques into a dual-branch network. The FCE method emphasizes critical components of the input data, ensuring feature consistency between the two branches. Additionally, the MLFM mechanism facilitates feature integration across multiple levels, thereby enabling a more comprehensive extraction of semantic information. This approach enhances semantic understanding and promotes feature consistency across branches. The proposed method achieves AP values of 82.38% for drone-to-satellite and 77.36% for satellite-to-drone image matching. Notably, the method maintains computational efficiency without significantly affecting inference time. Additionally, improvements are observed in R@1, R@5 and R@10 metrics.

This article applies deep learning technology to the field of military aircraft recognition in remote sensing images and proposes a You Only Look Once Version 8 Small (YOLOv8s) remote sensing image military aircraft recognition algorithm based on an attention mechanism—YOLOv8s-TDP (YOLOv8s+TripletAttention+dysample+PIoU). First, the TripletAttention attention module is used in the neck network, which captures cross-dimensional interactions and utilises a three-branch structure to calculate attention weights. This further enhances the network's ability to preserve details and restore colours in the process of image fusion. Secondly, an efficient dynamic upsampler, dysample, is used to achieve dynamic upsampling through point sampling, which improves the problems of detail loss, jagged edges, and image distortion that may occur with nearest neighbour interpolation. Finally, replacing the original model loss function with PIoU (Pixels Intersection over Union), IoU (Intersection over Union) is calculated at the pixel level to more accurately capture small overlapping areas, reduce missed detection rates, and improve accuracy. On the publicly available dataset The Remote Sensing Image Military Aircraft Target Recognition Dataset(MAR20), our proposed YOLOv8s-TDP model achieved a of 82.96%, of 80.71%, of 87.11% and of 65.88%, outperforming the original YOLOv8s model, RT-DETR model, YOLOv5 series model, YOLOv7 series model, and YOLOv11 series model.

Then, candidate adaptive dynamic range compression coefficients are determined based on the extracted detail layers, and the optimal adaptive dynamic range compression parameters are selected based on the high gradient proportion of the detail regions. Simulation experiments are conducted on multiple panchromatic remote sensing images with different scenes using the proposed method, and the effects of various dynamic range compression methods are evaluated based on multiple metrics. The results indicate that the proposed dynamic range compression method demonstrates excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {As a popular task in drone-captured scenes, object detection involves images with a large number of small objects, but current networks often suffer missed and false detections. To address this problem, we propose a YOLO algorithm MFF-YOLOv8 based on multi-scale feature fusion for small target detection in UAV aerial images. First, a high-fesolution feature fusion pyramid (HFFP) is designed, which utilizes high-resolution feature maps containing much information about small objects to guide the feature fusion module, weighting and fusing feature maps to enhance the network's ability to represent small targets. Meanwhile, a reconstruction feature selection (RFS) module is employed to remove the large amounts of noise produced by high-resolution feature maps. Second, a hybrid efficient multi-scale attention (HEMA) mechanism is designed in the backbone network to maximize the retention and extraction of feature information related to small objects while simultaneously suppressing background noise interference. Finally, an Inner-Wise IoU loss function (Inner-WIoU) is designed for joint auxiliary bounding box and dynamic focal bounding box regression, which enhances the accuracy of network regression results, thus improving the detection precision of the model for small objects. MFF-YOLOv8 was experimented on the VisDrone2019 dataset, achieving a 47.9% mAP50, 9.3% up compared with that of the baseline network YOLOv8s. Also, in order to verify the generalization of the overall network, it was evaluated on the DOTA and UAVDT datasets, and the mAP50 was improved by 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively. The results demonstrate that MFF-YOLOv8 significantly enhances detection precision for small objects in UAV aerial scenes.},

  abstract     = {Lane intrusion detection is an essential component of road safety, as vehicles crossing into lanes without proper signalling can lead to accidents, congestion and traffic violations. In order to overcome these challenges, it has become critical for the future autonomous vehicles and ADAS to possess a precise and reliable lane detection technique which could then further monitor the lane violation in real-time. However, lane detection is still challenging due to variants in lighting conditions, obstructions and weak markers. This research paper proposes a new YOLOv8 architecture for lane detection and traffic monitoring systems. The modifications considered in the paper are the addition of the large separable kernel attention (LSKA) module and the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism, which enhance the model's feature extraction and its performance in various real-world scenarios. Furthermore, a new lane intrusion detection (LID) algorithm was created which effectively distinguishes between actual lane intrusions forbidden ones (e.g., crossing solid lane lines) and permissible ones (e.g., crossing dashed lane lines), a crucial aspect for traffic management. The model was successfully tested by transferring the data which was personally recorded on Chinese highways and that show its function in a real environment. The model was tested using a custom dataset which included videos taken on Chinese highways, demonstrating its ability to work under real-world conditions. In this way, the results show that the proposed YOLOv8 model improves the accuracy and reliability of the lane detection tasks, with the model achieving a mAP of 97.9%, which will be useful and a significant advancement in the application of AI to public safety and highlights the critical role of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for enhancing road safety and traffic control.},

Although many innovative algorithms and methods have been developed to improve the results of camouflaged object detection, the problem of poor detection accuracy in complex scenes still exists. To improve the accuracy of camouflage target segmentation, a camouflaged object detection algorithm using contextual feature enhancement and an attention mechanism called amplify and predict network (APNet) is proposed. In this paper, context feature enhancement module (CFEM) and reverse attention prediction module (RAPM) are designed.CFEM can accept multi-level features extracted from the backbone network, and convey the features with enhancement processing to achieve the fusion of multi-level features.RAPM focuses on the edge feature information through the reverse attention mechanism to mine deeper camouflaged target information to achieve and further refine the predicted results. The proposed algorithm achieves weighted F-measure and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.708 and 0.033 on the COD10K dataset, respectively, and the experimental results on other publicly available datasets are also significantly better than the other 14 state-of-the-art models, and achieves the optimal performance on the four objective evaluation metrics, and the proposed algorithm obtains sharper edge details on COD tasks and improves the prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {Object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery plays an important role in many fields. However, UAV images usually exhibit characteristics different from those of natural images, such as complex scenes, dense small targets, and significant variations in target scales, which pose considerable challenges for object detection tasks. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel object detection algorithm for UAV images based on YOLOv8 (referred to as OATF-YOLO). First, an orthogonal channel attention mechanism is added to the backbone network to imporve the algorithm's ability to extract features and clear up any confusion between features in the foreground and background. Second, a triple feature encoder and a scale sequence feature fusion module are integrated into the neck network to bolster the algorithm's multi-scale feature fusion capability, thereby mitigating the impact of substantial differences in target scales. Finally, an inner factor is introduced into the loss function to further upgrade the robustness and detection accuracy of the algorithm. Experimental results on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline model. On the validation set, the OATF-YOLO algorithm achieves a precision of 59.1%, a recall of 40.5%, an mAP50 of 42.5%, and an mAP50:95 of 25.8%. These values represent improvements of 3.8%, 3.0%, 4.1%, and 3.3%, respectively. Similarly, on the test set, the OATF-YOLO algorithm achieves a precision of 52.3%, a recall of 34.7%, an mAP50 of 33.4%, and an mAP50:95 of 19.1%, reflecting enhancements of 4.0%, 3.3%, 4.0%, and 2.6%, respectively. To further validate the model's robustness and scalability, experiments are conducted on the NWPU-VHR10 dataset, and OATF-YOLO also achieves excellent performance. Furthermore, compared to several classical object detection algorithms, OATF-YOLO demonstrates superior detection performance on both datasets and indicates that it is better suited for UAV image object detection scenarios.},

To address these limitations, this study proposes TLEAR-Net, a novel defect detection framework integrating transfer learning with an edge-adaptive reinforcement attention mechanism. The methodology employs RetinaNet as the baseline architecture, enhanced through multi-stage domain adaptation using COCO 2017 pretraining and parameter-shared ResNet-50 backbone optimisation to bridge cross-domain feature discrepancies. An innovative edge-adaptive reinforcement (EAR) attention module is developed to selectively amplify defect boundary features through learnable gradient operators and hybrid spatial-channel attention mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations on a proprietary data set annotated defect samples demonstrate the framework's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy (89.22% mAP) while maintaining real-time processing capability (42.45 FPS).},

To enhance the accuracy of the reflection component and capture finer image details, we introduce a depthwise convolutional focal modulation block. This block improves the representative capacity of the reflection component feature map. Finally, we adjust the illumination component and synthesize it with the reflection component to generate the enhanced image. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 datasets and 13 methods, using metrics such as SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, NIQE, and BRISQUE, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised approaches and shows competitive performance when compared to supervised methods.},

Therefore, we propose a clustering-based color reordering method for reversible data hiding in palette images to improve the reordering effect and further enhance the performance. In this method, we first design a centroid initialization method to select the initial centroids and then exploit the K-means algorithm to generate clusters for the colors in the original color table.

Based on the relationship between the original and the reordered color tables, a novel index matrix can be reconstructed. Finally, state-of-the-art reversible data hiding algorithms can be implemented on the reconstructed index matrix for performance improvement. Since our proposed method improves the reordering effect, enhances the correlation of the reconstructed index matrix, and reduces the length of the encoded location map, the maximal embedding capacities and the visual quality under the fixed embedding capacities are improved.

Traditional ore size detection is often done by manual sieving, which takes a great deal of time and labor. In this work, a deep learning network model (referred to as TRCU), combining Transformer with residual blocks and CBAM attention mechanism in an encoder-decoder structure was developed for particle size detection of medium and large particles in a wide range of particle sizes in an ore material transportation scenario. This model presents a unique approach to improve the accuracy of identifying ore regions in images, utilizing three key features. Firstly, the model utilizes the CBAM attention mechanism to increase the weighting of ore regions in the feature fusion channel; secondly, a Transformer module is used to enhance the correlation of features in coarse-grained ore image regions in the deepest encoding and decoding stages; finally, the residual module is used to enhance useful feature information and reduce noise. The validation experiments are conducted on a transport belt dataset with large variation in particle size and low contrast. The results show that the proposed model can capture the edges of different particle sizes and achieve accurate segmentation of large particle size ore images. The MIoU values of 82.44%, MPA of 90.21%, and accuracy of 94.91% are higher than those of other existing methods.

The lightweight model proposed addresses the inherent challenges of detecting small objects and muti scenarios in the match. After training, the proposed model performed better on four scenarios with different shades of tennis ball match, with results visualized through heatmaps and performance metrics tabulated for detailed analysis. The recall, FLOPs and number of parameters of the improved RTMDet-light are 71.4%, 12.543G, and 4.874M, respectively.

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal, motion and channel information are pivotal in video-based behaviour recognition. Traditional 2D CNNs demonstrate low computational complexity but fail to capture temporal dynamics effectively. Conversely, 3D CNNs excel in recognising temporal patterns but at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose a generic and effective SME module composed of three parallel sub-modules, namely Spatio-Temporal Excitation (STE), Motion Excitation (ME) and Efficient Channel Excitation (ECE). Specifically, the STE module enhances the spatiotemporal representation using a single-channel 3D convolution, enabling the model to focus on both temporal and spatial features. The ME module emphasises motion-sensitive channels by calculating feature map differences at adjacent time steps, guiding the model toward motion-centric regions. The ECE module efficiently captures cross-channel interactions without dimensionality reduction, ensuring robust performance while significantly reducing model complexity. Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method achieved Top-1 accuracy of 49.0% on the Something-Something V1 (Sth-Sth V1) dataset and 40.8% on the Diving48 dataset. Extensive ablation studies and comparative experiments further demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an optimal balance between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Experiments on the VisDrone2019 dataset show that LCM-YOLO has excellent detection capabilities.

  abstract     = {Current feature matching methods typically employ a two-stage process, consisting of coarse and fine matching. However, the transition from the coarse to the fine stage often lacks an effective intermediate state, leading to abrupt changes in the matching process. This can hinder smooth transitions and precise localization. To address these limitations, this study introduces Coarse-Mid-Fine Match Net (CMFNet), a novel three-stage image feature matching method. CMFNet incorporates an intermediate-grained matching phase between the coarse and fine stages to facilitate a more gradual and seamless transition. In the proposed method, the intermediate-grained matching refines the correspondences obtained from the coarse-grained stage using Adaptive-random sample consensus (RANSAC). Subsequently, the midtransformer, which integrates sparse self-attention (SSA) mechanisms with local-feature-based cross-attention, is employed for feature extraction. This approach enhances the feature extraction capabilities and improves the adaptability to various types of image data, thereby boosting overall matching performance. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism based on local region features is introduced. The network undergoes fully self-supervised training, aiming to minimize a match loss that is autonomously generated from the training data using a multi-scale cross-entropy method. A series of thorough experiments was carried out on diverse real-world datasets, including both unaltered and extensively processed images.The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 0.776 mAUC on the HPatches dataset and 0.442 mAUC on the ISC-HE dataset.},

Improved YOLOv8s is employed to extract person categories from the video on a frame-by-frame basis, and when combined with the stage-wise clustering person Re-ID network (SCPN), it enables collaborative person retrieval across multiple cameras. Notably, a feature precision (FP) module is added in the YOLOv8s network to form FP-YOLOv8s, and SCPN incorporates innovative enhancements including the stage-wise learning rate scheduler, centralized clustering loss and adaptive representation joint attention module into the person Re-ID baseline model. Comprehensive experiments on COCO, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms several other leading methods. Given the scarcity of image-video person Re-ID datasets, we also provide an extended image-video person (EIVP) dataset, which contains 102 videos and 814 bounding boxes of 57 identities captured by 8 cameras.

However, traditional approaches struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including complex boundary delineation and intricate spatial relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce the semantic uncertainty-aware segmentation (SUAS) method, an innovative plug-and-play solution designed specifically for remote sensing image analysis. SUAS builds upon the rotated multi-scale interaction network (RMSIN) architecture and introduces the prompt refinement and uncertainty adjustment module (PRUAM). This novel component transforms original textual prompts into semantic uncertainty-aware descriptions, particularly focusing on the ambiguous boundaries prevalent in remote sensing imagery. By incorporating semantic uncertainty, SUAS directly tackles the inherent complexities in boundary delineation, enabling more refined segmentations. Experimental results demonstrate SUAS's effectiveness, showing improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics. SUAS achieves consistent enhancements in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and precision at various thresholds, with notable performance in handling objects with irregular and complex boundaries—a persistent challenge in aerial imagery analysis. The results indicate that SUAS's plug-and-play design, which leverages semantic uncertainty to guide the segmentation task, contributes to improved boundary delineation accuracy in remote sensing image analysis.},

This allows for sufficient learning of audio features from image features in a low dimensional state to generate more accurate lip movements.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel image enhancement method that integrates traditional image processing techniques with deep learning frameworks. Initially, images are transformed from the red, green and blue (RGB) color space to the Lab color space, and the luminance component (L) is extracted to quantify texture. Subsequently, texture complexity is assessed using features derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), including contrast, correlation, homogeneity, and energy. These features are weighted to compute an overall texture complexity score, which facilitates the segmentation of the image into distinct regions. Regions characterized by simple textures are aggregated into larger segments, whereas regions with complex textures are subdivided into smaller segments. Following segmentation, histogram equalization is applied along with noise reduction and image enhancement via a convolutional autoencoder model. The model extracts relevant features and reduces dimensionality in the encoder phase, and reconstructs the image through the decoder. This methodology effectively preserves semantic information and enhances image clarity. Some experiments are conducted using the ExDark dataset, which comprises twelve categories, and the enhancement results are quantitatively evaluated using image quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and neural image quality evaluator (NIQE). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly surpasses existing enhancement techniques in terms of image quality and visual perception, thereby affirming its efficacy in improving the visual quality and detail of low-light images.

In the first stage, FSA-Shared_Nadam estimates head pose angles, MediaPipe detects facial landmarks to calculate eye distance and aspect ratios, and sharpness is calculated using the Laplacian operator. Images are considered valid if they meet the criteria. A model trains a face quality scoring formula, learning how different head pose angles affect face recognition accuracy. In the second stage, face images are clustered, and the formula is applied to select the highest-scoring face within each cluster.

However, in retinal fundus imaging, the reduction in image quality, characterized by poor local contrast and non-uniform brightness, is inevitable. Image enhancement becomes an essential and practical strategy to address these issues. In this paper, we propose a retinal fundus image enhancement method that emphasizes details and equalizes brightness, based on image decomposition. First, the original image is decomposed into three layers using an edge-preserving filter: a base layer, a detail layer, and a noise layer. Second, an adaptive local power-law approach is applied to the base layer for brightness equalization, while detail enhancement is achieved for the detail layer through saliency analysis and blue channel removal. Finally, the base and detail layers are combined, excluding the noise layer, to synthesize the final image. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with both classical and recent approaches using two widely adopted datasets. According to the experimental results, both subjective and objective assessments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances retinal fundus images by highlighting details, equalizing brightness, and suppressing noise and artifacts, all without causing color distortion.},

First, we introduce space-to-depth-convolution (SPD-Conv), which replaces traditional downsampling methods in convolutional neural networks, preserving spatial details without reducing the image resolution. This enhances the model's ability to detect small imperfections. Additionally, the integration of GCNet helps detect blemishes that closely resemble surrounding skin tones by leveraging global context modelling. The improved model better understands the overall structure and features of the face. Experimental results show that our model achieves a 5.3% and 5.6% improvement in mAP50 and mAP50-95, respectively, over YOLOv8n. Furthermore, it outperforms the latest YOLOv11n model by 6.9% and 7.2% in mAP50 and mAP50-95.},

This paper proposes an improved two-stage few-shot object detection method that builds upon the faster region-based convolutional neural network framework to enhance its performance in detecting objects with limited training data. First, a modified data augmentation method for optical images is introduced, and a Gaussian optimization module of sample feature distribution is constructed to enhance the model's generalizability. Second, a parameter-less 3D space attention module without additional parameters, is added to enhance the space features of a sample, where a neuron linear separability measurement and feature optimization module based on mathematical operations are used to adjust the feature distribution and reduce data distribution bias. Finally, a class feature vector extractor based on meta-learning is provided to reconstruct the feature map by overlaying a class feature vector from the target domain onto the query image. This process improves accuracy and generalization performance, and multiple experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset show that the proposed method has higher detection accuracy and stronger generalizability than other methods. Especially, the experiment using practical images under complicated environments indicates its potential effectiveness in real-world scenarios.},

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures, especially in the presence of non-uniform blur. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. MFENet introduces a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depth-wise separable convolutions to capture rich multi-scale spatial and channel information. Furthermore, the proposed method employs a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that utilizes wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Notably, in downstream object detection tasks, our blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.},

However, to further enhance the model's supervisory signals, we introduce a new feature-based perceptual loss. This module utilizes a pre-trained encoder to extract features from both the synthesized and target frames and calculates their cosine dissimilarity as an additional source of supervision. In this way, we aim to improve the model's robustness in handling complex lighting and surface reflection conditions in endoscopic scenes. We compare the performance of using two pre-trained CNN-based models and four foundational models as encoder. Experimental results show that our improve method further enhances the accuracy of depth estimation in medical imaging. Additionally, it demonstrates that features extracted by CNN-based models, which are sensitive to local details, outperform foundation models.

The GsConv module reduces the model's number of parameters and computational complexity. The Dysample module reduces the loss of the rice diseases feature during the extraction process. The SCAM module allows the model to ignore the influence of complex backgrounds and focus on extracting rice disease features. The WIoU v3 loss function optimises the regression box loss of rice disease features. Compared with the YOLOv8n model, the P and mAP50 of GDS-YOLO increased by 5.4% and 4.1%, respectively, whereas the number of parameters and GFLOPS decreased by 23% and 10.1%, respectively.

However, existing shadow detection methods tend to misidentify complex shadows and their similar patterns, such as soft shadow regions and shadow-like regions, since they treat all cases equally, leading to an incomplete structure of the detected shadow regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a structure-aware transformer network (STNet) for robust shadow detection. Specifically, we first develop a transformer-based shadow detection network to learn significant contextual information interactions. To this end, a context-aware enhancement (CaE) block is also introduced into the backbone to expand the receptive field, thus enhancing semantic interaction. Then, we design an edge-guided multi-task learning framework to produce intermediate and main predictions with a rich structure. By fusing these two complementary predictions, we can obtain an edge-preserving refined shadow map. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary semantic-aware learning to overcome the interference from complex scenes, which facilitates the model to perceive shadow and non-shadow regions using a semantic affinity loss. By doing these, we can predict high-quality shadow maps in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the balance error rate (BER) by 4.53%, 2.54%, and 3.49% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the benchmark datasets SBU, ISTD, and UCF, respectively.},

For text localization, we explore maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) for detecting components that work by clustering pixels with similar properties. The output of component detection includes several non-text components due to the degradations of social media images. To select the best components among many, we explore the genetic algorithm by convolving different kernels with components, which results in a feature matrix that is further fed to EfficientNet for choosing actual text components. Therefore, the proposed model is called genetic algorithm based network for text localization in degraded social media images (TLDSMI). For evaluating text localization, we consider the images of the standard dataset of natural scenes by uploading and downloading from different social media platforms, namely, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram. The effectiveness of our method is shown by testing on original and degraded standard datasets. For example, for the degraded images of different complexities including degradations caused by social media platforms, the proposed method performs well in almost all situations.

Among the various attack types, spoofing attack poses a significant threat due to high success rates and minimal technical requirements. In this study, we explore the differences between real and fake palmprint images. Based on these differences, we propose the concept of ‘high-frequency spoofing regions’ to capture key discriminative spoofing clues. Specifically, the high-frequency spoofing regions adaptation ( HFSRA ) model is proposed to address palmprint anti-spoofing. The HFSRA consists of two key modules: the texture analysis module (TAM) and the spoofing attention module (SAM). In particular, the TAM divides the input feature map into several patches and evaluates the texture distribution within each patch. Next, the SAM dynamically constructs an attention map by mapping the texture distribution to an attention weight matrix. This adaptive structure forces the model to focus on high-frequency spoofing regions, which improves the model's ability to extract meaningful spoofing clues effectively. Furthermore, we establish three experimental protocols for evaluating the performance of palmprint anti-spoofing models. These protocols provide a standardized evaluation framework for future studies. Extensive experiments conducted under these protocols demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of HFSRA.},

By designing an innovative approach, Chinese character strokes are divided into several distinct components, with only specific ones being selectively modified to generate new glyphs, thus forming a unique codebook. The watermark signals are embedded by substituting the carrier glyph with the newly generated one, and the signals are extracted using a template matching method. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional manually designed codebooks, the proposed method significantly reduces human labor and computational overhead while maintaining high visual quality. Moreover, it exhibits superior robustness and adaptability across various challenging scenarios, including digital noise attacks, print-scanning attacks, and print-camera capture, making it a highly effective solution for protecting textual information.},

  abstract     = {In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have made significant strides in recovering 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single 2D measurement. However, the inherent nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of HSI reconstruction continue to challenge existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight collaborative attention-enhanced accelerated unfolding network ( ), which integrates a DUN framework with a streamlined prior extractor. Our integrated approach introduces a generically accelerated half-quadratic splitting algorithm (A-HQS) for degradation estimation, overcoming the limitations of first-order optimization and enabling effective long-range dependency modeling. Within the prior extractor, we introduce cross-convergence attention, facilitating iterative information exchange between local and non-local Transformers to capture holistic features and enhance inductive capacity. Notably, the concept of collaborative cross-convergence is embedded throughout all submodules, ensuring effective information flow. The proposed not only accelerates the convergence of spectral reconstruction, but also fully exploits compressed spatial-spectral information. Numerical and visual comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this approach. Comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the superiority of this approach. The source code is available at https://github.com/Mengjie-s/CA2UN .},

The escalating occurrences of floods, particularly in urban areas, can be attributed to climate change, extreme weather patterns, uncontrolled urbanization, and complex geographical conditions. To mitigate the destructive impacts, such as loss of life and economic ramifications, automatic flood analysis and remote-sensing imagery segmentation offer valuable decision-making insights. However, the segmentation process for flood detection faces challenges due to the scarcity of labelled data and diverse resolutions, including medium resolution data. In response, the authors propose Flood-MATE, a novel semi-supervised learning approach based on the mean-teacher model. Our approach leverages the deep learning architecture and introduces a new loss function scenario for training. The dataset utilized in this study comprises SAR images of Sentinel-1 C-band that have undergone thorough processing.

In this paper, a novel calibration method for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras is proposed based on improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction. Initially, a method to extend the maximum fitting FOV of the camera model to over 180 degrees is proposed. Subsequently, a calibration board detection approach is proposed using SE(3) image pre-correction. Specifically, image pre-correction is incorporated into the camera calibration process, utilizing SE(3) to define the pre-correction plane. Calibration boards are detected within the pre-corrected images, enhancing the reliability, accuracy and speed of board detection in distorted images, consequently increasing the control point's maximum FOV. Lastly, the improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction are integrated into a feedback-based camera calibration system for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras. Operating with real-time or offline video streams as input, this system autonomously selects calibration key frames, optimizes camera parameters and calibration board poses in real-time. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to a 62% increase in the achievable maximum FOV.},

Accurately positioning the centre of OVL targets is fundamental for effective metrology. However, the identification and localization of target centres become challenging due to complex shapes and unexpected features, such as rounded corners, that can arise during manufacturing. An algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenge by employing customizable shape fitting. This method begins with the extraction of sub-pixel edge points, followed by applying a Hough transform to group and smooth these points, thereby enhancing contour quality. By parameterizing the target shape based on specific points, the algorithm integrates sub-pixel traversal techniques with an optimization objective, achieving sub-pixel accuracy in centre positioning. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can achieve a positioning accuracy of ±0.03 pixels and demonstrates robustness against noise and blur. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to test the OVL target pair arrays fabricated by electron beam etching, confirming an accuracy of ±0.04 pixels (±6.9 nm). These results validate the algorithm's capability to meet high precision requirements for OVL target centre positioning in wafer applications.},

  abstract     = {In high-precision image segmentation tasks, even slight deviations in the segmentation results can bring about significant consequences, especially in certain application areas such as medical imaging and remote sensing image classification. The precision of segmentation has become the main factor limiting its development. Researchers typically refine image segmentation algorithms to enhance accuracy, but it is challenging for any improvement strategy to be effectively applied to images of different objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a two-step refinement method for image segmentation, comprising region expansion and minor contour adjustments. First, we design an adaptive gradient thresholding module to provide gradient-based constraints for the refinement process. Next, the region expansion module iteratively refines each segmented region based on colour differences and gradient thresholds. Finally, the minor contour adjustments module leverages local strong gradient features to refine the contour positions further. This method integrates region-level and pixel-level information to refine various image segmentation results. This method was applied to the BSDS500, Cells, and WHU Building datasets. The results demonstrate that the refined closed contours align more closely with the ground truth, with the most notable improvement observed at contour inflection points (corner points). Among the results, the Cells dataset showed the most significant improvement in segmentation accuracy, with the F-score increasing from 87.51% to 89.73% and IoU from 86.83% to 88.40%.},

However, the diagnosis of each modality is not entirely accurate. Compounding the challenge is the difficulty in acquiring multi-modal data, with existing datasets frequently lacking paired multi-modal data. To solve these problems, we propose multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm and cross-modal generation algorithm. The multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm first calculates the mean and variance separately for each modality, and then generates multi-modal diagnostic results in a distribution fusion manner. In order to generate the absent modality (mainly OCT data), three sub-networks are designed in the cross-modal generation algorithm: cross-modal alignment network, conditional deformable autoencoder and latent consistency diffusion model (LCDM). Finally, we propose multi-task collaboration strategy where diagnosis and generation tasks are mutually reinforcing to achieve optimal performance.

A crucial reason for its limitation of discriminability is the lack of neighbourhood information description from a global perspective. Previous research has attempted to improve its performance by introducing global thresholds, but such threshold selection is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel tomography-aided local binary patterns (TLBP), inspired by the tomographic process of sample separation. TLBP considers constructing visual feature representations under multi-level non-local information to compensate for the lack of LBP possessing only a single shallow feature. In addition to the basic LBP features from local visual context, TLBP captures refined neighbourhood greyscale information through multi-quantile thresholds from a global visual perspective, thereby greatly enhancing discriminability. Experimental results in texture classification, face recognition, and hyperspectral pixel-wise classification demonstrate that the proposed TLBP descriptor outperforms the competitors, achieving 94.39% (KTH-TIPS), 81.22% (KTH-TIPS-ROT), 93.81% (Indian Pines), 99.85% (Salinas), and 99.50% (ORL) accuracy.

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image target detection provides an effective and accurate data analysis tool for many application areas. Due to complex backgrounds, large differences in target scales, and missed detection of small targets, remote sensing image target detection is challenging. In order to enhance the model's understanding of the global information of remote sensing images, this paper proposes the GFA module. This module can establish the global contextual connection of remote sensing images to provide rich context to help understand the complex scene and background in which the target is located, without being limited to local information. Additionally, it focuses on channel information for enhanced target feature extraction. For the purpose of alleviating the serious imbalance in foreground–background samples that is present in single-level target detection models. The loss function is reconstructed based on focal loss by redefining the balance factor α and focus factor γ , so that it can be dynamically adjusted during network training. Meanwhile, EIoU is used to further enhance the bounding box regression capability. Affine transformations were also used to augment the dataset in order to assist the model in adjusting to real-world situations. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the publicly available HRRSD dataset. In comparison with YOLO v5, the mAP of the detection results improved by 2.7%. Compared with YOLO v8 and YOLO v10, the mAP improved by 3.2% and 3.3%. The model achieves an FPS of 40.1, an optimal balance between speed and accuracy. Further, experiments are conducted using the NWPU VHR-10 dataset and the RSOD dataset, both of which demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other target detection methods and improves remote sensing target detection performance.},

  abstract     = {In the current field of speech-driven 3D facial animation, transformer-based methods are limited in practical applications due to their high computational complexity. A new model—NewTalker—is proposed, which has core modules consisting of the residual bidirectional Mamba (RBM) and the time–frequency domain Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (TFK). The RBM module incorporates the philosophy of Mamba, enhancing the model's predictive ability for sequence data by utilizing both past and future contextual information, thereby reducing the computational complexity. The TFK module integrates the temporal and frequency domain information of audio data through Kolmogorov–Arnold networks, allowing the model to generate 3D facial animations smoothly while learning more detailed features. Extensive experiments and user studies have shown that the proposed NewTalker significantly surpasses current mainstream algorithms in terms of animation quality and inference speed, achieving the state-of-the-art level in this domain.},

  abstract     = {Automatic liver segmentation is of great significance for computer-aided treatment and surgery of liver diseases. However, respiratory motion often affects the liver, leading to image artifacts in liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and increasing segmentation difficulty. To overcome this issue, we propose a global spatial structure-aware attention model (GSA-Net), a robust segmentation network developed to overcome the difficulties caused by respiratory motion. The GSA-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture, which extracts spatial structure information from images and identifies different objects using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The network's encoder extracts multi-scale image features with the help of an effective and lightweight channel attention module. The decoder then transforms these features bottom-up using tree filter modules. Combined with the boundary detection module, the segmentation performance can be further improved. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two liver MRI benchmarks: one with respiratory artifacts and the other without. Numerical evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that GSA-Net consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of segmentation precision on our respiratory artifact dataset, and also achieves notable results on high-quality datasets.},

The algorithm incorporates a fast lightweight feature extraction structure, the number of parameters and computation of the model are reduced while preserving the spatial information, thus improving the target detection performance. A multi-scale feature fusion module is introduced, enabling the extraction of more comprehensive and richer features compared to traditional single-scale methods, to better support defect detection tasks. Additionally, a receptive field attention structure, Receptive Field Attention Neck, is designed in the Neck part to expand the model's receptive field and reduce computational complexity, significantly improving detection accuracy for small defects. This allows the model to effectively capture both global and local features in complex industrial scenarios. The effectiveness of the improved FMR-YOLO algorithm is validated on two industrial surface defect datasets: GC10-DET and NEU-DET. Experimental results show that the mAP@0.5 detection accuracy has increased by 4.5% and 5.1% on the GC10-DET and NEU-DET datasets, respectively, with a parameter size of merely 2.7 M.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Although image super-resolution technology has been successfully applied to SAR imaging in recent years, there is less research on large-scale factor SAR image super-resolution methods. A more effective method is to obtain comprehensive information to guide the reconstruction of SAR images. In fact, the co-registered characteristics of high-resolution optical images have been successfully applied to improve the quality of SAR images. Inspired by this, an optical-guided multi-kernel attention based SAR image super-resolution reconstruction network (OMA-SSR) is proposed. The proposed multi-modal mutual attention (MMA) module in this network can effectively establish the dependency between SAR image features and optical image features. This network also designs a deep feature extraction module for SAR images, which includes a channel-splitted multi-kernel attention (CSMA) module and residual connections. CSMA module splits SAR image channels, extracts features in different ranges through multi-kernel convolution, and finally fuses the extracted features between different channels. Experimental results on the Sen1-2 and QXS datasets show that the proposed OMA-SSR performs well in evaluation indicators and visual effects of SAR image super-resolution reconstruction.},

However, in previous works, the negatives are sampled from the input image itself, which inspires us to design a data augmentation method to improve the quality of the selected negatives. Moreover, the previous methods only preserve the content consistency via patch-wise contrastive learning, which ignores the domain consistency between the generated images and the real images of the target domain. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised i2i translation framework based on multi-cropping contrastive learning and domain consistency, called MCDUT. Specifically, the multi-cropping views are obtained with the aim of further generating high-quality negative examples. To constrain the embeddings in the deep feature space, a new domain consistency loss is formulated, which encourages the generated images to be close to the real images. In many i2i translation tasks, this method achieves state-of-the-art results, and the advantages of this method have been proven through extensive comparison experiments and ablation research.

To extract richer features while reducing useless parameters in the network, this paper introduced the Im SRM filtering kernel into the image preprocessing module. To extract effective steganography noise from images, this paper combined depthwise separable convolution and residual networks for the first time and introduces them into the steganography noise extraction module. In addition, to focus network attention on the image regions where steganography information exists, this paper integrated the coordinate attention mechanism. This module will make the network pay attention to the overall structure and local details of the image during network training, improving the network's recognition ability for steganography information. Finally, the extracted steganography features are classified through a classification module. This paper conducted a series of experiments on the BOSSBase 1.01 and BOWS2 datasets. The improvement in detection accuracy is between 1.2% and 18.2% compared to classic and recent steganalysis networks.},

Various models and algorithms have been explored by researchers to address different types of image distortions, including sparse representation, grouped sparse representation, and low-rank self-representation. The grouped sparse representation algorithm leverages the prior knowledge of non-local self-similarity and imposes sparsity constraints to maintain texture information within images. To further exploit the intrinsic properties of images, this study proposes a novel low-rank representation-guided grouped sparse representation image restoration algorithm. This algorithm integrates self-representation models and trace optimization techniques to effectively preserve the original image structure, thereby enhancing image restoration performance while retaining the original texture and structural information.

Most existing face frontalization methods rely on heavy architectures that struggle with small datasets and produce low-quality images. Additionally, although video frames provide richer information, these methods typically use single images due to the lack of suitable multi-image datasets. To address these issues, a parameter-efficient framework for high-quality face frontalization in both single and multi-frame scenarios is proposed. First, a high-quality, diverse dataset is created for single and multi-image face frontalization tasks. Second, a novel single-image face frontalization method is introduced by combining GAN inversion with transfer learning. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 91% compared to existing GAN inversion methods while achieving far more photorealistic results than GAN-based methods. Finally, this method is extended to sequences of images, using attention mechanisms to merge information from multiple frames. This multi-frame approach reduces artefacts like eye blinks and improves reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that this single-image method outperforms pSp, a state-of-the-art GAN inversion method, with a 0.15 LPIPS improvement and a 0.10 increase in ID similarity. This multi-frame approach further improves identity preservation to 0.87, showcasing its effectiveness for high-quality frontal-view reconstructions.},

Four single-flow continuous fermenters were used for rumen culture incubation with four different treatment diets: Control (50:50 forage to concentrate [F:C] ratio), Control + Bromoform (CBR), Low Forage (LF; 20:80), and High Forage (HF; 80:20). After 10 days of incubation, all fermenter contents were transferred and used in a 24 h ANKOM batch culture to measure gas production with LMD and OGI. The authors introduce the Controlled Diet (CD) dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,885 plume images captured using an FLIR GF77 OGI camera under varying dietary conditions. The performance of six semantic segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, DeepLabv3+, and Gasformer) on the CD dataset is compared. Results showed that LMD data for followed a similar pattern to the gas chromatography (GC) instrument results. The in vitro results showed that different diets and F:C ratios had an impact on gas production and rumen fermentation characteristics. Adding bromoform to the control diet fully inhibited emission. The HF diet produced more compared to all treatments ( ) when measured with GC and LMD. CBR produced the lowest values when measured with GC and LMD. The Gasformer architecture achieved the highest performance with mean IoU of 85.1% and mean F-score of 91.72%.

First, based on the ShuffleNet-V2 backbone model, SLW-LDT introduced a local feature extraction branch that highlights specific expression-related features by cropping the facial image into four local regions. Subsequently, the SLW algorithm is devised to allocate learnable weights to global and local features from different branches before their fusion. Moreover, considering the challenge associated with accessing emotional distribution in facial images directly, a label distribution training module (LDT) is introduced during the training phase to generate label distributions for effective training purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracies of 89.77% and 64.21% on two in-the-wild datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet-7), and 98.90% on the lab-controlled CK+ dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods reveals slight improvements in recognition accuracy along with robust performance exhibited by the model.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the real-time object detection problem for devices with limited computing resources in densely populated and occluded scenarios, a novel occlusion-aware lightweight object detection network (OLODN) is proposed. This network integrates innovative components to significantly enhance detection efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Firstly, OLODN employs FasterNet blocks and reparameterised generalised-FPN to reduce computational complexity and preserve feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Secondly, a reinforced coordination attention mechanism is designed to strengthen the network's ability to capture occlusion boundary information. Additionally, a spatial pyramid pooling feature concatenation module is introduced to integrate multi-scale features and enhance the algorithm's robustness to occlusions. Lastly, OLODN adopts a task-aligned one-stage object detection strategy, optimising the anchor alignment of classification and localisation tasks, effectively improving detection accuracy under occluded conditions. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. On the WiderPerson dataset, OLODN achieved a recall rate of 68.0%, which is 2.8% higher than YOLOv11's 65.2%, while running at 35.3 frames per second (f/s) on CPU and 76.6 f/s on GPU, faster than YOLOv11's 34.1 f/s and 74.5 f/s by 1.2 f/s and 2.1 f/s, respectively.},

Despite extensive research on morphing detection, limited attention has been given to restoring accomplice face images, which is critical for forensic applications. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel face de-morphing (FD) method based on identity feature transfer for restoring accomplice face images. The method encodes facial attribute and identity features separately and employs cross-attention mechanisms to extract identity features from morphed faces relative to reference images. This process isolates and enhances the accomplice's identity features. Additionally, inverse linear interpolation is applied to transfer identity features to attribute features, further refining the restoration process. The enhanced identity features are then integrated with the StyleGAN generator to reconstruct high-quality accomplice facial images. Experimental evaluations on two morphed face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, improving the average restoration accuracy by at least 5% compared with other methods. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for advancing forensic and security applications.},

Recently, due to the rise and widespread use of spike cameras, learning optical flow from spiking cameras has become a hot topic in the field of two-dimensional motion estimation. Although existing methods have been designed to learn optical flow by designing feature processing methods for spike streams, there is still insufficient consideration for flow field post-processing, resulting in limited accuracy of optical flow estimation. To address this problem, an optical flow estimation method based on directional disassembly is proposed. Specifically, the estimated flow fields along the horizontal and vertical directions are disassembled and the motion vectors along the two directions are denoised separately to reduce the burden of post-processing for complex two-dimensional motion information. In addition, contextual information is introduced in the post-processing so that the scene information can effectively contribute to the results of the flow post-processing.

Therefore, this article proposes an improved detection model YOLOv7-SFWC for illegally manned trucks. First of all, the pictures of illegal manned vehicles obtained by relevant departments are expanded and labeled, and the dataset of illegal manned vehicles is created. Building upon the foundational YOLOv7 model, this study replaces the traditional convolution module with the FasterNet convolution module and SCConv module, and introduces the Wise-IoU (WIoU) loss function algorithm and Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism. The results show that the mAP value of the YOLOv7-SFWC model is improved by 4.15% and FPS by 7.6 compared with the original YOLOv7 model, and the computational complexity is reduced to adapt to the deployment. Moreover, the model's effectiveness is validated through extensive comparison experiments. Finally, the visual results show the accurate performance of the model and verify the progress of YOLOv7-SFWC.

  abstract     = {As one of the world's most popular beverages, tea plays a significant role in improving tea production efficiency and quality through the identification of tea shoots during the tea manufacturing process. However, due to the complex morphology, small size, and susceptibility to factors like lighting and obstruction, traditional identification methods suffer from low accuracy and efficiency. In this study, image enhancement techniques such as HSV transformation, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping were applied to the training dataset to improve model robustness and enhance generalization across varying lighting and angles. To address these challenges in the context of tea buds detection, deep-learning-based object detection methods have emerged as promising solutions. Nevertheless, current object detection technologies still face limitations when detecting tea buds under these conditions. To enhance identification performance, this article proposed an improved YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once version 5 small model) algorithm. In the improved YOLOv5s algorithm, CBAM, SE, and CA attention mechanisms were incorporated into the backbone network to augment feature extraction, and a weighted Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed in the neck network to boost performance, resulting in the YOLOv5s_teabuds model. Experimental results indicated that the improved model significantly outperformed the original in terms of precision, recall, mAP and F1-score, with the CA attention mechanism providing the most notable improvement—enhancing precision, recall, mAP and F1-score by 18.119%, 9.633%, 16.496% and 13.524%, respectively. After integrating BiFPN, the YOLOv5s_teabuds model further strengthened performance and robustness, with precision, recall, mAP and F1-score increased by 19.346%, 11.388%, 18.620%, and 15.059%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Images can be corrupted during capture or transmission due to clouds, overlaps, and other interferences, deviating from their original state. Image inpainting techniques restore such images, but different types—Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), RGB, and infrared—require varying field-of-view sizes. SAR and infrared images, with less information, need a larger field of view, leading to uncorrelated interference in distant areas. RGB images, richer in information, are constrained by a limited local field of view, hindering access to full semantic details. To address these challenges, an aggregated convolution progressive network is proposed. This model employs a coarse-grained inpainting module for initial restoration, enhanced by an aggregated convolution module to capture contextual information. Local and global details are then used to refine the output, improving restoration quality. Additionally, existing datasets predominantly focus on RGB images, lacking diversity. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive dataset covering SAR, RGB, and infrared images under cloud, overlap, and corruption conditions is constructed. This method achieves superior performance, with MAE of 0.05, SSIM of 0.95, and PSNR of 36.68 within a 20–30% mask size range, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across diverse image types and size ranges.

To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight and high-accuracy small-object detection algorithm for UAV aerial imagery that is based on YOLOv5s. First, the network structure is optimized by removing the layers in YOLOv5s primarily used for detecting large targets (P4 and P5) and adding layers primarily used for detecting small targets (P2 and P3). This enables the model to focus more on extracting small-object features. A lightweight dynamic convolution is subsequently introduced in the C3 module, and the lightweight LW_C3 and LW_downsampling modules are designed for feature extraction and downsampling operations. This enhances the model's feature extraction capability while achieving a lightweight design. Finally, the adaptive multi-scale spatial feature fusion (AMSFF) module is designed to adaptively learn the spatial weights of the feature maps at different levels, thereby further strengthening the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the improved YOLO-Tiny model has higher accuracy and lower complexity, hence validating its excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image super-resolution by addressing issues such as transition smoothing, insufficient high-frequency information, and training instability encountered in regression-based and GAN-based models. However, challenges persist when applying diffusion models to image super-resolution, including randomness, inadequate conditional information, high computational costs, and network architecture complexities. In this article, the authors introduce a diffusion model based on Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), and propose the use of ENAFBlocks instead of traditional ResBlocks to enhance model performance in noise prediction. The Mean-Reverting SDE effectively mitigates the randomness of the diffusion model by leveraging low-resolution images as means. Additionally, an LR Encoder is introduced to capture hidden information from LR images, providing a more robust condition for stable result generation by the noise predictor. To efficiently handle high-resolution images within limited GPU memory, the method employs adaptive aggregate sampling, which merges overlapping regions smoothly using weighted averaging. Furthermore, color variations are addressed during diffusion model sampling through color correction. Extensive experiments on CelebA, DIV2K, and Urban100 demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models like IDM, with a PSNR improvement of 0.22 dB, FID reduction of 2.35, and LPIPS reduction of 0.05 on the DIV2K dataset, along with a reduced parameter count and faster inference time.},

  abstract     = {When capturing distant targets, the video sequence images are affected by atmospheric turbulence, resulting in distortion and blur. In order to restore the degraded images due to atmospheric turbulence in video sequences, this article combines lucky imaging with generative adversarial networks for the first time. The idea of lucky imaging is employed to eliminate geometric distortions, followed by the use of generative adversarial networks to address the blur issue. Additionally, an adaptive restoration method targeting turbulence intensity is proposed to improve the computational efficiency of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined restoration method of lucky imaging and generative adversarial networks outperforms classical lucky imaging. Specifically, compared to classical lucky imaging, the Brenner gradient function, Laplacian gradient function, Spatial Median Difference (SMD), Entropy, Energy gradient function, PIQE, and Brisque indicators improve by 7.7%, 13.1%, 3.6%, 4.1%, 2.1%, 26.6% and 21.54% (all evaluation indicators in the above improvement rates have undergone logarithmic transformation), respectively.

  abstract     = {The primary challenge of the multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) task is the modal fusion, and the lack of modalities may exist in the fusion process, which leads to poor prediction results. Most of the previous research on multimodal fusion is single-stage fusion, disregarding how various modality subsets interact, as well as rarely considering relative position relationship of modality sequences, causing the fragmentation of context info. Considering the aforementioned issues, this study introduces an MSA method based on the multi-stage graph fusion network (MSGFN) under random missing modality conditions to improve the robustness of the model to MSA under the random missing modality conditions. Firstly, for each modality, its inter-modal and intra-modal multi-head attention are used to learn robust representation of the modality sequence. Meanwhile, the relative position encoding (RPE) is introduced into mechanism of attention that enables model to perceive and learn the relative position before and after the modality sequence when calculating attention, thereby better understanding the contextual info of the sequence. After that, the transformer encoder receives the learned modality features and uses the pre-trained model to supervise the reconstruction of the missing modality information. Finally, the feature representations of different modalities have effectively fused using multi-stage graph fusion network, and the output is used for the ultimate sentiment classification. Wide experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP, and the findings indicate that the proposed method can better handle the challenges caused by modality fusion and modality missing compared with several baseline methods.},

This approach not only enhances model adaptability but also minimizes maintenance costs. However, the current popular methods are susceptible to the ‘copying shortcut’ phenomenon, which constrains their performance on benchmark datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multi-class anomaly detection model: UniRD, based on the reverse distillation method. This model creates an image corruptor that expands the dataset and generates ‘normal-corrupt’ image pairs. During the training process, their correspondence is used to optimize the reverse distillation. This process greatly exploits and releases the potential of the student decoder. Furthermore, a teacher feature adaptation module is devised to enhance the compatibility between the pre-trained model and the anomaly detection task. This has the effect of reducing the discrepancy between teacher and student features while ensuring the consistency of normal sample features. The comprehensive evaluation results in two mainstream datasets, MVTec and VisA, and demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits improvement in all indicators compared to benchmark methods. The proposed method attains the state-of-the-art, substantiating its effectiveness and advancement.},

However, many existing algorithms neglect the registration of non-rigid point cloud. Recent studies have focused on scene flow, which can achieve non-rigid point cloud registration by estimating the scene flow of two point clouds. The presence of occlusion in a scene is primarily attributed to variations in viewpoint and access time, thereby posing a significant challenge in accurately predicting scene flow. In the endeavour to mitigate this issue, the focus is on the propagation of scene flow originating from non-occluded points towards occlusion points while concurrently estimating the occlusion map. The proposed network, a non-rigid point cloud registration method based on scene flow estimation, achieves exceptional performance for the EPE3D metric on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI scene flow datasets, and it demonstrates strong generalization on the railroad dataset.},

Firstly, a dataset for salt-and-pepper noise image classification is constructed, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for judging noise image (CNN-J) is trained. Image classified as normal by CNN-J is not processed, while the classified noisy image is denoised. In the denoising process, a marking image and a rough denoised image are generated by CNN for noise mask (CNN-M) and CNN for denoising (CNN-D), respectively. Subsequently, the refined denoised image is output using the proposed refining mechanism. The middle layers of CNN-M and CNN-D are constructed by depth-separable CNN to reduce the network complexity. Experimental results show that the misjudging rate of CNN-M marking is reduced by 19.94% compared with the best existing marking method. Compared with the traditional methods, the peak signal to noise ratio of the proposed method is increased by 2.95% and the information loss is reduced by 21.46%. In addition, the computational complexity is at least 11.18% lower than that of the traditional CNN. Finally, the display of salt-and-pepper denoised images on the flexible AMOLED is realized.},

  abstract     = {A novel automated method for segmenting retinal layers in three-dimensional (3D) space from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images. Compared to 2D segmentation, 3D segmentation uses more data and produces findings that are more accurate and reliable. The class-specific area of interest (ROI) choice and three important reference class approximations make the suggested technique precise, effective, and reliable. In the first step, contours are detected based on gradient intensity. To choose a smaller region of interest (ROI), the second stage entails acquiring the identified boundary neighbour B scan data for the selected ROI by categorising the problem as a graph problem. The third stage involves locating edge pixels using Canny Edge Detection from nodes. In order to calculate the edge weight of a histogram, slope similarity to the reference line and node characteristics are considered. The fourth phase boundary is precisely found by Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The accuracy of the method was tested based on 288 B scans of 12 patients (ten normal macular degeneration (AMD) subjects and 2 age-related subjects from two different institutions). Five recent automated procedures are compared with the results to further validate the findings of the fifth phase. The outcomes demonstrate a mean original mean square error (RMSE) for each of the cut-off values, which are 2.82, 4.88, 2.03, 3.77, and 0.64 pixels, respectively. As can be seen, the suggested strategy outperforms the existing models' significantly with a return on investment of 0.26 pixels.},

The model introduces MoE-SM, an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to replace the Feed-Forward inside all Transformer block. MoE-SM is designed with Smart-Merger, and new layer for merging the output of individual experts, and with a new way to split the work between experts, defining a new per-example strategy instead of the commonly used per-token one. Furthermore, it is analyzed how positional encodings interact with each other, demonstrating that per-channel bias and per-head bias can positively cooperate.

Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient objective-mathematical model based on statistical perceptual features. The structural and textural features are computed using the modified regularized heaviside local binary pattern (RH-LBP) approach and the concept of entropy. The higher-order probability coefficients of images are considered to extract features that are highly correlated to the human visual system features. Further, the additivity property of Renyi entropy is used to show the randomness of the information combining two terms: One extracts the images spatial intensity changes, and therefore their texture qualities, and the other attain structural details. The features in the proposed approach are jointly optimized to achieve better robustness, monotonicity and match human assessments on image quality, while minimizing the computational complexity and run time. Experiments are conducted with three synthetically distorted datasets, KonIQ-10K, BIQ2021, and LIVE (wild), and two intentionally distorted datasets, TID2013 and CSIQ and are used to evaluate performance index.

An 18-layer ResNet model was trained using ground truth leaf width values for regression in leaf width estimation. Experiments used a dataset of 4960 images representing 8 rice diseases. The leaf width prediction model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 11.18% and was used to generate a tiled dataset for training advanced rice disease detection models.

  abstract     = {The detection of road potholes plays a crucial role in ensuring passenger comfort and the structural safety of vehicles. To address the challenges of pothole detection in complex road environments, this paper proposes a model focusing on shape features (pothole detection you only look once, PD-YOLO). The model aims to overcome the limitations of multi-scale feature learning caused by the use of fixed convolutional kernels in the baseline model, by constructing a feature extraction module that better adapts to variations in the shape of potholes. Subsequently, a cross-stage partial network was designed using a one-time aggregation method, simplifying the model while enabling the network to fuse information between feature maps at different stages. Additionally, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism is introduced to select relevant features, reducing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Experiments conducted on the VOC2007 and GRDDC2020_Pothole datasets reveal that compared to the baseline model YOLOv8, PD-YOLO achieves improvements of 3.9% and 2.8% in mean average precision, with a frame rate of approximately 290 frames per second, effectively meeting the accuracy and real-time requirements for pothole detection.

First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with geometric transformations is designed, which uses rotated labels as supervision to obtain lower-level characteristics that more accurately capture various orientations and then makes use of a spectral-spatial characteristic extraction network to maximize the utilization of HSI's spectrum and spatial information. Next, a class anchor open-set classification module based on a twin clustering network is designed, which uses SCL and FSL to extract more specific personal information by mining the category-invariant characteristics present in the known versus unknown class data. Finally, multiple convolution and open-set recognition (OSC) is performed on the feature blocks. Experimental results on three classical HSI datasets show that FSSCL-OSC provides a significant improvement over existing methods, under a sample size of only 10%, the overall accuracy reached 82.38%, 90.76% and 84.70%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compared with common urban landscape semantic segmentation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image semantic segmentation is more challenging because small targets have very low pixel percentages and multi-scale features due to the influence of flight altitude. Yet, the commonly used successive grid downsampling strategy in the current transformer-based methods omits some important features of small targets. Furthermore, due to the complex background interference, it can lead to even worse results. In reaction to this, existing strategies aim to maintain superior resolution. Nevertheless, the application of this method incurs considerable computational costs, which brings challenges for the practical applications of UAVs. So it is significant to design a novel framework to balance retaining more pixels representing small objects during downsampling and reducing computational costs. For this, the Channel Selection and the Local Attention Transformer Model (CSLFormer) are proposed. During the overlap patch embedding process of feature maps, the model allocates half of the important channels to global attention and local attention. These two types of attention focus on different aspects: one learns the relationships and importance among various patches, while the other emphasizes the features of individual patches. The method shows superior performance on two public datasets: AeroScapes and Vaihingen, achieving mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 75.57% and 78.93%, respectively. The proposed CSLFormer has been released on GitHub: https://github.com/leoda1/CSLFormer .},

However, images captured by fisheye cameras suffer from significant geometric distortions, affecting image analysis and understanding. This distortion bends straight lines into curves, resulting in a barrel-shaped appearance of the image. To mitigate these effects and transform fisheye images into a regular perspective, fisheye image correction is necessary, enabling more accurate and reliable performance in applications like object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and visual navigation. While convolutional neural networks based fisheye image correction has progressed, it has not fully utilized the global distribution and local symmetry of distortions due to the limitations of fixed receptive fields. This paper introduces a new model based on the Swin Transformer that effectively utilizes both global and local distortion features to adapt automatically to fisheye lens distortions. It also incorporates image restoration functionality to enhance texture details in the corrected images.

To advance towards an autonomous model for detailed polyp segmentation, the authors propose a new framework for polyp segmentation called U-shaped cross-fusion network with attention mechanism (UCFA-Net), which employs a pyramid vision transformer as encoder to extract image features at multiple scales. Furthermore, the multi-scale cross-fusion module cross-fuses the different scale features and then goes through the multi-scale convolutional parallel feedforward transformer module for modelling the global and local information. Finally, progressive attentional up-sampling module acts as a decoder for up-sampling with progressive attention to get the final polyp segmentation result. The authors comprehensive testing demonstrates that their network achieves superior average scores across the five datasets and exhibits greater robustness in the face of diverse and demanding scenarios, when compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Gallbladder cancer is a fatal disease, and its early diagnosis can significantly impact patient treatment. Ultrasound imaging is often the initial diagnostic test for gallbladder cancer, making the enhancement of cancer detection accuracy from these images crucial. Despite the promising results of artificial intelligence techniques in disease diagnosis, their black-box nature hinders the reliability of their results and their practical application. Therefore, it is essential not to rely solely on a single model's output and to further investigate for more reliable outcomes. This study presents a step-by-step structural investigation of forming an end-to-end model, a conjunction of two convolutional neural network based methods, for detecting gallbladder conditions. The final model, leveraging feature fusions and hierarchical classification, achieved a high accuracy of 92.62% for detecting normal, benign, and malignant gallbladders. It also achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.36% for classifying normal and non-normal instances and 92.22% for classifying benign and malignant cases. Finally, comprehensive post-processing investigations, including cross-validation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty estimation, along with error analysis, are conducted to gain more insights into the model's output. Among these insights, the model demonstrated resilience of its results to active dropout and augmentation at the inference phase. Furthermore, when applied with test-time data augmentation, uncertainty estimation methods have better distinguishability between the uncertainties of correctly and incorrectly classified instances, which provides additional information about the model's output.

The authors aim to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to learn mitochondrial morphological features. The approach begins with self-supervised learning from a vast set of unlabeled images through masked image modeling. This technique involves presenting images with randomly masked patches, prompting the model to predict the content of these masked areas. By doing so, the model learns the distinctive features of mitochondria. In the subsequent phase, the trained encoder is transferred to the segmentation task, replacing the original reconstruction decoder with the Segformer segmentation decoder. The model is then fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. By reconstructing mitochondria in the masked regions, the model learns features more effectively on unlabeled samples, and improves segmentation performance even with limited labeled data. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 11.8% improvement in Intersection over Union metrics compared to existing fluorescence mitochondrial segmentation techniques.},

However, accurate detection and segmentation of tumors, essential for diagnosis, rely heavily on costly manual annotation by experts. To mitigate these costs, weakly supervised methods have gained traction. This paper introduces a novel weakly supervised brain tumor segmentation approach utilizing point and scribble supervision. Experts annotate only the slice with the largest tumor area by marking a single point near the tumor center or drawing a scribble within the tumor region. The method operates in two phases. First, labels are propagated to unlabelled pixels, generating a pseudo-ground-truth with three labels: tumor, non-tumor, and marginal pixels (unlabelled pixels surrounding the initial segmentation). Second, a segmentation model is trained using the pseudo-ground-truth and a loss function combining level-set and binary cross-entropy losses. Marginal pixels contribute to level-set loss computation, refining the segmentation process. The approach is validated on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes from BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show Dice scores comparable to fully supervised methods for whole tumor segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed weakly supervised strategy. This method reduces annotation effort while maintaining competitive segmentation performance, making it valuable for clinical applications.},

We presents a Multi-Domain Representation Network (MDRN) for unsupervised multi-domain learning. MDRN innovates by disentangling and preserving both domain-invariant and domain-specific features through an unsupervised cross-domain reconstruction task. It employs content encoders for domain-invariant features and multi-domain style encoders for domain-specific characteristics. By merging these features based on domain similarity, MDRN constructs a comprehensive feature space that enhances image reconstruction across domains. Additionally, MDRN integrates domain-specific classifiers, which learn domain classification and provide weighted fusion of domain-specific features. This design facilitates effective inter-domain distance measurement and feature integration. Experiments on PACS and DomainNet show MDRN's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art UDG approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in handling distribution shifts between source and target domains.},

Comparative performance evaluation with five state-of-the-art deep architectures such as MobileNet, EfficientNet-B7, Inceptionv3, ResNet-50 and VGG-16, and with published models such as COVIDNet-CT, COVNet, COVID-Net CT2, etc. is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Object detection based on deep learning plays an important role in the application of the Internet of Things (IoT). Traditional methods consume a lot of computing resources and cannot be well deployed in the IoT environment. A lightweight object detection method based on attention mechanism is proposed and applied to crowd counting. In view of the low accuracy and poor real-time performance of multi-scale crowd detection, we design a crowd counting model based on YOLO v5, and apply it to the IoT environment. It is proposed to insert the transformer into the YOLO v5 backbone network. Based on the multi-head attention mechanism in the transformer encoder, the global dependency is modelled to make full use of the context information. The CNN is used to realize the fusion of multi-scale feature maps, and the feature enhancement modules concerned by the attention network are further counted. Experiments show that it can not only detect multi-scale targets, but also achieve real-time performance in video surveillance scenes.},

  abstract     = {The use of the internet of things (IoT) is steadily increasing in a wide range of applications. Integration of IoT, computer vision, and artificial intelligence can improve people's daily life in various domains such as smart homes, smart cities, and smart industries. There are a large number of face recognition and face attribute recognition scenarios in reality, and the industry commonly decomposes these tasks, with three models responsible for handling face detection, face recognition, and face attribute recognition. The multi-model approach requires a lot of computational resources for context switching, while training one model with one dataset is not only complex, but also leads to overfitting of the multi-model approach. The authors propose a single-model multi-task approach, which can complete all tasks using only one model, and thus obtains a great improvement in inference speed, especially in scenes with high face density. After an experimental comparison, our approach saves a maximum of 96% of inference time, 49.5% of memory usage, and 59.7% of CPU time, avoids frequent context switching, and simplifies the training steps while improving the generalization performance of the model.},

  abstract     = {Classification of Hyperspectral Satellite Images (HSI) is a very important technology for object detection and cartography. Several problems can be detected, which make classification difficult (large size of the images, fusion between the classes, small amount of samples, etc.). Recently, several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-HSI) have been proposed for the classification of hyperspectral images. In this article, an improvement to CNN-HSI is proposed, aiming to reduce the number of erroneous pixels during classification (due to the limited number of samples). Thus, an extra-convolution technique (ExCNN) is proposed, where we add layers of global convolutions on the classified images, outgoing from classical CNN. The addition of 1 to 10 layers, on three real hyperspectral images, is tested. The results obtained are compared with other similar methods of the state of art, and show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

An overview of aviation accident analysis involving human factors is first conducted, followed by an introduction of several conceptual models and human reliability analysis methods. Finally, a specific framework for risk assessment of human factors in aviation is proposed. The human factors analysis and classification system structure combined with the quantitative method is the most frequently used mode in aviation accident analysis. From a macro ergonomic perspective, systematic consideration has been emphasised frequently in existing research. Pilots or individuals are thought to be associated with the organisations and environment they located in. On the other hand, the micro ergonomic aspect prefers a quantitative and probabilistic way to reveal the individual's failure mode or error rate. Based on previous studies, the proposed framework provides a systematic view to help with the evaluation of human performance in aviation, taking into account human issues as well as management and environmental factors.},

  abstract     = {In the field of oncology, lung cancer is a leading contributor to cancer-related mortality, highlighting the need for early detection of lung nodules for effective intervention. However, accurate segmentation of lung nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains a significant challenge due to issues such as heterogeneous nodule dimensions, low contrast, and their visual similarity with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Edge-Enhanced Feature Pyramid SwinUNet (EE-FPS-UNet), an advanced segmentation model that integrates a modified Swin Transformer with a feature pyramid network (FPN). The research objective is to enhance boundary delineation and multi-scale feature aggregation for improved segmentation performance. The proposed model uses the Swin Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and integrates an FPN for robust multi-scale feature aggregation. Its window-based self-attention mechanism also reduces computational complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution CT images. Additionally, an edge detection module enhances segmentation by providing edge-related features to the decoder, improving boundary precision. A comparative analysis evaluates the EE-FPS-UNet against leading models, including PSPNet, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms these models, achieving a Dice Similarity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.89, establishing its efficacy for lung nodule segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate point correspondences is critical for rigid point cloud registration in correspondence-based methods. Many previous learning-based methods employ encoder-decoder backbone for point feature extraction, while applying attention mechanism for sparse superpoints to deal with the partial overlap situation. However, few of these methods focus on the intermediate layers yet mainly pay attention on the top-most patch features, thus neglecting multi-faceted feature perspectives leading to potential overlap areas estimation inaccuracy. Meanwhile, obtaining correct correspondences is usually interfered with the one-to-many case and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level features extraction network with integrating linear dual attention mechanism into skip-connection stage of encoder-decoder backbone, both efficiently suppressing irrelevant information and guiding residual features to learn the common regions on which the network should focus to tackle the overlap estimation inaccuracy issue, combined with a parallel-structured decoder forming distinguishable features and potential overlapping regions. Additionally, a two-stage correspondences pruning process is designed to tackle the mismatch issue, which mainly depends on the rigid geometric constraint. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate our method's accuracy and stability, by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on registration recall.},

  abstract     = {Medical images often exhibit low and blurred contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues, with considerable variation in lesion edges and shapes even within the same disease, leading to significant challenges in segmentation. Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarise the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, the residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and the transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.},
