  abstract     = {Schizophrenia is a neurological disorder that is associated with several genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. The various prediction, detection, and classification techniques that can be used in order to catch the disease in early stages are noted in this paper. Some of the common machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), random forest, logistic regression, and also certain models that have been developed, particularly those by the PRONIA project and ENIGMA consortium, are compared in terms of their results and accuracy in schizophrenia detection. The aim is to identify which of these machine learning models performs the best. While a lot of developments have been made, there is much more that can be done in this particular field of psychosis. Additionally, a potential new model is proposed for future work. This article is categorized under:},

  abstract     = {The present systematic review gives a broad overview of the image-based datasets on which emotion has been classified. These datasets are categorized into three groups: (1) those containing only facial images, (2) those incorporating facial images with additional contextual body features, and (3) those based on visual components with physiological or audio signals. This paper discusses datasets in each category, focusing on their structure, emotion categories, emotion sources, anonymization level, and suitability for machine learning applications. A key aspect of this study is mapping emotions in the datasets analyzed to Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, allowing standardization based on a consistent psychological model. This alignment demonstrates the need for more thorough and balanced datasets encompassing a wider range of affective states and exposes discrepancies in the representation of emotions. Comprehensive statistics on each dataset are also provided in our study, allowing for comparisons on sample size, distribution of emotions, anonymization, and sources of emotion. To conclude, this study discusses future directions, for which multimodal datasets that incorporate images, audio, and biosignals are of high importance as are databases containing a larger variety of emotions mapped more evenly across Plutchik's model.

  abstract     = {Providing neural networks with the ability to learn new tasks sequentially represents one of the main challenges in artificial intelligence. Unlike humans, neural networks are prone to losing previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning proposes diverse solutions to mitigate this problem, but only a few leverage explainable artificial intelligence. This work justifies using explainability techniques in continual learning, emphasizing the need for greater transparency and trustworthiness in these systems and grounding our approach in empirical findings from neuroscience that highlight parallels between forgetting in biological and artificial neural networks. Finally, we review existing work applying explainability methods to address catastrophic forgetting and propose potential avenues for future research. This article is categorized under:},

  abstract     = {The global rise in fatty liver diseases is alarming. Traditional diagnostic methods include ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, and liver biopsies, the latter being the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enhanced liver biopsy accuracy, improving treatment outcomes. This study investigates how various AI techniques aid histopathologists, gastroenterologists, and liver specialists in diagnosing and assessing liver damage due to abnormal fat accumulation. We conducted a systematic review of AI applications in evaluating fatty liver diseases, particularly through histopathological image analysis. Our search encompassed five scientific databases: PubMed Central, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We focused on peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, theses, and book chapters, adhering to specific terminology. The data synthesis followed the PRISMA guidelines, comparing literature based on four key indices and their annual distribution. We evaluated 37 studies utilizing histopathological imaging for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, including related conditions, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. The review summarized the performance of various algorithms and explored the distribution of machine learning efforts. Given the complexity of histopathological images, AI algorithms can effectively stratify liver samples affected by fat. Our findings indicate that AI's diagnostic performance closely matches traditional pathological interpretations, offering reliable results for clinical applications.

Addressing these issues is resource-intensive, requiring comprehensive strategies to navigate their individual complexities and compounded effects. This article explores the dual challenges imposed by class imbalance and the absence of labeled data, along with their individual complexities and combined effects on the performance of the model. This study addresses approaches for handling the imbalance problem in datasets, such as data-level, algorithm-level, and deep learning methods. The survey also examines hybrid methodologies that integrate these strategies to tackle the compounded issues effectively. Emerging techniques like Bayesian graph-based learning, uncertainty-guided semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised approaches are also considered for their potential to address the scalability, noise filtering, and generalization challenges associated with imbalanced and unlabeled datasets. It identified persistent gaps, such as the lack of robust evaluation metrics and the underutilization of dynamic feature extraction techniques, suggesting solutions with advanced machine learning approaches. Additionally, the need for adaptive techniques, such as dynamic class weighting and data-driven filtering mechanisms, is highlighted to address limitations and improve the scalability of machine learning models in real-world applications.

Recognizing its potential, researchers from multiple fields have substantially progressed rPPG by establishing a strong theoretical basis for signal acquisition and developing signal processing and data-driven algorithms for rPPG extraction. While most rPPG reviews primarily focus on HR signal extraction methods, our research provides an overview of the potential scope of rPPG. We systematically organize research on rPPG signal acquisition and extraction techniques and provide a critical review of recent rPPG advancements in diverse health parameter estimation. Besides providing a thorough HR estimation review, we incorporate the extraction of derivative signals such as RR and SpO 2 from rPPG data, including their applications and limitations. We also highlight the adaptation of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV) techniques with rPPG technologies, and accumulate available critical rPPG resources like datasets, codes, and tutorials. Finally, we identify challenges and research gaps, such as motion artifacts, varying lighting conditions, and differences in skin tone. We aim to uplift advancements in rPPG systems by outlining future research directions.

The proliferation of crowdsourcing has made it much simpler to utilize the intelligence and adaptability of many people to learn new knowledge to solve the problem of acquiring new knowledge. In the past, numerous crowdsourcing works have highlighted multiple aspects; however, no surveys have been conducted that focus on the entire crowdsourcing process. This concentrated survey provides a comprehensive review of the technical advances from a systematic perspective. This survey systematically reviews technical advances for a crowdsourcing process that contains four dimensions: task modeling, crowdsourcing data acquisition, the learning process, and predictive model learning, and proposes a comprehensive and scalable framework from CROWD4AI (Crowdsourcing Framework with 4 Dimensions for Artificial Intelligence). In addition, this paper focuses on each dimension's potential challenges and future direction, encouraging researchers to participate in crowdsourcing. To bridge theory with practice, we also include a detailed case study that demonstrates the real-world application of our proposed framework in the context of annotating cultural heritage damages using crowdsourced input.

  abstract     = {With renewable energy being aggressively integrated into the grid, energy supplies are becoming vulnerable to weather and the environment, and are often incapable of meeting population demands at a large scale if not accurately predicted for energy planning. Understanding consumers' power demands ahead of time and the influences of weather on consumption and generation can help producers generate effective power management plans to support the target demand. In addition to the high correlation with the environment, consumers' behaviors also cause non-stationary characteristics of energy data, which is the main challenge for energy prediction. In this survey, we perform a review of the literature on prediction methods in the energy field. So far, most of the available research encompasses one type of generation or consumption. There is no research approaching prediction in the energy sector as a whole and its correlated features. We propose to address the energy prediction challenges from both consumption and generation sides, encompassing techniques from statistical to machine learning techniques. We also summarize the work related to energy prediction, electricity measurements, challenges related to energy consumption and generation, energy forecasting methods, and real-world energy forecasting resources, such as datasets and software solutions for energy prediction.

  abstract     = {Forecasting soil moisture is critical for keeping groundwater levels stable, monitoring droughts, and assisting agricultural productivity. Surface soil moisture has a tremendous impact on both the environment and society. To provide proper soil moisture, the right tools are required. Gravimetric, physical, and empirical models produce reliable results, but they are generally context-dependent and inappropriate for large-scale investigations. Remote sensing has developed as a credible technology for estimating large-scale soil moisture levels. However, various obstacles exist when getting soil moisture data using remote sensing, including the availability and precision of data sources. The spatial and temporal limits of many remote sensing sources, such as microwave and optical sensors, combined with environmental conditions, provide considerable feasibility issues. As a result, a robust model capable of accurately capturing both linear and nonlinear connections between multiple surface soil variables is critical. Recently, AI approaches have been identified as promising options for managing complicated factors in this domain. This review paper investigates the use of several AI algorithms for estimating soil moisture content (SMC). It focusses on AI-enabled frameworks built with remote sensing satellite imagery. In addition to including in situ observations, the study discusses the advantages of AI approaches, the issues they solve, and provides a detailed description of the integration of microwave, optical, and combination (synergistic) data sources. This paper also addresses the most common AI approaches applied with various types of remote sensing data and the results they produced. By exploring the strengths and technical problems associated with diverse data sources, this work hopes to help researchers make wise choices about data selection and model construction. Finally, the proposed future research directions are likely to assist emerging researchers in broadening the scope of this critical topic in a way that corresponds with future demands.

  abstract     = {Intracranial hemorrhage (IH) is a critical condition requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to ensure effective treatment and reduce mortality rates. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated significant potential in automating the detection and analysis of brain injuries in IH patients. However, the “black-box” nature of many AI systems raises concerns about transparency, reliability, and clinical applicability. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses these challenges by making AI models more interpretable, allowing healthcare professionals to understand and trust the decision-making processes. This review paper explores various XAI techniques—such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and its variants—and their specific applications in IH clinical tasks. We systematically examine studies incorporating XAI for curing IH patients, highlighting how these methods enhance model transparency and support clinical decision-making. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to select the papers. Studies are categorized into those using tabular data and those using image data. The literature indicates a rapidly growing number of XAI publications in this field. SHAP is the most commonly used XAI method for tabular data, while CAM-based methods, such as Grad-CAM, dominate in image-based applications. Furthermore, we discuss current limitations of XAI methods and future research directions. This review aims to provide researchers and clinicians with valuable insights into the role of XAI in improving the reliability and practical integration of AI-driven tools for IH patient care.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. To achieve this, we conducted a literature review based on PRISMA methodology, deriving key insights in the field of cyber abuse detection. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models—highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics by offering both theoretical and practical insights into the evolving landscape of cyber abuse, as well as the technological innovations that simultaneously mitigate and exacerbate it. The findings support platform administrators and policymakers in developing more effective moderation strategies, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and integrating AI responsibly to create safer digital environments.

This paper offers a systematic review of HSN Analysis, addressing the theoretical and practical challenges associated with investigating the interplay between varied node types and diverse relationships within HSNs. The paper begins by defining HSNs and outlining their characteristics, highlighting the existence of diverse entity kinds and a range of relationship types. It explores the significance of HSNs in modeling real-world systems, including online social platforms, biological networks, e-commerce networks, and recommendation systems, where diverse entities play distinct roles. The analysis of HSNs extends beyond traditional homogeneous networks, incorporating various types of nodes and edges, and introduces novel considerations for effective analysis. The difficulties in modeling, representing, and analyzing HSNs will be covered in this work. Several reviews of social network analysis have been published in the past, but they often focus on simple networks, not HSN analysis specifically. This paper aims to fill that gap by comprehensively reviewing different aspects of HSN and its analysis. We start with the fundamentals of HSNs, explore its major types-multi-relational networks and multi-modal networks and further their impact on popular data mining tasks. Then, we explore various applications of heterogeneous information network analysis, like recommender systems, text mining, fraud detection, and e-commerce.

  abstract     = {The maintenance advancements achieved in Industry 4.0 generate large amounts of data, necessitating complete, accurate, and precise labels for training datasets to align with corresponding ground truth. These labels serve as annotations for early anomaly detection. Delivering high-quality annotations derived from weak labels and striking a balance between annotation efforts and accuracy are critical tasks. Consequently, researchers have focused their attention on Weakly Supervised Learning methods, which have shown effectiveness in handling datasets characterized by incomplete, imprecise, and erroneous labels across various maintenance applications. In this survey, the authors aim to address a gap in the existing literature by conducting a comprehensive examination of Weakly Supervised Learning for Predictive Maintenance, categorizing related works. Furthermore, the survey discusses challenges and identifies open research lines.},

  abstract     = {With the growing reliance on LLMs for a wide range of NLP tasks, optimizing the use of labeled and unlabeled data for effective context generation has become critical. This work explores the interplay between two prominent methodologies in few-shot learning: in-context learning (ICL), which utilizes labeled task-specific data, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which leverages unlabeled external knowledge to augment generative models. Since each has its individual limitations, we propose a novel hybrid approach to obtain “the best of both worlds” by dynamically integrating both labeled and unlabeled data towards improving the downstream performance of LLMs. Our methodology, which we call LU-RAG (labeled and unlabeled RAG), recomputes the scores of top- k labeled instances and top- m unlabeled passages to refine context selection. Our experimental results demonstrate that LU-RAG consistently outperforms both standalone ICL and RAG across multiple benchmarks, showing significant gains in downstream performance. Furthermore, we show that LU-RAG performs better with a semantic neighborhood as compared to a lexical one, highlighting its ability to generalize effectively.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems predict user interests and recommend items for online platforms including e-commerce, social networks, and decision systems. However, data bias has become a significant obstacle, severely impacting the accuracy, fairness, and reliability of recommendation results. This survey examines causal inference for optimizing recommendation systems and mitigating data bias, addressing three questions: (1) Bias types and performance impacts; (2) Causal inference mitigation methods; (3) Approach advantages, limitations, and research opportunities. The motivation for this survey stems from the limitations of traditional debiasing methods, which often fail to account for causal relationships and struggle in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Causal inference provides a robust framework for identifying and addressing the underlying causes of bias, enabling more transparent and accurate recommendation systems. Therefore, we define three critical stages of bias: bias in the data stage, model selection stage, and model evaluation stage. For each stage, causal inference-based optimization methods are introduced and critically analyzed. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this study analyzes data augmentation and regularization techniques as potential strategies for future research. The whole research might highlight the ability of causal inference to uncover and control confounding factors, offering deeper insights into the mechanisms driving biases.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Document Classification (ADC) refers to the process of automatically categorizing or labeling documents into predefined classes or categories. Its effectiveness may depend on various factors, including the models used for the formal representation of documents, the classification techniques applied, or a combination of both. Recently, Transformer models have gained popularity due to their pre-training on large corpora, allowing for flexible knowledge transfer to downstream tasks, such as ADC. However, such models can face challenges when handling “long” documents, particularly due to input sequence length constraints, which can have knock-on effects on the task we refer to as Automatic Long Document Classification (ALDC). Distinct models for tackling this limitation of Transformers have been proposed over the past few years, and employed to perform ALDC; however, their application to this task has resulted in some inconsistent outcomes, struggles to surpass simple baselines, and difficulties in generalizing across diverse datasets and scenarios. That is why this survey aims to illustrate these limitations, by: (i) presenting current long document representation issues and solutions proposed in the literature; (ii) based on such solutions, illustrating a comprehensive analysis of their application in ALDC and their effectiveness; and (iii) discussing current evaluation strategies in ALDC with particular reference to suitable baselines and actual long-document benchmark datasets.},

Various data types are reviewed, including tabular data, medical imaging, and clinical text, offering a comprehensive perspective on XAI applications. Key findings identify significant gaps, such as the limited availability of public datasets, suboptimal data preprocessing techniques, insufficient feature selection and engineering, and the limited utilization of multiple XAI methods. Additionally, the lack of standardized XAI evaluation metrics and practical obstacles in integrating XAI systems into clinical workflows are emphasized. We provide actionable recommendations, including the design of explainability-centric models, the application of diverse and multiple XAI methods, and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration. These strategies aim to guide researchers in building robust AI models, assist technology developers in creating intuitive and user-friendly AI tools, and inform policymakers in establishing effective regulations.

  abstract     = {Anomaly predicated upon multiple distributed hybrid sensors frequently uses hybrid approaches, integrating techniques derived from statistical analysis, probability, data mining, machine learning, deep learning, and signal denoising. Many of these methods are based on the analysis of irregularities, data continuity, correlation, and data consistency, aiming to discern anomalous patterns from normal behavior. By leveraging these techniques information fusion aims to enhance situational awareness, detect potential threats or abnormalities, and improve decision-making processes in complex environments. It addresses uncertainties by integrating data from diverse sources, thereby enhancing performance, and reducing dependency on individual sensors. This study examines applications based on single and multiple sensor data, revealing common strategies, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and potential solutions for detecting and diagnosing anomalies by analyzing low, large, and complex data derived from the context of homogeneous or heterogeneous systems. Information fusion techniques are evaluated for their performance on various levels of algorithm complexity. This in-depth bibliographic study involved searching top indexing databases such as Web of Science and Scopus. The inclusion criteria were articles published between 2012 and 2024. The search capitalized on specific keywords as follows: “sensor malfunction,” “sensor anomaly,” “sensor failure,” “sensor fusion,” and “anomaly data mining.” Publications that did not strictly focus on analytical processing for anomaly detection, diagnosis, and prognosis in sensor data were excluded. In conclusion, the practice of information fusion promotes transparency by elucidating the process of combining information, thereby enabling the inclusion of multitude of perspectives, and aligning with established best practices in the field. Data deviation remains the primary criterion for detecting anomalies using mostly deep learning and extensively hybrid techniques. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art algorithms based on neural networks still require further contextual interpretation and analysis. Functional safety and safety of intended functionality breaching can lead to decision-making errors, physical harm, and erosion of trust in autonomous systems. This is due to the lack of interpretability in AI approaches, making it challenging to predict and understand the system's behavior under various conditions.},

Traditional review papers offer a way to mitigate these difficulties but are often time-consuming and labor-intensive. This article introduces a novel AI-assisted narrative review methodology that integrates advanced text retrieval and visualization techniques, enhanced with geometric features, to address this. The proposed approach relies on the automatic identification of research topics/clusters within a large different document corpus of different time periods. This approach not only facilitates the systematic exploration of trends over time but also serves as a valuable adjunct, enabling experts to focus on specific, homogeneous areas within scientific fields/clusters. Initially, the methodology in its generality and mapping of the evolution of emerging topics are described, revealing the temporal dynamics and interconnections within the literature of time series anomalies. Subsequently, the proposed method is applied to time series data and an in-depth exploration of the identified dominant cluster is presented. The cluster involves advanced techniques and models for anomaly detection in time series analysis. Focusing on such a homogeneous subfield enables the derivation of a wealth of characteristics and outcomes regarding the evolution of this topic, revealing its temporal dynamics and trends. The review process demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed AI-driven approach in literature reviews and provides researchers with a powerful tool to synthesize and interpret complex, dynamically changing, advanced scientific fields.},

  abstract     = {Causality and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have developed as separate fields in computer science, even though the underlying concepts of causation and explanation share common ancient roots. This is further enforced by the lack of review works jointly covering these two fields. In this paper, we investigate the literature to try to understand how and to what extent causality and XAI are intertwined. More precisely, we seek to uncover what kinds of relationships exist between the two concepts and how one can benefit from them, for instance, in building trust in AI systems. As a result, three main perspectives are identified. In the first one, the lack of causality is seen as one of the major limitations of current AI and XAI approaches, and the “optimal” form of explanations is investigated. The second is a pragmatic perspective and considers XAI as a tool to foster scientific exploration for causal inquiry, via the identification of pursue-worthy experimental manipulations. Finally, the third perspective supports the idea that causality is propaedeutic to XAI in three possible manners: exploiting concepts borrowed from causality to support or improve XAI, utilizing counterfactuals for explainability, and considering accessing a causal model as explaining itself. To complement our analysis, we also provide relevant software solutions used to automate causal tasks. We believe our work provides a unified view of the two fields of causality and XAI by highlighting potential domain bridges and uncovering possible limitations.},

Many of these applications use neuromorphic sensors as input devices. We have surveyed three specific neuromorphic computers viz. SpiNNaker, TrueNorth, Loihi, and one neuromorphic sensor viz.

As central features in the EU's shifting security regime, ETIAS and facial recognition technologies deploy algorithmic profiling and biometric risk assessment to screen visa-exempt third-country nationals. The research systematically examines the decision-making processes of ETIAS and the overall facial recognition system, demonstrating the interplay between algorithmic risk assessments and discretionary human discretion by national authorities. It contends that the algorithmic profiling lack of transparency, combined with sweeping national security exceptions, produces a procedural void, in which the right to reasoned decisions and effective remedies is compromised. Second, the use of interoperable databases and risk indicators puts core data protection principles into jeopardy, notably purpose limitation and the right to be forgotten. This paper also argues that ETIAS and the application of facial recognition technologies represent a larger trend toward “techno-regulatory assemblages” in EU governance, where technological infrastructures increasingly influence legal and administrative decisions. It critically assesses whether the human oversight mechanisms incorporated within ETIAS National Units are adequate to prevent the risks involved in automated decision-making, especially in the face of strict time pressures and security requirements. The study detects a latent paradox: though these systems aim to strengthen a “Security Union,” they might inadvertently lead to an “Insecurity Union” by undermining transparency, procedural protections, and citizen rights.},

The prevalence of Lithium-ion batteries is evident, playing its clear role in the operation of small devices as well as large systems such as electric vehicles, flying devices, mobile devices, and more. Monitoring lithium-ion battery health is crucial for assessing, minimizing degradation, preventing explosions, and enabling timely replacements. Assessing health often involves predicting state-of-health (SoH) or remaining useful life (RUL), with numerous studies dedicated to this field. Hence, many research studies have been conducted on predicting SoH, with a primary focus on data-driven methods based on machine learning, owing to the recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To provide a systematic overview of the trends in this emerging problem, we present a comprehensive survey of classified SoH forecasting methods, with a primary focus on data-driven approaches. The paper also offers an in-depth focus on recent advancements in deep learning (DL) models, an area that has not been thoroughly discussed previously. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of input features and emphasize the critical role of temporal attributes incorporated into the models. The insights provided in this paper offer readers a comprehensive understanding of the field, equipping them to effectively advance related future work.},

One specific application of EPM is curriculum mining, which focuses on understanding the learning program students follow to achieve educational goals. This is important for institutional curriculum decision-making and quality improvement. Therefore, academic institutions can benefit from organizing the existing techniques, capabilities, and limitations. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify works on applying PM to curricular analysis and provide insights for further research. We reviewed 27 primary studies published across seven major databases. Our analysis classified these studies into five main research objectives: discovery of educational trajectories, identification of deviations in student behavior, bottleneck analysis, dropout/stopout analysis, and generation of recommendations. Key findings highlight challenges such as standardization to facilitate cross-university analysis, better integration of process and data mining techniques, and improved tools for educational stakeholders.

Breaking down silos between law, social sciences, and natural sciences is critical for all processes of disaster risk reduction. It is essential to explore how AI enhances understanding of legal frameworks and environmental management, while also examining how legal and environmental factors may limit AI's role in society. From a co-production review perspective, drawing on insights from lawyers, social scientists, and environmental scientists, principles for responsible data mining are proposed based on safety, transparency, fairness, accountability, and contestability. This discussion offers a blueprint for interdisciplinary collaboration to create adaptive law systems based on AI integration of knowledge from environmental and social sciences. When social networks are useful for mitigating disaster risks based on AI, the legal implications related to privacy and liability of the outcomes of disaster management must be considered. Fair and accountable principles emphasize environmental considerations and foster socioeconomic discussions related to public engagement. AI also has an important role to play in education, bringing together the next generations of law, social sciences, and natural sciences to work on interdisciplinary solutions in harmony. Although emerging AI approaches can be powerful tools for disaster management, they must be implemented with ethical considerations and safeguards to address concerns about bias, transparency, and privacy. The responsible execution of AI approaches, based on the dynamic interplay between AI, law, and environmental risk, promotes sustainable and equitable practices in data mining.},

  abstract     = {Data mining and natural language processing (NLP) are fundamental fields that interact in many ways. Text mining shares many topics, such as sentiment analysis and content understanding. Combining these two fields enables more efficient mining of text data and the extraction of valuable information. In particular, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture has achieved success in image generation and has started to be used on text data. However, training GANs is fraught with difficulties due to the complexity of text data. Linguistic studies show important differences between languages. Language is characterized by fluidity, ambiguity, and context-sensitive interpretations, and text-generating GAN models can struggle to deal with these complexities. The interaction between data quality, language structure, and complex interpretation can lead to inconsistency and ambiguity in the text production of GAN models. These problems are particularly pronounced when complexities such as semantic subtleties, idiomatic expressions, and context-dependent usages come into play. Text generation is an area of GAN models used in NLP to generate language and enrich text-based applications. Work in this area can contribute to analyzing, classifying, and processing text data. Many methods and techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of text GANs. However, some problems may be encountered in the optimization of these methods. Therefore, it is essential to use optimized methods. In conclusion, GANs can be an important tool to improve text generation in NLP. Still, they require continuous research and innovation to deal with factors such as language complexity and data quality.},

This systematic review examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically detect these conditions using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), we reviewed 74 carefully selected studies published between 2013 and August 2024 that used machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), or both of these two methods to detect neurological and mental health disorders automatically using EEG signals. The most common and most prevalent neurological and mental health disorder types were sourced from major databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. Epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease are the most studied conditions that meet our evaluation criteria, 32, 12, and 10 studies were identified on these topics, respectively. Conversely, the number of studies meeting our criteria regarding stress, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and autism spectrum disorders was relatively more average: 6, 4, 3, and 3, respectively. The diseases that least met our evaluation conditions were one study each of seizure, stroke, anxiety diseases, and one study examining Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy together. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were most widely used in ML methods, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominated DL approaches. DL methods generally outperformed traditional ML, as they yielded higher performance using huge EEG data. We observed that the complex decision process during feature extraction from EEG signals in ML-based models significantly impacted results, while DL-based models handled this more efficiently. AI-based EEG analysis shows promise for automated detection of neurological and mental health conditions. Future research should focus on multi-disease studies, standardizing datasets, improving model interpretability, and developing clinical decision support systems to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.},

Some of them, such as trace clustering, trace classification, and anomalous trace detection require a preliminary preprocessing step in which the raw data is encoded into a numerical feature space. To this end, encoding techniques are used to generate vectorial representations of process traces. Most of the PM literature provides trace encoding techniques that look at the control flow, that is, only encode the sequence of activities that characterize a process trace disregarding other process data that is fundamental for effectively describing the process behavior. To fill this gap, in this article we show 19 trace encoding methods that work in a multi-perspective manner, that is, by embedding events and trace attributes in addition to activity names into the vectorial representations of process traces. We also provide an extensive experimental study where these techniques are applied to real-life datasets and compared to each other.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, machine learning (ML) has witnessed a paradigm shift in kernel function selection, which is pivotal in optimizing various ML models. Despite multiple studies about its significance, a comprehensive understanding of kernel function selection, particularly about model performance, still needs to be explored. Challenges remain in selecting and optimizing kernel functions to improve model performance and efficiency. The study investigates how gamma parameter and cost parameter influence performance metrics in multi-class classification tasks using various kernel-based algorithms. Through sensitivity analysis, the impact of these parameters on classification performance and computational efficiency is assessed. The experimental setup involves deploying ML models using four kernel-based algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function, Polynomial Kernel, and Sigmoid Kernel. Data preparation includes text processing, categorization, and feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer, followed by model training and validation. Results indicate that Support Vector Machine with default settings and Radial Basis Function kernel consistently outperforms polynomial and sigmoid kernels. Adjusting gamma improves model accuracy and precision, highlighting its role in capturing complex relationships. Regularization cost parameters, however, show minimal impact on performance. The study also reveals that configurations with moderate gamma values achieve better balance between performance and computational time compared to higher gamma values or no gamma adjustment. The findings underscore the delicate balance between model performance and computational efficiency by highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In customer-oriented systems, customer lifetime value (CLV) has been of significant importance for academia and marketing practitioners, especially within the scope of analytical modeling. CLV is a critical approach to managing and organizing a company's profitability. With the vast availability of consumer data, business analytics (BA) tools and approaches, alongside CLV models, have been applied to gain deeper insights into customer behaviors and decision-making processes. Despite the recognized importance of CLV, there is a noticeable gap in comprehensive analyses and reviews of BA techniques applied to CLV. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art investigations on CLV models integrated with BA approaches, thereby contributing to a research agenda in this field. The review methodology consists of three main steps: identification of relevant studies, creating a coding plan, and ensuring coding reliability. First, relevant studies were identified using predefined keywords. Next, a coding plan—one of the study's significant contributions—was developed to evaluate these studies comprehensively. Finally, the coding plan's reliability was tested by three experts before being applied to the selected studies. Additionally, specific evaluation criteria in the coding plan were implemented to introduce new insights. This study presents exciting and valuable results from various perspectives, providing a crucial reference for academic researchers and marketing practitioners interested in the intersection of BA and CLV.},

  abstract     = {Dissolution refers to the process in which solvent molecules and solute molecules attract and combine with each other. The extensive solubility data generated from the dissolution of various compounds under different conditions, is distributed across structured or semi-structured formats in various media, such as text, web pages, tables, images, and databases. These data exhibit multi-source and unstructured features, aligning with the typical 5 V characteristics of big data. A solubility big data technology system has emerged under the fusion of solubility data and big data technologies. However, the acquisition, fusion, storage, representation, and utilization of solubility big data are encountering new challenges. Knowledge Graphs, known as extensive systems for representing and applying knowledge, can effectively describe entities, concepts, and relations across diverse domains. The construction of solubility big data knowledge graph holds substantial value in the retrieval, analysis, utilization, and visualization of solubility knowledge. Throwing out a brick to attract a jade, this paper focuses on the solubility big data knowledge graph and, firstly, summarizes the architecture of solubility knowledge graph construction. Secondly, the key technologies such as knowledge extraction, knowledge fusion, and knowledge reasoning of solubility big data are emphasized, along with summarizing the common machine learning methods in knowledge graph construction. Furthermore, this paper explores application scenarios, such as knowledge question answering and recommender systems for solubility big data. Finally, it presents a prospective view of the shortcomings, challenges, and future directions related to the construction of solubility big data knowledge graph. This article proposes the research direction of solubility big data knowledge graph, which can provide technical references for constructing a solubility knowledge graph. At the same time, it serves as a comprehensive medium for describing data, resources, and their applications across diverse fields such as chemistry, materials, biology, energy, medicine, and so on. It further aids in knowledge retrieval and mining, analysis and utilization, and visualization across various disciplines.},

However, the rapid growth in knowledge creation and the rising number of publications have made this task increasingly complex and challenging. Moreover, most systematic literature reviews are performed manually, which requires significant effort and creates potential bias. The risk of bias is particularly relevant in the data synthesis task, where researchers interpret each study's evidence and summarize the results. This study uses an experimental approach to explore using machine learning (ML) techniques in the SLR process. Specifically, this study replicates a study that manually performed sentiment analysis for the data synthesis step to determine the polarity (negative or positive) of evidence extracted from studies in the field of agile methodology. This study employs a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis and achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 86.5% in identifying study evidence polarity.},

  abstract     = {To improve data analysis and feature learning, this study compares the effectiveness of quantum dimensionality reduction (qDR) techniques to classical ones. In this study, we investigate several qDR techniques on a variety of datasets such as quantum Gaussian distribution adaptation (qGDA), quantum principal component analysis (qPCA), quantum linear discriminant analysis (qLDA), and quantum t-SNE (qt-SNE). The Olivetti Faces, Wine, Breast Cancer, Digits, and Iris are among the datasets used in this investigation. Through comparison evaluations against well-established classical approaches, such as classical PCA (cPCA), classical LDA (cLDA), and classical GDA (cGDA), and using well-established metrics like loss, fidelity, and processing time, the effectiveness of these techniques is assessed. The findings show that cPCA produced positive results with the lowest loss and highest fidelity when used on the Iris dataset. On the other hand, quantum uniform manifold approximation and projection (qUMAP) performs well and shows strong fidelity when tested against the Wine dataset, but ct-SNE shows mediocre performance against the Digits dataset. Isomap and locally linear embedding (LLE) function differently depending on the dataset. Notably, LLE showed the largest loss and lowest fidelity on the Olivetti Faces dataset. The hypothesis testing findings showed that the qDR strategies did not significantly outperform the classical techniques in terms of maintaining pertinent information from quantum datasets. More specifically, the outcomes of paired t -tests show that when it comes to the ability to capture complex patterns, there are no statistically significant differences between the cPCA and qPCA, the cLDA and qLDA, and the cGDA and qGDA. According to the findings of the assessments of mutual information (MI) and clustering accuracy, qPCA may be able to recognize patterns more clearly than standardized cPCA. Nevertheless, there is no discernible improvement between the qLDA and qGDA approaches and their classical counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Reliable deployment of machine learning models such as neural networks continues to be challenging due to several limitations. Some of the main shortcomings are the lack of interpretability and the lack of robustness against adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper, we comprehensively review the possibilities and limits of adversarial attacks for explainable machine learning models. First, we extend the notion of adversarial examples to fit in explainable machine learning scenarios where a human assesses not only the input and the output classification, but also the explanation of the model's decision. Next, we propose a comprehensive framework to study whether (and how) adversarial examples can be generated for explainable models under human assessment. Based on this framework, we provide a structured review of the diverse attack paradigms existing in this domain, identify current gaps and future research directions, and illustrate the main attack paradigms discussed. Furthermore, our framework considers a wide range of relevant yet often ignored factors such as the type of problem, the user expertise or the objective of the explanations, in order to identify the attack strategies that should be adopted in each scenario to successfully deceive the model (and the human). The intention of these contributions is to serve as a basis for a more rigorous and realistic study of adversarial examples in the field of explainable machine learning.},
