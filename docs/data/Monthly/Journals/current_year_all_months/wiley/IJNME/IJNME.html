  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling complex thermo-mechanical fracture behavior. A high-order element formulation is established on the basis of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM) to perform spatial discretization of transient heat conduction problems. Due to the use of hierarchical, high-order shape functions, temperature gradients can be effectively captured even on relatively coarse meshes. The discretized transient heat conduction equation is subsequently solved using an implicit time integration scheme, specifically, the backward difference method. Numerical validation against the commercial software ABAQUS demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach in simulating heat transfer and predicting thermoelastic deformation fields under mixed thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, HQEM is integrated with the virtual crack closure method (VCCM) for the evaluation of fracture parameters in two-dimensional cracked structures subjected to coupled thermo-mechanical loadings. Within the VCCM framework, a unified explicit expression of the virtual crack closure integral is derived for HQEM with arbitrary nodal configurations. The integration of HQEM with VCCM significantly reduces mesh refinement requirements and preprocessing effort compared to conventional FEM. Case studies confirm that the integrated HQEM–VCCM approach yields accurate solutions for fracture parameters of cracked structures under coupled thermo-mechanical conditions.},

The study focuses on defining and examining various types of consensus within this model, addressing strict and more relaxed disagreements. The consensus problem is then explored at the coalition level. The key properties and quantitative measures for evaluating consensus quality are discussed. Finally, the negotiation process is investigated. The first approach is based on the expanding range of preferences derived from different definitions of consensus, and the second is focusing on issues position adjustment in order-based conflict situation. Using examples, including a medical case with multiple specialists, the paper demonstrates the practical utility of the methods. In general, this work improves the understanding of preference-based conflicts and the possibility of consensus, contributing to more effective decision-making processes.},

In this method, the governing equations are spatially discretized within the framework of the total Lagrangian material point method (TLMPM) and temporally discretized using an explicit time integration scheme. To address the issue of decreased computational accuracy of the material point method (MPM) near physical domain boundaries, a Gaussian kernel function with kernel correction is employed to establish the interpolation formulas between particles and the background grid. Furthermore, to mitigate volumetric locking caused by the nearly incompressible nature of soft materials, the F -bar method is further developed within the framework of TLMPM. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed STLMPM are demonstrated by several representative numerical examples, and the simulation results are compared with analytical solutions and other numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {The long-term performance of pavement structures is influenced by the combined effects of repeated traffic loads and environmental conditions, such as temperature variations. Traditional numerical approaches face significant challenges in simulating the decades-long lifespan of pavements due to the vast disparity between the time scales of individual loading events and the overall lifespan. This paper presents a novel framework for the thermo-mechanical analysis of pavement structures, based on a time homogenization technique to efficiently predict long-term performance. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is employed to simulate the mechanical response of pavements to consecutive tire overruns, while a thermo-mechanical material model accounts for the effects of temperature variations. A key innovation is the treatment of history variables (HVs). The framework incorporates both spatial and temporal mapping of HVs, enabling the extrapolation of material behavior when the evolution rate of HVs stabilizes. This allows for the skipping of computationally expensive tire overruns, significantly reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy. Numerical examples demonstrate the framework's ability to predict the long-term response of pavement structures under realistic traffic and thermal conditions.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

Computational methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) typically face convergence problems for such microstructures unless specific discretizations are used, most prominently the discretization on the staggered grid. FFT-based methods were originally developed for periodic boundary conditions, and recent work provided extensions to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the unit cube faces by utilizing dedicated sine and cosine series. Unfortunately, such approaches were only developed for discretizations that fail to converge for complex porous microstructures. The article at hand closes this gap by constructing the appropriate Eshelby-Green operator for the displacement gradient associated with the staggered grid discretization and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eponymous staggering of the displacement variables infers certain challenges to be resolved, that is, the construction is significantly more difficult than for the cases discussed in the literature. However, our innovative techniques permit treating the class of microporous materials—which have a wide range of applicability—in a robust and efficient way. We showcase the superiority of the novel techniques via dedicated computational experiments.},

Their popularity comes from their effective minimization of expensive function evaluations, their capability to leverage gradients, and their efficient use of noisy data. Bayesian optimizers have commonly been applied to global unconstrained problems, with limited development for many other classes of problems. In this article, two alternative methods are developed that enable rapid and deep convergence of nonlinearly-constrained local optimization problems using a Bayesian optimizer. The first method uses an exact augmented Lagrangian and the second augments the minimization of the acquisition function to contain additional constraints. Both of these methods can be applied to nonlinear equality constraints, unlike most previous methods developed for constrained Bayesian optimizers. The new methods are applied with a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer and enable deeper convergence for three nonlinearly-constrained unimodal optimization problems than previously developed methods for constrained Bayesian optimization. In addition, both new methods enable the Bayesian optimizer to reach a desired tolerance with fewer function evaluations than popular quasi-Newton optimizers from SciPy and MATLAB for unimodal problems with 2 to 30 variables. The Bayesian optimizer had similar results using both methods. It is recommended that users first try using the second method, which adds constraints to the acquisition function minimization, since its parameters are more intuitive to tune for new problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a flexible multi-body dynamics approach for elastic smooth and non-smooth shells undergoing large deformations and large overall motions. The formulation is based on a co-rotational curved quadrilateral shell element employing vectorial rotational variables and a quasi energy and momentum conservation algorithm. Hamilton's principle is adopted to derive the system's dynamic differential equations. When differentiating the kinetic energy functional with respect to time, the part involving the first-order differentiation of vectorial rotational variables with respect to time is integrated into an equivalent load vector, yielding a symmetric equivalent mass matrix. Accelerations, velocities, displacements, body, and surface loads of the generalized midpoints are generated by convex functions. The Newmark scheme is applied to transform the dynamic differential equations of the system into a set of nonlinear equations. Instead of using strains and their first/second derivatives with respect to local nodal variables at the midpoint configuration, the formulation employs time-averaged assumed strains (computed via the MITC method) and their corresponding derivatives evaluated at both ends of the time step for calculating the internal force vector and element tangent stiffness matrix in the local coordinate system. The transformation matrix from local to global coordinates, however, remains computed at the midpoint configuration. This approach ensures near-exact conservation of total energy and exact conservation of linear and angular momenta once the external loads vanish, while also yielding symmetric tangent stiffness matrices in both local and global coordinate systems. Finally, four examples of three smooth shells and one non-smooth shell problems subjected to impulse loads are solved to verify the proposed formulation for flexible multi-body dynamics of shells. It is shown that the results exhibit excellent agreement with those from other references, demonstrating the reliability, accuracy, and long-term stability of the proposed quasi energy and momentum conserving algorithm.},

For systems with multiple outputs, traditional sensitivity analysis methods are typically carried out for each system response individually. However, obtaining the importance of variables from the system-level view still needs objective decision support. To address this issue, this study proposes a multi-output system sensitivity decision-making method based on evidence theory. The proposed method first conducts surrogate model-based Sobol sensitivity analysis for each output of the system. Subsequently, the global sensitivity information for each output is used as evidence to construct a basic probability assignment, according to a rule defined for determining basic probability assignment. Finally, a synthesis rule is applied to calculate comprehensive sensitivity information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through validation with three numerical examples and one engineering case. This method provides more objective and rational decision support for sensitivity analysis of multi-output systems, offering significant potential benefits in parametric studies of complex systems.},

The stabilization parameter is defined as where denotes the finite-element mesh size and is the shear modulus; this choice, derived via eigenvalue analysis-ensures robustness against volumetric locking while preserving consistency. The nonlinear system of algebraic equations is solved via a Newton–Raphson scheme with a block-preconditioned GMRES solver, achieving optimal displacement convergence rates (comparable to Taylor–Hood elements). Validated on benchmarks including Cook's membrane and a pressurized neo-Hookean cylinder, the method demonstrates optimal displacement convergence and less than 2% error in reaction forces compared to Abaqus. It reduces degrees of freedom by 30%–40% and solve times by 35% relative to Taylor–Hood elements, as shown in weak scaling tests. An industrial case study on seal compression under 4 mm displacement highlights its capability to handle contact mechanics and geometric nonlinearities, with pressure oscillations suppressed below 5%. The framework's open-source implementation, combined with its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness under mesh distortion (aspect ratios up to 5:1) and near-incompressibility ( ), makes it a versatile tool for engineering applications. Key advancements include a theoretically grounded stabilization strategy, computational efficiency gains, and seamless integration into industrial workflows.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a unified variational framework for deriving the evolution equation of the level set function in topology optimization, departing from conventional Hamilton–Jacobi-based formulations. The key idea is the introduction of an auxiliary domain, geometrically identical to the physical design domain, occupied by fictitious matter which is dynamically excited by the conditions prevailing in the design domain. By assigning kinetic and potential energy to this matter and interpreting the level set function as the generalized coordinate to describe its deformation, the governing equation of motion is determined via Hamilton's principle, yielding a modified wave equation. Appropriate combinations of model parameters enable the recovery of classical physical behaviors, including the standard and biharmonic wave equations. The evolution problem is formulated in weak form using variational methods and implemented in the software environment FreeFEM++. The influence of the numerical parameters is analyzed on the example of minimum mean compliance. The results demonstrate that topological complexity and strut design can be effectively controlled by the respective parameters. Notably, the proposed formulation inherently supports the nucleation of new holes and maintains a well-defined level set function without requiring explicit re-initialization procedures, both of which emerge naturally from the physically motivated variational framework. The inclusion of a damping term further enhances numerical stability. To showcase the versatility and robustness of our method, we also apply it to compliant mechanism design and a bi-objective optimization problem involving self-weight and compliance minimization under local stress constraints.},

  abstract     = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been extensively studied for several decades, yet accurate calculation of pressure fields remains a significant challenge, hindering its widespread application in practical engineering. This paper focuses on developing a novel density correction method to enhance the accuracy of hydrostatic pressure distribution in SPH, both near solid boundaries and within the fluid domain. The method incorporates two innovative concepts: an interpolation grid and supplementary particles, both aimed at refining density distributions. The proposed method is straightforward to implement, making it accessible for a wide range of applications. It proves highly effective in calculating improved hydrostatic pressure fields in high-pressure regions close to solid boundaries. Moreover, the proposed method effectively suppresses unphysical oscillations and peaks in the hydrodynamic pressure fields while alleviating unintended numerical dissipation that often occurs in long-term simulations. Additionally, the method offers greater flexibility in determining the correction interval and demonstrates excellent compatibility with various solid boundary treatments. The performance of the proposed method is validated through several numerical tests, and comparisons with other related numerical schemes are presented.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional transport codes for the simulation of tokamak plasmas are simplified versions of full 3D fluid models, where plasma turbulence is averaged out. One of the main challenges in such reduced models is to accurately reconstruct transverse transport fluxes that arise from the averaging of stresses due to fluctuations. These transverse fluxes are typically approximated by ad-hoc diffusion coefficients (turbulent eddy viscosity), manually adjusted to align numerical solutions with experimental observations. They can vary significantly depending on the type of tokamak, the experimental conditions, and even the location within the device, severely limiting the predictive capability of these codes for new configurations. To address this issue, we recently proposed an innovative approach to fusion plasma simulations by introducing two additional transport equations for turbulence-related variables (specifically, the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate ) into the mean-flow system to estimate the turbulent eddy viscosity. This approach also introduces new free parameters, but they are primarily governed by the underlying transport physics and thus exhibit considerably less variation across devices and plasma regions. In this article, we continue an ongoing study of data assimilation techniques to determine the free parameters of the model for transverse turbulent plasma transport. Based on digital twin experiments within the framework of equations averaged over the magnetic surfaces of the tokamak, we provide an in-depth study of optimization strategies to improve the performance of the calibration algorithm in a complex configuration with considerable scale variation of the parameters.},

After identifying the frequencies, material properties are determined by solving an optimization problem. However, if the experimental frequencies are affected by noise (as often happens in practice), this can lead to inaccuracy due to the ill-conditioning of the problem. A regularization strategy based on Tikhonov regularization is discussed, and an automatic regularization parameter choice is introduced to deal with cases where the noise level is not known beforehand. The algorithm is tested on three examples, including artificial models where the exact solution is known and a case study from the Matilde donjon in Livorno, with experimental data measured by seismic stations during ambient vibration tests. The proposed method consistently performs well across all tests, validating the reliability of the approach.},

  abstract     = {The highly anisotropic, multi-scale nature of fusion plasma simulations in tokamaks, combined with the complexity in the geometries of plasma-facing components and magnetic equilibrium, challenges numerical schemes. They therefore require the development of advanced numerical techniques to enhance computational efficiency and enable codes to simulate realistic plasma configurations relevant to tokamak operation. This paper proposes an adaptive mesh refinement strategy ( -adaptivity) in the SolEdge-HDG code for the resolution of 2D fluid-drift Braginskii equations using the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. The strategy is based on an oscillation indicator implemented to detect under-resolved regions and dynamically refine the mesh, associated with an a posteriori accuracy indicator built on the local difference between the solution at order and the post-processed one at order considered as reference. The method thus enables both refinement, where necessary, as well as coarsening in regions where the solution is smooth. Numerical results obtained with this method in realistic tokamak geometry and plasma conditions show significant reductions in computational resources and an improvement in code robustness while maintaining high accuracy, particularly in regions with steep gradients or near the sharp angles of the tokamak walls. This work highlights the potential of such -adaptivity technique to optimize transport simulations in realistic tokamak configurations, offering a fully automated, goal-oriented mesh refinement strategy. In addition to optimizing the numerical cost of simulation, this strategy offers all users a fully automated means of designing a mesh in any tokamak geometry.},

  abstract     = {The Total Lagrangian Material Point Method (TLMPM) is a relatively new variant of the now popular MPM, a method to solve partial differential equations appearing in solid and fluid mechanics problems. In TLMPM, each solid has its own grid, and all calculations are carried out in a configuration of reference, often the original configuration. Because of this, TLMPM is free of numerical fracture, cell crossing instability and is efficient. An unfortunate result of having individual grids is that TLMPM does not have a built-in contact algorithm. Recently, a contact algorithm based on particle-to-particle contact was published for TLMPM. However, it scales quadratically with the number of particles and is therefore slow for a large number of particles. This paper introduces a new contact algorithm for TLMPM using a flexible contact grid. The advantages of this algorithm are: (1) all the advantages of TLMPM are kept, such as the absence of numerical fracture and good convergence rates; (2) the core principle of using a background grid in the material point method for contacts is preserved; (3) different basis functions can be used for each grid, and (4) boundary conditions can be enforced with more flexibility. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through several two and three-dimensional numerical examples exhibiting large elastic and plastic deformation.},

Math. 60 (2007): 1443–1487], we previously proposed the generic projection and unconstrained PPE (GePUP) formulation [Zhang, J. Sci. Comput. 67 (2016): 1134–1180] for numerically solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (INSE) with no-slip boundary conditions. In GePUP, the main evolutionary variable does not have to be solenoidal, with its divergence controlled by a heat equation. This work presents GePUP–FEM, high-order finite-element solvers for the INSE under the framework of the method-of-lines. Continuous Lagrange finite elements of equal order are utilized for the velocity and pressure finite element spaces to discretize the weak form of GePUP in space, while high-order implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta methods are then employed to treat the stiff diffusion term implicitly and the other terms explicitly. Due to the implicit treatment of the diffusion term, the time step size is only restricted by convection. The solver is efficient in that advancing the solution at each time step only involves solving a sequence of linear systems either on the velocity or on the pressure, with geometric multigrid methods. Furthermore, the solver is enhanced with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) so that the multiple length scales and time scales in flows at moderate or high Reynolds numbers can be efficiently resolved. Numerical tests with various Reynolds numbers are performed for the single-vortex test, the lid-driven cavity, and the flow past a cylinder/sphere, demonstrating the high-order accuracy of GePUP–FEM both in time and in space and its capability of accurately and efficiently resolving the right physics. Moreover, GePUP–FEM offers the flexibility in choosing velocity and pressure finite element spaces and is free of the standard inf-sup condition.},

  abstract     = {Plates are common flat structural elements that support loads through their flexural bending rigidity. Because plate thickness is much smaller than their surface dimensions, plate theories have emerged to simplify full three-dimensional behavior. Since analytical solutions for plate elements are not always available, especially for general loads and boundary conditions, numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), are often employed to solve these problems. Due to its general polynomial approximation of the solution field, FEM often requires a large number of degrees of freedom to achieve convergence, increasing the computational burden. In this study, we propose a new approach for the analysis of plates utilizing the eXtended finite element method (XFEM) within the Mindlin-Reissner thick plate theory. As opposed to the traditional XFEM, where the enrichment functions are applied locally, mainly targeting strong and weak discontinuities in the domain, in the proposed approach, the entire domain is globally enriched with functions inspired by analytical solutions available for simple cases of plates. The objective of the current formulation is to reduce the computational burden by reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the problem compared to the standard FE configuration. The deformation of rectangular plates is studied for different boundary and loading conditions. The enrichment functions added to the FE shape functions are based on the series expansion resulting from the analytical solution of a simply supported plate under uniform pressure. However, those functions may not necessarily match the actual problem studied. To this end, higher series terms are employed to improve the accuracy and response of the plates. A convergence study is conducted to investigate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. The results show an improved convergence rate of the XFEM compared to the standard FEM approach.},

By constructing symmetric functions of repeated eigenvalues—including cluster mean, -norm and Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) functions—the study confirms their differentiability when all repeated eigenvalues are included, that is, clusters are complete. Numerical sensitivity analyses indicate that, under some symmetry conditions, multiple eigenvalues may also be differentiable with respect to the symmetric design variables. Notably, regardless of enforced symmetry, the cluster mean approach guarantees the differentiability of multiple eigenvalues, offering a reliable solution strategy in eigenfrequency optimization. Optimization schemes are proposed to maximize eigenfrequencies and bandgaps by integrating cluster means with the bound formulations. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples of 2D and 3D solids and plate structures.

The proposed method utilizes the product space as the input space, composed of function spaces for force boundaries, displacement boundaries, material properties, and other mechanical factors. Distinct branch networks are established for each mechanical factor and distinct trunk networks for each corresponding response. The solution family learning task is accomplished by using shared branch networks across multiple trunk networks. The load adaptability for both concentrated and distributed forces is achieved through the integration of Gaussian Random Fields(GRFs) and Fourier polynomials to generate function spaces for the force boundary; the load adaptability for force and imposed displacement excitation is achieved by incorporating the product space of force and displacement boundaries into the input space. The numerical cases of (1) elastic plates subjected to benchmark force and imposed displacement excitations, (2) benchmark beams under pure and tensile bending, and (3) 3D elastic cubes undergoing axial tension demonstrate the method's adaptability to various load scenarios and its capacity to handle complex stress states.

  abstract     = {The ability to solve parameterized partial differential equations is pivotal to improving engineering design efficiency, and with the advancement of machine learning technologies, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a promising avenue. In this work, a coupled dual-domain Darcy–Brinkman flow model for gradient porous media is established. Building upon this, the trunk-branch (TB)-net PINN framework, which is capable of dealing with multi-physical field issues, is utilized to conduct predictions for a specific porosity configuration scenario, and the performance of different data collocation strategies is examined. Following this, explorations for parameterized flows are implemented, demonstrating remarkable accuracy in two randomly chosen conditions. This is the first known application of PINNs-like methods to handle such complex parameterized dual-domain Darcy–Brinkman flows, yielding invaluable experience pertinent to engineering design and efficiency optimization.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization under uncertainty or reliability-based topology optimization is usually numerically very expensive. This is mainly due to the fact that an accurate evaluation of the probabilistic model requires the system to be simulated for a large number of varying parameters. Traditional gradient-based optimization schemes thus face the difficulty that reasonable accuracy and numerical efficiency often seem mutually exclusive. In this work, we propose a stochastic optimization technique to tackle this problem. To be precise, we combine the well-known method of moving asymptotes (MMA) with a stochastic sample-based integration strategy. By adaptively recombining gradient information from previous steps, we obtain a noisy gradient estimator that is asymptotically correct, that is, the approximation error vanishes over the course of iterations. As a consequence, the resulting stochastic method of moving asymptotes (sMMA) allows us to solve chance constraint topology optimization problems for a fraction of the cost compared to traditional approaches from literature. To demonstrate the efficiency of sMMA, we analyze structural optimization problems in two and three dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Air-jet weaving relies on high-speed air flow to propel the weft yarns through the machine, achieving high insertion rates but at the cost of a significant energy demand. Capturing the interactions between the air jets and the weft yarns, which often have a fuzzy surface structure, is therefore vital in improving the air-jet weaving process. To achieve this, this work introduces a cost-efficient method to represent fuzzy staple-fibre yarns in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by adapting the Actuator Line Method (ALM). The methodology addresses the drag-dominated aerodynamic forces acting on the yarn by introducing an upstream velocity sampling procedure. These forces are then introduced in the flow domain in a smooth and continuous manner using the actuator curve embedding principle, allowing relatively coarse mesh resolutions while still providing a correct prediction of the aerodynamic forces. The method is validated numerically through comparison with high-fidelity fibre-resolved simulations in uniform flow. Results show maximal errors in the force prediction of approximately in cross flow with narrow force regularization kernels and a force distribution error below while reducing the cell count by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the methodology was also validated experimentally in non-uniform flow and the simulations of these jet flow experiments show excellent agreement with the measured aerodynamic forces on the yarns for various orientations and supply pressures. This actuator line approach significantly reduces the computational cost by bypassing the need for microscale flow resolution around fuzzy yarn surfaces. For this reason, it opens the door to large-scale coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of the yarn insertion process in air-jet weaving.},

We investigate the resulting discrete solution space, the accuracy, and the computational cost of these spatial discretization schemes. To fulfill the required continuity of the rod formulation, the nodal scheme discretizes the rod in terms of its nodal positions and directors using cubic Hermite splines. Isogeometric discretizations naturally fulfill this with smooth spline basis functions and discretize the rod only in terms of the positions of the control points (see Nguyen et al. in Reference no. 41), which leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the Euclidean space . They enable the employment of basis functions of one degree lower, that is, quadratic splines, and possibly reduce the number of degrees of freedom (dofs). When using the nodal scheme, since the defined director field is in the unit sphere , preserving this for the nodal director variable field requires an additional constraint of unit nodal directors. This leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the manifold ; however, it results in zero nodal axial stress values. Allowing arbitrary length for the nodal directors, that is a nodal director field in instead of as within discrete rod elements, eliminates the constrained nodal axial stresses and leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of . To enforce the unit nodal director constraint, we discuss two approaches using the Lagrange multiplier and penalty methods. We compare the resulting semi-discrete formulations and the computational cost of these discretization variants.

  abstract     = {Port Hamiltonian systems formalism [1] is proposed for providing the general control theory for finite-dimensional systems, with the models typically used in multibody dynamics (such as rigid components interconnected with flexible joints, or ports). Many present applications require better modeling of the system flexibility (and risk of damage), and one has to consider infinite-dimensional systems. The nonlinear dynamics and control of such a system in terms of Reissner's geometrically exact beam are studied in this work. More precisely, we first present the theoretical formulation for nonlinear dynamics for a 2D Reissner's beam constructed as a port-Hamiltonian system. This results in a highly nonlinear problem due to nonlinear beam kinematics capable of representing finite displacements, rotations, and strains. The port Hamiltonian formulation suitable for the (nonlinear) control problems is then developed by selecting appropriate effort and flow variables, and the model is reformulated as a coupled system of first-order partial differential equations in a structure-preserving format in a continuum setting. We then develop an expanded format required for a nonlinear system and the corresponding variational formulation by using the principle of virtual power, with the boundary conditions defining the port variables that are used in control. The final step is the finite element discretization by using finite element interpolations for such a nonlinear port-Hamiltonian formulation, resulting in a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with nodal degrees that count displacements, rotation, linear and angular velocities, forces, and moments, which provides the greatest flexibility in choosing control strategies. This set of differential equations is here integrated by the backward Euler scheme, resulting in a nonlinear system of algebraic equations. The consistent linearization of such a system provides a robust performance for the proposed port Hamiltonian formulation. This is illustrated with the results of several numerical simulations that confirm the improved performance in energy conservation, which is superior to those provided previously by energy-conserving time integration schemes that have been constructed for fully discretized problems [2].},

The proposed MOFDA is rigorously evaluated on 31 standard benchmark problems and 11 constrained engineering design cases—including truss optimization, welded beam design, and a large-scale steel frame structure—to assess its accuracy, stability, and solution diversity comprehensively. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms such as MOMVO, MOMSA, MSSA, and MOGNDO further highlight the strong performance of MOFDA.

The results show that MOFDA consistently achieves competitive or superior outcomes on benchmark functions, delivers substantial weight reduction, and improves structural efficiency in engineering applications.

Specifically, an auxiliary field is employed to capture the asymptotic singular behavior of the near-tip stress field, while the traction-based equilibrium finite element accounts for the residual terms. The remarkable property of the proposed enriched EFEM is that the stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the stress fields are directly obtained with high accuracy, even on a very coarse mesh. Moreover, in combination with the compatible solution acquired by the enriched finite element method (FEM), strict estimation of the discretization error is obtained for crack problems by dual analysis. Numerical examples are finally conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method on strict error estimation and accurate computation of the SIFs.},

To this end, we prescribe an averaged curvature parameter for the entire microstructure, while also constraining local curvature for every fiber to a maximum value. While local curvature is unambiguously defined, the choice of the averaged curvature parameter is not obvious. We introduce as a novel curvature measure the deviation from straight curve (DSC), which computes as the trace of the local second-order fiber orientation tensor's covariance for a single fiber. Averaging this over all fibers leads to a scalar averaged curvature parameter. Using this parameter, we define an optimization procedure for generating curved-fiber reinforced microstructures. We compare the microstructure generation capabilities of the proposed extension with the prior algorithm without curvature control and find that the extended algorithm is capable of realizing a significantly wider spectrum of curvatures. Finally, we study the influence of fiber curvature on elastic properties, and find that for an example composite of glass-fiber reinforced polypropylene, increased fiber curvature leads to a reduction of the Young's modulus by as much as 10%.},

The core innovation is a generalized summation rule that enables accurate coarse-graining consistent with general finite element shape functions. While a few existing approaches have explored summation rules for higher-order interpolation, such efforts remain limited and are typically tailored to specific element types or applications. In contrast, the proposed framework provides a unified and systematic approach that ensures compatibility with general shape functions, significantly enhancing the flexibility and applicability of nonlocal quasicontinuum methods. The GSR-QC method features: (1) constitutive-model consistency, employing the same discrete lattice model in both fully resolved and coarse-grained regions; (2) shape-function-consistent energy sampling, aligned rigorously with the interpolation order of general finite elements; and (3) interfacial compatibility, enabling seamless energy and force transfer across regions of differing resolutions without additional interface treatment. The performance of GSR-QC is validated using bilinear quadrilateral and quadratic triangular elements across benchmark problems—including uniaxial tension, clamped bending, three-point bending, and crack propagation in truss-based lattice structures—demonstrating good accuracy. Additionally, the error analysis and convergence behavior of GSR-QC are investigated.},

Similar to deterministic hyperelastic analysis, prescribed external forces or boundary values are applied through a series of load steps. By using a stochastic Newton-Raphson method, the stochastic hyperelastic analysis at each load step is linearized as a series of linear stochastic equations. To avoid the use of stochastic configurations from intermediate load steps, all analyses are performed on the initial configuration, thus referred to as a total Lagrangian method. Each stochastic increment of the stochastic solution is then approximated as the product of a random variable and a deterministic vector, and they are solved through a dedicated iteration. Specifically, the deterministic vector is solved using linear deterministic equations, and the corresponding random variable is calculated through one-dimensional stochastic algebraic equations that can be solved efficiently using a sample-based strategy, even for very high-dimensional random inputs. In this way, the proposed method avoids the curse of dimensionality to a great extent. 2D and 3D numerical examples with up to 100 stochastic dimensions demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to propose a novel finite element (FE) approach for studying the large deformations of structures with arbitrary geometry in the context of micromorphic hyperelasticity. The 3D micromorphic hyperelasticity is first formulated in a general form based on novel constitutive relations within a Lagrangian framework. In order to implement in the coding procedure, the vector–matrix counterparts of presented relations are also given, which can be used in numerical approaches readily. In the next step, a finite element method is developed to compute large deformations in arbitrary-shaped structures under static loading. The correctness and reliability of the approach are illustrated by solving some test problems. Additionally, the effects of Young's modulus, internal length, and scale-transition parameters on the large deformation behavior of considered micromorphic hyperelastic structures are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an effective and robust computational method of gradient-based methodology for weight minimization of geometrically nonlinear structures, considering 3D trusses as exemplary case study. The optimization framework can accommodate multiple different constraints: (i) bounds on the cross-sectional area of each design element, (ii) prescribed ranges for displacements and stresses, and (iii) nonlinear stability for geometries such as arches and domes. For large structures, this results in numerous optimization variables and constraints, including the highly nonlinear (ii) and (iii). Such constraints are evaluated consistently and simultaneously by combining path-following finite element analysis and null vector method. Typically, the gradient of the nonlinear structural response is approximated numerically, which is computationally intensive and can introduce inaccuracies deteriorating the optimization process. In contrast, this work derives a fully analytical gradient evaluation for nonlinear deformation, stress, and stability constraints. This is implemented directly within the finite element solver, enhancing robustness and computational efficiency of the optimization. Validation examples range from simple benchmarks to large structures.},

Moreover, each of these local curves is supposed to start at the identity of . Both assumptions may not reflect the actual curve to be interpolated. This paper pursues a different approach to construct splines on . Local curves are expressed as solutions of the Poisson equation on . Therewith, the local interpolations satisfies the boundary conditions while respecting the geometry of . A -order approximation of the solutions gives rise to a -order product of exponential (POE) spline. Algorithms for constructing 3rd- and 4th-order splines are derived from closed form expressions for the approximate solutions. Additionally, spline algorithms are introduced that allow prescribing a vector field the curve must follow at the interpolation points. It is shown that the established algorithms, where -order POE-splines are constructed by concatenating local curves starting at the identity, cannot exactly reconstruct a -order motion. To tackle this issue, the formulations are extended by allowing for local curves between arbitrary points, rather than curves emanating from the identity. This gives rise to a global -order spline with arbitrary initial conditions. Several examples are presented, in particular the shape reconstruction of slender rods modeled as geometrically nonlinear Cosserat rods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the coefficient of friction between tool, chip, and workpiece during machining is essential for a reliable and cost-effective process. In this context, current numerical methods are often based on homogenized approaches with friction models that use constant friction coefficients; thus, failing to capture local effects. In addition, often neither the effect of lubricants nor the local tool and chip topographies is accounted for. Towards improving the state of the art in both respects, in this paper, we present a micro-scale friction model that can be coupled with a meso-scale chip formation model. The micro model determines a local friction coefficient based on local temperature, contact pressure, cutting speed, and lubricant wetting. It also incorporates the experimentally determined tool and chip topography. A key assumption of the model is that the main contribution to the friction coefficient is the interlocking of local roughness peaks. Our numerical implementation uses a combination of isogeometric analysis (IGA) for the chip and finite elements with spline-based boundaries for the fluid. This approach ensures a smooth, conformal interface between the cooling fluid and the chip, allowing for direct spatial coupling. Temporally, a Robin–Neumann coupling is used, which is critical for handling fully enclosed fluid pockets. The direct contact between the tool and the chip is modeled using a mortar knot-to-surface approach. To ensure computational affordability in this multi-query FE 2 scenario, a surrogate model for the micro-scale model is created using Gaussian process regression.},

Many synthesis approaches simplify implementation by assuming small distortions, but this limits their practical application since CMs typically undergo large deformations that include geometric and material nonlinearities. CMs designed to generate a desired deformation path at the output points under specific loads are known as path-generating CMs. However, these CMs face significant challenges in topology optimization, resulting in the development of only a few optimization methods. Existing approaches often include only certain load cases in the optimization process. Consequently, if a CM designed this way encounters different load cases in practice, its path-generating behavior cannot be guaranteed. The authors have previously contributed to the development of an approach suitable for synthesizing load case-insensitive CMs. This paper extends that approach to account for nonlinearities, enabling the synthesis of path-generating CMs. The effectiveness of this extended approach is demonstrated through appropriate design examples. Additionally, the paper presents, for the first time, a shape-adaptive path-generating CM.},

This is particularly the case when there is significant interpenetration and evolution of the contact surfaces, such as the case of a relatively rigid body interacting with a highly deformable body. This paper provides a new three-dimensional large deformation contact approach where the Material Point Method (MPM) is used to represent the deformable material. A new contact detection approach is introduced that checks the interaction of the vertices of the domains associated with each material point with the discretized rigid body. This provides a general and consistent approach without requiring the reconstruction of an additional boundary representation of the deformable body. A new energy-consistent material point domain updating approach is also introduced that maintains stable simulations under large deformations. The dynamic governing equations allow the trajectory of the rigid body to evolve based on the interaction with the deformable body, and the governing equations are solved within an efficient implicit framework. The performance of the new contact approach is demonstrated on a number of benchmark problems with analytical solutions. The method is also applied to the specific case of soil-structure interaction, using geotechnical centrifuge experimental data that confirms the veracity of the proposed approach.},

PINNs adhere to the governing equations and the boundary conditions by integrating physical laws into the neural network architecture. They are used for forward and inverse simulations under non-standard, complex geometries and loading conditions. The first example features a plane strain shear test, a common protocol in soft tissue mechanics, where we provide a comprehensive comparison of three different total loss functions—namely, the minimization of the PDEs, the total potential energy, or a combination of both—for forward problems as a surrogate to finite element analysis (FEA). The second example deals with a patient-specific geometry of basal myocardium—obtained from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging—for forward and inverse analyses. Key findings reveal that apart from the accurately predicted primary fields, that is, displacements, the inverse design also provides a true estimate of the anisotropic material parameters from ground truth data obtained from experiments or FEA. Limitations remain in the performance of PINNs for forward simulations of the 2D basal myocardium, particularly with respect to computational demands and sensitivity to network architecture and hyperparameters. Despite challenges in accurately predicting secondary fields, for example, stresses, PINNs demonstrate their potential for inverse simulations, particularly in identifying anisotropic constitutive parameters that can be used in the case of noisy or incomplete datasets in future biomechanical applications.},

The material points are allowed to move flexibly within the background grid, making it easier to accurately track the failure zone.

The proposed estimator is built upon a recovery procedure originally formulated for the Generalized/eXtended Finite Element Method (G/XFEM), where a recovered stress field is computed using a block-diagonal system of equations.

  abstract     = {In the present work, a stabilized High-Order Spectral (HOS) model with adaptive residual-based artificial viscosity (RAV) has been developed for performance enhancement in fully-nonlinear free-surface flow simulation. To suppress the numerical instability caused by the nonlinear wave-wave interactions, that is, the nonlinear mode-coupling between eigen-modes, with an explicit time-domain integrator, additional estimations about the numerical residuals of free-surface elevation and free-surface potential with their backward histories have been carried out for stability-indicating and artificial viscous terms have been suggested to balance such unphysical energy-accumulation, especially for under-resolved wave components. Upon the normalized free-surface residuals as the scales of artificial viscosity, an even-order dissipation term has been assembled for energy suppression. To retain the overall explicit algorithm, such additional dissipation has been considered in an operator-splitting manner. For the proposed dissipation algorithm, it has been shown that the present residual-based artificial energy-suppression holds the spectral-vanishing property because of its wave-number-related normalization in wave-number space. With such spectral normalization, the dissipation for the lower-wave-number well-resolved wave components has been well-controlled with the increase of dissipation order. Compared with the commonly used spectral-filtering-based stabilization algorithm, where the energy suppression within single-step free-surface prediction shows independence from the temporal increment ( ), the developed residual-based algorithm holds a solution-adaptive property, leading to an enhanced convergence performance of the free-surface model with its stabilization term tightly coupled to . To check the performance of the present RAV-HOS model, a series of classical benchmarks, both numerical and experimental, have been reproduced, and a HOS-based Numerical-Wave-Tank (HOS-NWT) has been built as a preparation for our further investigations into wave-wave and wave-structure interactions. With the confirmation of both robustness and accuracy of the proposed stabilized HOS model, a promising prospect for its further application in oceanic, offshore, and marine engineering as an efficient free-surface simulator has been expected.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel topology optimization method considering contact and geometric nonlinearities constrained with stress. The frictional surface-to-surface contact algorithm is established by using the Coulomb friction law and penalty method. A nonlinear topology optimization model is established with the volume fraction as objective function and the stress as constraint, which realizes the lightweight design of the contact structures. The sensitivity information is derived by using the adjoint method. Several numerical examples compare the effects of different p-norm stress constraints, different friction coefficients, and different filter radii. It demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively control the maximum stress and reduce the weight of the contact structures under large deformation.},

  abstract     = {The composite design of the prepositive elliptical wing-main wing configuration suppresses the flow separation on the main wing by harnessing the beneficial interference of airflow between the two wings. Employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and optimization technologies, the two-dimensional composite configuration enhances the overall lift-drag ratio by a remarkable value of 112.24% compared to the baseline airfoil at an angle of attack of 18°, with a 74.41% increase in the time-averaged lift-drag ratio during a pitch oscillation period. To decipher the underlying flow control principles, numerical simulation-derived transient flow field snapshots are analyzed through the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). For the static conditions, the vortex shedding from the elliptical wing is critical in achieving the desired flow control effects. A necessary prerequisite for the effective creation of this vortex is the slit created between the main wing and the elliptical wing. For the dynamic conditions, the airflow acceleration facilitated by the slit is the predominant factor in the flow control effectiveness of the composite configuration. The vortex shedding that takes place downstream of the elliptical wing complements this primary effect, contributing as a secondary mechanism to the overall flow control. These results reveal the distinct mechanisms behind the flow control of the composite configuration under static and dynamic stall conditions and provide a theoretical foundation for this innovative approach to flow control.},

By introducing two Lagrange multipliers for each of the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes parts, we reformulate the original model problem into an equivalent system that incorporates the energy evolution process. Such a nonlinear, coupled system is then discretized in time using first- and second-order backward differentiation formulas, in which all nonlinear terms are treated explicitly and no extra stabilization term is imposed. The proposed dynamically regularized Lagrange multiplier (DRLM) schemes are mass-conserving and unconditionally energy-stable with respect to the original variables. In addition, the schemes are fully decoupled: Each time step involves solving two biharmonic-type equations and two generalized linear Stokes systems, together with two nonlinear algebraic equations for the Lagrange multipliers. A key feature of the DRLM schemes is the introduction of the regularization parameters which ensure the unique determination of the Lagrange multipliers and mitigate the time step size constraint without affecting the accuracy of the numerical solution, especially when the interfacial width is small. Various numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed DRLM schemes in terms of convergence, mass conservation, and energy stability.},

  abstract     = {Buckling is the most significant failure mode for thin-walled structures. In particular, geometric imperfections have a major influence on the buckling behavior. These spatially correlated imperfections are inherently random and can be modeled using random fields. Therefore, computationally expensive probabilistic buckling analyses have to be performed. For some structures, a linear pre-buckling behavior can be observed. In this case, the stability point can be calculated with a linear buckling analysis, which is widely used in engineering practice. However, the results of linear buckling analyses strongly differ from the correct buckling load in the case of a non-linear pre-buckling behavior. Then, a non-linear buckling analysis is required, which is computationally expensive for probabilistic safety assessments based on Monte Carlo simulations. This paper aims to estimate the second-order statistics of buckling loads for thin-walled structures exhibiting strongly non-linear pre-buckling behavior. The estimation leverages existing correlations between the outcomes of linear and non-linear buckling analyses. The proposed approach utilizes the framework of Control Variates, wherein the more expensive analysis (non-linear buckling analysis) is run a few times only, while the cheaper linear buckling analysis is run a considerable number of times. The proposed method is demonstrated on a variety of structures, including a folded plate with multiple types of stability points, a composite shell panel, and a cylinder with random geometric imperfections. In these numerical examples, stochastic buckling analysis using Control Variates is approximately 1.5 to 2.6 times faster than classical Monte Carlo simulation.},

The accumulated fatigue damage related to the fatigue constraint is calculated based upon the rainflow-counting scheme, Sines method, S – N curve and Palmgren–Miner's linear damage hypothesis. The Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) function is adopted as an aggregated measure for both the maximum contact pressure and the maximum fatigue damage. The design sensitivities are derived analytically using the adjoint method. Both frictionless and frictional contact problems are investigated. The influence of fatigue constraints on the optimization result is discussed in comparison with the standard compliance minimization. Frictional contact effects upon the optimized results and fatigue damage are highlighted. Results show that the maximum contact pressure and maximum fatigue damage can effectively be controlled to avoid fatigue failure and that the fatigue strength of the structure can be improved at the cost of structural stiffness.},

Building on recent advancements in the PGD algorithm, where an inertial step component has been introduced to improve efficiency in solving constrained optimization problems, this study introduces two key enhancements to further improve the algorithm's performance and adaptability in large-scale design spaces. First, univariate constraints (such as design variable bounds constraints) are directly incorporated into the projection step via the Schur complement and an improved active set algorithm with bulk constraints manipulation, avoiding issues with min–max clipping. Second, the update step is decomposed relative to the constraint vector space, enabling a post-projection adjustment based on the state of the constraints and an approximation of the Lagrangian, significantly improving the algorithm's robustness for problems with nonlinear constraints. Applied to a topology optimization problem for heat sink design, the proposed PGD algorithm demonstrates performance comparable to or exceeding that of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA), with minimal parameter tuning. These results position the enhanced PGD as a robust tool for complex optimization problems with large variable spaces, such as topology optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating stress constraints in topology optimization is a challenging task due to the large number of constraints in the formulation. One effective strategy to address this challenge is the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method, which transforms the original stress-constrained problem into a sequence of subproblems with only bound constraints. The effectiveness of the AL method heavily depends on the optimization method used to solve these subproblems. This work performs a comparative study of six optimization solvers: The method of moving asymptotes (MMA), the steepest descent method with move limits (SDM), the spectral projected gradient (SPG), and the limited-memory BFGS with bound constraints (L-BFGS-B), along with two proposed adaptations, steepest descent method with move limits—Barzilai–Borwein (SDMBB) and spectral projected gradient with move limits (SPGM). These methods are evaluated in the context of the volume minimization problem with local stress constraints. The solutions are compared in terms of performance, defined as the final volume fraction, and efficiency, measured by the number of state and adjoint analyses required. A mesh dependence study is conducted to assess the robustness of each method across different mesh sizes, including high-resolution cases with approximately 1.8 million elements. SDMBB exhibits the highest efficiency, while SPGM achieves the best performance, followed by SDM. The MMA, SPG, and L-BFGS-B show limitations in high-resolution problems or fail to meet specific stopping criteria. The results demonstrate that the choice of the optimization solver significantly affects the efficiency of the AL method, as well as the performance and mesh dependence of the solutions. Furthermore, this study identifies the most promising methods for solving large-scale stress-constrained problems.},

  abstract     = {Thermo-mechanical damage, such as thermal shock, is a common engineering problem. It constitutes a challenging problem that damage and temperature are conversely interacting with each other: Material damage leads to an increase in temperature due to energy dissipation; temperature also influences damage evolution. On the one hand, an increase in temperature decreases the damage threshold, which makes damage more likely to occur. On the other hand, a non-uniform temperature distribution can cause internal stresses within the material, leading to the occurrence of damage. Taking all of the above points into account, we introduce a novel approach based on the Hamilton principle for thermo-mechanically coupled, gradient-enhanced damage modeling. To accelerate the computation speed, we adopt the Neighbored Element Method to calculate the Laplace operator in the governing equation of both the damage variable and temperature. The numerical examples show the robustness and efficiency of our method.},

However, the large size of multispectral and hyperspectral datasets poses challenges for storage, transmission, and processing, particularly in precision farming and resource-limited contexts. This work presents the H 2 $$ {}^2 $$ -PCA-AT (Hilbert and Huffman-encoded Principal Component Analysis-Adaptive Triangular) format, a novel lossy compression framework that combines PCA for spectral reduction with anisotropic mesh adaptation for spatial compression. Adaptive triangular meshes capture image features with fewer elements with respect to a standard pixel grid, while efficient encoding with Hilbert curves and Huffman coding ensures compact storage. Numerical evaluations of data reconstruction, vegetation index computation, and land cover classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the H -PCA-AT format, achieving superior compression compared to JPEG while preserving essential agricultural insights.},

We want to allow for the reuse of existing codes for the subproblems, called a partitioned approach. To improve computational efficiency, different and adaptive time steps in the subsolvers are advisable. Using so-called waveform iterations in combination with relaxation, this has been achieved for heat transfer problems earlier. Alternatively, one can use a black box method like Quasi-Newton to improve the convergence behavior. These methods have recently been combined with waveform iterations for fixed time steps. Here, we suggest an extension of the Quasi-Newton method to the time-adaptive setting and analyze its properties. We compare the proposed Quasi-Newton method with state-of-the-art solvers on a heat transfer test case and a complex mechanical Fluid-Structure interaction case, demonstrating the method's efficiency.},

To enhance computational efficiency, a decoupled method is employed to separate the MDA from the probabilistic analysis. Initially, the paper introduces a moment-matching technique to estimate the first four moments of the coupling variables. This technique utilizes Taylor series expansion, direct tensor product quadrature, sparse grid numerical integration, and univariate dimension reduction methods. After quantifying the uncertainty in the coupling variables, system-level uncertainty propagation is carried out using methods similar to those used in single-discipline problems. The proposed methods are suitable for both sampling and analytical approximation-based reliability analysis techniques. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through a mathematical problem and a practical engineering problem.},

Despite their promise, deploying neural ODEs in practical applications often encounters the challenge of stiffness, a condition where rapid variations in some components of the solution demand prohibitively small time steps for explicit solvers. This work addresses the stiffness issue when employing neural ODEs for model order reduction by introducing a suitable reparametrization in time. The considered map is data-driven, and it is induced by the adaptive time-stepping of an implicit solver on a reference solution. We show that the map produces a non-stiff system that can be cheaply solved with an explicit time integration scheme. The original, stiff, time dynamic is recovered by means of a map learnt by a neural network that connects the state space to the time reparametrization. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating improvements in efficiency for the neural ODE inference while maintaining robustness and accuracy when compared to an implicit solver applied to the stiff system with the original right-hand side.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we address damage initiation and microcrack formation in ductile failure of polycrystalline metals. We show how our recently published thermodynamic framework for ductile phase-field fracture of single crystals can be extended to polycrystalline structures. A key feature of this framework is that it accounts for size effects by adopting gradient-enhanced (crystal) plasticity. Gradient-enhanced plasticity requires the definition of boundary conditions representing the plastic slip transmission resistance of the boundaries. In this work, we propose a novel type of microflexible boundary condition for gradient-plasticity, which couples the slip transmission resistance with the phase-field damage such that the resistance locally changes during the fracturing process. The formulation allows maintaining the effect of grain boundaries as obstacles for plastic slip during plastification, while also accounting for weakening of their resistance during the softening phase. In numerical experiments, the new damage-dependent boundary condition is compared with classical microfree and microhard boundary conditions in polycrystals, and it is demonstrated that it indeed produces a response that transitions from microhard to microfree as the material fails. We show that the formulation maintains resistance to slip transmission during hardening, but can generate microcracks across grain boundaries during the fracture process. We further show examples of how the model can be used to simulate void coalescence and three-dimensional crack fronts in polycrystals.},

The model is generalizable and capable of predicting complex simulations with just one training of the model, showing transfer learning capabilities. The primary objective is to optimize computational resources while maintaining accuracy on the predictions. With the combination of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and DLNs, our approach offers an efficient and effective solution for flow dynamics prediction. The new hybrid (POD/DLN) predictive model is designed for solving reacting flow problems. The POD block segregates temporal and spatial information, while the DLN block operates solely on the temporal domain with significantly reduced dimensionality. The POD modes contain the main flow characteristics, turning the model into a physics-based model. This architecture leads to substantial enhancements in computational cost and memory requirements, while maintaining the precision in the predictions. Such advancements are particularly crucial for addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional multivariate and complex time-series forecasting tasks. Two different deep learning architectures have been tested to predict the temporal coefficients, based on recursive (RNN) and convolutional (CNN) neural networks, introducing a novel physics-aware loss function. From each architecture, different models have been created to understand the behavior of each parameter of the neural network. The results show that these architectures are able to predict the temporal evolution of the reactive flow. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time this type of hybrid models is used to temporal prediction in reactive flows. The generalization capabilities and robustness of this physics-aware ROM shed light on new development of predictive models for this research field.},

  abstract     = {Crack initiation and propagation present significant challenges in solid mechanics, necessitating reliable and efficient computational methods for accurate simulations. Traditional mesh-based approaches face limitations such as computational inefficiency and mesh dependence. Meshless methods, particularly smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), offer an alternative by eliminating mesh-related issues and simplifying the simulation of discontinuities. SPH, originally developed for astrophysical applications, has been successfully adapted for fluid and solid mechanics, including fracture mechanics. This article introduces a total Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TLSPH) model for crack modeling, addressing the limitations of existing SPH and other methods. In proposed method, interactions between particle pairs are characterized by “stretch” and an interaction is eliminated when the stretch exceeds a threshold value. The mitigation of damage-induced instabilities is performed via enhancing the numerical diffusion and applying velocity filtering in damaged area. The capability of in-house TLSPH code is first demonstrated through simulations of 2D and 3D undamaged cantilever beams under large deformations. The accuracy of the novel damage model is validated by modeling Kalthoff-Winkler experiment in 2D and 3D and dynamic crack branching case in 2D. The results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed TLSPH damage model.},

  abstract     = {In the standard material point method (MPM), a Cartesian background grid is typically used to solve equations of motion. This can make imposing boundary conditions a challenging task when the boundary of the material domain does not align with the grid edge, as these nonconforming boundary conditions are difficult to apply directly to the nodes of the Cartesian grid. In this paper, we propose the Arbitrary Grid Material Point Method (AGMPM) to efficiently solve problems involving a nonconforming boundary conditions by converting them into conforming boundary conditions. In the AGMPM, boundaries with arbitrary geometries are constructed by using arbitrary convex polygonal grid cells. The Wachspress coordinates are introduced as the shape functions for these grid cells. To impose boundary conditions on the arbitrary grid, two specific types of boundary conditions are proposed as examples: roller boundary conditions, which are two-sided constraints, and rigid-wall-boundary conditions, which are single-sided constraints. These boundary conditions are extensions of those used in the standard MPM. To improve computational efficiency during the particle-to-mesh mapping, an efficient search algorithm based on the bucket search method is presented. Several numerical examples are studied to verify the proposed AGMPM, demonstrate its potential and flexibility in solving engineering problems, and showcase its improved accuracy compared to the standard MPM when dealing with nonconforming boundary conditions.},

Next, a quadrilateral 8-node element is constructed based on the CR method. In the development, with the use of the penalty function method, the independent nodal rotation degrees of freedom are utilized to approximate the elastic rotation field, ensuring the higher-order continuity requirement for the displacement test function in a weak sense. In addition, to fully improve the element performance, the trial function of CR force-stress is formulated based on the polynomial force-stress functions, which are continually updated with reference to the latest deformed configuration.

Combining the extended EBHM with the parametric level set method (PLSM) and the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method (ALM), it is able to design the topological configurations of arc unit cells for seeking superior effective elastic properties. In addition, the level set function is first filtered by compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) in order to eliminate small holes in the configuration. Numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. The periodic boundary condition performs well when the circumferential angle of the arc unit cell is in the range of [0.0002, 0.2]. Results indicate that the effective elastic properties of optimized arc unit cells override those of geometrically transformed optimal square unit cells. This superiority mainly benefits from the fact that unisymmetrical configurations are allowed in arc unit cells but not in square unit cells. Results also imply that the capability of nucleation of new holes is retained even though small holes are eliminated by filtering. It contributes to the trade-off between performance and manufacturability.},

  abstract     = {Based on the virtual work principle, a novel Petrov-Galerkin 4-node quadrilateral element is proposed in this article with different sets of test and trial functions. The virtual displacements are assumed by standard isoparametric interpolation which satisfies the interelement continuity requirement. It also ensures that the imposition of prescribed displacement boundary conditions and the calculation of equivalent nodal forces are the same as the conventional isoparametric elements. A support domain is formed for each element and all nodes within it are used to interpolate the actual displacements through the radial and polynomial basis functions. The nodal shape functions obtained by the radial polynomial interpolation possess the Kronecker delta property and sufficient completeness order for convergence. The resulted element stiffness matrix is unsymmetric, generally nonsquare, due to the Petrov-Galerkin formulation. However, the global unsymmetric stiffness matrix is square, sparse and structurally symmetric. Moreover, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix can be removed from the element stiffness matrix and this improves the immunity of the numerical accuracy to mesh distortion significantly. Numerical investigations demonstrate that the present element effectively combines the advantages of both finite element methods and radial basis meshless methods. Especially, the stress continuity and interelement smoothness are improved remarkedly.},

  abstract     = {Interfaces widely present in nature and civil engineering are the most fundamental elements causing discontinuous deformation and failure. The Goodman joint element is incorporated into the vast majority of commercial and proprietary finite element programs due to its simplicity. However, the numerical properties of the Goodman element are not ideal. A lot of effort has gone into enhancing its numerical properties, only to make some empirical suggestions for adjusting mesh and computation parameters, yet there are still many examples that fail to reach convergence or incur drastic numerical oscillations of contact stress. Considering that the Goodman element is implemented within the framework of the displacement method, and poorlyposed problems in the displacement method are usually well-posed problems in the force method, this study proposes a force method version of the Goodman element, abbreviated as FMVGE. The primal unknowns in FMVGE are the contact stresses on the interface rather than nodal deformations. The core problem in FMVGE represents the contact conditions in the form of a quasi-variational inequality (QVI). By employing process iteration rather than state iteration used in the displacement method, at the same time, FMVGE precisely satisfies the contact conditions, with convergence being theoretically guaranteed. Analysis of classic examples and engineering cases indicates that the numerical properties of FMVGE are significantly superior to the widely adopted master–slave block method. Appendices A and B provide the proof of the convergence of the FMVGE solution and the core Matlab code for solving the QVI, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Aero-engines are complex and sophisticated systems combining mechanical, thermal, and fluidic domains. Abnormal wear of mechanical components is becoming more prevalent due to severe changes in flight conditions and the external environment, which may lead to drastic performance degradation and accidents. Therefore, the diagnosis of such wear and tear faults is urgent, and based on this need, more researchers and scholars are focusing their attention on it. To address the current shortcomings of fault diagnosis algorithms that only rely on one-dimensional datasets or two-dimensional image analysis and the low accuracy of final fault identification, an innovative hybrid algorithm is proposed in this study. The algorithm integrates one-dimensional time series data and two-dimensional image data, converts the one-dimensional dataset into a two-dimensional image dataset through the Gramian Angle Field technique, and subsequently uses a dual-channel GRU-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network-Gated Recurrent Unit) algorithm model designed for fault diagnosis, which can simultaneously analyze and map the features and fault modes of the one-dimensional dataset and the two-dimensional image. In order to extract features with richer semantic information and stronger discriminative ability, a multimodal fusion technique is employed, which successfully addresses the limitations of the wear-and-tear feature distributions of the two datasets using the cross-extraction fusion method and combines the advantages of both in terms of trend distributions of the time series and edge feature distributions of the image sequences, respectively. The best fault diagnosis results were achieved by using the strong mapping relationship between the saliency feature expression and the fault modes. The final analysis shows that the recognition rate of typical mechanical wear of aero-engines exceeds 97%, thus achieving the desired goal.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a hybrid pressure face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver to simulate steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The method leverages the robustness, in the incompressible limit, of the hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin paradigm for compressible and weakly compressible flows to derive the formulation of a novel, low-order face-based discretization. The incompressibility constraint is enforced in a weak sense by introducing an inter-cell mass flux, defined in terms of a new, hybrid variable that represents the pressure at the cell faces. This results in a new hybridization strategy where cell variables (velocity, pressure, and deviatoric strain rate tensor) are expressed as a function of velocity and pressure at the barycentre of the cell faces. The hybrid pressure formulation provides first-order convergence of all variables, including the stress, without the need for gradient reconstruction, thus being less sensitive to cell type, stretching, distortion, and skewness than traditional low-order finite volume solvers. Numerical benchmarks of Navier-Stokes flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers, in two and three dimensions, are presented to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the method. In particular, the hybrid pressure formulation outperforms the FCFV method when convective effects are relevant, achieving accurate predictions on significantly coarser meshes.},

Fine meshes are used in the vicinity of localized defects to accurately capture crack initiation, while coarse meshes are used away from initial defects and include only crack propagation paths. This reduces the prohibitive computational times associated with uniformly fine meshes over the entire domain, or with the use of complex adaptive meshes in the phase field method. The coupling between the two overlapping meshes is achieved using a variational formulation in which the energies of the models associated with the fine and coarse meshes are weighted in the superposition zone. Two situations are considered. The first includes the resolution of the phase field problem only in the fine mesh, while the coarse mesh is limited to the undamaged elastic problem. In the second situation, cracks can propagate in both the fine and coarse mesh. Variational formulations and associated finite element implementations are detailed. Numerical examples are presented, showing the potential of this approach to significantly reduce computational costs in the phase field method for cracking without affecting the accuracy.},

Specifically, the evolve–filter–relax (EFR) algorithm is a framework that consists of evolving the solution, applying a filtering step to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius and the relaxation parameter . Standard choices for these parameters are usually fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, that is, the grid size for and the time step for . The key novelties with respect to the standard EFR approach are: (i) time-dependent parameters and , and (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time, considering a fully-resolved simulation as reference. In particular, we propose three different classes of optimized-EFR ( Opt-EFR ) strategies, aiming to optimize one or both parameters. The new Opt-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at . The Opt-EFR proved to be more accurate than standard approaches by up to 99 , while maintaining a similar computational time.

  abstract     = {Contact phenomena are crucial for understanding the behavior of mechanical systems. However, existing computational approaches for simulating mechanical contact often face numerical challenges, such as inaccurate physical predictions, energy conservation errors, and unwanted oscillations. We introduce an alternative technique for simulating dynamic contact based on the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method, originally developed for domain decomposition. In multibody contact scenarios, this method treats each body as a separate, non-overlapping domain and prevents interpenetration using an alternating Dirichlet–Neumann iterative process. This approach has a strong theoretical foundation, eliminates the need for contact constraints, and offers flexibility, making it ideal for multiscale and multiphysics applications. We conducted a numerical comparison between the Schwarz method and traditional methods, such as the Lagrange multiplier and penalty methods, focusing on a benchmark impact problem. Our results indicate that the Schwarz alternating method outperforms traditional methods in several key areas: it provides more accurate predictions for various measurable quantities and demonstrates exceptional energy conservation capabilities. To address unwanted oscillations in contact velocities and forces, we explored various algorithms and stabilization techniques, ultimately opting for the naïve-stabilized Newmark scheme for its simplicity and effectiveness. Additionally, we validated the efficiency of the Schwarz method in a three-dimensional impact problem, highlighting its inherent capacity to accommodate different mesh topologies, time-integration schemes, and time steps for each interacting body.},

Cut cells are a fundamental aspect of unfitted mesh approaches, where complex geometries or interfaces separating subdomains are embedded into structured background grids to facilitate the mesh generation process. In such methods, arbitrary small cells occur due to the intersections of background cells with embedded geometries and lead to discretization difficulties due to their diminutive sizes. Furthermore, temporal evolutions of these geometries may lead to topological changes across different time steps. Both of these issues, that is, small-cut cells and topological changes, can be addressed with a cell agglomeration technique, independent of discretization. However, cell agglomeration encounters significant difficulties in three dimensions due to the complexity of neighborship and issues like cycles and parallel agglomeration chains. The proposed strategy introduces a robust framework that mitigates these problems by incorporating methods for cycle prevention, chain agglomeration, and parallelization. Implemented in the open-source software package BoSSS, this strategy has been successfully tested on multiprocessor systems using dynamic multiphase test cases in both two and three dimensions, enabling simulations that were previously infeasible.},

  abstract     = {The representation of material failure due to wave propagation is essential for the numerical analysis of engineering structures under high dynamic loading. Explicit time integration schemes are well established for this kind of application. In order to realistically model the failure of certain material classes, it is necessary to resolve lower scale features accurately. Concurrent multiscale approaches are therefore well suited to this task. However, they are often complex and computationally demanding. The introduction of interfaces between disparately meshed domains may additionally lead to emerging reflections for waves that contain high frequencies, which the coarse domain cannot resolve. In this article, we compare accuracy, computational efficiency, versatility, and effort for two finite element implementations of concurrent two-scale schemes. Both offer the possibility of adding a Selected Perfectly Matched Layer (SPML) to dampen incompatible frequencies. One approach is the widely used conventional Lagrange multiplier (LM) approach; the second is a weak staggered (WS) coupling, which was designed to maintain direct solution schemes' efficiency with explicit time integration and diagonal mass matrices. It turns out that, for typical discretizations, the WS coupling achieves an accuracy comparable to the LM coupling but requires fewer computational operations and, relevant for parallel computer architectures, significantly less communication efforts. Adaptive changes of interface topology, for example, due to explicitly resolved cracks crossing the interface, can easily be represented in the WS approach, making it a suitable candidate for the application in scenarios where gross damage is expected.},

In numerical examples, we show the accuracy and efficiency of the method for nonlinear problems involving material and geometric nonlinearities as well as non-matching meshes. The method can predict solutions of new systems with varying boundary conditions and material behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Assessing the safety and environmental impacts of subsurface resource exploitation and management is critical and requires robust geomechanical modeling. However, uncertainties stemming from model assumptions, intrinsic variability of governing parameters, and data errors challenge the reliability of predictions. In the absence of direct measurements, inverse modeling and stochastic data assimilation methods can offer reliable solutions, but in complex and large-scale settings, the computational expense can become prohibitive. To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning-based surrogate model (SurMoDeL) designed for seismic data assimilation in fault activation modeling. The surrogate model leverages neural networks to provide simplified yet accurate representations of complex geophysical systems, enabling faster simulations and analyses essential for uncertainty quantification. The work proposes two different methods to integrate an understanding of fault behavior into the model, thereby enhancing the accuracy of its predictions. The application of the proxy model to integrate seismic data through effective data assimilation techniques efficiently constrains the uncertain parameters, thus bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world observations.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a chemo-damage-mechanical coupled phase-field method for modeling two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional hydrogen-assisted transient dynamic cracking in metallic materials. In this method, hydrogen diffusion in solids is described by the evolution of bulk hydrogen concentration governed by the diffusion equation with an extended Fick's law. The hydrogen concentration and the inertial force of solids are incorporated into the governing equations of a non-standard quasi-brittle phase-field model (known as the phase-field regularized cohesive zone model, PF-CZM) capable of modeling complicated multiple crack nucleation, initiation, and propagation with insensitivity to mesh size and length scale. The resultant displacement-damage-hydrogen concentration coupled three-field equation is derived by the finite element Galerkin method and solved using a staggered Newton–Raphson iteration algorithm with an unconditionally stable implicit Newmark integration scheme. The new method was verified by four benchmark examples with hydrogen-free numerical/experimental results for comparison, including quasi-static/dynamic fracture of a notched plate under uniaxial tension, a dynamic crack branching experiment under constant traction, the Kalthoff-Winkler impact fracture experiment, and dynamic fragmentation of a cylinder under internal pressures, with the effects of loading velocity, initial bulk hydrogen concentration, and diffusion time on crack propagation investigated in detail. It is found that the present method is capable of modeling complex 2D and 3D hydrogen-assisted dynamic crack propagation and bifurcation under impact or internal pressure loadings, and thus holds the potential to be used for the structural design of hydrogen storage.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty quantification is essential to exploiting the complete potential of cellular structures. Forward methods allow quantifying the uncertainties in the mechanical properties of cellular structures by propagating the uncertainties of the input parameters, while inverse methods allow using experimental data to indirectly infer the uncertainty of the input parameters. In this paper, a closed-loop forward and inverse quantification of the in-plane elastic properties of cellular structures was proposed. A polynomial chaos expansion model was used in the forward model for uncertainty propagation and quantification of the in-plane elastic properties using the results from the Fast Fourier Transform simulations. The random input parameters field in the Fast Fourier Transform simulations, including geometry and material parameters of cellular structures, was involved by Karhunen–Loève expansion. Furthermore, the inverse uncertainty quantification was conducted in the framework of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling-based Bayesian inference using the constructed polynomial chaos surrogate model. The approach introduced was applied to analyze the uncertainty quantification in two types of cellular structures. The results showed that the thickness of the cell wall dramatically influences the effective in-plane elastic modulus of the cellular structures. The PCE could significantly reduce the iterations compared to the Monte Carlo simulation while ensuring the accuracy of uncertainty quantification of the in-plane elastic modulus. In addition, effective evaluation and calibration of the geometry and material parameters of the cellular structures based on the obtained posterior probability distribution have been achieved. This addresses the problem of uncertainty quantification of the in-plane elastic properties and the difficulty in measuring the geometry and material parameters of cellular structures.},

This paper introduces a novel approach to stress-based topology optimization through the development of neural-reparameterized topology optimization using the convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KATO). KATO uses the neural network to reparameterize the optimization problem, offering a unique solution to the challenges posed by stress minimization in TO. It also simplifies the penalization scheme by reducing sensitivity to certain parameters, which reduces the non-convexity of the stress minimization problem, enhancing convergence and stability. Our method demonstrates better performance in stress minimization compared to conventional approaches and a different neural network-based approach, achieving up to 10% lower maximum stress in common benchmark cases. KATO also shows remarkable efficiency, reducing computational time by up to 67% compared to conventional methods for stress minimization problems. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of KATO's performance, computational cost, scalability, and the impact of various neural network architectures. Our results indicate that KATO not only improves stress optimization but also offers insights into the relationship between neural network design and topology optimization performance, paving the way for more efficient and effective structural design processes.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of blood flow in patient-specific models of heart ventricles is a rapidly developing field of research, showing promise to improve future treatment of heart diseases. Fluid-structure interaction simulation of the mitral valve, with its complex structure including leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, provides additional prospects as well as challenges to such models. In this study, we combine a patient-specific model of the left ventricle with an idealized unified continuum fluid-structure interaction model of the mitral valve, to simulate the intraventricular diastolic blood flow. To the best of our knowledge, no monolithic fluid-structure interaction model, without the need for remeshing, has ever been used before to simulate the native mitral valve within the left ventricle. The chordae tendineae are simulated as a region of porous medium, to partially hinder the flow. Simulation results from this model are compared to those of a model with the same patient-specific left ventricle, but with the mitral valve simply modeled as a time-variant inflow boundary condition. The blood flow is analyzed with the E-wave propagation index, and by use of the triple decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor, which decomposes the flow into rigid body rotational flow, shearing flow, and irrotational straining flow. The triple decomposition enables analysis of the formation of initially large dominant flow features, such as the E-wave jet and the vortex ring around it, and their subsequent decay into smaller turbulent flow structures. This analysis of the development of flow structures over the duration of diastole appears to be in general agreement with the theory of the stability of rotation, shear, and strain structures. Elevated shear levels are investigated, but are found only in limited amounts that do not indicate significant risks of thrombus formation or other blood damage, which is to be expected in this healthy ventricle. The highest shear levels are localized at the leaflets in the fluid-structure interaction model, and at the ventricle wall in the planar model. The computed E-wave propagation indices are 1.21 for the fluid-structure interaction model and 1.90 for the planar valve model, which indicates proper washout in the apical region with no significant risk of blood stasis that could lead to left ventricular thrombus formation.},

This interpolation based on Magnus expansion can simplify the description of interpolated element stress tensor and strain energy. Then, the simplified discrete strain operator can be obtained by interpolating the virtual twist vector totally independently of the beam element formulation, which can avoid calculating complex matrix and further reduce geometric nonlinearity greatly. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the discrete equilibrium equation and the corresponding Jacobi matrix for static problems can be reduced. Finally, five static examples without topological loops are taken to validate the fourth-order convergence rate, strain-continuity, path independence, and singularity-free properties of the proposed beam element formulation.},

Using the equivalence principles, the smeared crack model is equivalently transformed into a layered separation format, which can consider both small and large deformations. Numerical verification through single thin-layer elements and Petersson's three-point bending beam demonstrates that the proposed model can comprehensively consider plastic deformation, damage, and stiffness changes in concrete. Furthermore, the seismic failure process of Koyna gravity dam is simulated using the proposed plastic-damage thin-layer element method.

To improve the computational efficiency, we developed an adaptive coupling model between PD and classical continuum mechanics (PD-CCM) based on the Morphing method, driven by the broken bond or strength criteria. We derived the dynamic equation of the coupled models from the Lagrangian equation and then the discretized finite element formulation. An adaptive coupling strategy was introduced by determining the key position using the broken bond or strength criteria. The PD subdomain was expanded by altering the value of the Morphing function around the key position. Additionally, the PD subdomain was meshed by discrete elements (DEs) (i.e., nodes were not shared between elements), allowing the crack to propagate freely along the boundary of the DE. The remaining subdomains were meshed by continuous elements (CEs). Following the PD subdomain expansion, the CEs were converted into DEs, and new nodes were inserted. The displacement vector and mass matrix were reconfigured to ensure calculation consistency throughout the solving process. Furthermore, the relationship between the expansion radius of the PD subdomain and the speed of crack propagation was also discussed. Finally, the effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed model were verified via three two-dimensional numerical examples.},

To do so, we derive two-phase homogenization blocks that are capable of treating incompressible fluid phases and infinite material contrast. In particular, we leverage existing results for linear elastic laminates to identify closed form expressions for the linear homogenization functions of two-phase layered emulsions. To treat infinite material contrast, we rely on the repeated layering of two-phase layered emulsions in the form of coated layered materials. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions which ensure that the effective properties of coated layered materials with incompressible phases are non-singular, even if one of the phases is rigid. With the derived homogenization blocks and non-singularity conditions at hand, we present a novel DMN architecture, which we name the flexible DMN (FDMN) architecture. We build and train FDMNs to predict the effective stress response of shear-thinning fiber suspensions with a Cross-type matrix material. For 31 fiber orientation states, six load cases, and over a wide range of shear rates relevant to engineering processes, the FDMNs achieve validation errors below 4.31% when compared to direct numerical simulations with fast-Fourier-transform based computational techniques. Compared to a conventional machine learning approach introduced previously by the consortium of authors, FDMNs offer better accuracy at an increased computational cost for the considered material and flow scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This article provides a normalized field product approach for topology optimization to achieve close-to-binary optimal designs. The method uses a parameter-free density measure that enforces a specified minimum length scale on the solid phase, ensuring smooth and transition-free topologies. The density evaluation does not rely on weight functions; however, the associated density functions are required to confined between 0 and 1. The method combines the SIMP scheme with the introduced density function for material stiffness interpolation. The success and efficacy of the approach are demonstrated through the design of both two- and three-dimensional designs, including stiff structures and compliant mechanisms. The structure's compliance is minimized for the former, whereas the latter involves optimizing a multicriteria objective. The presented numerical examples consider different volume fractions, length scales, and density functions. The proposed method is also seamlessly extended with advanced elements for solving 3D problems. The optimized designs obtained are close to binary without any user intervention while satisfying the desired feature size on the solid phase.},

  abstract     = {Laminated composite plates widely used in industries are prone to various defects at the interfaces between layers in complex usage environments and manufacturing processes, also known as the interfacial imperfection. Therefore, based on the third-order zigzag displacement field and a layer-spring model, a four-node quadrilateral quasi-conforming plate element (QCQ4) is proposed to calculate the free vibration of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection. In addition, combined with the numerical results from other literature, it is verified that the proposed plate element (QCQ4) can effectively obtain the stress and deflection of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection, and accurately calculate the free vibration of laminates with different geometries, thicknesses and fiber directions. Furthermore, numerical results show that when the dimensionless interface parameter R characterizing the interfacial imperfection increases from 0.0 to 1.0 and 5.0, respectively, the maximum reduction in the natural frequency of the laminated thick and thin plates in the first six modes exceeds 33% and 37%. This means that and seem to be two critical values for evaluating whether thick and thin laminates will experience a significant decrease in stiffness due to interfacial imperfection. Besides, it is also found that as the increase of the dimensionless interface parameter R , the 4th and 5th mode shapes of the square and circular laminate, and the 5th and 6th mode shapes of the triangular laminate will change compared with the mode shapes of laminates without interfacial imperfection.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the optimal control of constrained mechanical systems, with potential additional kinematic constraints at the final time. Correspondingly, the equations of motion of the underlying mechanical system assume the form of differential-algebraic equations with end constraints. The proposed discretisation of the optimality conditions yields a scheme which is capable of preserving control angular momentum maps resulting from the rotational symmetry of the underlying optimal control problem. The numerical solution of the discretised system is first tested with two solution strategies: Monolithic and staggered approaches, and then also solved with hybrid approaches, which combine salient features of each individual strategy. The monolithic strategy solves all the optimality conditions for all time steps as a single system of non-linear equations and relies on a Newton-Raphson scheme, which guarantees quadratic rates of convergence in the vicinity of the optimal solution trajectory. The staggered strategy is based on the Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM), where state and adjoint equations are solved separately, and the control equations provide an update of the control variables, which we here achieve with also a Newton-Raphson scheme. The proposed hybrid strategies combine the advantages of a conventional gradient-based FBSM with the individual Newton-based solution procedures once the solution is close to the optimal trajectory. The strategies are developed and compared through three representative numerical examples, which show that all schemes yield very similar solutions. However, the hybrid approaches become more advantageous in the computation time when the time-step decreases or the size of the problem increases.},

However, the significant computational demands still pose challenges, particularly in dynamic simulations. To mitigate these challenges, we present a newly devised asynchronous variational integrator (AVI) for phase field modeling of dynamic fracture, implemented within the framework of the finite element library FEniCS. The AVI allows each spatial mesh element to progress independently with its own characteristic time step. In the new approach, displacement updates occur as usual at each time step, while the phase field is globally solved after the displacement update of the largest spatial mesh element rather than after each time step. Benchmark problems are investigated to assess the performance and reliability of the new method, revealing notable computational savings while effectively capturing intricate dynamic fracture behavior.},

  abstract     = {The process of elastic deformation is performed using the radial basis functions (RBF) method for the background mesh and the volume-weighted interpolation method for the computational mesh. The RBF method performs interpolation independently in different directions and does not ensure boundary orthogonality during elastic deformation. This study proposes a strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of the dynamic mesh method. Based on the automatically generated adaptive background mesh, a reference displacement method for spatial points is first developed to obtain reasonable reference displacements with rotational correction for spatial control points. The RBF is then used to interpolate the rotation angle of the boundary represented by the quaternion. Therefore, the large angle deformation can be more smoothly propagated to the spatial region. In the background mesh, the translational deformation is obtained by the damping function based on the minimum distance, the rotational deformation is calculated by rotating around a small number of nodes with the minimum distance from the wall surface, and the final rotational displacement is obtained by inverse distance weighting. This method ensures boundary orthogonality. Afterwards, the one-step reference displacement method is developed. A subset of mesh nodes on the boundary surface and one layer outside the boundary are automatically selected using a greedy algorithm and considered as control points. The spatial point is assigned a value using a reference displacement. The deformation displacement of the background mesh is calculated using the RBF method, and then interpolated into the computational grid. The obtained results show that this method can significantly improve the orthogonality of the boundary layer and retain the high accuracy of the RBF method for elastic deformation. In addition, a two-step spatial multi-point selection method is developed. Using a spatial peak selection method of high flexibility based on the quality change before and after mesh deformation, multiple spatial points are selected and considered as control points at a time, which allows for increased stability and robustness of the dynamic mesh method for the one-step reference displacement method. The deformation ability of the two-step spatial multi-point selection method is increased by 20% compared with that of the one-step reference displacement method in a single deformation step. The criterion for point selection is general, and the algorithm has high efficiency, which allows spatial control points to be selected in multiple regions. The two-step spatial multi-point selection method provides a smooth mesh, stretching the overlapped and squeezed mesh. The CPU cost is comparable to the RBF, and iteration is not required. The time complexity of the proposed multiple point selection method is reduced to 2/(M + 1) times that of the single-point selection method, which adds one spatial point at a time until M points are added. Several typical examples show that the proposed methods improve the mesh quality by about 30% for two-dimensional flow and 17% for three-dimensional flow while ensuring the computational efficiency.},

We obtained the difference value in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form as the output of learning using the factorization machine. The QUBO form difference was subjected to the original Hamiltonian as the correction term. The performance of this correction term was evaluated by calculating the energy for a equilibrium state of diblock copolymer. In phase-field analysis, the time evolution equation is formulated so that the total free energy decreases; hence, a lower the free energy means a more accurate result close to that of a conventional method.

  abstract     = {Finite periodic layout for multicomponent systems signifies a compelling design strategy for constructing complex larger structures through assembling repeating representative unit-cells with various orientations. In addition to better transportability, handleability and replaceability, design with structural segmentation has been considered particularly valuable for additive manufacturing of large workpiece due to limited printing dimension of machine. However, existing design optimization of periodic structures has been largely restricted to simple translational placements of unit-cells, sophisticated tessellation with differently oriented topological unit-cells remains underexplored. This paper presents an efficient and adaptable topology optimization framework for concurrently optimizing periodic structures comprised of repeating topological unit-cells and their tailored orientations. By introducing a weighting factor associated with different orientation states of unit-cells, a dominant orientation for each unit-cell can gradually emerge in the course of optimization process. The proposed procedure combines the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model for topology optimization of unit-cell and the discrete material optimization (DMO) technique for the optimization of its orientation. The optimization objective is to minimize structural compliance subject to volume fraction constraint. Through sensitivity analysis, optimality criteria can be applied to simultaneously optimize a representative unit-cell (RUC) topology and the orientation weighting factors in the periodic macrostructure. Several 2D and 3D examples are investigated to demonstrate significant enhancement in compliance reduction of up to 34% compared to conventional periodic design without orientation optimization. This represents a notable improvement in finite periodic structural optimization, particularly leveraging the topology optimization to tailor unit-cell orientation rather than relying on brute-force search approaches. Our methodology paves a new avenue for designing more efficient and readily manufacturable lightweight structures with enhanced performance metrics.},

However, it is challenging to identify the load-carrying boundary in density-based topology optimization frame. To address this issue, a direct load-carrying boundary identification method is proposed to describe and update the design-dependent boundary load, and a topology optimization method for structures with design-dependent boundary load is presented. First, a Flood Fill algorithm (FFA) based domain extension method is introduced to generate a new structure with a boundary equivalent to the load-carrying boundary of the original structure. Then, the erosion boundary identification method is applied to the new structure to identify the load-carrying boundary instead of the original structure. Finally, the load information (direction and magnitude) of the design-dependent boundary load is determined using a normalized gradient algorithm, which completes the update of the design-dependent boundary load. This method overcomes the difficulty of identifying the load-carrying boundary in density-based methods. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by several examples of minimum compliance (including 3D) and flexible mechanisms.},

After briefly reviewing the two-scale boundary value problem derived based on homogenization theory, an RBF interpolation with a normalized kernel is formulated for a discrete dataset, and an optimization algorithm is applied to determine the three hyperparameters so as to achieve proper interpolation. Then, we formulate the surrogate homogenization model (SHM) using the interpolants to substitute for the macroscopic viscoelastic response. To show the specific procedure of the proposed surrogate modeling and demonstrate the performance of the created SHM, a representative numerical example is presented in the offline and online stages. In the offline stage, NMTs are carried out in the space of training data, including the temperature, to generate a dataset as long as the macroscopic stresses can be learned exhaustively, and then optimization is performed to determine the set of hyperparameters. Then, to validate the created SHM, its responses to unseen loading and temperature histories are compared with the corresponding NMT results. In the online stage, the created SHM is used to carry out a macroscopic analysis of a simple structure under specific loading and temperature conditions, and subsequently, the obtained macroscopic stresses are compared with those obtained from the localization analysis results. The results are also compared with those obtained from the single-scale direct numerical analyses.},

We construct the parameter to objective map in such a way that the gradient can be computed entirely by automatic differentiation at roughly the cost of an objective function evaluation. Without handcrafted initializations, the method produces regular topologies close to the optimal solution for standard benchmark problems whilst maintaining the ability to solve a more general class of problems than standard methods, for example, interface-coupled multiphysics.},

  abstract     = {Slender structures, such as rods, often exhibit large deformations even under moderate external forces (e.g., gravity). This characteristic results in a rich variety of morphological changes, making them appealing for engineering design and applications, such as soft robots, submarine cables, decorative knots, and more. Prior studies have demonstrated that the natural shape of a rod significantly influences its deformed geometry. Consequently, the natural shape of the rod should be considered when manufacturing and designing rod-like structures. Here, we focus on an inverse problem: Can we determine the natural shape of a suspended 2D planar rod so that it deforms into a desired target shape under the specified loading? We begin by formulating a theoretical framework based on the statics of planar rod equilibrium that can compute the natural shape of a planar rod given its target shape. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of uncertainties (e.g., noise in the data) on the accuracy of the theoretical framework. The results reveal the shortcomings of the theoretical framework in handling uncertainties in the inverse problem, a fact often overlooked in previous works. To mitigate the influence of the uncertainties, we combine the statics of the planar rod with the adjoint method for parameter sensitivity analysis, constructing a learning framework that can efficiently explore the natural shape of the designed rod with enhanced robustness. This framework is validated numerically for its accuracy and robustness, offering valuable insights into the inverse design of soft structures for various applications, including soft robotics and animation of morphing structures.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel framework for solving large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization problems. While most previous studies on fluid topology optimization assume steady-state flows, an increasing number of recent studies deal with unsteady flows, which are more general in engineering. However, unsteady flow topology optimization involves solving the governing and adjoint equations of a time-evolving system, which requires a significant computational cost for topology optimization with a fine mesh. Therefore, we propose a large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization based on the building-cube method (BCM), which is one of the hierarchical Cartesian mesh methods. Although the BCM has been confirmed to have excellent scalability and is suitable for massively parallel computing, there are no studies that have applied it to unsteady flow topology optimization. In the proposed method, the governing and adjoint equations are discretized by a cell-centered finite volume method based on the BCM, which can achieve high parallel efficiency even with a fine mesh. The effectiveness of the proposed method for large-scale computing is discussed through several examples of optimization and verification of computational efficiency by weak scaling.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) is widely used to analyse coupled (solid-water) problems under large deformations/displacements. However, if not addressed carefully, MPM u-p formulations for poromechanics can be affected by two major sources of instability. Firstly, inf-sup condition violation can arise when the spaces for the displacement and pressure fields are not chosen correctly, resulting in an unstable pressure field when the equations are monolithically solved. Secondly, the intrinsic nature of particle-based discretisation makes the MPM an unfitted mesh-based method, which can affect the system's condition number and solvability, particularly when background mesh elements are poorly populated. This work proposes a solution to both problems. The inf-sup condition is avoided using two overlapping meshes, a coarser one for the pressure and a finer one for the displacement. This approach does not require stabilisation of the primary equations since it is stable by design and is particularly valuable for low-order shape functions. As for the system's poor condition number, a face ghost penalisation method is added to both the primary equations, which constitutes a novelty in the context of MPM mixed formulations. This study frequently makes use of the theories of functional analysis or the unfitted Finite Element Method (FEM). Although these theories may not directly apply to the MPM, they provide a robust and logical basis for the research. These rationales are further supported by four numerical examples, which encompass both elastic and elasto-plastic cases and drained and undrained conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we extend the quasi-static multi-phase-field method for composite materials to the dynamic case. In the dynamic multi-phase-field method, each phase of the composites has its individual phase field, and the degradation of each phase is governed by its respective phase field. The macroscopic response is then obtained by averaging and homogenization approaches through the reduced-order-homogenization (ROH) framework. Through the ROH and the Francfort-Marigo variational principle, we can obtain the equations that govern the motion of the composites and the evolution of each phase field. This method is capable of capturing the characteristics of dynamic fracture, such as crack branching, without the need for any additional bifurcation criterion. Moreover, it can capture dynamic fracture patterns in composite materials, including matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The corresponding numerical algorithm that includes spatial and temporal discretization is developed. An implicit, staggered Newton-Raphson iterative scheme is implemented to solve the nonlinear coupled equations. Finally, this method is tested with several sets of dynamic fracture benchmarks, which demonstrates good agreement with the experiments and other numerical methods.},

It is along the thickness direction ξ that the midsurface is scaled to represent the three-dimensional geometry and that the analytical displacement solution is sought. Neumann expansion is used to approximate the inverse of the Jacobian as a quadratic matrix polynomial of ξ while the assumed natural strain method is applied to alleviate the shear and membrane locking. The virtual work principle considering body forces is utilized to derive the scaled boundary finite element equation, which is directly solved via the differential quadrature method.

In response, multiscale topology optimization, which finds the optimal design of microstructure for the macrostructure geometry and performance requirements, has become a hot topic in the field of structural optimization. While the basic optimization framework based on the homogenization theory spanning macro and microscales is available, it is computationally expensive and not easily applicable in practical scenarios such as high-resolution design for precision modeling and reliable design considering non-linearities. To address this issue, we focus on a homogenization analysis using a fast Fourier transform as an alternative approach to conventional finite element analysis and develop an optimization method with fast computing speed and low memory requirements. In this paper, we define a simple stiffness maximization problem with linear elastic materials and conduct two and three-dimensional optimization analyses to evaluate the validity and performance of the proposed method. We discuss the advantages of computational cost, the influence of the filtering process, and the appropriate setting of material contrast.},

The full-order model consists of a transient thermomechanical model modified by use of the previously developed Inherent Strain Rate method. When applying the projection-based ROM to this full-order model, the constructed data sequence enables the design a local ROM depending on the energy deposition length and process parameters.

  abstract     = {Finding the critical time step for conditionally stable time integration methods has been a decades-long problem. The apparently obvious option of directly computing it from a generalized eigenvalue analysis, identifying the largest eigenfrequency of the discrete system, is usually impractical because of its numerical expense and because a stiffness matrix is often unavailable in the context of explicit analysis. There exist two popular approaches to efficiently estimate the critical time step: A characteristic element length can be estimated based on heuristic formulas. The resulting estimate, however, cannot be guaranteed to be conservative. Another approach is to reformulate and simplify the underlying eigenvalue problem on the element level and to use certain inequalities to derive an upper bound for the largest eigenvalue. This is conservative but may show poor performance by significantly under-predicting the actual critical time step. Moreover, the necessary simplifications are usually specific to the investigated element formulation. Many works that develop time step estimators demonstrate their performance only for particular element configurations, making it difficult to compare the estimators. In this paper, data-driven approaches for time step estimation for 2d-elements that address several of the aforementioned problems are proposed. First, the set of all possible quadrilateral element geometries and its discrete representation are described. A detailed comparison of nine existing time step estimators based on more than ten million element configurations is presented. Additionally, the concept of an optimal safety factor function is introduced. This concept allows us to generate the optimal and conservative version of an existing estimator and thus solves two problems at the same time: It can be used to make non-conservative estimators conservative and to improve the performance of estimators that are conservative by construction. Finally, we formulate time step estimation as a function approximation problem. It allows us to derive customizable time step estimators solely based on data. Through two examples, we demonstrate that this data-driven approach yields time step estimators that outperform state-of-the-art estimators in terms of accuracy while also being efficient to evaluate.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an improved version of the Extended Lumped Damage Mechanics (XLDM) formulation within a position-based approach of the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the XLDM, the strain field has been assessed from the elongations of numerical extensometers, which connect the finite element nodes. In addition, localisation bands positioned along the elements' boundaries depict the mechanical effects of material degradation. The position-based approach of FEM enables the accurate modelling of geometrically non-linear effects and its computational implementation is straightforward. In this approach, the equilibrium configuration has been evaluated in relation to the nodal positions instead of its displacements. Thus, one improvement proposed herein involves the coupling of the XLDM failure predictions within an exact geometrically non-linear framework. Besides, in this study, the XLDM has been further improved by incorporating the damage growth caused by compressive stresses. The non-linear formulation proposed herein enables the presence of reinforcements, which have been added by an embedded scheme and lead to another improvement in the XLDM context. Three applications demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed non-linear scheme, in which the numerical responses obtained by the proposed improved formulation have been compared to experimental results available in the literature.},

In contrast to the standard multi-velocity field approach, this method employs a penalty method to evaluate contact forces at the discretised boundaries of their respective physical domains. This enhances simulation fidelity by accurately considering the deformability of the contact surface and preventing fictitious gaps between bodies in contact. Additionally, the method utilises the Extended B-Splines (EBSs) domain approximation, providing two key advantages. First, EBSs robustly mitigate grid cell-crossing errors by offering continuous gradients of the basis functions on the interface between adjacent grid cells. Second, numerical integration errors are minimised, even with small physical domains in occupied grid cells. The proposed method's robustness and accuracy are evaluated through benchmarks, including comparisons with analytical solutions, other state-of-the-art MPM-based contact algorithms, and experimental observations from the literature. Notably, the method demonstrates effective mitigation of stress errors inherent in contact simulations.},

The localized radial basis function (LRBF) collocation method is modified and utilized to solve the resulting boundary value problems. A new radial basis function is developed and combined with an optimization strategy for the distribution of source points to enhance the performance of the LRBF scheme. This method synergizes the KDC technique, which supports large time step sizes, with the LRBF collocation method, characterized by its truly meshless nature, to address dynamic problems over long durations. Additionally, the coefficient matrix produced by the LRBF method is sparse and depends solely on the spatial distances between collocation points and source points, which is advantageous for long-term simulations. Numerical simulations spanning thousands of time steps demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and convergence of the hybrid approach. The developed numerical framework shows significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in handling dynamic problems with substantial temperature variations.},

The NURBS fitting method is used to fit the physical response function, generating a NURBS surface for describing the physical response function, that is, the explicitly described physical response function surface. An iso-surface cut the NURBS physical response surfaces to obtain the explicitly described structure topology. In addition, the standard IGS files of the NURBS physical response surface and iso-surface can be transferred to Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) software without post-processing. The multiscale structure can be easily assembled in CAD software using the proposed method.

We demonstrate that the main condition for the stability of the numerical solution is that the distribution of the pressure nodes has to be coarser than that of the velocity both globally and locally in the domain, and there is no need for any more complex assumptions similar to the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi condition in the finite element method. Optimal stability is achieved when the relative local density of the velocity to pressure nodes is about 4:1. The convergence rates of the method correspond to the convergence rates of numerical differentiation for both low and higher order discretizations. The method works well on both mesh-based and irregular nodes, such as those generated by random or quasi-random numbers and on nodes with varying density. There is no need for special staggered arrangements, which suggests that node generation algorithms may produce just one node set and obtain the other by either refinement or coarsening. Numerical results for the benchmark Driven Cavity Problem confirm the robustness and high accuracy of the method, in particular resolving a cascade of multiple Moffatt Eddies at the tip of the wedge by using nodes obtained from the quasi-random Halton sequence.},

The enrichment based on the Heaviside function is used to strongly enforce the given nonhomogeneous interface condition, that is, the jump in the solution, and only the enrichment based on the product of the Heaviside and Distance functions contributes to the degrees of freedom. Consequently, the number of degrees of freedom in this approach is the same as that is required for an interface problem with homogeneous interface conditions. The chief merit is that the proposed method totally confors and does not use conventional techniques for the nonhomogeneous interface condition in the literature, such as the penalty method or the Lagrange multiplier.

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis plays a vital role in understanding the impact of control parameter variations on system output, particularly in cases where an objective functional evaluates the output's merit. The adjoint method has gained popularity due to its efficient computation, especially when dealing with a large number of control parameters and a few functionals. While the discrete form of the adjoint method is prevalent, exploring its continuous counterpart can offer valuable insights into the underlying mathematical problem, particularly in characterizing the boundary conditions. This paper presents an investigation into the continuous form of the adjoint method applied to time-dependent viscous flows, where the time dependence is either imposed by boundary conditions or arises from the system dynamics itself. The proposed approach enables the computation of sensitivities with respect to both geometric and operational control parameters using the same adjoint solution. For time-periodic flows, a special formulation is developed to mitigate the computational costs associated with time integration. Results demonstrate that the methodology proposed in a previous work can be successfully extended to time-dependent flows with fixed time spans. In such applications, time-accurate simulations of physics and adjoint fields are sufficient. However, periodic flows necessitate the application of the Leibniz Rule because the period might depend on the control parameters, which introduces additional terms to the adjoint-based sensitivity gradient. In that case, time integration can be limited to a minimum common multiple of all appearing periods in the flow. Although the accurate estimation of such multiple poses a challenge, the approach promises significant benefits for sensitivity analysis of fully established periodic flows. It leads to substantial cuts in computational costs and avoids transient data contamination.},

  abstract     = {Thermal analysis of fractured porous media is of interest in environmental and reservoir engineering. The dual-porosity method is a common and cost-efficient approach for modeling fractured domain. In the case of thermal analysis, this method encounters two challenges; the high dependence on the matrix to fracture transfer parameter, “shape factor,” and numerical oscillations produced in the conventional Galerkin finite element formulation for convection dominant problems. To overcome these issues a Petrov-Galerkin dual porosity (PGDP) algorithm is presented for the analysis of 2D transient heat flow in fractured porous media. In the computational algorithm, an appropriate unit cell is selected from the primary domain and the corresponding thermal shape factor is evaluated with a time-varying function. Unlike conventional constant shape factor models, this shape factor accounts for not only the geometry of the blocks, but also the thermal properties of the domain and existing boundary conditions. Several case studies are simulated to investigate the validity and sensitivity of the time-dependent thermal shape factor to different parameters for square and non-square blocks. Moreover, the Petrov-Galerkin formulation is applied to effectively achieve the accurate spatial results for highly convective heat flows. Numerical simulations are performed to study the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed PGDP algorithm for different range of convection and conduction regimes. This study illustrates that the PGDP algorithm efficiently enhances the accuracy of the simulation in modeling of fractured domains, particularly in transient stages. Moreover, the capability of the proposed computational algorithm is demonstrated in modeling square and non-square matrix formations.},

Ultimately, the proposed model aims at providing an efficient algorithm to simulate strongly-coupled fluid-structure interactions (FSI). Within this goal, it is necessary to propose a precise and robust numerical framework and validate it on stationary solid cases first, which is the scope of the present study. Classical FSI methods, such as body-fitted approaches, are facing challenges with moving or complex geometries in realistic conditions, requiring computationally expensive re-meshing operations. IBM offers an alternative by treating the solid structure geometry independently from the fluid mesh. This study focuses on the extension of the IBM to compressible flows, and a particular attention is given to the enforcement of various thermal boundary conditions. A hybrid approach, combining diffuse forcing for Dirichlet-type boundary conditions and ghost-nodes forcing for Neumann-type boundary conditions is introduced. Finally, a simplified model, relying only on diffuse IBM forcing, is investigated to treat specific cases where the fluid solid interface is considered as adiabatic. The accuracy of the method is validated through various test cases of increasing complexity.},

The continuous problem is first rewritten in a manner that can be directly handled by the parametrisation method, which relies upon automated asymptotic expansions. A new mixed fully Lagrangian formulation is thus proposed, which contains only explicit polynomial nonlinearities, which is then discretised in the framework of finite element procedures. Validation is performed on the classical parallel plate configuration, where different formulations using either the general framework or an approximation of the electrostatic field due to the geometric configuration selected are compared. Reduced-order models along these formulations are also compared to full-order simulations operated with a time integration approach. Numerical results show a remarkable performance both in terms of accuracy and the wealth of nonlinear effects that can be accounted for. In particular, the transition from hardening to softening behaviour of the primary resonance while increasing the constant voltage component of the electric actuation is recovered. Secondary resonances leading to superharmonic and parametric resonances are also investigated with the reduced-order model.},

Each type is characterized by self-initiation, unconditional stability, identical second-order accuracy, controllable numerical dissipation, and zero-order overshoots. Recognizing that single-step implicit methods can be conceptualized as composite single-sub-step ones, both algorithm types achieve identical effective stiffness matrices, thereby reducing the computational effort for solving linear problems. The utilization of auxiliary variables endows the proposed single-step method with numerical attributes akin to established counterparts, while achieving identical second-order accuracy. Conversely, the adoption of the composite sub-step technique in the proposed two-sub-step methods surpasses the published algorithms by significantly reducing the error constants. This superiority persists when enforcing the same sub-step sizes and sub-step dissipation levels. Numerical simulations affirm that the proposed methods consistently outperform existing alternatives without incurring additional computational expenses.},

Secondly, the interpolation error in the maximum norm is estimated in any dimension. Consequently, we get a theoretical convergence rate which has been sought since the year 2010. When restricted to one-dimensional problems, we construct a special test function to prove the superconvergence: (1) S-FEM flux is exact in the meaning of element-wise integral; (2) numerical flux is exact at some point in each element; (3) physical flux can be quadratically approximated at the center of each element. At last, we present two numerical experiments: (1) conventional S-FEM fails in high-contrast composite materials while our new scheme performs well; (2) our flux converges quadratically.},

  abstract     = {Porous microstructures represent a challenge for the convergence of FFT-based computational homogenization methods. In this contribution, we show that the damped Eyre–Milton iteration is linearly convergent for a class of nonlinear composites with a regular set of pores, provided the damping factor is chosen between zero and unity. First, we show that an abstract fixed-point method with non-expansive fixed-point operator and non-trivial damping converges linearly, provided the associated residual mapping satisfies a monotonicity condition on a closed subspace. Then, we transfer this result to the framework of polarization schemes and conclude the linear convergence of the damped Eyre–Milton scheme for porous materials. We present general arguments which apply to a class of nonlinear composites and mixed stress-strain loadings, as well. We show that the best contraction estimate is reached for a damping factor of 1 / 2 $$ 1/2 $$ , that is, for the polarization scheme of Michel–Moulinec–Suquet, and derive the corresponding optimal reference material. Our results generalize the recent work of Sab and co-workers who showed that an adaptively damped Eyre–Milton scheme leads to linear convergence for a class of linear composites with pores. Finally, we report on computational experiments which support our findings.},

  abstract     = {The smooth polyhedral model has been commonly used to construct non-spherical particles with smooth surfaces, whereas it is mainly constrained to numerical simulations involving concave-shaped particles. This constraint arises from the limitations imposed by the contact algorithm. In this study, the contact detection between smooth polyhedrons is simplified to that between dilated triangular elements, and a discrete element method for concave polyhedral particles with smooth surfaces is developed. Subsequently, an automatic mesh simplification algorithm is established to enhance the computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In validating the smooth polyhedral model, the simulation results of a hexahedron colliding with a plane are found to agree favorably with the experimental results. Then, the elastic collisions between the convex and concave particles are analyzed, and the total kinetic energy before and after the particle collision remains unchanged. Furthermore, the influences of particle morphology on the packing fraction, flow fluctuation, flow rate, mixing rate, velocity distribution, and system energy in hoppers and rotating drums are analyzed, revealing the underlying flow characteristics of concave polyhedral granular materials with smooth surfaces.},

  abstract     = {The traditional approach to structural lightweight optimization design, which is based on the elastic limit rule, often results in a structure that exhibits either weight redundancy or strength redundancy to some extent. This study introduces a novel integration of shakedown analysis with structural topology optimization, departing from the conventional elastic limit rule. Shakedown analysis identifies a non-failure external load region beyond the elastic limit but below the plastic limit, independent of loading history. The proposed method, for the first time, accounts for the influence of self-equilibrium residual stress at the element level, redefining effective and ineffective elements in topology optimization. Shakedown total stress replaces elastic equivalent stress, offering a comprehensive measure. Utilizing Melan's lower bound theorem, a gradient-based topology optimization framework for shakedown analysis is developed, ensuring structures stay within the elastic–plastic range, preventing excessive plastic deformation. The approach, employing the moving asymptotes method after adjoint sensitivity analysis of shakedown total stress, is applied to a three-dimensional L-shaped bracket. Even with a remarkable 50% reduction in weight, the maximum total shakedown stress of the bracket reveals that it only increases by a modest 17.20% from its initial value. Moreover, compared to traditional topology optimization methods based on either elastic stress or stiffness, the proposed method based on total shakedown stress leads to a higher shakedown limit. Specifically, the configuration designed using the total shakedown stress exhibited increases of 2.01% and 9.82% in the shakedown limit compared to those obtained using stiffness and equivalent elastic stress, respectively. This suggests that the proposed method can effectively balance the trade-off between shakedown strength and structural stiffness, achieving a 2.01% rise in shakedown strength with only a 2.24% compromise in structural stiffness. These findings highlight the method's effectiveness and potential, emphasizing the benefit of redefining effective and ineffective elements using shakedown stress in topology optimization.},

To be scalable, these methods are equipped with an augmentation projector built from the local preconditioners nullspaces. The determination of these nullspaces is a complex task in the case of ill conditioned system, the use of block low rank compression makes this task even more complex as MUMPS' automatic detection no longer works properly. Two alternatives based on incomplete factorization with a well-chosen Schur complement are proposed. Also, the first massively parallel implementation of the adaptive multipreconditioned BDD solver (AMPBDD) is introduced. The performance of the methods is assessed with two weak scalability studies on problems up to 24,576 cores and about 790 millions of unknowns, on the Sator and Topaze supercomputers. BLR preconditioning proves to be an interesting strategy both in terms of memory usage and time to solution for reasonably conditioned problems.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel method for generating sequential parameter estimates and quantifying epistemic uncertainty in dynamical systems within a data-consistent (DC) framework. The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real- or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.},

The lowest order version of the proposed element reduces to the classical Bogner–Fox–Schmit (BFS) element for Kirchhoff plates. The GLL basis allows diagonalisation of the mass matrix using the nodal quadrature technique, which enhances the computational efficiency. The numerical properties of the proposed element are comprehensively evaluated, including the conditioning of the system matrices. Moreover, the effect of employing different numerical integration schemes and nodal sets is examined in both static and free vibration analyses. The effectiveness of the proposed element in wave propagation problems is evaluated by comparing its performance to the converged solutions achieved using the BFS element with a very fine mesh. Results demonstrate that the current element, without and even with mass matrix diagonalisation delivers exceptional accuracy while also exhibiting faster convergence and enhanced computational efficiency than the existing Kirchhoff plate elements.},

This interface filtering is achieved via the combination of the variable-radius-based partial-differential-equation (PDE) filtering and the Heaviside projection on a density representation. In the proposed method, designs are represented by a density field with sharp interface and no internal grey features, and a filter radius field is used as the design variable in the optimization process. With this method, any density distribution with sharp interfaces can be used as initial designs, and sharp density contrast in density distribution is preserved throughout the optimization process. An analytical relation between the maximum movements of interfaces and the maximum filter radius is given, so that the interface movement can be controlled during the optimization process. Sensitivities with respect to filter radius variables are derived. Two numerical treatments, involving the density update scheme and the radius re-initialization scheme, are developed to achieve smooth successive shape updates and avoid artificial local minima. Numerical examples, including geometric deformation problem, structural compliance minimization, thermal compliance minimization, and negative Poisson ratio problem, are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method.},

Nevertheless, microscopic propagation is often unstable and when using phase-field fracture poor convergence is found or, in the case of using staggered algorithms, leads to the presence of jumps in the evolution of the cracks. In this work, a novel method is proposed to perform micromechanical simulations with phase-field fracture imposing monotonic increases of crack length and allowing the use of monolithic implementations, being able to resolve all the snap-backs during the unstable propagation phases. The method is derived for FFT-based solvers in order to exploit its very high numerical performance in micromechanical problems, but an equivalent method is also developed for Finite Elements (FE) showing the equivalence of both implementations. It is shown that the stress-strain curves and the crack paths obtained using the crack control method are superposed in stable propagation regimes to those obtained using strain control with a staggered scheme. J-integral calculations confirm that during the propagation process in the crack control method, the energy release rate remains constant and equal to an effective fracture energy that has been determined as a function of the concretization for FFT simulations. Finally, to show the potential of the method, the technique is applied to simulate crack propagation through the microstructure of composites and porous materials providing an estimation of the effective fracture toughness.},

Consequently, a fundamental aspect in topology optimization is to consider the following additive manufacturing constraints: minimal length scale and overhang. The aim of this paper is to propose a new numerical method to control globally such additive manufacturing constraints. The idea relies on penalizing a regularized version of the perimeter: an isotropic version for global length and an anisotropic version for overhang. Besides, we show that the method may be used with density and level set approaches. Several numerical examples, including compliant mechanisms and material design, show that some bars have been removed, decreasing the complexity of the shape, and vertical tendency orientation of boundaries is generally obtained.},

However, the stability of IMEX schemes cannot be guaranteed for general non-linear problems. In this article, we present a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) stabilization of high-order IMEX time integration schemes that leads to unconditional stability. The proposed IMEX-BDF k -SAV schemes treat linear terms implicitly using k th-order backward difference formulas (BDF k ) and non-linear terms explicitly. This eliminates the need for iterations in non-linear problems and leads to low computational costs. Truncation error analysis of the proposed IMEX-BDF k -SAV schemes confirms that up to k th-order accuracy can be achieved and this is verified through a series of convergence tests. Unlike existing SAV schemes for first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a novel SAV for the proposed schemes that allows direct solution of the second-order ODEs without transforming them into a system of first-order ODEs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes by solving several non-linear problems in structural dynamics and show that the proposed schemes can achieve high accuracy at a low computational cost while maintaining unconditional stability.},

Firstly, a new and novel generalization of the Runge-Kutta (RK) and Runge-Kutta-Nyström (RKN) methods is proposed, featuring an advanced Butcher table for designing new and optimal algorithms. It encompasses not only the classical multi-stage methods as subsets, but also introduces novel designs with enhanced accuracy, stability, and numerical dissipation/dispersion properties. Secondly, to sharpen the focus on the present developments, several existing multi-stage explicit time integration methods (which are of interest and the focus of this paper) are revisited within the proposed unified mathematical framework, such that it highlights the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of various existing methods. Thirdly, the consistency analysis is rigorously demonstrated using both single-step and multi-step local truncation errors, addressing the order reduction problem observed in existing methods when applied to nonlinear dynamics problems. Finally, two sets of single-step, two-stage, third-order time-accurate schemes with controllable numerical dissipation/dispersion at the bifurcation point are presented. In contrast to existing methods, these newly proposed schemes preserve third-order time accuracy in nonlinear dynamics applications and exhibit improved stability in cases involving physical damping. Numerical examples are demonstrated to verify the theoretical analysis and the superior performance of the proposed schemes compared to existing methods.},

Meshfree particle methods like SPH are not mimetic, in the sense that discrete mass conservation does not imply discrete volume conservation. On the other hand, meshfree collocation methods typically do not use any notion of mass. As a result, they are neither mass conservative nor volume conservative at the discrete level. In this paper, we give an overview of various sources of conservation errors across different meshfree methods. The present work focuses on one specific issue: inconsistent volume and mass definitions. We introduce the concept of representative masses and densities, which are essential for accurate post-processing in meshfree collocation methods. Using these, we introduce an artificial compressibility in the fluid to reduce errors in volume conservation. Numerical experiments show that the introduced frameworks significantly improve volume conservation behaviour in meshfree collocation methods, even for complex industrial test cases such as automotive water crossing.},

  abstract     = {This work establishes a thermo-mechanical coupling model for thermally induced cracks in quasi-brittle materials within the framework of localizing gradient damage theory. The constitutive relation considering the thermal expansion effect, and the heat conduction equation integrating the volumetric strain and damage evolution, are formulated based on the Clausius–Duhem inequality to ensure thermodynamic consistency. In particular, to accommodate the tension-compression strength asymmetry across different quasi-brittle materials, a modified Mazars strain is proposed as the driving force for the micro equivalent strain, where the first invariant of strain tensor and an adjustable ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength ( k $$ k $$ ) are introduced. The numerical implementation employs the generalized-α method for time domain discretization and the staggered scheme for decoupling. Numerical simulations demonstrate a nice feasibility of the modified Mazars strain in capturing both tensile and mixed-mode failures, and the proposed model proves capable of characterizing complex crack behaviors under thermal loading in both quasi-static and dynamic scenarios. The quenching test simulations of ceramic plates highlight the bidirectional coupling effects on crack patterns. Unidirectional coupling models that ignore the influence of volumetric strain and damage evolution on the temperature field would underestimate the temperature gradient, resulting in larger crack spacing and fewer cracks. In the thermal shock tests of cylindrical specimens, the transition in crack patterns from spiral shear bands to an annular damage zone with increasing compression-tension strength ratio ( k $$ k $$ ) is precisely captured, demonstrating the generality of the proposed model for various quasi-brittle materials with tension-compression strength asymmetry.},

Sensitivity filtering methods have found extensive utility in mitigating numerical instabilities. Nevertheless, conventional sensitivity filtering can introduce numerous gray elements along the topology's boundaries, thereby impeding practical manufacturing within real-world engineering applications. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic sensitivity filter that adjusts the sensitivity at each iterative step based on the optimization outcomes of the preceding iteration. Through diverse test examples, our method demonstrates the capacity to effectively solve the numerical instability problem while concurrently achieving a nearly pure black and white design, characterized by significantly reduced computational expense and improved structural stiffness.},

  abstract     = {The Stokes equations are used to model the motion of fluid flows where inertial terms can be neglected. Traditional finite element approaches such as the Taylor–Hood element do not ensure local conservation pointwise of the mass. This can be achieved by employing a mixed formulation with the proper combination of H ( div ) $$ H\left(\operatorname{div}\right) $$ and L 2 $$ {L}^2 $$ spaces. In this context, this article presents a new hybrid-hybrid formulation to solve the Stokes equations. By applying Lagrange multipliers, the continuity of the tangential velocity is enforced, which is not intrinsically guaranteed by H ( div ) $$ H\left(\operatorname{div}\right) $$ spaces. In addition, a variation of the traditional H ( div ) $$ H\left(\operatorname{div}\right) $$ space, called Hdiv-C, is used to approximate the fields. The Hdiv-C space is created using concepts of the exact De Rham sequence and is shown to yield a smaller global system of equations than traditional finite element H ( div ) $$ H\left(\operatorname{div}\right) $$ spaces. A two-dimensional manufactured solution problem and the three-dimensional Annular-Couette flow problem are used to verify the hybrid-hybrid formulation's convergence rates, which are compared to Taylor–Hood's results. Application examples based on lab-on-chip mixers are analyzed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The examples consist of three different serpentine channel geometries: two in two dimensions (a sinusoidal and a “bumped” serpentine) and one in three dimensions (a C-shape serpentine). The results show that the hybrid-hybrid formulation combined with the Hdiv-C space is suitable for solving Stokes problems with optimal convergence rates, comparable to the Taylor–Hood element.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a regularization technique using discovered partial differential equations (PDEs) with an example of a surrogate model of crack propagation. Regularization techniques are so essential in machine learning to improve generalization performance. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have been proposed, which can be trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given PDE(s). However, the observational data are often measured under complex physical phenomena with fluctuations. PINN is, therefore, difficult to apply to multiphysics problems. Thus, PDE(s) is discovered, and the loss is defined by the weighted sum of the prediction loss and the PDE(s) loss as regularization, which is expected to reduce the validation loss and improve the generalization performance. PDE(s) is discovered using data that have been partially differentiated using Pytorch's automatic differentiation package. Automatic differentiation allows us to discover PDE(s) consisting of input and output parameters. In the surrogate model of crack propagation, the interpretable PDEs were discovered using AI Feynman, which consists of the derivatives of crack propagation vectors and their rate with respect to the coordinates of the analysis model. The validation loss for training constrained by PDEs was reduced by about 93% compared to the unconstrained validation loss. The error in crack length reduced from 2.23% to 0.12%, and the error in crack propagation rate reduced from 19.26% to 1.60%. The effectiveness of the discovered PDE regularization is discussed based on training results.},

Additionally, using an advanced solver significantly reduces computation time, making it well-suited for handling large-scale problems. The performance of the enhanced formulation is demonstrated by several numerical examples and compared to the results from the initial model. The results show that the enhanced formulation satisfies numerical stability and exhibits quadratic convergence behavior.

  abstract     = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a fully Lagrangian particle method, has been widely used in various applications, such as the simulation of incompressible flow with a free surface. For highly viscous flow, which typically appears in polymer processing, a fully implicit scheme, which implicitly treats both the predictor and corrector procedures of the projection method in the SPH framework, is efficient and numerically stable. This study proposes a simple and efficient fully implicit scheme that improves predictive accuracy for highly viscous flow. The proposed scheme utilizes a recently developed scheme for highly viscous flow that performs the pressure calculation before the viscosity diffusion calculation, unlike the conventional projection method. This study further improves the viscosity diffusion calculation by considering a viscous diffusion term that is usually ignored due to the continuity equation. Including this term enables us to correctly perform calculations for non-Newtonian flows. The increase in the computational cost that results from the inclusion of the term is alleviated by introducing a two-step method for calculating the viscous diffusion terms. The developed scheme is applied to injection molding of a polymer melt between two parallel plates. The results show that the proposed two-step implicit scheme reproduces the fountain flow behavior near the advancing front. In addition, a three-dimensional molding simulation of a plate with a hole shows a significant improvement in the prediction of the filling pattern in the mold.},

An advantage of DMCDM is that it combines the interpolation capabilities of the finite element method with the direct use of an integral form of the balance laws. Furthermore, it is easily extensible to mixed formulations, resulting in simpler than traditional finite element formulations. In this work, we extend DMCDM to the fully finite strain case with plasticity. We introduce a new discretization algorithm for finite strain problems, which includes a mean-dilatation technique to solve the volumetric locking problem. Assessment is supported by five linear and five finite strain benchmark problems, one of them being 3D. Finite strain solutions were found to be stable, exempt from hourglassing, and also locking-free. Results are found to be competitive with classical F-bar and B-bar elements, with a simpler formulation.},

The technique avoids geometric consideration of how a crack cuts elements or intersects other cracks. Each crack is described separately in terms of its sign distance function and regularized step function, which are only recorded for nodes in the region where the gradient of the regularized step function is non-zero. The algorithm creates a set of superimposed nodes, referred to as node twins, and elements, referred to as twinned elements, for each crack and determines the connectivity of the element twins using the involved crack indices. The displacement jump is calculated between each pair of element twins corresponding to the same crack, and a cohesive zone model (CZM) is formulated for each pair of twins to model crack opening. Following the theory for the novel method, several examples are presented that illustrate capabilities of the new method that the traditional RX-FEM formulation lacked. A quasi-2D example of offset crack propagation is considered and successfully compared with published results. Additionally, two 3D examples involving perpendicularly intersecting cracks are considered, illustrating the intersection of two crack fronts and correct partitioning of the domain into eight fragments due to three crossing cracks, respectively.},

However, the classical MMC method may encounter instability during the iterative process due to the excessively free movement of components and geometric defects caused by the incomplete fusion of components. This article proposes a novel joint-driven MMC (JMMC) method to address these issues. The core idea involves introducing a set of joint components to control and constrain the movement and deformation of the ordinary components. These ordinary components are interconnected through the joint components, guiding their movement and deformation within the design domain to facilitate structural layout changes, and the sizes of both ordinary and joint components can also be simultaneously optimized to alter the structural topology. Compared to the classical MMC method, the JMMC method retains the advantages of fewer design variables, explicit geometric information of structural boundaries, and seamless CAD integration while effectively mitigating iterative instability and avoiding the “dirty geometry” issues caused by incomplete component fusion. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In many applications in computer-aided engineering, like parametric studies, structural optimization, or virtual material design, a large number of almost similar models must be simulated. Although the individual scenarios may differ only marginally in both space and time, the same amount of effort is invested in each new simulation, without taking into account the experience and knowledge gained in previous simulations. Therefore, we have developed a method that combines data-based Model Order Reduction (MOR) and reanalysis, exploiting knowledge from previous simulation runs to accelerate computations in multi-query contexts. While MOR allows reducing model fidelity in space and time without significantly deteriorating accuracy, reanalysis uses results from previous computations as a predictor or preconditioner. In particular, this method enables acceleration of the exact computation of critical points, such as limit and bifurcation points, by the method of extended systems for systems that depend on a set of design parameters, such as material or geometric properties. Such critical points are of utmost engineering significance due to the special characteristics of the structural behavior in their vicinity. Conventional reanalysis methods, like the fold line analysis, can be used to accelerate the computation of critical points of almost similar systems but are limited in their applicability. For the fold line analysis, only small parameter variations are possible as the algorithm may not converge to the correct solution or fail to converge elsewise. Moreover, this method is only suited to finding the first critical points of limit point problems. In contrast to that, our developed data-based “reduced model reanalysis” method overcomes these problems. Thus, a larger parameter space can be covered. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated for a couple of numerical examples, including standard and isogeometric finite element models.},

We evaluate the performance of our method, both independently and in combination with the L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm (Limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno with Bound constraints), and we compare our results with those of L-BFGS-B alone. Using synthetic data, we show that both the correlation matrix calibration method and the combined one reduce the loss function of the optimization problem more effectively than L-BFGS-B. Moreover, the correlation matrix calibration method exhibits greater robustness to the initial parameter guess than both the combined method and L-BFGS-B. When applied to noisy data, all three calibration methods achieve comparable results. Although the correlation matrix calibration method yields less accurate parameter estimates than L-BFGS-B, in a real-world clinical case, the two new calibration methods provide clinical insights comparable to L-BFGS-B. Notably, the correlation matrix calibration method is three times faster than the other two calibration methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our new calibration method for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel approach for coupling non-isothermal fluid dynamics with fracture mechanics to capture thermal effects within fluid-filled fractures accurately. This method addresses critical aspects of calculating fracture width in enhanced geothermal systems, where the temperature effects of fractures are crucial. The proposed algorithm features an iterative coupling between an interface-capturing phase-field fracture method and interface-tracking thermo-fluid-structure interaction using arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian coordinates. We use a phase-field approach to represent fractures and reconstruct the geometry to frame a thermo-fluid-structure interaction problem, resulting in pressure and temperature fields that drive fracture propagation. We developed a novel phase-field interface model accounting for thermal effects, enabling the coupling of quantities specific to the fluid-filled fracture with the phase-field model through the interface between the fracture and the intact solid domain. We provide several numerical examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm. In particular, we analyze mesh convergence of our phase-field interface model, investigate the effects of temperature on crack width and volume in a static regime, and highlight the method's potential for modeling slowly propagating fractures.},

The utilization of both Lobatto and Chebyshev node sets in SEDM significantly enhances solution efficiency by replacing integration with direct differential. Moreover, for strongly nonlinear problems caused by thermal radiation, unknown terms are incorporated into the stiffness matrix, and the relaxation iteration technique is also employed, the convergence has been improved compared to traditional methods. Importantly, the element format of the SEDM for 3D problems with discontinuous interfaces is given specifically in this paper, and element-by-element loop assembly of stiffness matrices is realized. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the present method in efficiently and accurately solving 2D and 3D problems with discontinuous interfaces. The present method not only achieves faster convergence than the traditional finite element method, but also attains higher accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom and shorter computational time. Compared to the spectral element method (SEM), the proposed method significantly reduces the computation time of the stiffness matrix. Furthermore, by employing the coupled SEM-SEDM approach, computational efficiency is enhanced while maintaining high precision in sensitive regions.},

The traditional method cannot automatically divide the 3D surface topology in complex structures. Thus, we propose a surface-structured quadrilateral mesh generation method based on topology-consistent-preserved patch segmentation. The core idea is to segment the complex 3D model into several simple parts according to mesh quality and map each part to the 2D parametric domain based on the conformal parameterization method. Then, we utilize pattern-based topology partitioning to divide the parametric domain into multiple quadrilateral subdomains, facilitating the generation of 2D structured quadrilateral meshes. By using the inverse mapping algorithm based on barycentric weights, the generated 2D structured mesh is inversely mapped back to the 3D space. Finally, we splice each part accurately according to the structured mesh distribution. Experimental results show that our proposed method can generate higher-quality structured quadrilateral meshes than previous methods without losing the mesh topology of the original model.},

Based on the bar axial force correction method, the problem that the RVE method that node reaction forces on the common boundary may be unbalanced can be solved. For truss materials with periodic units, the effective elastic parameters and nodal displacement responses based on the proposed method are completely consistent those for the asymptotic homogenization (AH) method. Meanwhile, the proposed method is simpler than the AH method. Furthermore, compared with the axial compression experiment, the elastic modulus error of the proposed method is 3.81%. Thus, the correctness of this method is proved. Finally, the comparisons of different homogenization methods are analyzed in the numerical examples. The numerical examples show that the calculation results of the proposed method are the same as those of the AH method. Compared with the AH method, the maximum error of effective elastic parameters and nodal displacements for the RVE method are 22.51% and 13.65%, respectively. Compared with the AH method, the maximum error of effective elastic parameters and nodal displacements for the two-node (TN) method are 14.43% and 10.60%, respectively.

The proposed segregated solution procedure uses Picard-type defect (deferred) outer corrections, where the primary unknowns are cell-centre displacements and pressures. Spurious zero-energy modes (numerical oscillations in displacement and pressure) are avoided by introducing stabilisation (smoothing) diffusion terms to the pressure and momentum equations. Appropriate scaling of the momentum “Rhie–Chow” stabilisation term is shown to be important in regions of plasticity and damage. To accurately predict damage and fracture in wire drawing where hydrostatic pressure is high, novel variants of the Lemaitre model with crack-closure and triaxiality effects are proposed. The developed methods are validated against the notched round bar and flat notched bar experimental cases and subsequently applied to the analysis of axisymmetric wire drawing. It is shown that the proposed finite volume approach provides a robust basis for predicting damage in wire drawing, where the proposed novel Lemaitre model with crack-closure effects was shown to be the most suitable for predicting experimentally observed fracture.},

However, the conventional use of a single-time step for the entire domain can be inefficient. This article proposes a multi-time stepping algorithm that addresses this challenge by relaxing the constraint for an integer or constant time step ratio between subdomains and eliminating the need for kinematic interpolation. The algorithm ensures the satisfaction of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, deviating only to allow subdomains to remain in synchronization. Consequently, less integration steps are performed in comparison to state-of-the-art asynchronous integrators. We extend to the coupling of multiple subdomains, where each subdomain has its time step. Simulating stress wave propagation in metamaterials demonstrates that the proposed algorithm significantly accelerates simulation time, without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract     = {To obtain fast solutions for governing physical equations in solid mechanics, we introduce a method that integrates the core ideas of the finite element method with physics-informed neural networks and concept of neural operators. We propose directly utilizing the available discretized weak form in finite element packages to construct the loss functions algebraically, thereby demonstrating the ability to find solutions even in the presence of sharp discontinuities. Our focus is on micromechanics as an example, where knowledge of deformation and stress fields for a given heterogeneous microstructure is crucial for further design applications. The primary parameter under investigation is the Young's modulus distribution within the heterogeneous solid system. Our investigations reveal that physics-based training yields higher accuracy compared with purely data-driven approaches for unseen microstructures. Additionally, we offer two methods to directly improve the process of obtaining high-resolution solutions, avoiding the need to use basic interpolation techniques. The first one is based on an autoencoder approach to enhance the efficiency for calculation on high resolution grid points. Next, Fourier-based parametrization is utilized to address complex 2D and 3D problems in micromechanics. The latter idea aims to represent complex microstructures efficiently using Fourier coefficients. The proposed approach draws from finite element and deep energy methods but generalizes and enhances them by learning parametric solutions without relying on external data. Compared with other operator learning frameworks, it leverages finite element domain decomposition in several ways: (1) it uses shape functions to construct derivatives instead of automatic differentiation; (2) it automatically includes node and element connectivity, making the solver flexible for approximating sharp jumps in the solution fields; and (3) it can handle arbitrary complex shapes and directly enforce boundary conditions. We provided some initial comparisons with other well-known operator learning algorithms, further emphasize the advantages of the newly proposed method.},

To guarantee the precision of RVM, the first level samples and the last level samples of iCE are used as candidate samples and the last level samples are regenerated along with the RVM updates. To prevent unnecessary updates of RVM, the proposed method considers the positions of the samples in the current design of experiment. In addition, based on the statistical properties of RVM and iCE, an error-based stopping criterion is proposed.

In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared with the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5%–10 Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1%–7 relative errors.

  abstract     = {The paper presents a novel approach for reducing the co-simulation interface representation between multiple large-scale models. The methodology leverages model order reduction through component mode synthesis in some specific small deformation flexible multibody formulations that yield a constant transformation matrix between Cartesian coordinates and general multibody coordinates, such as the flexible natural coordinates formulation or the generalized component mode synthesis. The constant transformation matrix stemming from these techniques is further modified using modified Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization and the effective independence methodology to create a constant interface model reduction matrix. This matrix effectively connects a minimal set of interface nodes to the entire nodal domain, while simultaneously projecting the forces acting on the entire nodal domain onto the interface nodes. Notably, the proposed methodology scales the size of the required co-simulation interface representation with the considered set of mode shapes rather than the size of the numerical finite element mesh. This co-simulation interface model reduction strategy not only renders large distributed load models compatible with the Functional Mock-Up Interface but also extends its applicability to any structural model beyond the flexible multibody scope, provided that deformations remain relatively small. Numerical validation with a simply supported beam, connected to springs at each node, demonstrates that the interface model reduction error is significantly smaller than the co-simulation error. This suggests that substantial interface model reduction can be achieved without compromising accuracy. Moreover, additional numerical validation performed with a rotor-drum model showcases the versatility and scalability of the proposed approach, particularly in addressing dynamic structural systems.},

  abstract     = {A posteriori reduced-order models (ROM), for example, based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), are essential to affordably tackle realistic parametric problems. They rely on a trustful training set, that is a family of full-order solutions (snapshots) representative of all possible outcomes of the parametric problem. Having such a rich collection of snapshots is not, in many cases, computationally viable. A strategy for data augmentation, designed for parametric laminar incompressible flows, is proposed to enrich poorly populated training sets. The goal is to include in the new, artificial snapshots emerging features, not present in the original basis, that do enhance the quality of the reduced basis (RB) constructed using POD dimensionality reduction. The methodologies devised are based on exploiting basic physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation, to construct physically relevant, artificial snapshots at a fraction of the cost of additional full-order solutions. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the ideas exploiting only mass conservation (i.e., incompressibility) are not producing significant added value with respect to the standard linear combinations of snapshots. Conversely, accounting for the linearized momentum balance via the Oseen equation does improve the quality of the resulting approximation and therefore is an effective data augmentation strategy in the framework of viscous incompressible laminar flows. Numerical experiments of parametric flow problems, in two and three dimensions, at low and moderate values of the Reynolds number are presented to showcase the superior performance of the data-enriched POD-RB with respect to the standard ROM in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

The key lies in the definition of a novel dynamic constitutive relation error formulation, which is proven to be a strict bound of the discretization error. Moreover, based on the established dynamic constitutive relation error and the goal-oriented error estimation framework, strict upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest are also obtained. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the proposed strict bounds and to explore the application of these bounds to adaptive time stepping and mesh refinement.},

This model integrates three main processes: fluid flow in porous media, reactive transport, and the mechanical deformation of fractured porous media using a variational phase-field approach. To account for chemical reactions, we use the geochemical package PHREEQC, coupled with a finite-element transport solver (OpenGeoSys), to model reactions in both thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetically, considering changes in porosity. To represent chemical damage, we introduce a variable that ranges from intact material to fully damaged material. This variable accounts for changes in porosity as a result of chemical reactions, separate from the mechanical damage represented by the phase-field variable. We test our model through various examples to showcase its ability to capture fracture nucleation and propagation driven by chemical reactions.

Disk B-spline representation generalizes the concept of the B-spline control point into a control disk, enhancing the ability to manipulate both the shape and thickness of the region. Therefore, this representation is frequently employed for shape optimization. The optimized metamaterials described by disk B-spline are decomposed into a sequence of circles constructing one implicit function. A novel optimization model based on disk B-spline representation is proposed, and the homogenization theory is used for calculating effective Poisson's ratio (PR). The numerical examples contained missing rib metamaterials, petal-like metamaterials, and extreme PR metamaterials, which are studies to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness. By explicitly manipulating the parameters of the disk's B-spline, a broad spectrum of unexpectedly negative Poisson's ratio from -0.1 to -0.9 sequences can be achieved, and arbitrary Poisson's ratios structures can be obtained through interpolating continuous parameters. It's also extended to encompass 3D structures. We validate the accuracy of our results by comparing them with simulations performed using commercial software.},

To design original energy-stable schemes, they have to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation to determine the introduced Lagrange multiplier, which can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale and long-time simulations involving complex nonlinear terms. In this article, we propose an essential improved technique to modify this issue, which can be seen as a semi-implicit combined Lagrange multiplier approach. In general, the newly constructed schemes keep all the advantages of the Lagrange multiplier method and significantly reduce the computation costs. Besides, the new proposed second-order backward difference formula (BDF2) scheme dissipates the original energy, as opposed to a modified energy for the classic Lagrange multiplier approach. In addition, we establish a general framework for extending our constructed method to dissipative systems. Finally, several examples have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The classic constitutive model of metal plasticity employs the concept of yield surface to describe the strain-stress response of metals. Yield surfaces are constructed as level sets of yield functions, which in turn are assumed to be homogeneous, smooth and convex. These properties ensure the mathematical consistency of the constitutive model while also facilitating the calibration of the yield function. The significant progress in computing hardware and software of the last two decades has opened new possibilities for research into general-purpose yield functions that are capable of capturing with high accuracy the mechanical properties of sheet metal. Here we investigate the modeling capabilities of yield functions defined by homogeneous, smooth and convex neural networks (HSC-NN). We find that small-sized HSC-NNs are capable of reproducing a wide range of convex shapes. This type of network is then ideally suited to data-driven frameworks based on virtual testing or on interpolation of data from mechanical tests, being easy to deploy in finite element codes. HSC-NNs are particularly adept at fitting aggregations of plane stress and out-of-plane data to build yield surface models accounting for 3D-stress states. We use them here to bring new insights into a recent cup-drawing experiment with aluminum alloy AA6016-T4. Finite element simulations with both plane stress and 3D models show promising results. In particular, the overall simulation run times of the HSC-NNs employed here are found to be comparable with those of conventional yield functions.},

  abstract     = {A general bipenalty formulation with a parameter selection criterion is proposed for explicit contact-impact finite element analysis. In order to model the contact phenomenon using penalties, it is necessary to introduce an artificial contact stiffness that can increase the maximum natural frequency of the system. When a large stiffness penalty parameter is used, the stability condition forces to reduce the time step size, increasing at the same time the computational demands. A solution to avoid the small time step size requirement and possible instabilities is to include a mass penalty in addition to the stiffness penalty term, using a technique known as the bipenalty method. However, this method presents some other challenges, mainly related to the parameter selection criterion and its final accuracy. In this work, two important improvements for the bipenalty method are presented. (i) An element-type and dimension-independent criterion for the selection of penalty mass and stiffness parameters. (ii) A modified predictor-corrector scheme, specifically designed for the bipenalty method, that improves the accuracy of contact-impact problems. Different 1D, 2D, and 3D contact-impact examples are used to illustrate the stability, applicability to general contact cases, and reduction of the zigzag effect and spurious oscillations exhibited by the proposed methods.},

At the same time, the most effective locations of the loads and supports are often difficult to find manually. This substantially limits topology optimization's effectiveness for many mechanism design problems. We remove this limitation by developing a method which automatically determines optimal positioning of a prescribed input displacement and a set of supports simultaneously with an optimal material layout. Using nonlinear elastic physics, we synthesize a variety of compliant mechanisms with large output displacements, snap-through responses, and prescribed output paths, producing designs with significantly improved performance in every case tested. Compared to optimal designs generated using manually designed boundary conditions used in previous studies, the mechanisms presented in this paper see performance increases ranging from 47% to 380%. The results show that nonlinear mechanism responses may be particularly sensitive to boundary condition locations and that effective placements can be difficult to find without an automated method.},

  abstract     = {In the nonlinear large deformation regime, the beam theory is usually based on the Timoshenko assumption which considers shear deformations. The formulation of a 3D Euler–Bernoulli beam has been significantly delayed and only recently it did attract the attention of few researchers. The main reason lies in the challenging complexities met once an attempt to develop such a theory is undertaken. The main obstacle in defining a three-dimensional Euler–Bernoulli beam theory lies in the fact that there is no natural way of defining a base system at the deformed configuration. In this article, we provide a novel methodology to do so leading to the development of a spatial rod formulation which incorporates the Euler–Bernoulli assumption. The first approach makes use of Gram–Schmidt orthogonalisation process coupled to a one-parametric rotation. The latter completes the description of the torsional cross sectional rotation and overcomes the nonuniqueness of the Gram–Schmidt procedure. In a second approach, the rotation tensor is defined based on first and second derivatives of the displacement vector of the centre line. It is followed by one parametric rotation. The proposed formulation is extended to the dynamical case and a stable, energy and momentum conserving time-stepping algorithm is presented as well. Specifically, the proof of conservation of angular momentum of the time stepping algorithm is highly demanding and is given here in full.},

Adaptive strategies are an important tool for problems that demand highly refined meshes in localized regions, such as in phase-field problems. In the proposed strategy, the problem is initially discretized with a coarse FEM mesh, that is automatically replaced and refined by an SPIM discretization when and where fracture occurs. Five different benchmark tests are presented to illustrate the robustness of the proposed strategy. Brittle and quasi-brittle problems are simulated and evaluated in terms of phase-field contour plots and load-displacement paths, showing good agreement with literature results and with results obtained with previously refined FEM models. The numerical simulations consider different criteria for the identification of the regions where the discretization replacement and refinement must occur, different sizes of the substitution regions, and different SPIM strategies. The proposed strategy relies on three properties of the meshfree strategy: (i) the reduced connectivity that ease the adaptive refinement, (ii) the presence of the Kronecker-delta property, that makes the coupling with the FEM mesh straightforward, and (iii) the presence of nonpolynomial approximation functions, that provide a better approximation of the phase-field profile. As illustrated by the simulations, this new strategy results in computational times that are comparable with the ones of a previously refined FEM mesh, without requiring an a priori knowledge of the replacement regions.},

We use piecewise clothoid curves to approximate the initial curvature of the undeformed beam, facilitating a seamless integration into the Cosserat rod model. A straightforward solution of the governing equations is implemented using shooting method, verifying applicability across a range of problems. Interestingly, the parameters that define the clothoid segments also appear in the governing equations of the beam. This bridges the gap between the geometric design of the beams and their static simulations. In this way, we present the proposed formulation as an alternative to conventional IGA. The notable features of the method are easy implementation, good accuracy, and convergence. Moreover, the method predicts bending stress in the beam, capturing the nonlinearity of the deformation.},

  abstract     = {A ductile damage theory is presented by coupling the covariant formulation of finite deformation plasticity with the phase field modeling of fracture, including kinematic hardening for the ductile response of the materials. A phase field coupled nonlinear kinematic hardening equation is proposed in the reference configuration having equivalent representation through the Lie derivative of the kinematic hardening tensor by push-forward operation in the spatial configuration, thus ensuring the satisfaction of frame invariance. To capture the correct physical response of the material by the phase field evolution equation, the fracture driving function, that is, the difference between the sum of elastic and plastic energies and threshold energy, after the damage initiation is modified by an energy release controlling function, which is an empirical relation of equivalent plastic strain. In defining the energy release controlling function, well-defined points with physical significance in the experimental load versus displacement curve are used. To simulate the response of the material in relatively large time steps, a modified staggered scheme is presented, evaluating the fracture driving and energy release controlling functions from the previous converged step and using the updated phase field variable in the weak form of the momentum balance equation. To quantify different material parameters from available experimental results in the literature, the developed phase field coupled elasto-plastic model uses a neural network optimization procedure consisting of neural network training together with optimization in MATLAB and finite element model evaluation in Abaqus user element subroutine UEL. Model capabilities are demonstrated by simulating the crack propagation in complex 3D geometries such as the second and third Sandia Fracture Challenges.},

  abstract     = {Accurate modeling of fracture nucleation and propagation in brittle and ductile materials subjected to dynamic loading is important in predicting material damage and failure under extreme conditions. Phase-field fracture models have garnered a lot of attention in recent years due to their success in representing damage and fracture processes in a wide class of materials and under a variety of loading conditions. Second-order phase-field fracture models are by far the most popular among researchers (and increasingly, among practitioners), but fourth-order models have started to gain broader acceptance since their more recent introduction. The exact solution corresponding to these high-order phase-field fracture models has higher regularity. Thus, numerical solutions of the model equations can achieve improved accuracy and higher spatial convergence rates. In this work, we develop a virtual element framework for the high-order phase-field model of dynamic fracture. The virtual element method (VEM) can be regarded as a generalization of the classical finite element method. In addition to many other desirable characteristics, the VEM allows computing on polytopal meshes. Here, we use -conforming virtual elements and the generalized- time integration method for the momentum balance equation, and adopt -conforming virtual elements for the high-order phase-field equation. We verify our virtual element framework using classical quasi-static benchmark problems and demonstrate its capabilities with the aid of numerical simulations of dynamic fracture in brittle materials.},

  abstract     = {The structural properties of mechanical metamaterials are typically studied with two-scale methods based on computational homogenization. Because such materials have a complex microstructure, enriched schemes such as second-order computational homogenization are required to fully capture their nonlinear behavior, which arises from nonlocal interactions due to the buckling or patterning of the microstructure. In the two-scale formulation, the effective behavior of the microstructure is captured with a representative volume element (RVE), and a homogenized effective continuum is considered on the macroscale. Although an effective continuum formulation is introduced, solving such two-scale models concurrently is still computationally demanding due to the many repeated solutions for each RVE at the microscale level. In this work, we propose a reduced-order model for the microscopic problem arising in second-order computational homogenization, using proper orthogonal decomposition and a novel hyperreduction method that is specifically tailored for this problem and inspired by the empirical cubature method. Two numerical examples are considered, in which the performance of the reduced-order model is carefully assessed by comparing its solutions with direct numerical simulations (entirely resolving the underlying microstructure) and the full second-order computational homogenization model. The reduced-order model is able to approximate the result of the full computational homogenization well, provided that the training data is representative for the problem at hand. Any remaining errors, when compared with the direct numerical simulation, can be attributed to the inherent approximation errors in the computational homogenization scheme. Regarding run times for one thread, speed-ups on the order of 100 are achieved with the reduced-order model as compared to direct numerical simulations.},

This method addresses the complexities introduced by constraints, but the additional multiplier introduces a new degree of freedom and hence results in a system with mixed-type partial differential equations. To address this issue, we further propose a constraint realization method based on perturbation theory for infinite-dimensional mechanical systems within the framework of Hamel's formalism. This method circumvents the use of additional Lagrange multiplier, significantly reducing the computational complexity of modeling problems. Building on this, we construct a perturbed Hamel field integrator optimized for parallel computing and incorporate artificial viscosity to accelerate constraint convergence. While applicable to three dimensions, our method is demonstrated in a simplified context using planar Euler–Bernoulli beam examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the unified mathematical framework.},

However, the traditional reliability methods encounter inaccurate issue for evaluating the failure probability of stress-constrained structure. In this work, the failure mechanism of the stress-constrained RBTO problem is analyzed for continuum structure, which reveals that the correlation between different stress constraints and utilization of aggregation function significantly impacts the accuracy. Then, a novel stress-constrained system RBTO framework is suggested to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy for system reliability analysis. Furthermore, an accurate and efficient semi-analytical method is suggested to approximate the performance functions through first-order Taylor series expansion, in which the intricate implicit expressions are substituted by the straightforward analytic expressions. In addition, the fidelity transformation method is employed for converting the semi-analytical RBTO method to classical RBTO method. To demonstrate the practicability of the proposed framework, three benchmark cases, including 2D and 3D problems, are tested. The results reveal that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy and efficiency.},

The strain based integral equation is obtained from the combination of the displacement based equations for different domains, each one having its own reference elasticity tensor. In the latter, the strain values inside every phases are connected to material mismatch parameters on the phase boundary.

As the dynamic instability is one of the serious problems, the suppression is desired from an engineering point of view. To systematically reduce this dynamic instability, the present study develops a new topology optimization scheme for the reinforcement design.

  abstract     = {This article showcases the development of a dynamic Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation to account for inelastic material models within a finite element framework. Such a formulation is commonly utilized in research domains like fluid mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, quasi static remeshing techniques, and quasi static load movement. The work at hand describes the application of the ALE formulation to efficiently analyse structures subjected to moving loads in the field of transient inelastic solid mechanics. In particular, structures such as pavements, gantry crane girders etc., which are subjected to moving loads, can be numerically simulated, and their transient response in the relevant region around the load can be obtained without relying on moving loads. The focus of this article is to facilitate the treatment of history variables stemming from inelastic material models. Of particular interest is the advection procedure required to transport the history variables through the mesh, as the material appears to flow through it. The mathematical framework necessary to treat this advection process is described in detail, considering a nonlinear viscoelastic material model on a neo- Hookean base at finite deformations. Then, four methods for numerically achieving the advection are implemented within a transient finite element ALE formulation. These methods are compared against each other, and additionally with the conventional Lagrangian method for validation. The results demonstrate satisfactory agreement with conventional simulation methods, while offering a significant improvement in terms of computation speed. With the work at hand, the dynamic response of inelastic materials subjected to moving loads can be numerically simulated in a computationally efficient manner.},
