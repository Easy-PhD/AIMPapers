  abstract     = {As modelling of nonlinear oscillator systems plays an important part in science and engineering fields, a double loop Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) with adaptive radius and lattices is proposed for handling this issue. In this design, a large enough lattice arranged to cover all of the trajectories is taken as the mapping center of the RBFNN at the initial condition. The number of lattices will be dynamically adjusted, and those lattices far from the trajectories will be removed. Applying Taylor expansion in local space, the activated radius factor can be separated from the Gaussian function. In order to guarantee that the modelling scheme has the characteristic of fast convergence, the error power function is utilized to minimize the gain parameter of the error differential equation. In the double loop structure, the updated equation of weights and activated radius can be determined by the Lyapunov function, which can guarantee that the weights and the activated radius will converge to the neighborhood of their true value and the tracking error of state trajectories will converge to the neighborhood of zero. In order to show the effectiveness and superiority of the double loop RBFNN proposed in this paper, Helmholtz–Duffing and Vanderpol–Duffing are used as the testing objects of the nonlinear oscillator system while comparing with Deterministic Learning.},

  abstract     = {Personalized federated learning represents a pivotal strategy for addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity in federated learning. Clients optimize their models by leveraging information from other clients through a global model. However, data heterogeneity constrains the generalization capacity of the global model, thereby degrading the feature representation capability of local client models, especially in clients with limited data. In response to this challenge, we propose the Federal Merging Subgroup Information (FedMSI) method to augment personalized information in personalized federated learning. On the server side, FedMSI employs model clustering to identify subgroups of clients with similar personalized data distributions. It then aggregates cluster center models within each subgroup and transmits them to clients for use in the subsequent round of assisted training. On the client side, FedMSI introduces a local optimization objective that incorporates the cluster center model, enabling the extraction of informative knowledge to enhance local training. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMSI across different datasets, data heterogeneity levels, and data sizes. Ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of the design of the local optimization objective. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, FedMSI achieves a 13.16% improvement in scalability performance accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Falls among the elderly remain a critical public health concern, often leading to severe injuries or fatalities. In response, we propose SmartFallNet, an advanced deep learning framework designed for accurate and real-time fall detection in elderly care settings. The architecture leverages a dual-stream design that independently processes multimodal data from both RGB and depth frames using Vision Transformers (ViTs) for spatial feature encoding and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for temporal sequence modeling. To enhance the model's sensitivity to fall-relevant patterns, we introduce a novel Dynamic Kernel Attention Mechanism (DKAM) that selectively emphasizes critical temporal frames. Features from both modalities are fused via a Power-Weighted Aggregation strategy, resulting in a rich and context-aware representation of human motion. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets—UR Fall Detection (URFD) and the Falling Detection Dataset (FDD)—SmartFallNet achieved state-of-the-art performance with 99.1% accuracy on URFD and 98.5% on FDD, while maintaining a low inference latency of 0.2 s per sample, supporting near real-time application. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies, demonstrate the model's robustness, efficiency, and superiority over existing methods. These results underscore the potential of SmartFallNet for deployment in real-world healthcare and ambient-assisted living environments.},

However, most of the knowledge-graph-based systems focus only on ratings or reviews to build relationships. This prevents a comprehensive understanding of structural and positional information within graph data as well as user preferences that can change in time, as well. In order to address these issues, this paper aims to propose an advanced end-to-end Graph Neural Network architecture that significantly enhances recommendation system capabilities through the integration of state-of-the-art embedding techniques, knowledge graph frameworks, and transfer learning strategies. Incorporating positional encoding and topological feature extraction, the proposed model captures intricate user–item relationships and offers a robust representation that surpasses current approaches. A pretrained encoder facilitates knowledge transfer, effectively bridging domain gaps and amplifying prediction accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations against established baseline models reveal that our architecture has demonstrated enhanced accuracy, precision, and overall robustness. These results highlight the efficacy of combining knowledge graphs, sophisticated embedding strategies, and cross-domain transfer learning in building next-generation recommender systems, providing valuable insights for future advancements in the field.},

The customer review information is of huge interest to companies as well as customers. The information from customer feedback is not only valuable for consumers but also provides valuable feedback to companies. However, since customer reviews are usually presented as unstructured free text, extracting meaningful ratings from user opinions can be quite challenging. To overcome this issue, an effectual system is modeled for sentiment classification and review rating prediction utilizing reviews named fuzzy-based hierarchical attention gated recurrent network (Fuzzy-HAGRN). At first, the input reviews are fed to Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) tokenization, and after that, feature extraction is executed for the extraction of several essential features. Then, Fuzzy-HAGRN is utilized for sentiment classification and review rate prediction. Here, the Fuzzy-HAGRN method is developed by integrating the fuzzy concept, hierarchical attention network (HAN) as well as gated recurrent network (GRU). Finally, rating prediction is performed using the same Fuzzy-HAGRN. Fuzzy-HAGRN has obtained a precision of 92.20%, recall of 91.80%, and F 1-score of 91.50%.},

  abstract     = {An important advancement in medical diagnostics is the detection of eye diseases through image analysis, which is facilitated by the development of robust machine-learning approaches. This research provided an extensive methodology for eye disease classification, introducing the Multi-Layer DenseNet-77 architecture for analyzing the images. The process starts with the aggregation of different datasets for various eye conditions, which include healthy eyes, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. The data undergoes pre-processing, including grayscale conversion, resizing, and standardization, to improve image quality and ensure uniformity. Feature extraction is performed to capture important characteristics of the images. First-order statistics, such as entropy, mean, intensity, and energy, are used for feature extraction. These features serve as inputs to the Multilayer DenseNet-77 model. To enhance the classification accuracy, the Multilayer DenseNet-77 model incorporates advanced regularization techniques and optimized training strategies. The architecture of the model facilitates efficient feature reuse through the dense connections, which tackle the challenges associated with gradient flow and overfitting. Through the pooling layers and multiple convolutional layers, the retinal images are processed, and the DenseNet-77 approach classifies the images into predefined categories that significantly improve the early diagnosis and detection of eye diseases. This method not only contributes to enhancing the outcomes of the patients but also sets the stage for using deep learning in the analysis of medical images, highlighting its potential in transforming healthcare interventions. The experimental result validates that the proposed Multilayer DenseNet-77 model attained an accuracy of 99.21%, precision of 98.65%, recall of 98.56%, F1-score of 97.42%, specificity of 98.61%, and dice coefficient of 0.974.

The technique employs two advanced deep learning architectures, namely U-Net and pretrained SAM, for tumor segmentation. The U-Net model is specifically designed for medical image segmentation and leverages its deep convolutional neural network framework to extract meaningful features from input images. On the other hand, the pretrained SAM architecture incorporates a mechanism to capture spatial dependencies and generate segmentation results. Evaluation is conducted on a diverse dataset containing annotated tumor regions in BUS and mammographic images, covering both benign and malignant tumors. This dataset enables a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm's performance across different tumor types. Results demonstrate that the U-Net model outperforms the pretrained SAM architecture in accurately identifying and segmenting tumor regions in both BUS and mammographic images. The U-Net exhibits superior performance in challenging cases involving irregular shapes, indistinct boundaries, and high tumor heterogeneity. In contrast, the pretrained SAM architecture exhibits limitations in accurately identifying tumor areas, particularly for malignant tumors and objects with weak boundaries or complex shapes. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate deep learning architectures tailored for medical image segmentation. The U-Net model showcases its potential as a robust and accurate tool for tumor detection, while the pretrained SAM architecture suggests the need for further improvements to enhance segmentation performance.},

Recent progress in advanced assistive technologies (AATs) has emerged as an essential tool to mitigate the adverse impact of blindness and enhance the quality of life of visually impaired persons (VIPs). Like generic object identification, the VIPs face difficulties in identifying their garments. Such a limitation severely impacts their identity as they cannot select dresses according to their preferences for different contexts and occasions. To this end, in this paper, we present a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation of a mobile application for real-time fabric pattern classification to assist VIPs in selecting the cloth with fabric patterns of their choice. The proposed framework uses a robust and compute-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) named FabricNet to classify four types of fabric patterns (lattice, printed, solid, and stripe). The designed FabricNet model uses efficient feature enhancement (EFE), efficient feature refinement (EFR), and enhanced feature fusion (EFF) blocks to extract discriminative texture features from the fabric pattern images. We evaluated the performance of the proposed FabricNet on a recent open-source fabric image dataset. Compared to the existing baseline, the FabricNet model, with 1.64 M parameters, 6.25 MB memory storage size, and 4.09 GFLOPs, attained state-of-the-art classification accuracy with reduced model storage size and competitive computation time. Finally, we optimized the trained model and integrated it with a mobile application developed using the Android Studio software development kit (SDK) for real-time classification of fabric images. The designed mobile application on an Android mobile phone uses its back camera to capture garment images and provides predicted fabric type using audio feedback. Thus, it can assist VIPs in selecting clothing with fabric patterns of their choice in real time.},

  abstract     = {De-duplication is critically important for cloud computing since it permits the detection of repeated data within the cloud system under fewer resources and expenses. De-duplication removes unnecessary data from the cloud centers, which helps to identify the appropriate owner of cloud material. Each piece of data saved in the cloud is owned by a large number of cloud users, even though it contains just a single copy of the data. The dynamic nature of the cloud resources is not handled by the prior deduplication models and the existing models require more computing power for accurately determining the presence of duplicate files in the cloud system. In addition, the prior models split the files into chunks for determining the similar files in the cloud system which affects the quality of the data. To conquer these difficulties, an adaptive deep learning-based data deduplication model is developed using an optimization algorithm. The main innovation of the proposed research is to rapidly detect duplicate records in the cloud data and also provide high-level security while maintaining the operational efficiency of the cloud system. The proposed model acts as an efficient attack resistance system and it also ensures the data availability of the cloud system more rapidly. This data deduplication implies in detecting and examining the patterns inside records of information to precisely notice and eliminate repeated identical information. Hence, the data connected to the input pattern is given to the Serial Cascaded Autoencoder with Gated Recurrent Unit (SCA-GRU) for the deduplication process. After deduplication, the unnecessary data are removed for the precise consumption of resources to store exclusive data. To maintain the security of data, the optimal key-based data sanitization process is performed, in which the key is optimally generated with the aid of a Mutated Fitness-Based Krill Herd Optimization Algorithm (MF-KHO). This encoded data is then safely kept in the cloud, which protects the data from illegal access and possible defense breaches. The outcome of the suggested approach is validated with the previous data deduplication system to show the efficiency of the developed model. The experimental results showed that the recommended deduplication approach reaches an accuracy of 95.37%. Through efficient data deduplication, the storage requirement of the data is greatly reduced, which facilitates cost reduction and resource optimization within the cloud system and also the storage capacity utilization of the cloud system is greatly improved.},

In SA, particularly smart irrigation systems, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has improved automation and efficiency. The SA idea is developed by integrating Information Technology (IT) and data processing techniques with quantitative decision-making and intelligent control measures to advance production. Heterogeneous sensors are implemented in SA communication for enhanced security. However, the deployment of heterogeneous IoT sensors in large-scale networks increases the vulnerability to cyber intrusions, which can severely disrupt irrigation control and crop health. For secure SA farming, this paper proposes a SpinalFuzzyGoogLeNet (SpinalFGNet) module for intrusion detection in smart irrigation. Initially, the IoT system is simulated; the process of intrusion detection is performed by acquiring input data from specific datasets. Here, data pre-processing is done with Quantile Normalization. Then, feature fusion is achieved by Deep Kronecker Network with Gower distance. Afterward, data augmentation is performed by deploying oversampling based on Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. At last, intrusion detection is performed using the proposed SpinalFGNet, which is developed by the integration of SpinalNet and GoogLeNet with fuzzy concept. The evaluation of SpinalFGNet is conducted and accomplishments in terms of metrics gained accuracy at 92%, precision as 93%, recall as 95%, and F1-score as 94%.},

By retrieving the local characteristics of the music signal and extrapolating its holistic characteristics, the nonlinearity of the signal rendered by diverse musical styles also has a distinguishable difference. It is observed from the experiments that the maximum Lyapunov exponent of music characterized as “happy” and “relaxing” reaches 0.23, while the range of fluctuations in the correlation dimensions spans from 3.2 to 5.7. Furthermore, a discrepancy of 4.1 is noted in the correlation dimensions of music classified as “loud” and “uplifting,” indicative of the intricate nature of music signals' internal structures and the attenuation of chaotic characteristics. The M5 model exhibits an accuracy of 91.26% for classical music, representing a 2.9% enhancement over conventional methodologies. According to the aforementioned chaotic analysis, the originally designed nonlinearity extracting pattern for diverse music signals in the musical recognizing system demonstrates excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Clinicians can determine cardiac symptoms with the aid of heart rate detection and continuous surveillance. One of the necessary indicators utilized to assess the physiological wellness of the human body is heartbeat rate. Conventional heartbeat rate monitoring systems necessitate skin contact; nevertheless, Remote Photoplethysmography (RPPG) allows for contactless heartbeat rate measurement by using a video camera that records minute changes in skin tone. The medical field has increased interest in the surveillance of physiological signals due to technological developments in future healthcare. In this paper, a novel heartbeat rate monitoring system is developed to significantly track heart functioning. Initially, the facial videos are gathered from the online resources, and they are given to the face detection phase for generating detected face images with the help of Vision Transformer-based You Only Look Once v5 (ViT-Yolov5). Further, the detected face images are given to the feature extraction process. Here, the 3D Residual Attention Network (3D-RAN) is used to retrieve the features to generate the feature set 1. Similarly, Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) features and Deep Belief Network (DBN)-based features are retrieved from the input video, which is considered as feature set 2. Further, the heartbeat monitoring is done using the Weighted feature fusion-based Adaptive Long Short-Term Memory with Attention Mechanism (WALSTM-AM), and the weighted feature fusion is carried out on the feature sets 1 and 2, in which the weight and parameters are optimized using Enhanced Shell Game Optimization (ESGO). The numerical results showed that the developed model attained a Normalized Mean Square Error Value (NMSE) of 0.001868 that indicates better and more reliable validation of heartbeat rate, leading to higher representation of heart's activity. Thus, the proposed heartbeat monitoring mechanism attains better outcomes than the conventional methods to prove its optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), medical images play a vital role in healthcare systems by enabling accurate diagnosis, effective treatment planning, and continuous monitoring of various diseases. Deep learning models have strong potential to facilitate early detection by recognizing patterns in medical images. Although deep learning systems are more advanced, ambiguity continues to act as a major obstacle to progress. Ambiguity typically arises in areas such as accuracy, interpretability, and generalization. The challenge lies in balancing high performance with transparent and understandable decision-making processes. This uncertainty can hinder trust computation and practical deployment, especially in critical applications. Moreover, these models face challenges with data handling and often lack robustness, which affects their reliability. To address the above-mentioned issues, a novel multi-disease detection framework is proposed using a deep learning approach. The input medical images are gathered from online datasets using the IoMT-enabled devices. To detect different kinds of diseases, an adaptive vision transformer-based multi-scale residual dense network (AViT-MRDNet) is developed. This model processes the input images to classify four types of diseases including skin lesions, brain tumors, lung tumors, and breast cancer. Here, the hybrid bonobo with rat swarm optimizer (HB-RSO) is developed to optimize the parameters. Finally, the proposed framework produces the disease detection results. The overall performance of the implemented framework is verified by using various validation metrics such as precision, accuracy, false discovery rate, sensitivity, F 1-score, false positive rate, specificity, Mathew correlation coefficient, false negative rate, and negative predictive value to showcase the effectiveness in detecting the multi-disease. It attains an accuracy of 96.022, sensitivity of 95.164, specificity of 96.880, and precision of 96.825. Thus, these findings prove that the introduced framework has enhanced the system performance. The hybrid optimization algorithm in the proposed approach offers a robust solution for doctors and healthcare professionals to predict multiple diseases in patients. Therefore, it shows that the developed model is superior and delivers more reliable performance to other frameworks. The result confirmed that the proposed model can accurately and precisely detect the multi-disease and help the patients for early diagnosis. It leverages the strength of the vision transformer and the residual densenet to enhance the system performance.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. While diabetic retinopathy can occur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it is indeed more commonly associated with type 2 diabetes due to its higher prevalence and longer duration in many cases. Type 2 diabetes often develops gradually over time, allowing for prolonged exposure to elevated blood sugar levels. This prolonged exposure increases the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy and other diabetes-related complications. The aim of this paper is to analyze the various deep learning models for effective prediction of diabetic retinopathy in patients suffering from Type 2 Diabetes. Furthermore, standard datasets consisting of 38,788 training and 55,504 test images for diabetic retinopathy and blindness are obtained. On the other hand, deep learning models such as ResNet101V2, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNetB7, and Xception CNNs are applied to the dataset and trained as well. Moreover, the performance of all the models is assessed on the basis of certain quality measures, such as accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, RMSE values, and loss. On the other hand, results indicate the potential of deep learning models in accurately predicting diabetic retinopathy, thereby aiding in early diagnosis and intervention to prevent vision loss in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Human prakriti—a core Ayurvedic construct—encompasses constitution-based guidance in the Vatt, Pitt, and Kaph types. While clinically helpful, prakriti assessment is highly reliant on subjectivity, limiting reproducibility and cross-cultural generality. Here, well-validated psychometric assessments are integrated with interpretable machine learning to yield objective, scalable classification. Emotional quotient (EQ), risk-taking, personality, and Raven's progressive matrices (RPM IQ) tests were given to Indian ( N = 202; 76% male) and U.S. ( N = 204; 53% male) samples. Seven models were tested, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and multi-layer perceptron, and hand-tuned stacked ensemble (MR-CAT). Cross-cultural validation—training Indian data and validation on U.S. data—produced MR-CAT to achieve accuracies of 0.97 (India) and 0.99 (U.S.) with high precision, recall, and F1. SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) revealed differential psychometric patterns: for example, Vatt with high resilience and self-motivation and low collaborative leadership, Pitt with high calm and ethical courage, and Kaph with high emotional stability but low leadership initiative. These patterns conform to, yet go beyond, traditional dosha portraits. The findings demonstrate a reproducible, cross-culturally stable interface between Ayurvedic theory and computational intelligence, opening the door to scalable personalized preventive care and subsequent mind–body research.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which requires accurate and reliable diagnostic methods. This paper introduces an effective anomaly detection framework, t-SNE-LOF, which leverages the complementary strengths of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) detection. t-SNE captures complex, nonlinear relationships within high-dimensional data by reducing it to a lower-dimensional manifold while preserving local and global structures, whereas LOF identifies anomalies based on density variations, making it well-suited for detecting outliers in heterogeneous datasets. By combining these techniques, t-SNE-LOF effectively isolates cardiovascular anomalies with enhanced precision, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 99.28% and 98.75% on two publicly available datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods. Comparative evaluation against a broad range of classical semi-supervised methods (iForest, LOF, EE), three embedding-based variants, seven traditional supervised classifiers, and six deep learning models confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis interprets the model's predictions, providing insights into feature contributions and enhancing the explainability of the t-SNE-LOF framework for cardiovascular anomaly detection. The proposed method is semi-supervised and requires only healthy data during training, making it highly suitable for real-world clinical settings where labeled abnormal cases are limited. Future work will explore perplexity-free parametric t-SNE to improve scalability and eliminate manual tuning, along with automated hyperparameter optimization and extension to multi-modal cardiovascular data. This approach offers satisfactory performance and may support integration into Clinical Decision Support Systems to aid early cardiovascular diagnosis and prevention.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a vital NLP task that identifies sentiment towards specific entities or aspect terms within a text. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in semantic comprehension and logical inference. However, LLM hallucinations pose challenges in accurately determining sentiment polarity for aspect terms, leading to performance issues. Moreover, current ABSA methods often fail to fully leverage the vast prior knowledge embedded within LLMs, resulting in suboptimal classification outcomes for specific aspects. Inspired by these challenges, we propose the BYD-OBS-ABSA framework—‘Beyond Simple Observations, Embracing Comprehensive Contextual Insights’ for ABSA tasks. This framework leverages unique in-context constraints, backgrounds, and analogical reasoning to address LLM hallucinations and uses self-adaptive bootstrap instructions optimization to enhance LLM predictions. BYD-OBS-ABSA integrates various in-context augmentation strategies, including emotion-oriented backgrounds, constraints, and analogical reasoning. BYD-OBS-ABSA further improves initial LLM instructions through adaptive iterative optimization using a random search bootstrap algorithm, maximizing the benefits of LLM prompting. Extensive zero/few-shot experiments with GPT-3.5-turbo across six public datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework, even surpassing human judgment in certain scenarios.},

In this context, this paper proposes a right decoupled composite manifold for visual-inertial sliding-window iterative optimization compared with other manifolds including chained translation and rotation , special Euclidean group , and extended pose concerning the orientation, position, and velocity estimation. Furthermore, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) dynamics is propagated through extended pose with half rotation to maintain the accuracy of IMU preintegration. Moreover, to enhance robustness, a robustified Cauchy loss function is employed. The proposed method is evaluated with simulation and experiments on static and more challenging dynamic environments, considering its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Additionally, all necessary Jacobians for visual reprojection residuals and IMU preintegration residuals are provided in analytical form with numerical verification.},

  abstract     = {Despite high predictive performance, machine learning models can be unfair towards specific demographic subgroups characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This paper presents a novel approach using Computational Profile Likelihood (CPL) to assess potential bias in neural network decisions with respect to sensitive attributes. CPL estimates the conditional probability of a network's internal neuron excitation levels during predictions. To assess the impact of sensitive attributes on predictions, the CPL distribution of individuals sharing a particular value of a sensitive attribute and a specific outcome (e.g., “women” and “high income”) is compared to a subgroup sharing another value of the sensitive attribute but with the same outcome (e.g., “men” and “high income”). The resulting disparities between distributions can be used to quantify the bias with respect to the sensitive attribute and the outcome class. We also assess the efficacy of bias reduction techniques through their influence on the resulting disparities. Experimental results on three widely used datasets indicate that the CPL of the trained models can be used to characterize significant differences between multiple protected groups, highlighting that these models display quantifiable biases. Furthermore, after applying bias mitigation methods, the gaps in CPL distributions are reduced, indicating a more similar internal representation for profiles of different protected groups.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis using MRI scans must be very accurate since the subtle differences throughout the course of the disease are difficult to identify. Traditional approaches are not effective, and new computational techniques are required that can provide fast and accurate diagnosis. In this paper, a novel deep learning methodology that greatly enhances the sensitivity and specificity of AD stage identification by analyzing in-depth MRI scans is proposed. The model applies a novel Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which has been deeply trained on the “Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset” made available by Kaggle, to integrate various layers of depth and complexity to identify and scan in-depth features on MRI images. Major enhancements include the use of learning rate schedulers and dropout regularization to fine-tune training as well as avoid overfitting, with a diagnosis accuracy of 94.2%. This level of accuracy not only makes diagnostic processes easier but also allows for early detection of Alzheimer's phases, which is crucial for timely interventions and effective management of the condition. The model is rigorously trained on a large set of augmented data with varying levels of AD to guarantee robustness and generalizability in various demographic and clinical settings. Batch normalization and higher-order activation functions allow faster and stable convergence of training, and thus the model is more efficient and scalable. Application of this model to the clinic has the potential to sharply reduce time to diagnosis, lessen dependence on radiological expertise, and offer a high-accuracy, scalable imaging device enabling early and accurate treatment in Alzheimer's care. This innovation represents a significant next phase in medical imaging with artificial intelligence, and it offers a highly effective tool for fine detection and staging of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract     = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine condition in women of reproductive age that is linked to a number of issues with metabolism and reproductive health. For PCOS to be effectively treated and managed, a precise and early diagnosis is essential. In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated promising results in the diagnosis of PCOS by extracting pertinent features from clinical and laboratory data. Motivated by the diagnostic complexity and subjectivity in current PCOS identification techniques, this study addresses the gap in systematic evaluations of feature selection and classifier performance. The key objective is to develop an effective ML-based diagnostic framework by identifying the most informative features, selecting optimal classifiers, and analyzing the impact of data balancing and validation strategies. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of three feature selection methods, namely chi-square test, backward elimination, and mutual information gain, for identifying the most significant features from a dataset of 541 patients with and without PCOS. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dataset resampling on classification performance, evaluate the classification performance of individual features, compare the performance of various classifiers, and assess the classification performance for different values of k in k-fold cross-validation. As evidenced by our findings, the backward feature elimination method performs better than the other two methods in terms of identifying pertinent features for PCOS diagnosis, obtaining a Random Forest (RF) classifier accuracy of 96.55%. The most important features identified were anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level, regularity or irregularity in cycle, follicle no. in left and right ovaries, and endometrium dimension. Our results illustrate the significance of taking into account various feature selection methods to uncover the most relevant features and demonstrate the potential of ML and feature selection techniques in effectively detecting PCOS. Additionally, we briefly explore the potential integration of real-time data from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices into the PCOS diagnosis framework to enhance its real-world applicability.},

  abstract     = {A large amount of data have been published online in textual format for the last decade because of the advancement of information and communication technologies. This is an open challenge to organize and classify large amounts of textual data automatically, especially for a language that has limited resources available online. In this study, two types of approaches are adopted for experiments. First one is a traditional strategy that uses six (06) classical state-of-the-art classification models (1. decision tree (DT), 2. logistic regression (LR), 3. support vector machine (SVM), 4. k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), 5. Naive Bayes (NB), and 6. random forest (RF)) along with two (02) ensemble methods (1. Adaboost and 2. gradient boosting (GB)) and second modeling technique is our proposed voting based ensembling scheme. Models are trained on a 75-25 split where 75% of data is used for training and 25% for testing. The evaluation of the classification models is carried out based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indexes. The experimental outcomes witnessed that for the traditional approach, gradient boosting outperformed for the limited resource language with 98.08% F1-score, while SVM performed better (97.34% F1-score) for the resource-rich language.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning techniques are increasingly used for high-stakes decision-making, such as college admissions, loan attribution, or recidivism prediction. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the models learnt can be audited or understood by human users, do not create or reproduce discrimination or bias and do not leak sensitive information regarding their training data. Indeed, interpretability, fairness, and privacy are key requirements for the development of responsible machine learning, and all three have been studied extensively during the last decade. However, they were mainly considered in isolation, while in practice they interplay with each other, either positively or negatively. In this survey paper, we review the literature on the interactions between these three desiderata. More precisely, for each pairwise interaction, we summarize the identified synergies and tensions. These findings highlight several fundamental theoretical and empirical conflicts, while also demonstrating that jointly considering these different requirements is challenging when one aims at preserving a high level of utility. To solve this issue, we also discuss possible conciliation mechanisms, showing that a careful design can enable to successfully handle these different concerns in practice.},

  abstract     = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a growing area of research in human-computer interaction (HCI), where its potential ranges from medicine to entertainment. It intends to manage various assistive technologies through the utilization of brain signals. This technology acquires and interprets brain signals before sending them to a connected device, which generates controls based on the obtained signals. Emotion-based mental state categorization employing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an emerging method of BCI application. However, EEG signals comprise artifacts and redundant or noisy information from the subject, equipment, and external environment. Also, the EEG signals have a low spatial resolution (physical location of the activity within the brain) but a high temporal resolution (millisecond level). Therefore, artifact removal, feature extraction, and classification of EEG signals are challenging. This work proposed a novel approach called Extended Independent Component Analysis (E-ICA) for artifact removal from EEG signals. A Multi-class Common Spatial Pattern (M-CSP) is proposed for feature extraction. A Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is proposed to improve the classification of EEG signals and fine-tune its parameters. This study leverages the Database for Emotion Analysis using the Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset to validate the model's performance. This dataset includes EEG recordings annotated with emotional attributes such as valence, arousal, dominance, and liking. After conducting several experiments, the proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 94.61% and outperforms state-of-the-art works. The proposed approach can be successfully integrated into BCI systems for real-time emotion identification in healthcare and user engagement detection in gaming environments.},

  abstract     = {In general, the object detection mechanism recognizes target objects in the image frames, and the tracking mechanism helps to capture the movement of target objects in diverse frames. Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled us to build computers, robots, and automated tools that are mostly designed for performing tasks and generating decisions without human assistance. The drones called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are employed for many kinds of objectives, including parcel shipping, rescue operations, recognizing objects, and monitoring. Object detection and tracking systems are crucial for UAVs because they help to optimally capture moving objects, areas, and threats for enhancing security, surveillance, and awareness at an earlier stage. Also, they help to ultimately predict the category and location of UAVs from the video frames. Many researchers have developed diverse object detection and tracking methods on UAVs; yet, it is complex for continuously monitoring small objects in the gathered data, and it is affected by noise and blurriness due to the motion of UAVs. One of the greatest challenging duties for UAVs is object recognition and tracking since it needs precise, swift, and cost-effective object detection and tracking. Pre-trained networks are required for the detection of objects based on deep learning. Mismatches between the pre-trained and the target domain network areas create problems in object detection. With the aim of resolving these issues, a deep learning-assisted UAV control mechanism is developed in this research work by performing detection and tracking of objects. The developed model is helpful in improving rescue operations in disaster areas and security surveillance. At first, the input videos are accumulated from benchmark sources. From the videos, the resolution of the images is studied for an accurate object detection procedure. Next, the detection and tracking of the object are done via the developed Region Vision Transformer-based Adaptive Multi-scale You Only Look Once v8 (RV-AMYOLOv8). The parameters fromYOLOv8 are optimized using the Fitness-based Random Variable for Elk Herd Optimizer (FRVEHO) for enhancing the performance. The quantitative outcomes of the implemented approach help to analyze the suggested network's performance with conventional techniques. Here, the developed method attains 96% accuracy and 95% of precision measure to demonstrate its better performance than the existing methods. This object detection is helpful for analyzing the surrounding obstacles while controlling the UAVs.},

Numerous practical applications involve time-varying linear equations and inequality systems that demand real-time solutions. This article proposes a ZNN model specifically designed to solve such time-varying linear systems. Innovatively, it incorporates a new non-negative slack variable that transforms complex time-varying inequality systems into more easily solvable time-varying equation systems. By using an exponential decay formula and establishing an indefinite error function, the ZNN model is built. The suggested ZNN model's convergence properties are validated by theoretical research. Results from comparative simulations further support the superiority and effectiveness of the ZNN model in resolving inequality systems and time-varying linear equations.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have shown great power in many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as recommendation system and question answering. Despite the large amount of knowledge facts in KGs, KGs still suffer from an issue of incompleteness, namely, lots of relations between entities are missing. Link prediction, also known as knowledge graph completion (KGC), aims to predict missing relations between entities. The models based on tensor decomposition, such as Rescal and DistMult, are promising to solve the link prediction task. However, previous Rescal model lacks the ability to scale to large KGs due to the large amount of parameters. DistMult simplifies Rescal by using diagonal matrices to represent relations, while it suffers from the limitation of dealing with antisymmetric relations. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a SparseMult model, which is a novel tensor decomposition model based on sparse relation matrix. Specifically, we view KGs as 3D tensors and decompose them as entity vectors and relation matrices. To reduce the number of parameters in relation matrices, we represent each relation matrix as a sparse block diagonal matrix. Thus, the complexity of relation matrices grow linearly with the embedding size, making it able to scale up to large KGs. Moreover, we analyze the ability of modeling different relation patterns and show that our SparseMult is capable to model symmetry, antisymmetry, and inversion relations. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR, and CCKS2021 KGs. Experimental results demonstrate that our SparseMult model outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper proposes AutoMathKG, a high-quality, wide-coverage, and multi-dimensional math KG capable of automatic updates. AutoMathKG regards mathematics as a vast directed graph composed of Definition, Theorem, and Problem entities, with their reference relationships as edges. It integrates knowledge from ProofWiki, textbooks, arXiv papers, and TheoremQA, enhanced through large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation. To search for similar entities, MathVD, a vector database, is built through two designed embedding strategies. To automatically update, two mechanisms are proposed. For knowledge completion, Math LLM is developed to interact with AutoMathKG, providing missing proofs or solutions. For knowledge fusion, MathVD is used to retrieve similar entities, and LLM is used to determine whether to merge with a candidate or add a new entity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advanced performance of the AutoMathKG system, including superior reachability query results in MathVD compared to five baselines and robust mathematical reasoning capability in Math LLM.},

  abstract     = {Underwater images often suffer from visual degradation, affecting downstream tasks. While recent underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques have made some advances benefiting from deep neural networks, challenges remain in restoring fine details and achieving computational efficiency. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in image generation, we propose the Underwater Laplacian-Guided Diffusion Model (ULDM), which enhances image features layer-by-layer based on the hierarchical structure of the Laplacian pyramid transform to achieve both high-quality and efficient UIE. The Laplacian pyramid decomposes the degraded image into high- and low-frequency components, enabling the model to denoise the low-frequency spectrum and address global image degradation, thereby reducing computational overhead. To efficiently enhance high-frequency details, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention Weighted Module (HAWM) that leverages the strong pixel correlations in high-frequency sub-images at different levels, adjusting them layer-by-layer to better capture fine details. These high-frequency sub-images exhibit strong pixel correlation and consistent texture features across different layers, and their hierarchical pattern ensures effective detail restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.},

Traditional ResNet architectures, due to their fixed input size constraints, may reduce their recognition accuracy for images of arbitrary sizes. In this study, we introduce a novel heterogeneous convolution strategy, adjust batch normalization operations, and incorporate a spatial pyramid pooling module based on the ResNet18 network to eliminate these limitations. This new architecture, termed SPPRNet, supports flexible processing of arbitrary-sized inputs and combines multi-scale convolution kernels (3 3, 5 5, 7 7) to simultaneously capture fine-grained features and global contextual patterns. Quantitative results on general datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25.47% Top-1 error rate on ImageNet (compared to 30.55% for ResNet18) and attains 92.95% mAP on the Caltech-101 dataset for object detection tasks, outperforming mainstream models such as VGG-16 and MobileNet. The robust performance of our method in image tasks can be extended to existing approaches to further improve the quality of image recognition in library scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Micro-level prediction of information diffusion aims to predict the next user to participate in the diffusion process, and it is an important task in the field of social network analysis. However, the existing research has two main issues. On one hand, they rely solely on social relationships to learn users' social homophily, leading to an insufficient capture of complex diffusion relationships among users. On the other hand, they overlook the impact of group influence on cascade diffusion, which limits predictive performance. To address the above issues, this study proposes a predictive model for Information Diffusion combining Individual Association and Group Influence, denoted by IGIDP. First, a user diffusion association graph is constructed based on cascade sequences, using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn users' structural features. A gated fusion mechanism is then employed to enhance feature representation for better learning of the impact of user diffusion relationships on cascades. Next, a hypergraph is built through user-cascade interactions, and a hypergraph attention network is introduced to learn users' global interaction feature representations. Then, a novel Transformer variant is designed to capture both individual user and group effects on cascade diffusion. Finally, a decoder provides the diffusion probability for each user. Experimental results on four public, real-world datasets show that the IGIDP model achieves improvements in Hits@ and Map@ by 0.42%–20.94% and 1.66%–25.20%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) scam has increased widely in this society. The technology has emerged to steal money or hack the service during the ATM transaction. Many thieves are using the strategy of skimming and trapping to steal money from ATM devices. In order to secure the transaction in ATMs, several authentication frameworks with recognition have been implemented. This safety work could be dealt with through biometric identification such as face, retina, and fingerprint recognition of the user. Due to high demand for security and reliable authentication schemes, the multimodal biometric system has emerged. The multimodal biometric system needs more than one biometric trait of an individual for identification and security purposes. Therefore, an integrated bank ATM transactions security model using a deep learning-based multi-modal biometric authentication system is developed to provide higher security during ATM transactions. Initially, the ATM card with Personal Identification Number (PIN) is given as the input for making ATM transactions in integrated banks. If the PIN is verified, then the appropriate person is identified through the biometric information of the user. The biometric information of the users includes Fingerprint, Face recognition, Retina, and speech. The speech information is in the format of signal, and hence the de-noising is performed to eliminate the noises from the input signal. The de-noised signal is given to Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to perform a signal transformation. After applying STFT, the spectrogram of images is attained. Finally, both the fingerprint, face, Retina, and spectrogram images are combined and given as the input for the recognition stage. Here, the Adaptive and Attentive-based Mobilenet-v3 (AAMNet) network is used for the recognition of input images, where the parameters from the Mobilenet-v3 are optimized using the Enhanced Archerfish Hunting Optimizer (EAHO) to improve the recognition performance. After recognizing the biometric information of the users, the money transactions in ATMs are completed. Therefore, the security of the integrated banking ATM transaction is highly improved, and the illegal transaction is avoided. The experimental result of the developed security model in ATM transactions is validated with the traditional models to ensure the effectiveness of the developed system. Hence, the effective results of the proposed model attain nearly 93% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and also nearly 6% for FPR and FNR, respectively. This result could be used for practical applications like banking and the financial sector, money transactions, funding management, and so forth.},

  abstract     = {In the current era, improving the intelligence level of vessels and ensuring the construction of a safer and more reliable maritime traffic environment has become an extremely crucial task. And intelligent vessel trajectory prediction undoubtedly impacts the intelligent navigation and collision avoidance systems of vessels. However, unfortunately, in the past few decades, the analysis work on massive trajectory data has been relatively scarce. At the same time, whether the current research focus on vessel trajectory prediction is short-term or long-term, it has led to the situation that the accuracy of trajectory prediction is far from satisfactory. In view of this, this study innovatively introduces a data-driven Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach for the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This method realizes the accurate prediction of the entire vessel trajectory through the fusion of forward and reverse sub-networks (named FRA-LSTM here). Specifically, the forward sub-network in our proposed method cleverly combines LSTM with an attention mechanism to accurately extract key factors from the forward past trajectory data. Correspondingly, the reverse sub-network organically integrates the attention mechanism with a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to simultaneously mine the unique characteristics of the backward historical trajectory data. Finally, the features output by the forward and reverse sub-networks are combined so as to successfully construct the final expected trajectory. After a large number of comprehensive and in-depth tests, we are delighted to find that compared with BiLSTM and Seq2Seq, the method proposed in this study has achieved an average increase of 96.8% and 86.5% regarding the accuracy of short-term and mid-term trajectory prediction respectively. More importantly, in the domain of long-term trajectory prediction, the average accuracy of our method is as high as 90.1% higher than that of BiLSTM and Seq2Seq, showing excellent performance advantages.},

In response, we propose an AI-driven biomedical diagnosis platform for real-time detection and swift intervention. Leveraging privacy-preserving deep learning on the edge, users can promptly obtain automated diagnoses by uploading chest CT images. To further enhance accuracy, we employ a federated learning (FL) framework that ensures scalable training in an industrial IoT setting while protecting patient data. Our global FL model achieves around 96.25% accuracy on a validation dataset, outperforming individual clients by 3.42%. By eliminating the need for sharing raw data, patient privacy is preserved, and the system offers improved flexibility and scalability for medical diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {The precise prediction of power demand is of utmost importance for optimizing power system operations, particularly in the domain of the increasing integration of renewable energy resources. Conventional statistical and machine learning techniques encounter difficulties in capturing complex temporal correlations within load data. The objective of this research is to examine the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory – Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNNs) in load prediction and perform an extensive comparison analysis with the well-established XG-Boost and other conventional techniques. The incorporation of demand response and distributed renewable energy sources is of paramount importance in ensuring the stability of smart grids and the accurate assessment of power demand. However, the task of making precise energy forecasts faces various obstacles that stem from climate conditions, societal influences, and seasonal variations. The precision of our LSTM-RNN model is evaluated using actual demand data obtained from a prominent utility company in Germany. The findings indicate that the LSTM-RNN model consistently exhibits superior performance compared to standard machine learning techniques and XG-Boost in both short-term (1–24 h) and long-term (yearly) load forecasting. The LSTM-RNN has a notable level of resilience in generating accurate predictions, particularly when confronted with inadequate or noisy input data. The aforementioned results highlight the potential of LSTM-RNN in enhancing load forecasting in smart grids, hence enabling the efficient incorporation of demand response mechanisms and renewable energy sources. This study offers valuable insights and presents a comprehensive methodology for improving power demand estimation in contemporary power systems.},

  abstract     = {Context-aware sentiment analysis (CASA) is increasingly critical due to the complex nature of sentiments in digital communication. Traditional sentiment analysis often fails to capture the nuances in context-rich environments, facing challenges like disentangling sentiments, adapting to dynamic contexts, and handling cross-domain variations. Additionally, data sparsity and subjectivity in sentiment interpretation complicate CASA. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a Contextualized Cross-Domain Aspect Sentiment Transformer Network (CC-ASTN) that integrates BERT-based embeddings with aspect-specific embeddings for nuanced contextual and aspect-specific sentiment details. A core feature of CC-ASTN is its fine-grained sentiment analysis, which begins with word-level analysis to discern subtle emotional cues and modifiers, enabling the model to detect sentiment nuances. A novel dual attention mechanism dynamically adjusts focus based on relevance, resolving ambiguities. Advanced domain adversarial training and transfer learning techniques ensure effective cross-domain adaptation, while data augmentation and few-shot learning strategies tackle data sparsity. A hierarchical approach for sentiment analysis breaks down complex sentiments into granular components. The model's robustness is enhanced through dropout, layer normalization, and noise contrastive estimation (NCE), ensuring stability and performance consistency. A composite loss function balances multiple objectives, facilitating precise, domain-neutral sentiment analysis. Additionally, the model integrates real-time feedback mechanisms and leverages a multi-modal approach by incorporating textual, visual, and contextual data for holistic analysis. The CC-ASTN model demonstrates significant efficiency, with training typically taking ˜5 h. Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness, showing significant improvements over existing methods on the SemEval2014 Task 4 and SentiHood datasets. The model achieves inference times of ˜2 s, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications. These findings underscore CC-ASTN's efficacy as an advanced solution for context-aware sentiment analysis, capturing sentiment variations and aspect-level nuances with high precision and efficiency. Its adaptability to rapidly changing trends and real-time feedback integration enhance its applicability in dynamic, real-world scenarios, making it an effective tool for sentiment analysis across a range of fields.},

  abstract     = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and serious sleep disorder characterized by periodic interruptions in breathing lasting more than 10 s (apnea episodes) during sleep. OSA significantly affects quality of life and overall health, highlighting the critical need for an accurate and timely diagnosis. Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard diagnostic technique for OSA, involving the collection of respiratory, oxygen saturation, biometric, and physiological signals. However, manual analysis of these extensive sleep recordings by medical professionals is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a Siamese Network-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSSL) model for the automatic identification of SA episodes from single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Unlike conventional self-supervised methods, our approach does not require a momentum encoder, large batch sizes, or negative-positive pair construction. The model is evaluated using the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database and employs a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, the encoder is trained on unlabeled data to learn robust signal representations. In the second stage, the pre-trained encoder and classifier are fine-tuned using labelled data for optimal classification performance. The proposed model achieved high accuracy of , and when fine-tuned with , and of the labelled training data, respectively, for the classification per segment. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in both offline and online diagnostic settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Wind power, as an important component of distributed power grid integration, plays a vital role in the establishment of a robust power grid. However, the size and direction of wind speeds are random and intermittent, posing significant challenges to the integration of wind power into the grid. To address this issue, this article proposes a highly accurate hybrid optimized wind speed prediction model (HOWSPM) by combining techniques such as data noise processing methods, intelligent optimization algorithms, and deep learning models. First, HOWSPM utilizes the Rime optimization algorithm (RIME) to optimize the variational modal decomposition (VMD) and obtain the RIME-VMD data decomposition model. Second, the RIME-VMD decomposition model is employed to preprocess the nonlinear wind power data, resulting in 10 modal eigencomponents. Additionally, the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is applied to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the bidirectional long-short memory network (Bi-LSTM), leading to an optimized Bi-LSTM network. Finally, experiments are conducted using the optimized Bi-LSTM network for feature extraction and training on the 10 types of modal data. The experimental results show that the RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R 2 of HOWSPM were improved by an average of 36.04%, 42.42%, 23.65%, and 3.09%, respectively, across the four sites. Experimental results indicate that the proposed HOWSPM model effectively enhances the accuracy of wind speed prediction, thereby improving the efficiency of wind power grid integration.},

The upper limb movement intention is initially captured using an optical motion capture system and a surface electromyography acquisition system. An adaptive sliding mode control method, powered by a neural network, dynamically adjusts the controller's parameters to effectively address system uncertainties and external disturbances. The nonlinear disturbance observer in the controller helps identify and mitigate disturbances from the external environment, including Fourier-type, power-type, and mixed disturbances. Furthermore, the stability of the human-machine interaction controller is rigorously verified using the Lyapunov theorem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed neural network-based adaptive sliding mode control method significantly improves the performance and robustness of the upper limb rehabilitation robot.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental issue in managing parking effectively is optimizing the utilization of existing parking spaces. While advanced artificial techniques have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in classifying parking spots, optimizing their utilization remains a key concern. However, performance degrades during slight interference, obstructions, and diverse lighting conditions such as fog or haze. Most researchers have used deep learning approaches to classify parking spaces for non-hazy weather conditions only, often prioritizing model performance over training efficiency. Building on this, the main aim of the proposed work is to develop a model for classifying parking spaces under any weather conditions (hazy and non-hazy). A synthesized parking dataset is designed for hazy weather conditions. Light-dehazenet (LD-Net) is applied to counteract the effects of haze in the synthesized dataset. AlexNet is trained on the synthesized and PKLot datasets by applying transfer learning and preparing hazy and non-hazy feature vectors, respectively. A random forest is applied to select top-ranked features to avoid overfitting, remove noise from the features, and increase generalization capability. The selected features contribute to the input vector for classification using Multilayer-ELM (MLELM). The major breakthrough involves replacing the fully connected layer of AlexNet with MLELM to avoid lengthy backpropagation and reduce the training time. The experimental results of AlexNet-MLELM are compared with lightweight pre-trained CNN and existing state-of-the-art models. Empirical results suggest that the proposed model provides a viable approach for parking space classification in diverse weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {The stock market is extremely unpredictable and impulsive because of a variety of reasons, including public opinion, economic conditions, and so on. Each second, many Petabytes of data emerge from various sources, impacting the stock marketplace. A fair and effective merging of those sources of information (factors) into knowledge is predicted to improve the precision of stock market predictions. However, combining these characteristics from multiple sources of data into a single dataset to supply market evaluation is considered difficult since they are presented in various formats. This paper recommends a deep learning framework for performing prediction in the stock market by considering the sentiment text and historical information from social media. Initially, the required sentiment text and data are collected from the social media platform. From the database, the historical data of the company and the sentiment text from the user uploaded in the social media and news articles are collected. After that, the collected sentiment texts are preprocessed to remove the unwanted data. The preprocessed sentiment texts are given to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for retrieving the first set of features from the positive and negative sentiments. On the other hand, the deep features are retrieved from the data using a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN), which is considered a second feature set from historical data. The two sets of features retrieved from the sentiment text and data are passed to the Dual Scale Adaptive Residual Long Short-Term Memory with Attention Mechanism (DSAResLSTM-AM) for stock market price prediction, where the attributes of the ResLSTM are tuned using Enhanced Deep Sleep Optimizer (EDSO). Here, the sentiment text having positive and negative sentiments helps to predict the stock market price of the company effectively to be less or high along with the analysis of previous data. The recommended model helps to perform the accurate stock market prediction, and it is used to enhance the return and reduce the investment. Finally, experimental validations are conducted to find the performance of the developed model in the stock market prediction.},

  abstract     = {Firefighting pumps are vital components in fire safety systems, and their proper maintenance is essential for operational reliability. Conventional maintenance methods significantly depend on manual inspection and labor-intensive procedures, which are time-consuming and require significant personnel and capital expenses, particularly in large infrastructures. This paper introduces a novel fault detection framework leveraging artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) technology to enhance firefighting pump maintenance services. An advanced hybrid deep learning approach, IPSO-GRU-CNN, is developed to improve failure classification accuracy. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) methodology is employed for hyperparameter optimization of the gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network (GRU-CNN) model, demonstrating superior performance to conventional optimization methods such as PSO and random search. The IPSO-GRU-CNN model is extensively compared with various deep learning architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), GRU, and CNN-GRU, to assess its classification accuracy and efficiency. The suggested AIoT framework optimizes the fault detection process and demonstrates a practical and scalable solution for industrial applications, significantly reducing labor costs and capital expenses associated with the maintenance services of firefighting pumps. Experimental results demonstrated that the developed framework outperforms conventional techniques in terms of classification accuracy and error. Comparing across conventional techniques, IPSO-GRU-CNNs acquire the most significant enhancements of 73.37% loss, 98.88% validating loss, 25.84% CP, 89.72% validating CP, 74.64% MAE, 97.36% validating MAE, 74.21% MSE, 99.9% validating MSE, 5.8% PRE, 5.78% validating PRE, 5.06% REC, and 5.2% validating REC.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, blind image denoising with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the research hotspots in the field of image denoising. Relying on the convolutional operation and respective field, CNN is excellent in processing local information. However, this also brings the problems of lack of cross-domain interaction and process of global feature information. We incorporate it with transformer's self-attention mechanism and propose a cross-channel enhanced CNN, namely CCNet, for image denoising. CCNet consists of three parts: the backbone encoder (BE), the cross-channel enhancer (CCE), and the backbone decoder (BD). The BE and BD are constructed using the multiscale symmetric network U-Net and use the residual connection block (RCB) as the basic block for image feature extraction and reconstruction. CCE introduces transposed attention, serving as a complement of BE for cross-channel modeling. Meanwhile, we propose a unique gated fusion block (GFB) to fuse the information of these two modules and further feature learning. To improve training, we use random cropping, shuffling, and mixed noise strategies to expand the noise distribution learned by the model, increasing its noise adaptability. Extensive experiments on grayscale images, color images, and real noisy images demonstrate CCNet's strong performance in these tasks.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems have recently attracted audiences due to the precise prediction of user interests and provide recommendations accordingly. The user-specific interests are the main requirement to build any recommendation model that produces the desired recommendation list. But the users' interests are sometimes unpredictable due to the fluctuating nature of the arrival of newer products. To resolve this problem and achieve better recommendation outcomes, a two-tier enhanced hybrid collaborative filtering based recommendation system (EHCFR) is constructed in this work based on deep learning. Initially, users in the dataset are segmented based on their age stratification to obtain users' interests based on age. Then, the major features are extracted from the dataset using the word learning enhanced variational auto-encoder (EVAE). These features are provided along with the rating matrix as the input to the deep belief network (DBN) for rating prediction. Based on the predicted ratings, the top N1 recommendation list is generated. Then, a time window strategy is adapted in the model to determine the dynamic fluctuations of user interests. Another list called the top N2 recommendation list is generated based on these fluctuations. Finally, both these lists are concatenated to provide accurate and favorable recommendations to the users. The proposed model is tested on the user dataset and provides competitive performance against the existing state-of-the-art techniques. Also, a reliable comparison is made with the existing popular datasets, such as Movielens 100k and Jester, and the results prove the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Ontology engineering is crucial for many areas such as information retrieval systems, data integration facilities, and basic decision support systems. Nevertheless, estimating the cost of ontology engineering projects is notoriously difficult to achieve. This challenge stems from the complexity and evolving nature of such projects. To solve this difficulty, we propose to improve the accuracy of cost estimation through a hybrid methodology that combines Fuzzy Ontology Cost Estimation Model (F-ONTOCOM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Fuzzy logic is used in our model to capture linguistic variables and other complex relationships within the scope of cost estimation. At the same time, ANN allows for the recognition of complex nonlinear interactions, enhancing the overall accuracy of prediction. This integration of fuzzy logic and neural networks leads to enhancements in the model's robustness, adaptability, and precision. Our approach features a methodology for 148 ontology engineering projects that include, but are not limited to, data scraping and preprocessing, fuzzy inference system design, neural network training, and validation processes. The results showed that the hybrid approach was champion over the traditional estimation approach in terms of effort estimation, Mean Relative Error (MRE), Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), and the predictive accuracy over 21 randomly selected ontology projects.},

  abstract     = {Human beings show multiple responses to various emotional states, like anger, disgust, surprise, happiness, sadness, and fear. Among various emotions, facial expressions are widely informative as they exhibit a person's intentions and character. Facial expression recognition is used in many applications, such as marketing, research, customer service, neuroscience, and psychology. Traditional unimodal methods for facial expression recognition are ineffective due to the scarcity of data. In this paper, the Residual Fused Neuro-Fuzzy Network (RF-NFN) is used for the recognition of facial expressions and detection of emotion type using video and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Here, the video frame is allowed for pre-processing done by Non-Local Means (NLM) filtering. Then, pre-processed video frames and input EEG signals are fed toward feature extraction, which is then followed by feature selection. Finally, facial expressions are recognized and the type of emotion is detected by RF-NFN, which is designed by incorporation of Hybrid Cascade Neuro-Fuzzy Network (Hybrid Cascade NFN) and Deep Residual Network (DRN). Moreover, the performance of the RF-NFN model is validated by three performance measures that exhibited a maximum accuracy of 90.88%, precision of 91.77%, and recall of 94.57%.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks used deep architectures to achieve deep feature extraction in video super-resolution. However, they suffered from challenges of rapid motion and complex scenes in video super-resolution. In this paper, we present a deformable convolutional neural network for video super-resolution (DVSRNet). DVSRNet mainly contains forward and backward feature propagation blocks (FPBs), feature enhancement blocks (FEBs), a feature fusion block (FFB), and a reconstruction block (RB). FPBs can leverage temporal sequence information to capture rich temporal dimensional information in video super-resolution. To restore detailed information, an optical flow technique guided a CNN to align the obtained structural information of different frames to reduce motion-induced blur and artifacts. To address deformable videos from motioned objects, two FEBs utilized deformable convolutions to adaptively correct misaligned objects to improve spatial continuity of videos. To improve reliability of obtained videos, an FFB is used to integrate relations of different video frames from forward and backward propagations. Finally, an RB via upsampling operations and a residual learning technique is used to construct high-quality videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our DVSRNet exhibits superior performance on multiple public datasets for video super-resolution. Its codes can be available at https://github.com/leyoukai/DVSRNet .},

However, regardless of the validity of the pseudo-Gaussian label, previous DCF trackers generally suffer from aberrance, mismatching. In this work, we rethink the DCF tracker from the label matching and propose a label approximation DCF tracker (LACF) focusing on analyzing the commonly used Gaussian pseudo labels in the DCF. Specifically, based on the assumption that the same objects should contain a similar response between two frames, we construct a new pseudo label that combines the original pseudo-Gaussian labels and the previous response map. On the other hand, we introduce a windowing strategy to focus the DCF model on matching crucial labels for the right position.

Although models such as the ComParE Baseline for audio and BERT-based text classifiers have been successful, they do not take advantage of the complementary strengths of both modalities, which restricts their diagnostic power. To overcome this, we suggest SPID-AD (Speech-Based Intelligent Detection of Alzheimer's Dementia), a multimodal deep-learning approach that combines linguistic and acoustic features for the automated detection of Alzheimer's. Our approach uses a BERT-based architecture to mine semantic patterns from transcripts and an augmented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process Mel-spectrogram representations of speech. By combining these features in dense layers, the model retains language-related as well as auditory biomarkers of cognitive impairment. Assessed on the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus, SPID-AD has 95.6% classification accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art models in precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings demonstrate the strength of multimodal analysis in detecting dementia speech patterns, providing a non-invasive, AI-based diagnostic tool that may assist clinicians in the early detection of Alzheimer's.},

  abstract     = {Vitamin D is vital for bone health, immune system support, and muscle function. Deficiency in Vitamin D is widespread, with up to 65% of individuals in certain populations, including Black students at London Metropolitan University, UK, being affected. This study focuses on the need for a deeper understanding of Vitamin D prescription patterns, specifically within an inner London borough, using advanced data analytics. Previous analysis, such as ones conducted by OpenPrescribing.net , has investigated NHS prescription data but lacked a focused examination on Vitamin D. Our study introduces a novel computational approach, integrating NHS datasets from 2013 to 2023. We developed a web-hosted dashboard using Python, Flask, Cesium, PowerBI, and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn to provide real-time data visualization and predictive analytics. Our methodology involved API-driven ingestion of large-scale data, focusing on Vitamin D prescriptions in a borough, and mapping this against patient numbers. We used feature manipulation and model training to gain insights into prescription counts, dosages, medication types, and formulations. This interactive platform supports dynamic reporting through PowerBI and Cesium. Our findings reveal significant variations in prescription patterns among GP surgeries influenced by socioeconomic factors. This interdisciplinary project, in future collaboration with local GP federations, United Kingdom, enhances computational health data analysis and aims to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies, ultimately improving policy practice and public health outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition (HAR) technology plays a major role in today's world and is used in detecting human actions and poses in real-time. In the past, researchers employed statistical machine learning methods to build and extract attributes of various movements manually. However, typical techniques are becoming increasingly ineffective in the face of exponentially increasing waveform data that lacks unambiguous principles. With the advancement of deep learning technology, manual feature extraction is no longer required, and performance on challenging human activity recognition problems can be improved. However, various deep learning models have problems such as time consumption, inaccuracy, and the vanishing gradient problem. Therefore, to solve these problems, the proposed study used a deep convolutional attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network to detect human activities in the provided samples. The input images are first pre-processed using an adaptive bilateral filtering approach to improve their quality and remove image noise. Then, the crucial features are recovered using the convolutional neural network (CNN) based encoder-decoder model. Finally, a deep convolutional attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network is used to identify human activities. The model recognizes human actions with higher effectiveness and lower latency. The human behaviors are identified using the HMDB51 dataset. The proposed model acquired the highest accuracy of 95.46%, which is 10.51% superior to multi-layer perceptron (MLP), 6.99% superior to CNN, 12.76% superior to long short-term memory (LSTM), 5.59% superior to Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and 4.82% superior to CNN-LSTM, respectively.},

This paper proposes a novel bi-objective mathematical model incorporating learning effects to minimize makespan and balance workloads among workers. With the development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) empowered big models, new breakthroughs have emerged in industrial manufacturing decision-making. These models utilize deep learning for foundational content processing and leverage reinforcement learning to optimize strategies. This process provides robust support for achieving efficient decision optimization. Building on the concepts of AIGC big models training, this study employs reinforcement learning to refine the results of multi-objective genetic algorithms, thereby improving the solution capability of the bi-objective model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively provides optimal strategies for tuning crossover and mutation operations. Additionally, numerical experiments offer insights into the formation of hybrid SPS configurations.},

The superpixel fiber flexibly exploits the local similarity at different scales and leads to significant low-rankness. In this paper, we propose the parallel HSI denoising models which simultaneously consider the local and global low-rankness of the HSI based on superpixel segmentation. In the proposed models, the non-convex but smooth log-determination function is adopted to better characterize the low-rankness of the HSI. We also propose an adaptive weighted strategy to optimize the restored HSI. An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the parallel models. Several experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed approach over other competing methods.},

Accurate detection of the location and orientation of the runway can effectively assist in safe aircraft landings and avoid potential risks. However, existing runway detection methods struggle in foggy conditions due to light scattering, causing blurry images and obscuring runway details, resulting in poor detection performance. Towards this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive image-based runway boundary detection method by combining image processing and filter prediction to enhance images automatically. It leverages runway symmetry to enhance feature maps and global-local information fusion. A shape loss function based on the runway's parallel boundaries is also introduced. These developments finally endow the proposed method with robustness towards foggy conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, achieving an average IoU of 73.58 on internal datasets, surpassing other advanced methods.},

To handle this system, this paper proposes a semantic communication system for transmitting standard knowledge in power IoT networks, leveraging deep joint source-channel coding (Deep JSCC) to enhance communication efficiency and resilience. Unlike traditional communication approaches that prioritize bit-level accuracy, semantic communication focuses on conveying the meaning and relevance of information, ensuring that critical control signals and operational data are transmitted accurately, even under noisy channel conditions. The integration of Deep JSCC unifies data compression and error correction into a single neural network, enabling the system to dynamically balance the trade-off between compression efficiency and robustness to interference. The proposed semantic communication system also incorporates reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize network resource allocation on the bandwidth and transmission power, based on the semantic relevance of the transmitted knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in maintaining high reliability and low latency, even in resource-constrained environments, ensuring seamless grid operation and real-time decision-making. This research offers a novel framework for intelligent communication in power IoT networks, paving the way for sustainable energy management through efficient data handling, adaptive resource optimization, and improved communication reliability.},

  abstract     = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), renowned for its high spatial resolution, shows substantial promise in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. However, challenges such as lengthy data acquisition processes and susceptibility to noise can limit data availability and reduce classification accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the CosineGAN-transformer network (CGTNet), which integrates a dual discriminator GAN for generating high-quality synthetic data with a Transformer-based classification network. Equipped with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, this network excels at capturing the intricate spatiotemporal relationships inherent in high-resolution fNIRS signals. The dual discriminator framework ensures that both the temporal and spatial aspects of the synthetic data closely resemble the original signals, thereby enhancing data diversity and fidelity. Experimental results on a publicly available fNIRS dataset, comprising 30 participants performing motor imagery tasks (right-hand tapping, left-hand tapping, and foot tapping), demonstrate that CGTNet achieves an accuracy of 82.67%, outperforming existing methods. Key contributions of this work include the use of multi-head self-attention for refined feature extraction and a dual discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework that maintains data quality and consistency. These advancements significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of BCI systems, offering promising applications in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies.},

Based on this design framework, a complex-type dual-integral structure ZNN (DISZNN) model with inherent linear noise suppression capability is constructed for computing dynamic complex matrix inversion (DCMI) online. The stability, convergence, and robustness of the proposed DISZNN model are ensured via rigorous theoretical analyses. In three distinct experiments involving DCMI (including cases with only imaginary parts, both real and imaginary parts, and high-dimensional scenarios), the state trajectories of the DISZNN model are well and quickly fitted to the dynamic trajectories of the theoretical solutions with very low residual errors in various linear noise environments. More specifically, the residual errors of the DISZNN model for online computation of DCMI under linear noise environments are consistently below the order of , representing one-thousandth of the residual errors in existing noise-tolerant ZNN models. Finally, the DISZNN design framework is applied to construct a controlled chaotic system of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with uncertainties and external disturbances based on real-world modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the three state errors of the controlled PMSM chaotic system converge to zero quickly and stably under various conditions (system parameters, external disturbances, and uncertainties), further highlighting the superiority and generalizability of the DISZNN design framework.},

  abstract     = {Transfer functions have a very important role in metaheuristic optimization-based feature selection algorithms as these functions map the continuous search space into binary space. The U-shaped transfer function (UTF) is one of the transfer functions used to solve the problem of feature selection. However, the UTF requires the selection of parametric values, which can vary for different types of data. To address this issue, an approach to select the parameters of the UTF has been proposed based on a time-varying adaption method, resulting in the modified U-shaped transfer function (MUTF). Furthermore, a methodology has been proposed to enhance feature selection and classification for Parkinson's disease by utilizing z-score normalization in conjunction with a modified U-shaped transfer function and the binary self-adaptive bald eagle search (MUTF-SABES) optimization algorithm. The z-score normalization has been used to mitigate issues caused by outliers. Also, the performance of the k nearest neighbor classifier is improved by selecting an optimal parameter value using the proposed MUTF-SABES algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on seven different Parkinson's disease datasets and compared with five state-of-the-art optimization algorithms: Salp Swarm algorithm, Harris Hawks optimization, equilibrium optimizer, aquilla optimizer, and Honey Badger algorithm, to evaluate its performance superiority. The results achieved using the proposed approach have been superior or analogous to the erstwhile algorithms for performance comparability. Friedman's mean rank test is used to check the statistical significance of the propounded approach. The lowest Friedman's mean rank value obtained using the proposed approach indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to become an alternative to other well-known strategies.},

In orchards, pedestrians exhibit unpredictable behavior and can pose significant challenges to navigation and operation. This demands reliable detection technologies that ensures safety while addressing the unique challenges of orchard environments, such as dense foliage, uneven terrain, and varying lighting conditions. To address this, we propose ReB-DINO, a robust and accurate orchard pedestrian detection model based on an improved DINO. Initially, we improve the feature extraction module of DINO using structural re-parameterization, enhancing accuracy and speed of the model during training and inference decoupling. In addition, a progressive feature fusion module is employed to fuse the extracted features and improve model accuracy. Finally, the network incorporates a convolutional block attention mechanism and an improved loss function to improve pedestrian detection rates. The experimental results demonstrate a 1.6% improvement in Recall on the NREC dataset compared to the baseline. Moreover, the results show a 4.2% improvement in and the number of parameters decreases by 40.2% compared to the original DINO. In the PiFO dataset, the with a threshold of 0.5 reaches 99.4%, demonstrating high detection accuracy in realistic scenarios. Therefore, our model enhances both detection accuracy and real-time object detection capabilities in apple orchards, maintaining a lightweight attributes, surpassing mainstream object detection models.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of video data has resulted in an increasing need for surveillance and violence detection systems. Although such events occur less frequently than normal activities, developing automated video surveillance systems for violence detection has become essential to minimize labor and time waste. Detecting violent activity in videos is a challenging task due to the variability and diversity of violent behavior, which can involve a wide range of actions, motions, and interactions between people and objects. Currently, researchers employ deep learning models to detect violent behaviors. In fact, a large number of deep learning approaches are based on extracting spatio-temporal information from a video by exploiting a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Despite their success, these techniques require a lot more parameters than 2D CNNs and have high computational complexity. Therefore, we focus on exploiting a 2D CNN to encode spatio-temporal information. Actually, statistical features of the optical flow changes are used to give this ability to a 2D CNN. These features are designed to make attention to regions of a video clip with much more motion. Accordingly, the optical flow of an input video is calculated. To determine meaningful changes in the optical flow, the optical flow magnitude of a current frame is compared with its predecessor. After that, statistical features of these changes are extracted to summarize a video clip to a 2D template, which feeds a 2D CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets observe that the suggested strategy outperforms baseline ones. In particular, we make a better estimation of the spatio-temporal features in a video by shortening a video clip into a 2D template.},

  abstract     = {The early detection and classification of COVID-19 is crucial for disease diagnosis and control. To reduce the need for medical professionals, fast and accurate detection approaches for COVID-19 are required. Due to environmental concerns, the quality of the image gets degraded. Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19. Thus, the performance of the deep learning (DL) techniques is diminished. Therefore, a CT image-based hybrid DL technology is presented in this article for the classification of COVID-19 disease as COVID or non-COVID or pneumonia. Initially, in the pre-processing stage, the hybrid nonlocal moment bilateral filtering (Hybrid NMBF) technique is introduced for image de-noising and re-sizing. After pre-processing, the image is fed into the feature extraction phase. Gray-level covariance matrices (GLCM) technique is used to extract the relevant features and reduce feature dimensionality issues. For the feature selection process, the enhanced Archimedes optimization algorithm (EAOA) is introduced to select optimal features. The residual channel attention-generative adversarial network (RCA-GAN) technique is introduced for image classification. Here, the hyperparameter of the network is tuned using the Sandpiper optimization (SPO) algorithm to optimize the loss function. The data set used in this research is COVID-CT-machine learning deep learning (MD), and the performance is analyzed using the MATLAB tool. In the experimental scenario, the proposed system achieves 98.3% accuracy, 98.7% specificity, 99.4% sensitivity, 97.4% F -score, and 96.1% kappa. The attained results prove that the proposed system works better than the traditional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Several companies leverage trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to offer predictive services to users. These companies capitalize on CNNs' superior performance in image processing tasks, such as autonomous driving or face recognition. To safeguard data privacy and model parameters, various algorithms have been proposed. Most of them are predominantly designed using secure multi-party computation (MPC) or hardware-assisted solutions. However, certain limitations persist. First, MPC-based approaches (e.g., garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption) fail to meet rapid responsiveness requirements. Additionally, hardware-assisted solutions impose extra burdens to realize secure inference tasks. The primary reasons for these shortcomings can be summarized as follows: (1) high computation and communication delays are introduced by heavy cryptographic operations during the online phase. (2) Additional overhead for sharing triples. In this article, we propose PCIR, a secure protocol for privacy-preserving convolutional neural network inference (PCIR). PCIR aims to address the aforementioned issues based on a pre-shared secret sharing mechanism. It can achieve rapid responses to user requirements and preserve privacy of data and model for the following reasons: (1) it circumvents computationally expensive operations, such as an operation for permuting plaintext slots, which runs 56 times slower than a homomorphic addition operation, and 34 times slower than a homomorphic multiplication operation. (2) Computational operations, such as homomorphic additions or multiplications, are conducted during the pre-computation phase. It can significantly reduce the online computing costs. (3) PCIR conducts secure multiplication based on pre-shared secret shares. It results in much lower communication and computation costs compared with the use of multiplicative triples. Finally, we evaluate PCIR with benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results have shown that PCIR requires less time and less communication cost than previous methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Land coverage mapping and classification is one of the critical information-based tools for sustainable agricultural development, enabling relevant departments to carry out agricultural resource adjustments, yield predictions, and other tasks in advance. As a vital means of acquiring land cover and usage information, SAR sensors have become an important research direction due to their all-weather and all-day working capabilities. Nevertheless, traditional classification methods in PolSAR image classification often input a combination of various scattering features, i.e., high-dimensional feature combination, into classifiers, leading to mutual interference among different features and consequently degrading classification performance, especially for linear classifiers such as NRS and SVM. To mitigate this interference, this paper proposed an unsupervised feature selection based on spectral clustering (FSSC) that constructs a targeted approach by leveraging the linear expression capabilities of high-dimensional features. In this method, the linear relationships between different features are first analyzed, and the linear similarity between features can be quantitatively expressed using Pearson correlation coefficients, forming a feature similarity matrix. Subsequently, the similarity matrix undergoes unsupervised similarity partitioning through spectral clustering, dividing the features into distinct combinations. Features within clustering subsets can be considered as combinations with high linear similarity. Therefore, KL divergence is applied to select the most representative features within each cluster, and the resulting representative feature combinations from different clustering subsets are combined to form an optimal feature set, achieving the purpose of feature selection. This method maps high-dimensional feature combinations into low-dimensional ones while preserving the essential attributes of the original data, thereby retaining the valuable feature information and enhancing classification performance. Experimental outcomes conclusively show that the proposed method enhances the overall accuracy (OA) of SVM by 4.51% and the OA of NRS by 2.34% in the Flevoland Dataset, underscoring its efficacy in PolSAR image classification, especially for linear classifiers.},

We have collected 5856 chest x-ray images that are labeled as either “pneumonia” or “normal” from a public forum. Before applying the DeepPneuNet model, a necessary feature extraction and feature mapping have been done on the input images. Conv2D layers with a 1 × 1 kernel size are followed by ReLU activation functions to make up the model. These layers are in charge of recognizing important patterns and features in the images. A MaxPooling 2D procedure is applied to minimize the spatial size of the feature maps after every two Conv2D layers. The sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function trains the model, and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used to optimize it. The DeepPneuNet provides 90.12% accuracy for diagnosis of the Pneumonia infection for a set of real-life test images. With 9,445,586 parameters, the DeepPneuNet model exhibits excellent parameter efficiency. DeepPneuNet is a more lightweight and computationally efficient alternative when compared to the other pre-trained models.

  abstract     = {The rapid increase in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) usage across various sectors has heightened the need for robust detection and tracking systems due to safety and security concerns. Traditional methods like radar and acoustic sensors face limitations in noisy environments, underscoring the necessity for advanced solutions such as deep learning-based detection and tracking. Hence, this article proposes a two-stage platform designed to address these challenges by detecting, classifying, and tracking various consumer-grade UAVs. The tracking efficacy of the proposed system is assessed using a combination of deep learning and Kalman filter techniques. Specifically, we evaluate models such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOx to identify the most efficient detector for the initial detection stage. Moreover, we employ both the Kalman filter and the Extended Kalman filter for the tracking stage, enhancing the system's robustness and enabling real-time tracking capabilities. To train our detector, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 10,000 records that capture the diverse environmental and behavioural conditions experienced by UAVs during their flight. We then present both visual and analytical results to assess and compare the performance of our detector and tracker. Our proposed system effectively mitigates cumulative detection errors across consecutive video frames and enhances the accuracy of the target's bounding boxes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the algorithm based on review text has been widely used in recommendation systems, which can help mitigate the effect of sparsity in rating data within recommender algorithms. Existing methods typically employ a uniform model for capturing user and item features, but they are limited to the shallow feature level, and the user's personalized preferences and deep features of the item have not been fully explored, which may affect the relationship between the two representations learned by the model. The deeper relationship between them will affect the prediction results. Consequently, we propose a personalized recommendation method based on the rating matrix and review text denoted PRM-RR, which is used to deeply mine user preferences and item characteristics. In the process of processing the comment text, we employ ALBERT to obtain vector representations for the words present in the review text firstly. Subsequently, taking into account that significant words and reviews bear relevance not solely to the review text but also to the user's individualized preferences, the proposed personalized attention module synergizes the user's personalized preference information with the review text vector, thereby engendering an enriched review-based user representation. The fusion of the user's review representation and rating representation is accomplished through the feature fusion module using cross-modal attention, yielding the final user representation. Lastly, we employ a factorization machine to predict the user's rating for the item, thereby facilitating the recommendation process. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline algorithm in all cases, demonstrating that our method effectively improves the performance of recommendations.

  abstract     = {To meet the demands of modern technologies such as 5G, big data, edge computing, precision, and sustainable agriculture, the combination of Internet-of-Things (IoT) with software-defined networking (SDN) known as SD-IoT is suggested to automate the network by leveraging the programmable and centralized SDN interfaces. The previous literature has suggested quality-of-service (QoS) aware flow processing using manual strategies or heuristic algorithms, however, these schemes proposed with white-box approaches do not provide effective results as the network scales or dynamic changes are happening. This article proposes a novel QoS provision strategy using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to calculate the optimal routes autonomously for SD-IoT traffic. To satisfy the different demands of flows in the SD-IoT network the flows are divided into two types. Hence, based on their service demand the routes are generated for them as per service request. The scenario is explained with precision agriculture based on SD-IoT and results are compared with benchmark strategies. A real internet topology is used for the evaluation of results. The results indicated that the proposed method gives improvements for QoS such as delay, throughput, packet loss rate, and jitter compared with benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Nail-biting (NB) or onychophagia is a compulsive disorder that affects millions of people in both children and adults. It has several health complications and negative social effects. Treatments include surgical interventions, pharmacological medications, or additionally, it can be treated using behavioral modification therapies that utilize positive reinforcement and periodical reminders. Although it is the least invasive, such therapies still depend on manual monitoring and tracking which limits their success. In this work, we propose a novel approach for automatic real-time NB detection and alert on a smartwatch that does not require surgical intervention, medications, or manual habit monitoring. It addresses two key challenges: First, NB actions generate subtle motion patterns at the wrist that lead to a high false-positives (FP) rate even when the hand is not on the face. Second, is the challenge to run power-intensive applications on a power-constrained edge device like a smartwatch. To overcome these challenges, our proposed approach implements a pipeline of three convolutional neural networks (CNN) models instead of a single model. The first two models are small and efficient, designed to detect face-touch (FT) actions and hand movement away (MA) from the face. The third model is a larger and deeper CNN model dedicated to classifying hand actions on the face and detecting NB actions. This separation of tasks addresses the key challenges: decreasing FPs by ensuring NB model is activated only when the hand on the face, and optimizing power usage by ensuring the larger NB model runs only for short periods while the efficient FT model runs most of the time. In addition, this separation of tasks gives more freedom to design, configure, and optimize the three models based on each model task. Lastly, for training the main NB model, this work presents further optimizations including developing NB dataset from start through a dedicated data collection application, applying data augmentation, and utilizing several CNN optimization techniques during training. Results show that the model pipeline approach minimizes FPs significantly compared with the single model for NB detection while improving the overall efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Depression, a prevalent mental disorder in modern society, significantly impacts people's daily lives. Recently, there have been advancements in developing automated diagnosis models for detecting depression. However, data scarcity, primarily due to privacy concerns, has posed a challenge. Traditional speech features have limitations in representing knowledge for depression diagnosis, and the complexity of deep learning algorithms necessitates substantial data support. Furthermore, existing multimodal methods based on neural networks overlook the heterogeneity gap between different modalities, potentially resulting in redundant information. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal depression detection model based on the Enhanced Cross-Attention (ECA) Mechanism. This model effectively explores text-speech interactions while considering modality heterogeneity. Data scarcity has been mitigated by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Additionally, we design a modal fusion module based on ECA, which emphasizes similarity responses and updates the weight of each modal feature based on the similarity information between modal features. Furthermore, for speech feature extraction, we have reduced the computational complexity of the model by integrating a multi-window self-attention mechanism with the Fourier transform. The proposed model is evaluated on the public dataset, DAIC-WOZ, achieving an accuracy of 80.0% and an average F 1 value improvement of 4.3% compared with relevant methods.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are prevalent forms of malignant neoplasms that, depending on their type, location, and grade, can significantly reduce life expectancy due to their invasive nature and potential for rapid progression. Accordingly, brain tumors classification is an essential step that allows doctors to perform appropriate treatment. Many studies have been done in the sector of medical image processing by employing computational methods to effectively segment and classify tumors. However, the larger amount of information collected by healthcare images prohibits the manual segmentation process in a reasonable time frame, reducing error measures in healthcare settings. Therefore, automated and efficient techniques for segmentation are crucial. In addition, various visual information, noisy images, occlusion, uneven image textures, confused objects, and other features may impact the process. Therefore, the implementation of deep learning provides remarkable results in medicinal image processing, particularly in the segmentation and classification process. However, conventional deep learning-assisted methods struggle with complex structures and dimensional issues. Thus, this paper develops an effective technique for diagnosing brain tumors. The main aspect of the proposed system is to classify the brain tumor types by segmenting the affected regions of the raw images. This novel approach can be applied for various applications like diagnostic centers, decision-making tools, clinical trials, medical research institutes, disease prognosis, and so on. Initially, the requisite images are collected from standard datasets and further, it is subjected to the segmentation period. In this stage, the Multi-scale and Dilated TransUNet++ (MDTUNet++) model is employed to segment the abnormalities. Further, the segmented images are given into an Adaptive Dilated Dense Residual Attention Network (ADDRAN) to classify the brain tumor types. Here, to optimize the ADDRAN technique's parameters, an Improved Hermit Crab Optimizer (IHCO) is supported, which increases the accuracy rates of the overall network. Finally, the numerical examination is conducted to guarantee the robustness and usefulness of the designed model by contrasting it with other related techniques. For Dataset 1, the accuracy value attains 93.71 for the proposed work compared to 87.86 for CNN, 90.18 for DenseNet, and 89.56 and 90.96 for RAN and DRAN, respectively. Thus, supremacy has been achieved for the recommended system while detecting the brain tumor types.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, crowdsourcing has developed into a business production paradigm and a distributed problem-solving platform. However, the conventional machine learning models failed to assist both requesters and workers in finding the proper jobs that affect better quality outputs. The traditional large-scale crowdsourcing systems typically involve a lot of microtasks, and it requires more time for a crowdworker to search a work on this platform. Thus, task suggestion methods are more useful. Yet, the traditional approaches do not consider the cold-start issue. To tackle these issues, in this paper, a new recommendation system for crowdsourcing data is implemented utilizing deep learning. Initially, from the standard online sources, the crowdsourced data are accumulated. The novelty of the model is to propose an adaptive residual long short-term memory (ARes-LSTM) that learns the task's latent factor via the task features rather than the task ID. Here, this network's parameters are optimized by the fitness-based drawer algorithm (F-DA) to improve the efficacy rates. Further, the suggested ARes-LSTM is adopted to detect the user's preference score based on the user's historical behaviors. According to the historical behavior records of the users and task features, the ARes-LSTM provides personalized task recommendations and rectifies the issue of cold-start. From the outcomes, the better accuracy rate of the implemented model is 91.42857. Consequently, the accuracy rate of the traditional techniques such as AOA, TSA, BBRO, and DA is attained as 84.07, 85.42, 87.07, and 90.07. Finally, the simulation of the implemented recommendation system is conducted with various traditional techniques with standard efficiency metrics to show the supremacy of the designed recommendation system. Thus, it is proved that the developed recommendation system for the crowdsourcing data model chooses intended tasks based on individual preferences that can help to enlarge the number of chances to engage in crowdsourcing efforts across a broad range of platforms.},

  abstract     = {Speech enhancement is crucial in many speech processing applications. Recently, researchers have been exploring ways to improve performance by effectively capturing the long-term contextual relationships within speech signals. Using multiple stages of learning, where several deep learning modules are activated one after the other, has been shown to be an effective approach. Recently, the attention mechanism has been explored for improving speech quality, showing significant improvements. The attention modules have been developed to improve CNNs backbone network performance. However, these attention modules often use fully connected (FC) and convolution layers, which increase the model's parameter count and computational requirements. The present study employs multi-stage learning within the framework of speech enhancement. The proposed study uses a multi-stage structure in which a sequence of Squeeze temporal convolutional modules (STCM) with twice dilation rates comes after a Triple attention block (TAB) at each stage. An estimate is generated at each phase and refined in the subsequent phase. To reintroduce the original information, a feature fusion module (FFM) is inserted at the beginning of each following phase. In the proposed model, the intermediate output can go through several phases of step-by-step improvement by continually unfolding STCMs, which eventually leads to the precise estimation of the spectrum. A TAB is crafted to enhance the model performance, allowing it to concurrently concentrate on areas of interest in the channel, spatial, and time-frequency dimensions. To be more specific, the CSA has two parallel regions combining channel with spatial attention, enabling both the channel dimension and the spatial dimension to be captured simultaneously. Next, the signal can be emphasized as a function of time and frequency by aggregating the feature maps along these dimensions. This improves its capability to model the temporal dependencies of speech signals. Using the VCTK and Librispeech datasets, the proposed speech enhancement system is assessed against state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and yielded better results in terms of PESQ, STOI, CSIG, CBAK, and COVL.},

  abstract     = {The sharing of patient information on an open network has drawn attention to the healthcare system. Security is the primary issue while sharing documents online. Thus, a dual watermarking technique has been developed to improve the security of shared data. The classical watermarking schemes are resilient to many attacks. Protecting the authenticity and copyrights of medical images is essential to prevent duplication, modification, or unauthorized distribution. This paper proposes a robust, novel dual watermarking system for securing healthcare data. Initially, watermarking is performed based on redundant lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and turbo code decomposition for COVID-19 patient images and patient text data. To achieve a high level of authenticity, watermarks in the form of encoded text data and decomposed watermark images are inserted together, and an inverse LWT is used to generate an initial watermarked image. Improve imperceptibility and robustness by incorporating the cover image into the watermarked image. Cross-guided bilateral filtering (CG_BF) improves cover image quality, while the integrated Walsh–Hadamard transform (IWHT) extracts features. The novel adaptive coati optimization (ACO) technique is used to identify the ideal location for the watermarked image in the cover image. To improve security, the watermarked image is dissected using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and encrypted with a chaotic extended logistic system. Finally, the encrypted watermarked image is implanted in the desired place using a novel deep-learning model based on the Hybrid Convolutional Cascaded Capsule Network (HC 3 Net). Thus, the secured watermarked image is obtained, and the watermark and text data are extracted using the decryption and inverse DWT procedure. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using accuracy, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), NC, and other metrics. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 99.26%, which is greater than the existing methods.},
