  abstract     = {Phenalenyl is known for its highly delocalized radical structure, making it a fundamental building block in the construction of polyradical compounds. This study explores how different connection topologies between phenalenyl units via acetylenic bridges modulate the polyradical character, as well as the electronic and magnetic properties of the resulting systems. The connection type depends on the atom occupation pattern of the phenalenyl singly occupied orbital (SOMO). Three types of connections are defined that induce different π conjugation strength. Linear di- and tetra-phenalenyl chains and cyclic tri- and tetra-phenalenyl aggregates have been investigated. High-level multireference averaged coupled cluster (MR-AQCC) calculations were performed to describe the electronic structures of these compounds. The polyradical character of the oligomers is assessed using descriptors such as singlet-triplet splitting, effectively unpaired electrons ( N U ). Additionally, the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicenter index (MCI), fluctuation index (FLU), nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS (1)), and the anisotropy of the current-induced density (ACID) analysis are employed to characterize the influence of the phenalenyl linkages on aromaticity. Results indicate that bridges enabling stronger interaction between the SOMOs of phenalenyl units lead to a reduction in polyradical character. Aromaticity analysis corroborates these findings, revealing decreased aromaticity in rings where electron interaction occurs through the bridge. On the contrary, choosing bridging types of weak interaction leads to strong open shell character providing candidates for molecular magnetism. A comparison with the predictions of Ovchinnikov's rule is carried out both to rationalize the outcomes of the quantum chemical calculations and to highlight limitations of the rule, particularly in the treatment of quasi-degenerate states.},

  abstract     = {Despite the widespread success of the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method in molecular simulations, its high computational cost due to dense molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) sampling limits its application in large-scale systems. Here we present DF-RESP, which combines the density fitting MEP (DF-MEP) method with RESP charge derivation to dramatically accelerate calculations while maintaining accuracy. Compared to conventional RESP calculations, DF-RESP achieves excellent accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) in charges below 0.003 e for the S22 benchmark and electrostatic interaction energy deviations under 0.1 kcal/mol. For androgen receptor–ligand complexes, DF-RESP achieves an MAE of less than 0.06 kcal/mol. Notably, DF-RESP precisely captures conformational energy variations in Ser-Ala-Gly tripeptide dynamics through charge analysis and achieves a 14-fold speedup for the 1493-atom protein 1h59 while maintaining comparable accuracy. These results demonstrate that DF-RESP is a computationally efficient and reliable approach for RESP charge calculations in large-scale biomolecular simulations.},

This research investigates the structural, optical, and electrical properties of Ca 3 BiCl 3 utilizing the CASTEP module in the context of density functional theory (DFT). To enhance the photovoltaic efficacy of Ca 3 BiCl 3 -based solar cells (SCs), two hole transport layers (HTLs), Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, and two electron transport layers (ETLs), C 60 and WS 2 , were investigated. The Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) was utilized to undertake a comprehensive numerical analysis of Ca 3 BiCl 3 SCs, employing essential semiconductor equations such as Poisson's equation, the carrier continuity equations, and the drift-diffusion model. A comprehensive parameter analysis was performed, including factors such as layer thickness, doping density, temperature, carrier production and recombination rates, defect densities at the interfaces and the bulk material, quantum efficiency, and series vs. shunt resistance. After optimizing the ETL and HTL settings, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.54% was attained using WS 2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL. This arrangement produced a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 23.393 mA/cm 2 , an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.313 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 89.64%. The results highlight the significant potential of Ca 3 BiCl 3 as an effective absorber material, especially in conjunction with WS 2 and P3HT, for the progression of high-efficiency perovskite heterostructure SCs.},

In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism influencing the need for orbital planarity and the role of frontier orbital overlap in magnetic exchange interactions. To study this, we designed a series of 12 polyacene-coupled triarylmethyl diradicals, systematically increasing in length of polyacene. We have used nine different DFT functionals for the calculation of the magnetic exchange coupling constant ( J ). The calculation of magnetic exchange coupling reveals that the GGA functionals define a more accurate spin state, hence more correct magnetic behavior than the meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. We have studied the effect of orbital orientation and their energy gap to understand the high magnetic exchange coupling in the higher polyacene-coupled diradicals. Our calculations revealed that the planarity and overlap of the frontier molecular orbitals are one of the key factors in influencing the strength and behavior of the magnetic exchange interactions in diradicals. Specifically, the overlap between SOMOs and LUMO influences the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction.},

Yet, they hold the promise to be efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize qualitatively wrong predictions. We benchmark twelve energy gaps to find that the local-correlated versions of ADC(2) and CC2 excited state methods deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, we find that double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean absolute errors ( ) despite very low standard deviations ( ). Exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation, which reduces the mean absolute error to below 5 meV, but with an increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods, often overlooked due to their high bias, can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design. The bias-correction data-fitting procedure can be applied to any general problem where two flavors of a method, one with low bias and another with low variance, have been identified a priori.},

The structural characteristics, encompassing lattice parameters and formation energies, validate the stability of these materials, which exhibit a cubic configuration with the Fm-3m space group. The electronic band structure calculations with the modified Becke-Johnson exchange potential indicate indirect band gaps for K 2 AlInZ 6 (Z = F, Cl, Br), with band gaps of 3.73, 2.88, and 2.41 eV for K 2 AlInF 6 , K 2 AlInCl 6 , and K 2 AlInBr 6 , respectively, rendering them viable candidates for optoelectronic applications. The estimated elastic constants, bulk modulus, and shear modulus demonstrate mechanical stability, indicating their suitability for durable and flexible devices. The optical characteristics, including dielectric functions and absorption spectra, exhibit considerable absorption in the ultraviolet range, indicating their potential use in photovoltaic systems. Furthermore, the thermodynamic characteristics are examined by assessing formation energy and Debye temperature. The negative formation energies of these materials signify their strong thermodynamic stability, whereas the Debye temperature analysis elucidates their lattice vibrations and heat capacity, further substantiating their stability and applicability in diverse energy technologies. At 800 K, K 2 AlInF 6 , K 2 AlInCl 6 , and K 2 AlInBr 6 show Seebeck coefficients of ~150, ~160, and ~135 μV/K, respectively, with κ e / τ rising to ~4.0–4.75 × 10 14 W/mKs.

  abstract     = {Electric dipole moments are widely employed in structural biology and computational chemistry as global descriptors of macromolecular charge distribution, contributing to the understanding of protein interactions, solvation, and orientation in external fields. However, for systems bearing a nonzero net charge, the dipole moment becomes explicitly dependent on the choice of coordinates origin, a consequence grounded in classical electrostatics and sometimes overlooked in structural analyses. This origin-dependence is particularly relevant in biological systems, as proteins are typically charged at physiological pH which differs from their isoelectric points (pI's). Moreover, coordinate manipulations such as centering and alignment are routinely performed during molecular dynamics simulations, docking, and structural comparisons, potentially altering the calculated dipole moment of charged systems. This study reviews the theory of the changes in the dipole moment of charged macromolecules accompanying displacements of the origin of the coordinates system. The theory is illustrated by numerical examples on representative proteins. Using the classical expression , we demonstrate that displacements of the order of a protein's radius of gyration or larger can induce dipoles several hundreds to thousands of debyes. We examine this effect across a range of proteins with varying sizes and identify trends correlating the extent of origin-induced changes with molecular size. These examples highlight the need for standardization in defining coordinate systems in dipole-related analyses. The quantum mechanical status of the dipole moment operator is discussed clarifying that only neutral systems satisfy Dirac's criteria for a true “observable”. Altogether, theory, numerical benchmarks, practical guidelines, and pedagogical insights are presented for reliably calculating and interpreting dipole moments of charged biological macromolecules.},

Isotope substitution systematically decreased intermolecular and intramolecular bond lengths (H > D > T). Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) combined with Hirshfeld partial charge analysis confirmed the bonding interpretation but revealed significant variations in bonding contributions across different complexes. While some systems exhibited increased electrostatic attraction, others showed enhanced orbital interactions or shifts in Pauli repulsion, which could stabilize or destabilize the interaction. Natural orbital for chemical valence (NOCV) analysis highlighted charge depletion from the partially negative hydrogen towards the vacant orbital of the bonding partner in CIHB systems, further supporting the bonding model. This study demonstrates how isotope substitution influences electronic structure and lays the groundwork for extending such analyses to more strongly bound systems, where isotope effects may be more pronounced.},

The potential energy surface (PES), computed ab initio, as a function of bond distances and bond angles, has traditionally been represented using analytic functions and/or interpolation methods. We show here that the ab initio computed electronic energy values of a molecular system can be fitted more accurately than the corresponding potential energy values using the artificial neural network methodology. The exact Coulombic internuclear repulsion energy can be added subsequently to the fitted electronic energy to obtain an accurate PES.},

Although numerous software platforms are available, including AutodockGPU, the command-line interface requirements present significant barriers to non-specialized users, while multi-target screening protocols introduce additional complexity in receptor preparation procedures. To address these limitations, we developed Plasmodocking, a comprehensive web-based platform designed to automate molecular docking simulations against predefined Plasmodium falciparum targets ( https://plasmodocking-unir.ecotechamazonia.com.br/ ). The platform enables users to submit up to 10 molecular structures (.sdf format) for automated AutodockGPU screening against 38 pre-configured parasite targets, facilitating systematic comparison of binding energies with co-crystallized ligands. Developed using Python and Next.js, Plasmodocking accelerates malaria drug discovery by enabling simultaneous multi-target docking simulations within a single experimental framework.

  abstract     = {Precise control over DNA stability and interactions is crucial for successful gene editing technologies. To achieve this, a detailed understanding of individual hydrogen bonds within GC (Watson-Crick) and GC*/GC + (Hoogsteen) base pairs is essential, particularly regarding how strategic substitution of these base pairs modulates their strength and, ultimately, DNA stability. Leveraging the atomic-resolution capabilities of interacting quantum atoms (IQA) and interacting quantum fragments (IQF) analyses, this study investigates the impact of substituent position and electronic nature on individual hydrogen bond strengths in substituted GC (WC), GC* (HG) and GC + (HG) base pairs. Our results reveal how the electronic properties of substituents and their specific location on the base pairs significantly influence the forces governing atomic interactions, ultimately impacting the strength of individual hydrogen bonds within GC (WC), GC* (HG) and GC + (HG) base pairs. While IQA highlights the importance of classical interactions in stabilizing hydrogen bonds, IQF analysis, taking a more holistic perspective, reveals a more significant role for electron sharing, highlighting the intricate dance between these forces in shaping DNA stability. Furthermore, GC + (HG) base pairs consistently exhibit stronger inter-fragment interactions compared to GC (WC) and GC* (HG) base pairs, consistent with their higher energy binding energies. The primary reason for the enhanced stability of the GC + (HG) base pairs compared to the GC (WC) and GC* (HG) base pairs is that cytosine has added a proton to the Hoogsteen geometry, leading to strong inter-fragment interactions. By contrast, GC* (HG) geometries are substantially less favorable than GC (WC) and GC + (HG) geometries. GC* (HG) base pairs consistently show weaker inter-fragment interactions compared to GC (WC) and GC + (HG) bases. This reduction in stability is attributed to the substitution of the cytosine amino group with its imino tautomeric form at the electron-donating site of hydrogen bond a , which leads to a decrease in electron-donating ability and the polarity of the N  H bond. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of tuning the interactions within GC (WC), GC* (HG) and GC + (HG) base pairs through strategic substitution, offering a powerful tool for manipulating DNA stability, function, and interactions with other molecules.},

  abstract     = {The electrostatic potential at the nucleus of an atom, whether it be in the free state or in a neutral molecule or in an ionic molecular species, is qualitatively a characteristic property of the atom. It changes remarkably little from one molecular environment to another. As has been shown earlier by Politzer, the energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed both rigorously and approximately in terms of the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei. These findings support the validity of the atoms-in-molecules concept; however, without boundaries. This has been further substantiated in recent papers where the authors have shown that the electrostatic potential created by the electrons of all of the other atoms at a particular nucleus in a molecular species, not including those associated with that particular atom itself, is almost identical in magnitude to the potential due to the other nuclei. However, as has been shown by Gadre and Suresh, small differences in the electrostatic potentials at nuclei for interacting atoms in noncovalent interactions have been correlated with their interaction energies. Thus, finding ways to compute these beyond the main group elements is imperative for further exploration. Because of the importance of electrostatic potential at nuclei, in this paper are reported first, for comparison purposes, the electrostatic potentials at nuclei for atoms from Z = 1 to Z = 36 (hydrogen to krypton) using four density functional methods and the 6–311 + G(3df,2p) basis set and then for Z = 1 to Z = 54 (hydrogen to xenon) using six methods and the aHGBSP1-5 basis set. The values are presented and graphically displayed and discussed.},

The present results show that Be 2 B 5 + , a charge-separated [Be] 2+ [B 5 ] 3− [Be] 2+ cluster, can employ both its cationic Be center and anionic B center to bind Ng atoms. It can bind a total of seven Ng atoms, resulting in the formation of a highly symmetric (Ng Be ) 2 Be 2 (Ng B ) 5 B 5 + complex, having D 5 h point group. The thermochemical analyses reveal that the Ng-Be bonds are stronger than the Ng-B bonds. (Ng Be ) 2 Be 2 B 5 + (Ng = Ar-Rn) complexes are stable against the dissociation of Ng atoms even at room temperature. But, (Ng Be ) 2 Be 2 B 5 + (Ng = He and Ne) and (Ng Be ) 2 Be 2 (Ng B ) 5 B 5 + (Ng = Ar-Rn) complexes are stable only at very low temperatures. Therefore, they can be suitable candidates for low-temperature matrix isolation. A thorough bonding analysis, through charge and energy decomposition methods, discloses that despite the Ng-B interaction being weaker than the Ng-Be interaction, the former bond is more covalent than the latter one. In fact, in the Ng-B bonds, both the orbital and electrostatic interactions are larger in magnitude than the Ng-Be bonds; however, significantly larger Pauli repulsion in the former bonds makes them weaker than the latter bonds. In both Ng-Be and Ng-B bonds, the covalent interaction originates from a strong Ng(p σ ) → Be 2 B 5 + σ donation, complemented by two weak Ng(p π ) → Be 2 B 5 + π donations.},

  abstract     = {We studied isomeric conformer effects on the positron affinity (PA) of halogenated hydrocarbons using density functional theory combined with the electron–positron correlation-polarization potential (CPP) model. PA values are computed for 75 halogenated hydrocarbons, including fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br) derivatives of methane, ethylene, and ethane molecules. The positive PA values can be described by a linear combination of the dipole moment and polarizability of parent molecules. For Cl-substituted methane derivatives, PA increased with the number of Cl substitutions. Such a trend is consistent with the increase in the polarizability of the Cl-substituted methane derivatives. For Cl-substituted ethylene derivatives, PA differences among C 2 H 2 Cl 2 isomers (PA( cis -C 2 H 2 Cl 2 ) > PA(1,1-C 2 H 2 Cl 2 ) > PA( trans -C 2 H 2 Cl 2 )) correlated well with the dipole moments of the respective parent isomers. The isosurfaces of positronic density in the cis isomer revealed that the positron is localized near the halogen atoms, whereas those in the trans isomer are more diffusive due to the spatial separation of the 2 Cl atoms. While a similar overall feature of positron density is observed in Br-substituted C 2 H 2 Br 2 species, positron densities of C 2 H 2 Br 2 are more contracted than those of C 2 H 2 Cl 2 , reflecting that PA(Br) > PA(Cl) due to polarizability differences. These tendencies are also found in halogenated ethane species.},

  abstract     = {An electronic structure study of carbon-based materials has become essential in recent times, as they emerge as promising materials for organic molecular devices. The active electrons residing in the π-molecular orbitals of these systems are strongly correlated, rendering the simple molecular orbital (MO) picture inadequate to accurately capture their electronic properties. The Pariser-Parr-Pople model, which incorporates long-range electron–electron repulsions, is the electronic model of choice for studying these systems. In this mini-review, we introduce the model Hamiltonian and discuss modern numerical methods such as the exact diagonalization and the highly accurate density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, both of which are commonly employed to probe this model. We present our findings on organic molecules like pyrene, triphenylene, benzopyrene, perylene, 1,12-benzoperylene, coronene, and ovalene, considered as graphene nano flakes (GNFs), along with representative graphene nano ribbons (GNRs) such as 2-ZGNR, 3-ZGNR, 5-AGNR and 6-AGNR (Z for zigzag and A for armchair edges), as well as polychrysene and fused azulene. For GNFs, we examine fluorescence properties, singlet fission, and triplet-triplet annihilation in the context of organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic devices, based on the energies of the low-lying states. Our studies also reveal that previous predictions made using effective one-electron models regarding ZGNRs and AGNRs with (where is an integer) dimer bonds across the width are incorrect. We further find that narrow ZGNRs, in the polymer limit, can exhibit a high-spin ground state, contradicting the one-electron picture of edge magnetism predicting a zero-spin ground state. Additionally, we predict that fused azulene structures, which may form along the grain boundaries of graphene layers, can exhibit a high-spin ground state in the polymer limit.},

CO 2 and N 2 O were investigated by evaluating the energy of individual noncovalent interactions and cooperative contributions using the molecular tailoring approach-based (MTA-based) method. The molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) analysis revealed that CO 2 acts as a better electron acceptor due to a more pronounced electron-deficient region on its C-atom, compared to the central N-atom of N 2 O. The energies of the individual tetrel bonds (TBs), pnicogen bonds (PBs), and hydrogen bonds (HBs) observed in CO 2 …water and N 2 O…water in the dimeric clusters calculated using the MTA-based method align well with the MESP results. As the number of water molecules increases ( n = 1–5), the most stable configurations reveal that CO 2 and N 2 O preferentially interact with cyclic water clusters, indicating that water…water HBs dominate energetically over CO 2 …water and N 2 O…water interactions in larger clusters. This is clearly evident from the higher values of water…water HB energies (4.72–9.67 kcal/mol in CO 2 (H 2 O) n and 4.50–9.35 kcal/mol in N 2 O(H 2 O) n ) calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level as compared to the CO 2 …water and N 2 O…water interactions (range of 0.31–4.05 kcal/mol and 0.04–3.28 kcal/mol, respectively). Based on the calculated energies and cooperative contributions by the MTA-based method, the order of interaction strength in these microhydrated clusters follows: HB in water…water > TB in CO 2 …water > PB in N 2 O…water > H  OH…N of (N 2 O) HB > H  OH…O of (CO 2 ) HB > H  OH…O of (N 2 O) HB. We wish to emphasize here that the present study is the first systematic attempt to establish an energetic hierarchy among various HBs, TBs, and PBs, thereby providing deeper insight into the microhydration networks of two atmospherically relevant isoelectronic molecules. These findings are expected to be crucial for elucidating the subtle interplay of noncovalent interactions in atmospheric and related environments.},

This newly implemented method allows the use of global and range-separated hybrid functionals in TD-ADFT for the calculation of vertical excitation energies and corresponding oscillator strengths. To preserve the exceptional computational efficiency and low-order scaling of TD-ADFT, only the diagonal elements of exact exchange are included in the TD-ADFT matrices. For singlet excitations, this approximation reaches accuracies comparable to four-center electron repulsion integral (ERI) implementations, albeit with a fraction of the computational cost. For triplet excitations, larger deviations are found with the HDA. Despite additional integral calculations, the low-order scaling of TD-ADFT is preserved with the HDA. We explain this by the intact index alignment between the ERIs and the excitation vectors, which remains unaltered in TD-ADFT with the HDA.},

  abstract     = {Significant amounts of effluents containing pharmaceuticals residues are released each year in the environment. These residues are responsible for the disruption of the metabolism of organisms. In this study, vermiculite, a low-cost and high specific area clay material, is a best and effective way to remove the micro-pollutants by adsorption. Thus, we investigate the adsorption of carbamazepine (CAR), aspirin (ASP), diazepam (DIA), diclofenac (DIC), paracetamol (PAR), and ibuprofen (IBU), the most common pharmaceutical pollutants encountered in wastewater, on the hydrated surface of vermiculite exchanged with magnesium using thermodynamic calculations and density functional theory (DFT). Our results indicate that DIC exhibits the highest affinity for the hydrated surface of vermiculite, followed by PAR, IBU, ASP, CAR, and DIA. Furthermore, it is possible to regenerate the adsorbent after use, just by heating the vermiculite to a temperature of 360 K. The adsorptions are all exothermic, with energies depending upon the structural configuration of the pollutant on the surface.},

FragmentScout uses publicly accessible structural data of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase, which was previously generated at the Diamond LightSource by XChem high-throughput crystallographic fragment screening. The workflow generates a joint pharmacophore query for each binding site, thereby aggregating the pharmacophore feature information present in each experimental fragment pose. The joint pharmacophore query is then used to search 3D conformational databases using the Inte:ligand LigandScout XT software. The FragmentScout in silico workflow offers a novel tool for identifying micromolar hits from millimolar fragments in fragment-based lead discovery.

However, analyzing its underlying mechanisms at the microscopic level, particularly on the wafer surface, remains a significant challenge. This review focuses on the theoretical study of the micro-mechanism of CMP, and systematically reviews the application of quantum chemistry based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) based on Newtonian mechanics (classical MD/reaction MD/ab initio MD) in the prediction of reaction activity and the analysis of interface behavior. DFT calculation can efficiently locate active sites and reveal the nature of bonding; MD simulation has realized the leap from adsorption configuration to reaction path, but it faces challenges such as limited time scale and high computational cost. So, the development of accurate force field for CMP complex solution environment, the combination of DFT calculation and MD simulation, and the application of machine learning MD will become the breakthrough points for CMP theoretical calculation. The deep integration of theoretical calculation and experiment will subvert the traditional trial-and-error research and development mode of CMP, and realize the whole process digital chain of “molecular design -performance prediction - defect detection” in computer software, which is expected to accelerate the green revolution in precision manufacturing fields such as semiconductors.},

Yet, their accurate calculation and prediction remain challenging. In this study, we employ descriptors derived from density-based reactivity theory to offer a new and quantitative perspective. To this end, we analyzed four series of Lewis acids and bases across two types of reactions. Our results demonstrate that Lewis acidity and basicity can be effectively quantified using a range of global and local descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and an information-theoretic approach in density functional theory. Additionally, various electronic properties, including frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential, natural valence atomic orbital energies, and several types of atomic charges, were identified as robust descriptors. Leveraging these features, we constructed machine-learning models capable of accurately predicting Lewis acidity and basicity. We also uncovered a strong correlation between Lewis acidity/basicity and electrophilicity/nucleophilicity, further bridging these conceptual frameworks. The consistent high correlations obtained across descriptors, coupled with the performance of our machine learning models, confirm that Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity can be quantitatively characterized with high fidelity. This work suggests that density-based frameworks could provide a powerful and novel foundation for understanding the hard and soft acids and bases principle.},

We perform microkinetic modeling of the pertinent reaction considering competitive binding of the reactants and branching pathways in the overall scheme. The experimentally reported product yield could be well reproduced by our proposed kinetic scheme. Our results suggest that the presence of water in the system is inhibitive and does not help with the tautomerism of the bound reactant, unlike the previous experimental results for an aliphatic nitrile. We analyze the transition states and intermediates involved in the competitive binding and branching pathways by Fukui function analysis and energy decomposition analysis to rationalize the computed reaction path. The underlying factors that influence the preference of one pathway or the other could be reasonably rationalized based on these analyses.},

Seven GNN architectures, GCN, GIN, GraphConv, GATConv, GATNet, SAGEConv, and GIN+EdgeConv, were trained for 100 epochs and evaluated across performance and interpretability metrics. GraphConv achieved the lowest test MSE (0.7054), MAE (0.6196), and the highest (0.6513) with only 16.5k trainable parameters, confirming its optimal accuracy-complexity trade-off. GIN+EdgeConv followed closely with MSE of 0.7386, MAE of 0.6332, and of 0.6349, leveraging edge-awareness for enhanced expressivity. In contrast, attention-based models like GATConv and GATNet underperformed, with test MSEs of 0.9667 and 1.0096, and values of 0.5221 and 0.5009, despite their higher complexity (43.5k and 37.3k parameters). Latent space analysis via t-SNE, PCA, and UMAP showed superior cluster separability for GraphConv, GIN+EdgeConv, and GCN. Clustering metrics corroborated these observations: GraphConv achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.4665, a Davies–Bouldin Index of 0.7111, and a Calinski–Harabasz Score of 1278.40. Cluster-wise molecular dipole means for GIN+EdgeConv ranged from 2.6221 to 2.9606 Debye, reflecting high semantic coherence. Residual analysis and QQ plots confirmed that models with lower MSEs also had near-Gaussian error distributions, enhancing interpretability. Compared to benchmark models like PhysNet and DimeNet++, Q-DFTNet offers lower absolute accuracy but excels in modularity, interpretability, and computational efficiency. For a chemically grounded baseline for deploying GNNs in quantum chemistry and materials discovery pipelines, Q-DFTNet is proposed.},

  abstract     = {As the global issue of antibiotic resistance becomes increasingly severe, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of short-chain peptides with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, have garnered significant attention from the scientific community due to their unique antibacterial properties and potential clinical applications. However, traditional methods for discovering and designing AMPs often rely on repetitive laboratory trials and error corrections, which are not only costly but also inefficient. In contrast, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly deep learning algorithms, for screening and predicting AMPs has demonstrated substantial advantages. Deep learning models can automatically learn and extract key features of AMPs from large-scale datasets, enabling efficient prediction of potential AMP sequences. This approach not only significantly enhances the screening efficiency of AMPs but also reduces research and development costs, thereby opening new avenues for the study and application of AMPs. Therefore, this article provides an overview of the workflow and research progress in utilizing deep learning to predict AMP sequences. The limitations and challenges faced by this technology in the field of AMP prediction are also discussed in this review.},

  abstract     = {Organolithium compounds play a pivotal role in organic synthesis, yet their high reactivity and extreme moisture sensitivity—due to the polar carbon-lithium bond—typically necessitate strictly anhydrous conditions. Intriguingly, recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of water can facilitate certain organolithium reactions, such as the efficient synthesis of 2,2-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans via the reaction of methyllithium (MeLi) with 4-chloro-1-phenylbutan-1-one under “on-water” conditions. Despite the success of such transformations, the underlying reaction mechanisms and the behavior of MeLi in aqueous environments remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the MeLi-mediated reaction in the presence of water using hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations, biased by well-tempered metadynamics within a water-ether droplet solvation model. Both dimeric and tetrameric MeLi clusters were examined. Our findings reveal that a hydrogen-bond network involving partially hydrolysed dimers (MeLi 2 OH) and diffusing water molecules stabilizes the organolithium species within the ether phase, preventing complete hydrolysis and enabling product formation. Similarly, the partially hydrolysed tetramer cluster MeLi 4 (OH) 3 was also found to support the progression of the addition reaction without full decomposition.},

  abstract     = {The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a widely studied hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for approximating ground-state energies in molecular and materials systems. This study benchmarks the performance of the VQE for calculating ground-state energies of small aluminum clusters ( Al − $$ {\mathrm{Al}}^{-} $$ , Al 2 $$ {\mathrm{Al}}_2 $$ , and Al 3 − $$ {\mathrm{Al}}_3^{-} $$ ) within a quantum-density functional theory (DFT) embedding framework, systematically varying key parameters: (I) classical optimizers, (II) circuit types, (III) number of repetitions, (IV) simulator types, (V) basis sets, and (VI) noise models. All calculations were performed using quantum simulators to evaluate VQE performance under both idealized and noise-augmented conditions. Our findings demonstrate that certain optimizers converge efficiently, while circuit choice and basis set selection have a marked impact on energy estimates, with higher-level basis sets closely matching classical computation data from Numerical Python Solver (NumPy) and Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (CCCBDB). To approximate realistic conditions, we employed IBM noise models to simulate the effects of hardware noise. The results showed close agreement with CCCBDB benchmarks, with percent errors consistently below 0.2%. The results demonstrate that VQE can approximate energy estimates under simulated conditions for small aluminum clusters and highlight the importance of optimizing quantum-DFT parameters to balance computational cost and precision. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to benchmark VQE in practical settings and lays the groundwork for future benchmarking tools for quantum chemistry and materials applications.},

  abstract     = {Bandgap engineering is the process of modifying a material's electronic structure to optimize its bandgap for specific applications. Applying pressure is an effective technique to alter a material's physical properties to meet device requirements. In this manuscript, we have investigated the impact of bandgap engineering through pressure application on the physical characteristics of AcGaO 3 . Using the Wien2K code and the FP-LAPW method, we evaluated the material's properties under pressures ranging from 0 to 30 GPa, with additions of 5 GPa in each calculation. The Modified Becke-Johnson approximation was employed to accurately account for exchange-correlation effects. The elastic constants show a significant decrease with increasing pressure, indicating a reduction in the material's resistance to external strain. Lower speed values of the elastic waves suggest that the atomic bonding becomes weaker as the pressure is enhanced. Similarly, the Debye and melting temperatures decline as pressure increases. Electronic properties reveal a reduction in the indirect bandgap, while optical properties exhibit a shift from the higher energy region to the lower energy region under elevated pressures. The optical properties report a significant reduction in the polarization ability, absorption, and conductivity as the pressure is increased. This approach opens new possibilities for technological applications, as AcGaO 3 's reduced bandgap and optical characteristics in the visible area make it an attractive contender for next-generation optoelectronic and energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Accurate, efficient stability predictors are essential for understanding isomer formation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with implications for pollution toxicity and carbon-material design, holding broad environmental and technological significance. Recently, a benchmark study demonstrated that PBE0-D4 reproduces CCSD(T)-level isomerization energies for 335 PAHs with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.67 kcal mol −1 . Here, we apply the PBE0-D4/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory to 38,264 PAH isomers from the COMPAS-3x database and identify fast, geometry-based parameters that predict isomer stability. The total dihedral deviation (Σ Dihedral ) provides a cost-free nonplanarity metric yielding a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 3.6 kcal mol −1 , outperforming maximal z -displacement (MAD = 4.8 kcal mol −1 ) and the Harmonic Oscillator Model of Aromaticity (HOMA; MAD = 5.3 kcal mol −1 ). A combined Σ Dihedral –HOMA model reduces the MAD to 2.5 kcal mol −1 , and adding a fitted semiempirical xTB correction further lowers the MAD to 0.8 kcal mol −1 . We implement these descriptors in the PAH Automated Property Scanner (PAHAPS) web tool, enabling rapid estimation of PAH isomer energies from molecular coordinates without intensive quantum calculations. This integrated approach facilitates large-scale screening and efficient design of stable PAH isomers for environmental and materials applications.},

  abstract     = {The effects of replacing individual contributions to an empirical energy function are assessed for halogenated benzenes (X-Bz, X = H, F, Cl, Br) and chlorinated phenols (Cl-PhOH). Introducing electrostatic models based on minimal distributed charges (MDCM) instead of usual atom-centered point charges (PCs) to realistically describe features such as σ −holes yields overestimated hydration free energies unless the van der Waals parameters are reparametrized. Scaling van der Waals ranges by 10% to 20% for three Cl-PhOH and most X-Bz yield results within experimental error bars, which is encouraging, whereas for benzene (H-Bz) PC-based models are sufficient. Replacing the bonded terms by a neural network-trained energy function featuring fluctuating atom-centered PCs also yields qualitatively correct hydration free energies, which can be brought into agreement with experiments within error bars after adaptation of the van der Waals parameters. The infrared spectroscopy of Cl-PhOH is rather well captured by all models, although the ML-based energy function performs somewhat better in the region of the framework modes. The present work finds that refinements of empirical energy functions for targeted applications are a meaningful way toward more quantitative and physics-based simulations. At the same time, empirical energy functions have matured to a remarkable degree, at least for the species considered in the present work.},

Only a few are known as peri-fused six-membered cyclic nitrenium ions (PCNIs) and they are reported to be nitrogen Lewis acids. Preliminary electronic structure analysis indicated that the electronic properties of PCNIs somewhat deviate from the other CNIs (five or seven-membered). Further, these ring systems proved to be non-aromatic (in the triazine ring), whereas the five and seven-membered analogs are aromatic. In this work, an electronic structure analysis was carried out on the newly designed PCNIs to understand their characteristic features. Several analogs of these species were designed to identify PCNIs with improved electronic stability. The PCNIs are electrophilic because of the empty p orbital and the formal positive charge at the central nitrogen atom. The Lewis acidic character of known and designed PCNIs has been evaluated in terms of hydride ion affinity (HIA), fluoride ion affinity (FIA), ΔH PMe3 and ΔH NHC values. This work helped identify a set of new PCNIs whose electronic stability and Lewis acidity parameters are significantly high. Further, a few of these systems were found to be aromatic in all three rings with notable negative NICS(1) values.},

Here, we investigate how VOCs with different central atoms dictate autoxidation pathways and subsequent highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) properties, ultimately influencing the complex refractive index of VOC-mineral particles via density functional theory (DFT) and quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) analysis. Using dimethylsulfide (DMS)/dimethylether (DME) as ether-type proxies and triethylamine (TEA)/trimethylphosphine (TMP) as alkane-type proxies, we reveal two distinct autoxidation paths: alkane-type VOCs undergo more O 2 -addition steps due to their structural capacity for H-shift reactions, generating HOMs with higher oxidation states (OS), molar mass, and polarizability. These properties drive stepwise increases in the refractive index ( n ) for alkane-VOC-mineral particles, leading to stronger light-scattering ability compared to ether-type counterparts. Our results establish a direct link between VOCs' autoxidation mechanisms and optical properties, providing new insights into climate-relevant aerosol interactions.},

Density functional theory (DFT) was used to evaluate the electronic and structural properties of these complexes to determine their catalytic efficiency. The ADAP ligand is crucial for reducing the activation energy and stabilizing intermediates, thereby enhancing catalysis. The study compared mononuclear and binuclear pathways and revealed that ADAP-Cu complexes, especially in binuclear forms, presented the most favorable energy profiles with significant barrier reductions due to cooperative copper interactions. In contrast, ADAP complexes with silver and gold exhibit higher activation energies and lower efficiency. The role of the solvent was also examined, revealing that toluene increases the energy barriers in metal-catalyzed reactions. These findings emphasize the superior catalytic efficiency of copper-based ADAP complexes and the impact of solvent choice on reaction dynamics, offering insights for advanced catalytic system design in organic synthesis.},

To address whether charge variation in GEPS violates the fundamental assumption of ZMM, we compared conformational ensembles obtained using GEPS combined with either ZMM or a conventional electrostatic calculation method. Our results demonstrate that GEPS and ZMM can be effectively combined without introducing systematic bias. Additionally, we identified a potential limitation of ZMM: in highly polarized systems, it may fail to capture long-range electrostatic repulsion, potentially leading to artifacts. These findings support the practical use of GEPS with ZMM for conformational sampling; however, caution is warranted when applying ZMM to systems with highly delocalized electrostatics.},

  abstract     = {We present a two-step method for the direct estimation of the energy of individual non-covalent interactions (NCIs) such as hydrogen bond (HB), CH…π or π…π interactions in any given molecular crystal. The first step of this method is to calculate the energy of a NCI by a molecular tailoring approach based (MTA-based) method utilizing a sufficiently large molecular crystal structure. This calculation is performed at the low Hartree–Fock (HF) level. In the next step, the energy of the same referenced NCI is evaluated by the MTA-based method employing a suitable monomeric or dimeric species. This calculation is usually performed at both the high (B3LYP, MP2 or CCSD(T)) and low (HF) levels. Note that the NCI energies in monomeric or dimeric species are significantly different from those in the actual crystal. The difference in the energy calculated in the second step at high and low levels is added to the energy of this NCI calculated (at HF level) in the first step employing a large molecular crystal. The energies of NCIs calculated by this two-step method are compared with their actual crystal counterparts. For this purpose, molecular crystals of L-Histidine (LH), nitromalonamide (NMA) and salicylic acid (SA) are chosen as test cases. It is found that the proposed two-step method provides very accurate energy of individual NCIs in these molecular crystals. For instance, the estimated energies of NCIs by the proposed two-step method are in excellent linear agreement with their actual crystal counterparts ( R 2 = 0.9983). Furthermore, RMSD and standard deviation are 0.22 and 0.24 kcal/mol, respectively, with a mean and maximum absolute error being 0.15 and 0.51 kcal/mol, respectively. Importantly, the two-step method is computationally efficient and saves nearly 50% of computational time vis-à-vis its full calculation counterpart employing the actual molecular crystal.},

The trends computed for structural parameters and the band gap energies of prototype structures show a good agreement with those reported earlier for n ≤ 99. In order to study the effect of surface passivation, we use a representative model where 2-coordinated surface atoms of (CdSe) n QDs were saturated by hydrogen atoms. The prototype for passivated nanoclusters shows enhancement of band gap energy over their bare (CdSe) n counterparts. We further highlight the strength of our approach by extending the study for the modeled nanoclusters larger than 2.2 nm size, viz. (CdSe) 146 (diameter d = 2.5 nm), (CdSe) 185 (d = 2.7 nm), and a prototype core-shell (CS) QD, viz. (CdSe) 66 /(ZnS) 119 , (d = 2.8 nm), which is otherwise an arduous task on off-the-shelf contemporary hardware. MTA-assisted density functional method offers a reliable and rapid approach for initial steps of geometry optimization of medium and large nanoclusters. The geometrical features viz. surface reorganization through self-healing, selective localization of molecular orbitals, and size dependency of band gap are also retained by MTA. The present approach coupled with a dedicated high performance computer cluster thus has the potential of extending the limits of density functional framework to handle the nanoclusters larger than 3.5 nm (~few hundred atoms).},

  abstract     = {This work presents a robust and efficient algorithm for exhaustively determining the critical points (CPs) of the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) in 3D space. By combining Newton's method with a systematic physical space sampling strategy, we locate all CPs (maxima, minima, and saddle points) for both exact quantum-chemical MEPs and their tricubic interpolated approximations. The method is validated using a test function with known CPs and applied to a diverse set of molecules, including neutral systems, ions, and noncovalent complexes from the S66 and IONIC-HB datasets. Our results demonstrate that the interpolated MEP faithfully reproduces the topology of the exact potential in most cases, with minor discrepancies arising near nuclear positions or in regions of low gradient. The algorithm's efficiency (2–7 faster for interpolated calculations) and robustness make it suitable for large-scale analyses of MEP topologies, offering insights into chemical reactivity and noncovalent interactions.},

Despite its efficiency and popularity, the accuracy of DFT results is highly dependent on the choice of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals. This study evaluates several XC functionals for calculating atomization energies in 13-atom homo- and heteronuclear alkali metal clusters (X 13 and YX 12 , with X, Y = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), comparing these results with reference data obtained from fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations.

  abstract     = {Two years ago, a partition was proposed in the position space of the charge distribution of atoms and molecules, relying on the optimization of the boundaries of space-filling non-overlapping localization regions. This is achieved with the help of global objective functions providing either a measure of the dispersion of numbers of electrons in each localization region or of the dependence of these numbers between them. The output of the method reproduces very well the expected chemical structures in terms of atomic shells, bonds, and lone pairs domains. This method, inspired by the data processing of experimental results, is by construction free of any approximation since it only requires as input the one and two-particle densities of probability. It is based on a strict definition of the concepts of chemical entity, i, e, a set of nuclei and of a given number of localized electrons, for which an electron count followed by a multivariate analysis is carried out. In its first version, the software was extremely inefficient, and its use was therefore limited to atoms and small molecular systems to keep the computational effort within reasonable limits. A significant improvement has been recently achieved, enabling calculations of molecules as large as polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In the present paper, we first discuss the philosophy of previous population schemes, then we describe the features of our new family of population analysis, and then report the results obtained on a rather large sample of molecules and complexes, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons, propellanes, transition metal carbonyl 1:1 complexes and hydrogen-bonded systems as well as reaction mechanisms.},

We employ a growth-pattern algorithm to explore the potential energy surface of the Cu n and PdCu n −1 clusters ( n = 3–20), identifying new putative global minima for PdCu 7 and PdCu 9–11 . For both systems, we analyze their structural, electronic, chemical, and optical properties as a function of size. Structural analysis shows that progressive Cu addition stabilizes Pd in apical positions, reducing electron acceptance barriers and enhancing nucleophilicity compared to its pure copper counterpart. Concurrently, Cu addition induces a blueshift in UV–Vis absorption spectra, indicating increased electronic transition energies. These findings suggest promising applications for these bimetallic clusters in catalysis and electronic sensing.},

  abstract     = {The Born–Oppenheimer approximation assumes nuclear motion evolves on single, uncoupled potential energy surfaces, widely used to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for atomistic systems. However, for near-degenerate same-symmetry electronic states, avoided crossings in the potential energy curves occur and non-adiabatic couplings (NACs) become significant. In such cases, the adiabatic approximation is unsuitable for high-resolution spectroscopy. A unitary transformation to the diabatic representation can eliminate NACs, resulting in smooth molecular property curves that may cross. Computing this adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation (AtDT) is desirable but non-analytic for multi-state coupled systems, necessitating numerical solutions. It remains unclear if current methods yield numerically exact AtDTs ensuring rovibronic energy level equivalence between adiabatic and diabatic pictures. We demonstrate (for the first time) numerically exact equivalence of adiabatic and diabatic representations for -state diatomic molecules using ab initio data for , CH, and a model 10-state system. We show how the equivalence can be efficiently used to assess the importance of non-adiabatic effects and the impact of omitting them when computing rovibronic energies of diatomic molecules.

Although the overall geometrical properties of the oxidized and reduced forms were virtually identical, there were differences in local structure and motion. In particular, the C -terminal region of the reduced form was allowed to have more conformations than that of the oxidized form. Furthermore, the free-energy profile of the flip of the peptide bond linking Cys46 and Ser47 (conversion from “CO-in” to “CO-out” conformations) with the Fd reduction was obtained using 14.6-μs umbrella sampling simulation. It was estimated that the “CO-out” conformation was substantially more stable than “CO-in” conformation and that the activation free energy of the peptide-bond flip was very low. The dynamical structural information obtained in this study on plant-type Fds is expected to contribute to the elucidations of Fd functions.},

This study investigates the effect of ring size and aromaticity on tautomeric stability of Imidazolin-2-chalcogenones and Pyrimidin-2-chalcogenones using quantum mechanical methods. Analysis of the tautomerisation energies reveals that five-membered unsaturated analogues favor lactams, whereas six-membered ones prefer lactims, a reversal in tautomeric preference not observed in saturated lactams or acyclic amides. Charge and population analyses reveal that the nature of C  N(C N )/CX(C  X) bonds contribute to tautomeric stability. EDA-NOCV analysis indicates that the primary difference in C  N(C N ) bonds between the five- and six-membered analogues lies in the low E π in six-membered lactams, supported by low NICSzz (1) values. The tautomerisation of six-membered lactams to lactims results in gain in aromatic stabilization, which plays a crucial role in reversal of tautomeric stability in Pyrimidin-2-chalcogenones, overcoming the intrinsic stability of C  N(C N ) bonds in Imidazolin-2-chalcogenones.},

Additionally, seven protocols with relativistic Hamiltonians, using all-electron basis sets for Au, were evaluated. The results indicate that the structure is relatively insensitive to the computational protocol. In contrast, the activation Gibbs free energy ( ) are highly sensitive to both the level of theory and basis sets choice. Notably, the basis set used for ligand atoms plays a key role in accurately predicting kinetic parameters.

However, for bulkier [Au(R-dien-H)Cl] + derivatives, diffuse functions on ligand atoms are essential, making 6-31+G(d) the recommended basis set. When all five Au(III) complexes are considered, the optimal performance is achieved using B3LYP with the Stuttgart-RSC ECP for Au and 6-31+G(d) for ligand atoms.

We present Voronota-LT, a highly efficient method for computing Voronoi tessellation-based atom-atom contact areas within molecular solvent-accessible surfaces. Voronota-LT differs fundamentally from the original Voronota method by directly constructing each interatomic contact surface without precomputing global Voronoi diagrams or Delaunay triangulations. This enables fast, parallelizable computations with linear scalability and a possibility for targeted analysis of molecular interfaces. In addition to its high performance, Voronota-LT comprehensively describes interatomic interactions with full structural context.

  abstract     = {In recent times, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become essential tools in molecular graph learning, due to its ability to model intricate structural dependencies. Despite their success, recent research has shown that GNNs still face significant limitations, in capturing long-range dependencies and global structural information. One of the central issues is the over-squashing problem, where information from distant nodes is excessively compressed into fixed-size node representations. This leads to poor information propagation; as a result, ultimately degrading the model's performance—particularly in complex tasks such as lethal dose forecasting, where both local chemical substructures and global molecular topology play vital roles. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anti-symmetric fuzzy-enhanced graph learning (ASFGL) model. Generally, our model integrates two key components: an anti-symmetric transformation module and a residual adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The anti-symmetric transformation is designed based on stable graph ordinary differential equations (ODE); thus, ensuring a non-dissipative and stable propagation of information across multiple graph layers. This mechanism effectively mitigates the over-squashing issue, therefore, allows our model to better capture long-range dependencies in a stable manner. Complementarily, the ANFIS module employs bell-shaped membership functions to support robust and interpretable learning; as a result, enabling adaptive rule-based reasoning that refines the molecular representations learned from the graph structure. By combining these modules, the ASFGL model bridges local message passing and global structural awareness, yielding expressive molecular embeddings well-designed for toxicity prediction problems. We evaluate our proposed ASFGL model on different benchmark molecular datasets, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based architectures in terms of MAE/RMSE evaluation metrics, particularly in scenarios requiring deep representation learning over large interactions. These results highlight the efficacy of integrating anti-symmetric dynamics and fuzzy inference systems in advancing molecular property prediction and overcoming foundational challenges in GNN design.},

  abstract     = {Enzymatic hydride transfer reactions play a crucial role in numerous metabolic pathways, yet their accurate computational modeling remains challenging due to the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Ideally, molecular dynamics simulations should sample all enzyme configurations along the reaction path using post-Hartree-Fock or DFT QM/MM electrostatic embedding methods, but these are computationally expensive. Here, we introduce a simple approach to improve the third-order density functional tight binding (DFTB3) semi-empirical method to model hydride transfer reactions in enzymes. We identified deficiencies in DFTB3's description of the potential energy surface for the hydride transfer step in Crotonyl-CoA Carboxylase/Reductase (Ccr) and developed a systematic methodology to address these limitations. Our approach involves modifying DFTB3's repulsive potential functions using linear combinations of harmonic functions, guided by analysis of C-H and C-C distance distributions along the reaction path. The optimized DFTB3 Hamiltonian significantly improved the description of the hydride transfer reaction in Ccr, reproducing the reference DFT activation barrier within 0.1 kcal/mol. We also addressed the transferability of our method by applying it to another hydride transfer reaction bearing the 1,4-dihydropyridine motif but exhibiting distinct structural features of the reactant, as well as the hydride transfer reaction in Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR). In both cases, our adapted DFTB3 Hamiltonian correctly reproduced the DFT reference and experimentally observed activation barriers.

  abstract     = {Drug–target interaction prediction serves as a crucial component in accelerating drug discovery. To overcome current limitations in deep learning approaches, specifically the inadequate representation of local features and insufficient modeling of drug and target information interactions, we propose a multiscale feature extraction coupled multilayer cross-interaction network (MSCMLCIDTI). The model uses multiscale convolutional blocks to extract structural fingerprints of drug compounds and amino acid sequences at different scales for multigranularity pattern recognition across spatial domains, followed by gated attention to obtain multidimensional features. This multidimensional feature extraction enhances the model's capability to identify critical binding sites between pharmacological compounds and their biological targets. Furthermore, we implement a deep cross-interaction mechanism utilizing multilayer attention-based interactions to model complex relationships between distinct drug substructures and protein fragments. This design empowers accurate identification of sophisticated interaction signatures in pharmaceutical target complexes. Comprehensive validation across four open-access benchmark datasets reveals our framework's superior predictive accuracy compared to existing leading-edge models.},

This S N Ar reaction follows a stepwise pathway: initially, pyrrolidine adds to the C2 position of the 2-methoxy thiophene partner. Then, the release of methanol is triggered by a proton transfer from the newly formed ammonium intermediate to the methoxy group. With excess pyrrolidine, this proton transfer is catalyzed by an additional pyrrolidine molecule. We establish linear correlations between the experimental electrophilicity and the Gibbs free energy barrier, Parr electrophilicity (ω), and molecular softness (S). Local reactivity descriptors for the C2 position are generally non-informative, except for the population of the C  O bond basin, the C2 population of the ELF LUMO function, and the condensed electrophilicity index ω + ( C2 ). This theoretical approach provides a robust method to further predict electrophilicity parameters in versatile thiophene derivatives chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds are essential chemical interactions that occur in various systems, playing a critical role in determining molecular structures, dynamics, and reactivity. While quantum chemical methods such as Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses have traditionally been used to explore these interactions, this work introduces the Chemical Bond Overlap (OP) Model and its topological (TOP) descriptors as a complementary approach for analyzing orbital overlap contributions in hydrogen bonds. The study reports a systematic investigation of a series of hydrogen-bonded systems (a total of 25 systems), demonstrating how electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents influence bond characteristics. The results reveal that OP/TOP effectively captures the effects of electronic perturbations, offering insights into the (X) interactions and serving as a complementary approach to QTAIM, NBO, and local vibrational modes theory (LVM). Notably, for nonconventional hydrogen bonds ( ), the OP/TOP model, consistent with LVM, correctly captures the expected increase in interaction strength for . This agrees with the higher electrophilicity of the hydrogen in , as indicated by its lower pKa and weaker CH bond dissociation energy. Additionally, the inclusion of electron-donating groups significantly enhances lone pair antibonding orbital interactions, increasing NBO occupancy and electron density at the hydrogen bond critical point (BCP), as reflected by a decrease in and an increase in . This behavior consistently indicates hydrogen bond strengthening across QTAIM, NBO, and OP/TOP descriptors. Calculations were performed using the B97X-D/def2-TZVP level of theory. The findings establish OP/TOP as a powerful tool for computational chemistry, particularly in the study of weak intermolecular interactions and molecular design.},

  abstract     = {The present work purposes and establishes an accurate prediction of HOMO–LUMO energies of thiophene-, selenophene-, and tellurophene-based helicenes using 15 different DFT methodologies. DFT functionals used in this work are PBE, PBE0, B3LYP, B3LYP-D, B3LYP-D3, M06, MN15, HSE06, LC-BLYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-ωPBE, ωΒ97XD and B2PLYP. DFT HOMO–LUMO gaps are compared with the fundamental gaps calculated at the CCSD(T) level of theory. The LANL2DZ basis set is used for tellurium atoms, and the 6–311++G(d,p) basis set is used for other elements. Statistical error analysis suggests that the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps can be accurately obtained using ωB97XD functional, with geometry optimization performed at the same theoretical level. However, geometry optimization using the B3LYP functional, followed by single-point energy calculation with the ωB97XD functional, provides a more cost-effective method with similar accuracy for energy gap prediction. HOMO–LUMO gaps of telluro[n]helicenes ([n]TeH) are redshifted compared with their S- and Se-analogs. Tellurophene-based helicenes ([n]TeH) systems are easy to oxidize in contrast to their S- and Se-analogs. Dimerization studies have found that substituted [7]TeH •+ is more stable in dichloromethane than its S- and Se-analogs. The CAM-B3LYP and ωΒ97XD functionals are used in conjunction with the TDDFT procedure to explore the excited states of [n]TeH radical cations. These radical cation systems showed better absorption in the infrared range than S- and Se-systems. Overall, our benchmarking studies lead to an accurate prediction of HOMO–LUMO gaps of [ n ]TeH. Further, this study demonstrates the potential of Te-based helical structures to create versatile next-generation organic materials.},

Simulated circularly polarized 10 femtosecond (fs) laser pulses were applied and we quantified the effects on the electron dynamics during the application of “pump” and candidate “probe” laser pulses to discover optimal “probe” laser pulses. This is undertaken for the first application of Next Generation Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (NG-QTAIM) using the Hessian of the “spin-up” and “spin-down” contributions to the total electronic charge density ρ ( r ). The optimal “probe” pulse was found to possess a peak electric field E = 10.0 × 10 −4 a.u. compared with the “pump” pulse of E = 200.0 × 10 −4 a.u. Separately considering the spin-up and spin-down contributions doubles the values of the chirality-helicity C helicity function relative to that of the total charge density contribution for the H-H bonding for the application of the “pump” laser pulse. Within the NG-QTAIM interpretation, a combination of highly responsive and coherent behaviors is associated with superconductivity. These behaviors were discovered from the very high values of the C helicity function, near-linear scaling of the bond-flexing F and bond-chirality C values with peak E -field and all instances of the H-H bonding possessing R electronic chirality assignments. The “pump” pulse was found to magnify the effects associated with superconductivity within the NG-QTAIM interpretation. Future applications are discussed including chiral spin selective phenomena and exotic high temperature superconductivity where phonons do not play a significant role.},

  abstract     = {Using the framework of the bonding evolution theory (BET), we investigated the molecular mechanism of the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of benzonitrile oxide ( 1 ) with five ethylenic derivatives (2 a–e ). The global mechanism consists in the concerted attack of one of the O lone pairs of 1 on one of the atoms of the C–X double or triple bond of 2 (X = C, O, N), the attack of the C–X double or triple bond of 2 on the C of the C–N triple bond of 1 , and the conversion of C–N triple bond of 1 into a double bond and the creation of a lone pair on N. The reaction proceeds through a one-step mechanism, the creation and modification of the electron basins occur at different places along the intrinsic reaction coordinate, as unraveled by the BET study. In the cases of dipolarophiles ( 2a–c ), first the C–N triple bond of 1 is converted into a double bond with the creation of a lone pair on N. Then, a C–C single bond between the C–N triple bond of 1 and one of the C atoms of the C–C double or triple bond of 2 is created. Finally, the O–C single bond is formed. Concerning 2e , the meta -path follows the same reaction mechanism as 2a–c , while for the ortho -path, the formation of C–N and C–O bonds are synchronous and mediated by the N4 lone pair. A similar observation (but for the two C–O bonds) is found for 2d ortho -path while the mechanism for the meta -path is quite different to the other ones due to the formation of an O–O bond. The present work represents a new example showing how the use of BET can provide curly arrows and electron flow representation to unravel molecular mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The intricate world of cellular processes relies significantly on the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) family of kinases, governing vital functions like brain development, splicing regulation, and apoptosis. DYRK1A, in particular, stands at the center of attention due to its pivotal role. Disruptions in its activity, whether through upregulation or downregulation, have profound implications, notably in neurological disorders and cancer progression. Understanding the impact of phosphorylation, a fundamental post-translational modification, on DYRK1A is paramount. In this study, we delved into the complex interplay of phosphorylation and the effects of the abemaciclib inhibitor on DYRK1A conformational dynamics. We employed advanced techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations and the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) scheme and deciphered the intricate dance of DYRK1A's structural elements during phosphorylation. Our exploration revealed intriguing details: the α C-helix undergoing outward movement, a distorted α C-helix, a wide-open P-loop, extended A-loop, and role of electrostatic interactions shaping A-loop dynamics. Notably, the interaction of specific residues, particularly Lys 188 , forming robust salt bridges with Asp 307 and Glu 203 , plays a pivotal role in shaping the structure of the protein. Diving deeper, we conducted principal component analysis and conformational free energy sampling to uncover crucial structural intermediates. Moreover, our dynamic cross-correlation map sheds light on the influence of phosphorylation by enhancing coordinated movements while dampening anti-correlated motions across various domains. This nuanced understanding of DYRK1A kinase activation, driven by phosphorylation, not only enriches our knowledge but also holds promise in the development of targeted therapies for associated diseases.},

  abstract     = {The design of novel materials through the strategic modification of their structural building blocks represents a powerful approach to achieving significant advancements in materials science. This study thoroughly examines the structural, mechanical, electronic, acoustic, and thermodynamic properties of a three-dimensional monoclinic boron carbide (3D m -B 8 C 8 ) structure using first-principles methods based on density functional theory (DFT). We introduce a unique cage-based 3D monoclinic boron carbide structure, constructed from 4-, 5-, and 6-membered rings, which demonstrates remarkable dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stability. Our advanced first-principles calculations reveal that this architecture exhibits metallic characteristics, as confirmed by both GGA-PBE and HSE06 hybrid functionals. In contrast to the ductile and low Vickers hardness 3D-B 6 C 6 , the 3D m -B 8 C 8 displays significant brittleness, a high Vickers hardness of 45.40 GPa (32.36 GPa), a low Poisson's ratio of 0.188, and a universal anisotropic index of 0.903. When compared to established thermal coating (TBC) materials such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), which has a fracture toughness range of 2.0 to 2.3 MPa m 1/2 and a minimum thermal conductivity of 2.20 W m −1 K −1 , the 3D m -B 8 C 8 demonstrates superior fracture toughness of 5.336 MPa m 1/2 and a minimum thermal conductivity of 3.773 W m −1 K −1 . These exceptional characteristics suggest that 3D m -B 8 C 8 could serve as a compelling candidate for applications in environmental protection, thermal barriers, and oxygen-resistant coatings. The material exhibits a Debye temperature of 1524.15 K, an acoustic Grüneisen constant of 1.240, and a phonon thermal conductivity of 85.52 W m −1 K −1 at 300 K. Its melting temperature is 3311.94 K, with a thermal expansion coefficient of 7.337 μK −1 and notable phonon inelastic scattering. These findings expand the range of boron carbide materials with new properties, presenting exciting prospects for advanced engineering applications and encouraging further experimental synthesis efforts.},

In this study, we have investigated the conformational changes of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, and the unbinding of the PLP-substrate complex (external aldimine) at the active site of the enzyme using molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamic simulations. The study reveals a three-step mechanism for the ligand unbinding process. Initially, the enzyme undergoes a reorganization in which the distance between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of opposite chains that form the active site increases. This reorganization opens the active site, and the interactions between the PLP-substrate complex and two active site loops, namely loop1 and loop2, begin to weaken. As a result, the ligand exits the active site and primarily interacts with loop3. Over time, these interactions with loop3 also weaken, and the ligand eventually becomes fully unbound. The calculated free energy differences for these steps are found to be 1 kcal/mol, 6 kcal/mol, and 8 kcal/mol, respectively. Our findings provide detailed insights into the conformational changes and energetics associated with ligand unbinding in ODC, offering a valuable framework for understanding similar processes in other PLP-dependent enzymes.},

The variation of the electrostatic term, which accounts for over half of the total attractive energy, can be approximated, but with only modest accuracy, by combination of the maximum and minimum of the electrostatic potential on the two subunits. Induction represents a smaller contribution to the total, but is well connected with the NBO interorbital transfer energy, as opposed to the reciprocal of the HOMO-LUMO gap which behaves quite differently than IND.

  abstract     = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear, negatively charged carbohydrates that modulate enzymatic activity in the extracellular matrix. Their high flexibility and specificity in protein-GAG interactions pose challenges for both experimental and computational studies. Here, the repulsive scaling replica exchange molecular dynamics (RS-REMD) method, combined with molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA), was implemented using the CHARMM36m force field to evaluate its ability to guide ligands to their native binding sites in seven protein-GAG/carbohydrate complexes. A five machine learning (ML)-based models including fully connected neural network (FCNN), linear regression, LightGBM, random forest and support vector regressor (SVR) were also trained to predict binding accuracy (RMSatd) based on MM-GBSA energy components, protein-GAG distances, and hydrogen bond counts. While MM-GBSA values showed weak to moderate correlations with RMSatd, most of the trained AI models significantly improved the selection of native-like binding poses with Random Forest model providing most accurate predictions. This study highlights the potential of integrating simulations with ML to refine molecular docking for flexible ligands like GAGs.},

The mutation of a single residue can have a strong impact on binding affinity and specificity, which is difficult to capture in sampling and scoring. Many established computational methods provide an estimate of binding or non-binding; however, comparing highly similar ligands is an important and significantly more challenging problem. Here we evaluated the capability of predicting ligand binding specificity using three established but conceptually different physics-based methods for protein design. As a model system, we analyzed the binding of peptides to designed armadillo repeat proteins, where a single residue of the peptide was changed systematically, leading to affinity changes in the range of 1–1000 nM. We critically assessed the prediction accuracy of the computational methods. While a good correlation with experimentally determined data was observed in several cases, specific biases in the prediction performance of each method were identified.},

Traditionally, polarizability calculations via DIM rely on matrix inversion, posing constraints on memory usage and computational time. Recent implementations have shown significant performance boosts by employing an iterative inversion solver, albeit reducing accuracy. In this paper, we present a direct approach for computing polarizabilities via iterative cycles, eliminating the need for matrix inversion. This allows for scaling up the model to hundreds of thousands of atoms without sacrificing precision, as often happens when simplifying the standard inversion procedure to reduce computational costs. Additionally, we have addressed memory issues associated with storing extensive arrays in standard implementations. Our advancement holds promise for diverse applications, providing an efficient method for exploring polarizabilities in various systems.},

When the pore size of a CNT is less than 2.56 nm, the properties of boric acid solutions show a noticeable confinement effect, which gradually decreases with increasing pore size and approaches those of a bulk solution. In small-sized CNTs (0.82 and 0.96 nm), boric acid molecules do not polymerize with each other. With further increasing pore size, polymerization occurs between boric acid molecules in a bidentate manner. In small CNTs (0.82 and 0.96 nm), boric acid molecules undergo dehydration and transform into metaboric acid molecules.

At 3,4 and 5,6 fusions of the tropone ring with aromatic cycles, the RAHB enhancement is observed while the RAHB weakening takes place at 4,5 and 6,7 fusions. An opposite trend appears at the fusion of the tropone ring with the antiaromatic cycle. A linear ratio was found between the HOMA structure-based aromaticity indices as well as NICS magnetic ones for the tropone ring and the RAHB energy. The total RAHB energy is divided into σ- and π-components. The σ- and π-components were established to change in the same directions, appearing the synergism. This synergism causes extremely high RAHB energies above 30 kcal/mol in some tropolones. It was shown that RAHB acquires the features of CAHB in these cases due to the excess charge on the oxygen of the CO group. The influence of the RAHB strength on the frontier molecular orbitals patterns, energy, the size of the gap between them, and the λ max absorption wavelength in the UV/vis range was studied. It was revealed that the HOMO energy elevates, the LUMO energy lowers, the HOMO-LUMO gap narrows, and the λ max wavelength undergoes a bathochromic shift with RAHB strengthening in the studied tropolones.},

From a computational point of view, the simulation of the HRS-OA (THS-OA) spectroscopy requires the calculations of five first (second) hyperpolarizabilities and these can be obtained from quadratic (cubic) responses functions by using the DALTON quantum chemistry software. However, the expressions for the chiral and achiral contributions to the scattered intensities are quite complicated because these contain a lot of terms. In particular, for HRS-OA and THS-OA 30 and 46 molecular invariants need to be computed, thus complicating their computational implementation. The postprocessing codes presented here can be used as black-box tools for the simulations of HRS-OA and THS-OA spectroscopies.

  abstract     = {The cluster-in-solvent approach, that is, the use of the quantum-mechanical calculation of a spectral observable on a significant number of solute–solvent clusters extracted from semi-classical simulations, is widely used in computational spectroscopy. However, identifying relevant coordinates for cluster selection remains a challenge. We previously developed the Ellipsoid Method for Cluster-in-Solvent (EMCS), an automated strategy for unbiased identification and statistical weighting of clusters. Yet, for larger solutes, EMCS can yield overly large solvent clusters that hinder conformational analysis. Here, we introduce a simple extension of EMCS that reduces cluster size, enabling its application to medium-to-large solutes. The method is validated through the computation of Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectra, which are highly sensitive to solute–solvent interactions. Test cases include aqueous L-alanine, aqueous dialanine, and (1S,2S)-trans-1-amino-2-indanol in DMSO. For L-alanine and trans-1-amino-2-indanol, computed spectra closely match experiment, with root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) values of 10.3 and 8.0, respectively, consistent with previous benchmarks. For aqueous dialanine, the main spectral features were reproduced, though discrepancies in the fine structure remain, likely due to limitations in capturing subtle solvation effects. Overall, the refined EMCS protocol enables efficient and non-arbitrary sampling of solute–solvent clusters, offering a valuable tool for the structural analysis of solvation shells in complex molecular systems.},

In addition to completed NCIs (hydrogen bonds with bond paths), we identify latent interactions—attractive, bond-path-free atomic pair interactions with negative interaction energies. These are classified into dynamic (vibration-induced and transient) and static (secondary, persistent but structurally passive) types. Analysis of the internal pressure in electronic continuum reveals that latent NCIs exhibit distinct signatures in the kinetic and exchange components, which evolve across the molecular, cluster, and crystalline states. Dynamic interactions are characterized by off-axis minima in the exchange part of the pressure, whereas static interactions lack such features. Upon crystallization, intramolecular latent NCIs may disappear due to electron density redistribution and the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. These intermolecular contacts may also spatially constrain atoms, suppressing vibrational flexibility and effectively converting dynamic NCIs into static ones. The kinetic pressure highlights regions of electron localization, while the exchange pressure offers a physical criterion for distinguishing different types of NCIs. Our findings demonstrate the structural and stabilizing roles of latent interactions and establish electronic pressure as a sensitive and informative descriptor for their analysis.},

Our results show that the calculated rates of ISC are comparable for the two adducts, while the rates of TTEnT differ due to the orbital overlap between the donor and acceptor sites. After the TTEnT, a stereospecific cyclization occurs, completing the catalytic cycle.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of molecular properties is essential for modern drug design and discovery. Self-supervised learning (SSL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in this field to learn molecular representations and predict molecular properties. However, previous graph-based deep learning methods have overlooked the important weak interaction, that is, long-range interatomic interaction, which is crucial in determining the molecular properties. This study presents a novel self-supervised learning framework, Virtual Bonding Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction (VIBE-MPP), to address the limitations of existing methods by incorporating weak interactions and 3D spatial information into the molecular representations. VIBE-MPP utilizes a Virtual Bonding Graph Neural Network (VBGNN) to construct a virtual bonding enhanced graph that encodes molecules, and a Dual-level Self-supervised Boosted Pretraining (DSBP) approach to enhance representation learning through four designed pretext tasks. The framework introduces virtual bonds to represent atom interactions within a radius of 10 Å, enabling an atom to engage in message passing with multiple other neighboring atoms simultaneously. The model is evaluated on 10 benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks. On average, it improves upon the best baseline models by 3.20% and achieves optimal performance on four regression datasets. Additionally, visualizations of the learned molecular representations in downstream datasets show that VIBE-MPP effectively captures molecular properties and semantic information.},

The topological analysis of ELF enables partitioning of the molecular space into basins (core, valence, monosynaptic, and polysynaptic). The gradient field of ELF, examined using quantum chemical topology algorithms, is a key component of this analysis, which can be time-consuming. Combining ELF and the Independent Gradient Model (IGM), we propose a novel approach that is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods, providing a rapid visual methodology to identify the synaptic order of ELF basins, which defines their connectivity and corresponding bonding schemes. We validate this combined approach across a wide range of representative chemical systems, demonstrating its efficiency in generating visual ELF analyses and in enhancing traditional approaches where topological analysis may struggle. The analysis serves as a stepping stone for full ELF topological analyses through programs like TopChem2.},

Current literature suggests that substitutions at the position are the most commonly preferred due to their labile nature, which makes synthesis easier. However, there has been no systematic study investigating how the position of substitutions impacts the TP activity of BODIPY systems. Furthermore, we found no reports addressing the effects of heavy atoms, such as iodine, on this property. To fill these gaps, this work presents a systematic investigation of how substitution of iodine at the position, along with a few polar groups at other positions in the BODIPY core, affects the TP activity. For this purpose, 36 BODIPY systems were designed and their one- and two-photon (TP) activities were studied computationally using the state-of-the-art resolution-of-identity coupled cluster with doubles method. To explain the effect of iodine, and that of nature and position of polar groups in the BODIPY core on TP activity, we used a three-state model. Further, we also performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interaction of the designed molecules with the Human Serum Albumin (HSA) protein. Our findings suggest that substituting iodine at the position increases the TP activity. Additionally, we observed that the substitution of polar groups at the position results in larger TP activity compared to and positions. Molecular docking and simulation results revealed that the designed molecules interact with HSA, and the complexes formed are stable throughout the simulation period.},

  abstract     = {Asymmetrically substituted indenotetracene crystals are promising nonfullerene electron transport materials for organic photovoltaics, offering potential improvements in efficiency and stability. In this work, we present a first-principle investigation of the electronic and vibrational properties of a diarylindenotetracene system functionalized with two methoxy groups (hereafter DimethoxyASI ). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis [reported in J. Org. Chem. 2018, 83, 4, 1828 ] reveals a monoclinic structure with an interplanar distance of 3.76 Å, providing insight into the molecular packing and intermolecular interactions that govern the solid-state organization. Notably, for the first time, in this work we identify two distinct dimeric species within the crystalline lattice by a structural and electronic analysis, each exhibiting different intermolecular arrangements that significantly influence both the electronic structure and vibrational properties of the material. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations provide insight into the molecular packing, electronic states, and vibrational characteristics of the crystal. The theoretical absorption spectrum, obtained from TDDFT calculations, features three main electronic transitions centered at 530, 360, and 275 nm, displaying a mixed character of localized excitations and charge-transfer contributions. The vibrational properties, investigated through phonon density of states calculations at the DFT level, highlight well-defined spectral features. While most vibrational modes remain consistent between monomeric and dimeric configurations, significant deviations emerge in the low-frequency region, where intermolecular interactions and crystal packing effects play a crucial role. Furthermore, the two dimeric species exhibit distinct electronic properties beyond their geometric differences. A key distinguishing factor is the transition electric dipole moments (TEDMs), which governs the probability and polarization of electronic transitions. Our analysis reveals that the TEDMs magnitude and orientation vary significantly between the two dimeric species, suggesting that they may interact differently with polarized light. These differences provide new insight into the role of molecular aggregation in shaping the optical response of organic semiconductors and highlight the impact of polymorphism on their electronic properties. Overall, this study underscores the intricate relationship between molecular packing, electronic structure, and vibrational properties in indenotetracene-based materials, contributing to a deeper understanding of their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.},

Zirconium-ligand association and reaction energies have been compared with results from quantum chemical calculations obtained at MP2 and DFT (PBE and B3LYP) level of theory, as well as with those from the semi-empirical methods DFTB2/PTBP and GFN2-xTB.

To provide a critical validation of the newly derived parameters, the structure of the biomedically relevant Zr-DFO complex has been evaluated with respect to a DFT (B3LYP) reference calculation. In addition, extensive DFTB3 MD simulations of the two prominent metal-organic frameworks UiO-66 and UiO-67 have been performed.

  abstract     = {Given the rising incidence of prostate cancer (PCa), there is an increasing demand for cost-effective and reliable methods for early detection using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biomarker. PCa remains a leading cause of mortality among individuals with prostates aged 55–80 years. Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) represent a promising solution due to their selectivity, sensitivity, and stability for PSA detection. However, the synthesis of MIPs for protein targets presents significant challenges, particularly in the rational selection of functional monomers and cross-linkers. This study introduces a theoretical framework to aid the development of MIPs by assisting in the selection of optimal reagents for PSA targeting. A novel algorithm, the Molecular Binding Algorithm for Surface Mapping (MBASM), was developed to efficiently generate amino acid-monomer complexes. The integrated MBASM + DFT approach was validated through comparison with the GFN2-xTB method and the Quantum Cluster Growth approach implemented in the CREST program. The results demonstrated strong agreement between the methods, establishing MBASM + DFT as a viable and innovative alternative tool for predicting interaction structures and energies. Through this strategy, promising monomers for PSA-targeted MIP synthesis were identified, including itaconic acid, 4-imidazole acrylic acid, and methacrylic acid, with 1,4-divinylbenzene emerging as the most effective cross-linker. This computational methodology provides a powerful and systematic approach for optimizing MIP synthesis aimed at selective PSA detection.},

Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we systematically examined the electrochemical performance of Zr-based bimetallic MXenes, Zr 2 MC 2 O 2 , and M 2 ZrC 2 O 2 ( M = Sc, Ti, V), including their structural stability, electronic properties, adsorption characteristics, and ion diffusion behavior. The strategic incorporation of 3d transition metals induces pronounced synergistic effects, significantly enhancing electronic conductivity, with Sc 2 ZrC 2 O 2 exhibiting the highest density of states at the Fermi level (9.375 states/eV). The computed adsorption energies confirm strong Li/Na interactions, particularly in Sc 2 ZrC 2 O 2 , which displays exceptional adsorption affinities of −2.754 and −2.241 eV for Li and Na, respectively. Additionally, Sc 2 ZrC 2 O 2 achieves a remarkable theoretical specific capacity of 429 mA h g −1 for NIBs and 213 mA h g −1 for LIBs. Furthermore, Zr 2 TiC 2 O 2 exhibits the lowest average open-circuit voltage (OCV), measured at 0.33 V for NIBs and 1.23 V for LIBs. Notably, the introduction of 3d transition metals enhances Na-ion diffusion while selectively optimizing Li-ion mobility, with Sc 2 ZrC 2 O 2 exhibiting the lowest Li-ion diffusion barrier (0.273 eV) and Zr 2 TiC 2 O 2 facilitating Na-ion transport with the lowest diffusion barrier (0.309 eV). Furthermore, structural stability analysis confirms that these MXenes exhibit minimal lattice distortion and robust mechanical integrity during lithiation and sodiation. Our results highlight the synergistic effects of transition metal combinations in tailoring the electrochemical properties of MXenes, positioning them as promising candidates for high-performance anode materials in energy storage applications.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of protein–peptide complex structures plays a critical role in structure-based drug design, including antibody design. Most peptide-docking benchmark studies were conducted using crystal structures of protein–peptide complexes; as such, the performance of the current peptide docking tools in the practical setting is unknown. Here, the practical setting implies there are no crystal or other experimental structures for the complex, nor for the receptor and peptide. In this work, we have developed a practical docking protocol that incorporated two famous machine learning models, AlphaFold 2 for structural prediction and ANI-2x for ab initio potential prediction, to achieve a high success rate in modeling protein–peptide complex structures. The docking protocol consists of three major stages. In the first stage, the 3D structure of the receptor is predicted by AlphaFold 2 using the monomer mode, and that of the peptide is predicted by AlphaFold 2 using the multimer mode. We found that it is essential to include the receptor information to generate a high-quality 3D structure of the peptide. In the second stage, rigid protein–peptide docking is performed using ZDOCK software. In the last stage, the top 10 docking poses are relaxed and refined by ANI-2x in conjunction with our in-house geometry optimization algorithm—conjugate gradient with backtracking line search (CG-BS). CG-BS was developed by us to more efficiently perform geometry optimization, which takes the potential and force directly from ANI-2x machine learning models. The docking protocol achieved a very encouraging performance for a set of 62 very challenging protein–peptide systems which had an overall success rate of 34% if only the top 1 docking poses were considered. This success rate increased to 45% if the top 3 docking poses were considered. It is emphasized that this encouraging protein–peptide docking performance was achieved without using any crystal or experimental structures.},

  abstract     = {Non-covalent interactions (NCI) dominate the properties of condensed phase systems. Towards a detailed understanding of NCI, quantum mechanical (QM) methods allow for accurate estimates of interaction energies and geometries, allowing for the contributions of different types of NCI to condensed phase properties to be understood. In addition, such information can be used for the optimization of empirical force fields, including the specific contribution of electrostatic versus van der Waals interactions. However, to date, the relative orientation of monomers defining molecular interactions of dimers is often based on full geometry optimizations of all degrees of freedom or extracted from known experimental structures of biological molecules. In such cases, the spatial relationship of the monomers often leads to multiple atoms in each monomer making significant contributions to the interactions occurring in the dimer, confounding understanding of the contributions of specific atoms or functional groups. To overcome this, a workflow is presented that allows for systematic control of the interaction orientation between monomers to be performed through the use of molecular interaction rules (MIR) in an extendable tool that can be applied to a broad range of chemical space. Using the “MIR workflow” allows a user to perform automation of the determination of well-defined monomer interaction orientations in dimers using Z-matrices, allowing for potential energy scans (PES) to be performed on combinatorial pairs of the monomers. In addition, compiled monomer and dimer geometries and PES data are stored in an extendable database. Illustration of the utility of the workflow is performed based on a collection of 89 monomers encompassing a variety of functional group classes from which 10,616 interaction dimers can be automatically generated. PES between all dimers were calculated at the QM HF/6-31G*, MP2/6-31G*, and ωb97x-d3/6-31G* model chemistries. In addition, analysis of the benzene dimer in three interaction orientations, a hydrogen bond interaction between azetidinone and N -methylacetamide, and the interaction of pyridine with acetone in the Burgi–Dunitz orientation are presented including results with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. Results show the impact of different QM model chemistries on minimum interaction energies and distances over a large ensemble of intermolecular interactions with emphasis on the contributions of dispersion.},

  abstract     = {The hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between backbone amide and carbonyl groups are fundamental to the stability, structure, and dynamics of proteins. A key feature of such hydrogen bonding interactions is that multiple H-bonds can enhance each other when aligned, as such in the -helix or -sheet secondary structures. To better understand this cooperative effect, we propose a new physical quantity to evaluate the cooperativity of intermolecular interactions. Using H-bond aligned N-methylacetamide molecules as the model system, we assess the cooperativity of protein backbone hydrogen bonds using quantum chemistry (QM) calculations at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level, revealing cooperative energies ranging from 2 to 4.3 kcal/mol. A set of protein force fields was benchmarked against QM results. While the additive force field failed to reproduce cooperativity, polarizable force fields, including the Drude and AMOEBA protein force fields, have been found to reproduce the trend of QM results, albeit with smaller magnitude. This work demonstrates the theoretical utility of the proposed formula for quantifying cooperativity and its relevance in force field parameterization. Incorporating cooperative energy into polarizable models presents a pathway to achieving more accurate simulations of biomolecular systems.},

This is essential for simulating self-assembly into higher-order structures like filaments, lattices, or macromolecular complexes. Applications of self-assembly are ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science, but these higher-resolution methods increase computational cost. Here, we present a parallel implementation of the particle-based NERDSS software using the message passing interface (MPI), achieving close to linear scaling for up to 96 processors. By using a spatial decomposition of the system across processors, our approach extends to very large simulation volumes. The scalability of parallel NERDSS is evaluated for reversible reactions and several examples of higher-order self-assembly in 3D and 2D, with all test cases producing accurate solutions. Parallel efficiency depends on the system size, timescales, and reaction network, showing optimal scaling for smaller assemblies with slower timescales. We provide parallel NERDSS code open-source, supporting development and extension to other particle-based reaction–diffusion software.},

  abstract     = {The Radical General-Purpose Reactivity Indicator (R-GPRI) is a valuable new tool for discerning the most reactive atoms within a molecule undergoing radical attack. In this study, we apply the condensed R-GPRI and the condensed Radical Fukui Function (RFF) to identify the two most reactive atoms in 14 nitrogen heteroarenes subjected to radical attack by •CF 3 (trifluoromethyl radical) and • i -Pr (isopropyl radical). The results were compared with available experimental data and calculated activation barriers to comprehensively evaluate the reactivity of these molecules, especially in reactions without isolated products. The outcomes indicate that R-GPRI is a robust alternative for identifying the most reactive C  H sites in disubstituted nitrogen heteroarenes, outperforming the RFF. We also found that for nitrogen heteroarenes, summing the charges of the hydrogen atoms into the heavier atoms to which they are bonded as computed with the Hirshfeld population scheme enhances the performance of the RFF compared to previous findings. As such, the R-GPRI appropriately incorporates both charge and RFF contributions. It is also observed that the atoms within molecules that have a small condensed RFF tend to be unreactive in these radical attack reactions. This is even observed in atoms with the largest charge in magnitude (with the appropriate sign) but a small condensed RFF.},

To improve the kinetics of these reaction systems, accurate energetics were computed with the ωB97X-D and CCSD(T) methods, and the rate constants were determined using CVT methods with multidimensional tunneling. KIEs were also determined for (R1), which is an important path at high temperatures. At the ωB97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level, the value of electronic barrier height is 4.5, 5.2, and 0.4 kcal mol −1 for (R1), (R2), and (R3), respectively. In addition to the characterization of the elementary reactions, a mechanism consisting of all interconnected reactions was characterized by using the energy-grained master equation approach to determine the phenomenological rate constants for the formation of products and the time evolution of the species.

It has been found that DMA cluster size is a key parameter in modulating CO 2 conversion, both energetically and structurally. It has been shown that as the size of DMA clusters increases, hidden domains transform into real domains and the energy barrier for the rate-limiting step significantly decreases, so that a slow and unlikely reaction becomes an instantaneous and viable reaction.

The hPF-MD scheme is particularly suitable to develop a GPU-resident and low data exchange code. Comparison of performances obtained using the previous multi-CPU code with the proposed multi-node multi-GPU version are reported. Several non-trivial issues to enable applications for systems of considerable sizes, including large input files handling and memory occupation, have been addressed. Large-scale benchmarks of hPF-MD simulations for system sizes up to 10 billion particles are presented. Performances obtained using a moderate quantity of computational resources highlight the feasibility of hPF-MD simulations in systematic studies of large-scale multibillion particle systems.

Continuum Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory, multiscale Brownian dynamics, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to predict and interpret local potentials. Local potentials around DNA demonstrate strong salt dependence. Experimental results are in good agreement at 0.138 M ionic strength with continuum theory and simulation. Compared to experiment, the PB and multiscale simulation methods overestimate local potentials in magnitude at medium to high salt concentration. We find that the overestimate is mainly caused by ignoring the probe-probe and probe-ions correlations in the proximity of DNA. The probe-related correlations can be up to 0.4 kcal/mol in certain regions. Comparisons of the experiment and the calculations emphasize not only the importance of orientations of probes but also the probe-related correlations in determination of near-surface-zone potentials.},

  abstract     = {We present PDBrestore, a free web interface for repairing protein PDB chains extracted from either a local PDB file or a PDB file downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. PDBrestore performs several key tasks: It adds hydrogen atoms, completes missing atoms in side chains, fills gaps in the sequence, derives the itp parameter file for a ligand according to the GAFF2 force field for GROMACS applications, and generates a reasonably pre-equilibrated solvated simulation box. The interface is designed to streamline the cumbersome preparatory work required to set up an initial protein-ligand coordinates PDB file for use in drug design projects, such as free energy perturbation or thermodynamic integration calculations of ligand binding affinities. Additionally, PDBrestore is available as a command-line application within the open-source ORAC distribution, which can be freely downloaded from the website: www1.chim.unifi.it/orac .},

Bond length and Wiberg bond order analyses reveal significant double bond character of the X–Y bond, confirming the hypervalent structure of the molecule.

Topological molecular graphs are commonly used for representing molecules in machine learning (ML). However, the challenge is to utilize the complete geometry information, such as, bonds, angles, and dihedral angles while processing a molecular graph. In this work, we present predictive GNN accounting three-dimensional molecular structures including the dihedral angles (GNN3Dihed) in a systematic manner. Additionally, we demonstrate that the usage of autoencoders to generate latent space embeddings for usually sparse atomic and bond vectors reduces the number of parameters in the message passing stage while not reducing performance. We compare the performance of GNN3Dihed with state-of-the-art baselines on several tasks (regression and classification), for example, solubility prediction, toxicity prediction, binding affinity, and quantum mechanical property prediction, and showed that the present architecture often outperforms other models—demonstrating the importance of 3D structural information for ML in chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Physics-based methods such as protein-ligand binding free energy calculations have been increasingly adopted in early-stage drug discovery to prioritize promising compounds for synthesis. However, the accuracy of these methods is highly dependent on the details of the calculation and choices made while preparing the ligands and protein ahead of running calculations. During ligand preparation, researchers typically assign partial atomic charges to each ligand atom using a specific ligand conformation for charge assignment, often the input conformer. While it is a well-known problem that partial charge assignment is dependent on conformation, little investigation has explored the downstream effects of varied partial charge assignment on free energy estimates. Preliminary benchmarks from the Open Free Energy Project show that generating partial charges from different input conformers leads to variation of up to kcal/mol in calculated relative binding free energies due to variation in partial charges alone. In this study, we more systematically explore this issue, investigating it in smaller systems using absolute hydration free energy calculations to reduce the degrees of freedom and sources of statistical error as compared to larger protein-ligand systems. We investigate how differences in partial charge generation (such as those caused by input conformer choice, partial charge engine, and hardware) may lead to differences in calculated absolute hydration free energy (AHFE) values. We demonstrate that supplying different input conformers to a partial charge engine can result in atomic partial charge discrepancies of up to 0.681 e, resulting in differences in calculated AHFE of kcal/mol. We find that even relatively small variations in partial charge assignment can result in notable differences in calculated AHFE. Thus, care should be taken when assigning partial charges to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of any resulting free energy calculations. We expect that these effects will be magnified in pharmaceutically relevant binding free energy calculations with additional degrees of freedom, more highly directional interactions than in water, and potentially more statistical error.},

  abstract     = {Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical geometry optimizations of large-scale biological systems, such as enzymes, proteins, membranes, and solutions, are typically computationally expensive to the point of being cost-prohibitive. By convention, an approximation is made to such calculations that atoms beyond a certain distance from the QM region provide only negligible improvements to the resulting optimization energy and geometry, and as such are restrained to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. These constraints are normally applied beyond a user-defined radius. Here we describe a new method of geometry optimization acceleration and automation which generates adaptive gradient-based restraints for QM/MM optimizations, leading to significantly faster optimizations and generally lower relative energies. The restraints are determined by an algorithm rather than a user, and can adapt to directional optimizations as well as differences in starting geometry. This flexibility is key to finding excited state minima and minimum energy conical intersections (MECIs) in complex protein environments. This algorithm was implemented as an external Python tool for use alongside TeraChem, with a modular interface that can be straightforwardly applied to other QM/MM packages. We tested on a green fluorescent protein (rsEGFP2) and two red fluorescent proteins (FusionRed, mScarlet) in water and a proton-swapping aspartic acid pair in explicit water. We are able to produce a nearly 50% reduction in computational time while maintaining appropriately optimized geometries and relative energies.},

  abstract     = {Vibrational spectroscopy calculations based on classical molecular dynamics simulations are widely employed in a variety of popular fields, for instance, computational biochemistry and materials science. These calculations commonly rely on the Fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function. One major drawback of the method is that calculated spectra are difficult to interpret due to the large number of closely spaced signals. In this paper, we show how theory can help to overcome this issue by means of a time-average technique, and we introduce free software to perform such calculations for anyone who may take advantage of it. The studies presented here involve the classical vibrational spectra of aniline microsolvated by a water molecule and gas-phase deoxyguanosine. The software is made available in the form of a free web-platform, named SEMISOFT ( http://semisoft.unimi.it/ ), whereby, upon upload of the classical trajectory, the user gets the corresponding time-averaged spectrum. Furthermore, since the evaluation of response functions through autocorrelated data is quite a general approach, the web-platform can be directly employed in many other research fields besides chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Collision cross section (CCS) values can enhance the identification and classification of molecular contaminants such as per- and polyfluororoalkyl substances (PFAS). However, the computational burden required for large molecules, combined with the increasing number of potential PFAS candidates, can render existing methods incapable of providing sufficiently accurate results in a timely manner. Furthermore, machine learning methods struggle to generalize when the (de)protonated structure undergoes structural changes that are not common in the training dataset. In this study, we introduce IMPACT4-CCS (Integrated Modeling and Prediction using Ab initio and Trained potentials for Collision Cross Section), a novel computational workflow ensemble that comprises ab initio with machine learning tasks to accelerate accurate prediction of CCS for PFAS molecules. IMPACT-4CCS achieves comparable accuracy to current machine learning approaches, as validated using a test set of 100 molecules. Furthermore, IMPACT-4CCS exhibits better accuracy when implemented on some specific emerging PFAS subclasses, such as the n H-perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids ( n H-PFCA) family, for which other methods overestimate their CCS values. As far as the authors know, IMPACT-4CCS is the only existing method capable of capturing structural dynamics (i.e., hydrogen bridging) present in some large and flexible PFAS molecules. Our work demonstrates that the careful use of machine learning to accelerate traditional methods is likely to be more accurate than relying purely on machine learning on molecular graphs. Future (or recommended) work includes assessing the usefulness of IMPACT-4CCS for extending nontarget analysis to larger PFAS datasets such as the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) PFAS list in PubChem, which could be greater than 7 million molecules with diverse chemistry.},

Gas phase DFT computations do not fully reflect this ultrastrong dipole moment, demonstrating the role of solvent in increasing this dipole moment. Here, we investigate the effect of solvent molecule position on the dipole moment of this species, computationally examining systems with giant dipole moments. These systems are optimized in the gas phase with the B3LYP functional, employing the aug-cc-pVTZ and def2-TZVP basis sets, as well as the B3LYP-D3BJ/aug-cc-pVTZ functional in Orca. Single point DLPNO-CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ results were obtained from Orca and Psi4, as well as DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS information from Psi4. Additionally, these are compared to the dipole moments of di- and tri-hydrated systems, and the SMD models for THF and water at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The dissociation energies, HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and dipole moments are presented. These metrics show the nh1nh1′ THF system boasts the largest dissociation energy and dipole moment of the singly solvated systems, due to its strong hydrogen bonding. The importance of solvent placement is highlighted and may guide the synthesis of macromolecules or organic frameworks incorporating the MOI or MOI-like subunits. Remarkably, a single solvent molecule provides a good model for the difference between the gas phase and solvated species. The predicted gas phase dipole moments computed with B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ for the MOI, its monohydrated complex, dihydrated complex, and its trihydrated complex are 9.6, 14.2, 16.0, and 16.8 Debye, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Cyanopolyyne and protonated-dicyanopolyyne molecules always get special attention for their detection in the interstellar medium. The rotational quantum dynamics for the collision of recently detected protonated dicyanoacetylene ( ) with He is studied to get the inelastic rate coefficients till temperature range of 100 K. An accurate potential energy surface (PES), computed using ab initio methods, has been developed for the –He collision system. The PES was developed with the coupled cluster, that is, the CCSD(T)-F12b method in combination with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The 2D PES has a global minimum with a value of −239.19 . The analytical fitting of this 2D PES is done to obtain the radial coefficients, that give cross-sections for molecule till collisional energy range of 300 . The rate coefficients are achieved for the first 20 rotational transitions. An important trend is observed when comparing the de-excitation rate coefficients at different temperatures. For transitions below , a preference for odd values is evident, which can be attributed to the anisotropy in the PES of the –He collision. This similar behavior is observed for –He collision. However, for higher transitions, a strong propensity for even transitions emerges. The results obtained in the present work will enable us to estimate the abundance of in the ISM under non-local thermal equilibrium conditions.},

This is done using the recently presented dynamic radii adjustment for continuum solvation ( Draco ) scheme. This allows for efficient geometry optimization and reasonable numerical Hessian calculations. The derived gradient is implemented in ORCA, and therefore is easily applicable. The derivation and implementation is validated by comparing analytical and numerical gradients and testing geometry optimizations on a diverse test set, including small organic compounds, metal-organic complexes, and highly charged species. We additionally test the continuity of the potential energy surface using an example where very strong changes in the radii occur.

These methods are applied to investigate the mechanism behind the transition mutation from guanine:cytosine (G:C) to adenine:thymine (A:T) in DNA containing O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) lesions. The mutagenicity of O6-MeG has long been debated, with various geometric and energetic factors proposed. Using TS/TB and TS/TB-EDA, we compare the electronic structures of damaged and undamaged base pairs at the mutation site during DNA replication, emphasizing the energetic components that influence base pair binding. Our analysis explores the strengths of individual orbital interactions, such as -bonds and hydrogen bonds, as well as decomposes the total binding energy between DNA bases into the physical components. We find that the electronic structure of the O6-MeG lesion closely resembles that of A rather than G, while the O6-MeG:T pair exhibits energetic and geometric characteristics similar to A:T. This similarity suggests the explanation for the polymerase's preference for pairing O6-MeG with T. The obtained results are consistent with experimental data and provide insights into the high O6-MeG:T mismatch rate observed in O6-MeG damaged DNA sequences.},

The nature of the interactions is analyzed using molecular electrostatic potential maps, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, delocalization indices, and electron density difference maps. In the presence of LiH, NH 3 molecules engage in several types of noncovalent interactions, namely, hydrogen bonding (HB), lithium bonding (LB), and dihydrogen bonding (DHB). The LiH:NH 3 dimer is stabilized primarily through Li···N interactions. The role of these noncovalent interactions in complexes having more than one NH 3 molecule, for example, hetero-trimer, tetramer, and pentamer structures, is also examined. Increasing the number of NH 3 molecules enhances the number of HB sites. Additionally, the strengths of LB and DHB interactions associated with HB-bonded NH 3 molecules increase. Interaction energy estimates and many-body energy decomposition analysis suggest that increasing NH 3 molecules increases cooperativity, approaching ~10% of the total interaction's energy in the case of tetramers and pentamers.},

  abstract     = {Residue interaction networks determine various characteristics of proteins, such as the folding rate, thermostability, and allosteric process. The interactions between residues can be described by distances or energies. The former is simple but less rigorous. The latter is complicated but more precise, especially when considering the solvent effect. In this work, we apply an existing energy decomposition method based on the Poisson–Boltzmann equation solver. The calculation is especially accelerated on GPU for higher performance. In four formal applications, the constructed interaction energy (IE) network shows good results. First, it is found that the protein folding rate has a stronger correlation with the energy-based contact order than the distance-based contact order. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is 0.839 versus 0.784 on a dataset of non-two-state proteins. Second, we find that most thermophilic proteins have lower IEs than mesophilic proteins. The IE in solvent acts as an indicator to evaluate the thermostabilities of proteins. Third, we use the IE network to predict the key residues in the formation of the insulin dimer. Most key residues are in agreement with the findings in previous alanine-scanning experiments. Lastly, we propose a novel method (called APFN) to predict the allosteric pathway based on the IE network. The method gives the same allosteric pathway for CheY protein as in previous nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. On the whole, the IE network in the solvent has been demonstrated to be reliable in describing the characteristics embedded in protein structures.},

This substructure can assume various ring puckering chair and skew-boat conformations, and can thereby impact glycan conformations relevant for biomolecular structure and signaling. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) provides a wealth of experimental glycan structural biology data that can be useful in the development and validation of molecular mechanics force fields for these molecules. However, these experimental data are typically from solvent-depleted crystalline environments at very low temperatures, in contrast to biological conditions that are aqueous and near ambient temperature, which is the regime targeted by biomolecular force fields. To determine if these PDB X-ray crystal data can be of utility as references for carbohydrate force fields, we compared ring puckering conformations from these experimental data to both vacuum and explicit aqueous solvent puckering free energy data from extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) molecular dynamics simulations using the previously validated CHARMM36 force field. We found that, for monosaccharides that are not charged (glucose, N -acetylglucosamine, galactose, N -acetylgalactosamine, mannose, xylose, and fucose), both the vacuum and aqueous simulation puckering preferences strongly correlate with PDB data, and therefore with each other. In contrast, all charged monosaccharides that were considered (the conjugate bases of N -acetylneuraminic acid, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid) had puckering preferences correlating with PDB data only in aqueous simulations and not in vacuum simulations. These results suggest that comparing puckering preferences from aqueous simulations to PDB X-ray crystal puckering conformation data can be a valid and useful component of carbohydrate force field development and validation.},

Previous studies have largely focused on enzymatic systems, which have made it difficult to distinguish the effects of QM region size and conformational sampling from other factors including QM-MM boundary artifacts and the boundary effects. This study uses the difference-based adaptive solvation QM/MM method to investigate the tautomerization reactions of alanine and aspartate in explicit solvent. The choice of computationally tractable systems enables the decoupling of QM region size effects from other factors and a direct comparison of free energy surfaces with potential energy surfaces (PESs). The results show that (1) it is crucial to properly account for thermal fluctuations along the reaction pathways, and (2) free energy surfaces converge rapidly with increasing QM region size, whereas charge transfer requires a slightly larger QM region to achieve convergence. These findings are expected to guide future studies of enzymatic systems and other complex systems where QM/MM methods are applied.},

The acyl transfer reaction occurs between the activated carboxylate group of the fatty acid and the free hydroxyl group on the glycerol backbone of DAG. However, how the two substrates enter DGAT1's catalytic reaction chamber and interact with DGAT1 remains elusive. This study aims to explore the structural basis of DGAT1's substrate recognition by investigating each substrate's pathway to the reaction chamber. Using a human DGAT1 cryo-EM structure in complex with an oleoyl-CoA substrate, we designed two different all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation systems: DGAT1 away (both acyl-CoA and DAG away from the reaction chamber) and DGAT1 bound (acyl-CoA bound in and DAG away from the reaction chamber). Our DGAT1 away simulations reveal that acyl-CoA approaches the reaction chamber via interactions with positively charged residues in transmembrane helix 7. DGAT1 bound simulations show DAGs entering into the reaction chamber from the cytosol leaflet. The bound acyl-CoA's fatty acid lines up with the headgroup of DAG, which appears to be competent to TAG formation. We then converted them into TAG and coenzyme (CoA) and used adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations to explore the egress pathways of the products. We identify their escape routes, which are aligned with their respective entry pathways. Visualization of the substrate and product pathways and their interactions with DGAT1 is expected to guide future experimental design to better understand DGAT1 structure and function.},

We identified (Z)-3-(2-phenylhydrazineylidene)benzofuran-2(3H)-one ( P ) during the recrystallization of (E)-2-(2,2-dichloro-1-(phenyldiazenyl)vinyl)phenol using a 96% ethanol solution. The mechanism of the unexpected substrate conversion leading to P is investigated using density functional calculations. The computations revealed that ethanol is required to initiate the reaction via TS1E , which involves a concerted deprotonation of ethanol by the basic diaza group of the substrate and an ethoxy group attacking the electrophilic center (Cl 2 C), with an energy barrier of 28.3 kcal/mol. The resulting intermediate ( I1E ) is calculated to be unstable and can yield a cyclic chloroacetal adduct with a lower energy barrier of 2.2 kcal/mol via the ring-closure transition state ( TS2E ). In the absence of water, the next steps are impossible because water is required to cleave the ether bond, yielding P . A small amount of water (4% of the recrystallization solvent) can promote further transformation of I2E via the transition states TS3E (∆ G ‡ = 11.1 kcal/mol) and TS4E (∆ G ‡ = 10.5 kcal/mol). A comparison of the ethanol/water- and only water-promoted free energy profiles shows that the presence of ethanol is crucial for lowering the energy barriers (by about 5 kcal/mol) for the initial two steps leading to the cyclic chloroacetal ( I2E ), whereas water is then required to initiate product formation.},

In this work, the electronically excited states of radical cations of acenes from naphthalene to dodecacene are investigated using algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) methods and different time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) exchange-correlation kernels. The performance of the employed ADC methods and different DFT functionals is assessed using experimental values as benchmarks. Using ADC, it is then shown that excited states typical for neutral acenes are retained in their radical cation counterparts, while additional states emerge due to excitations into the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO). Finally, the evolution of the excitation energies in neutral as well as cationic acenes with increasing length is investigated using TD-DFT, where a special focus lies on the correct description of longer acenes using single-reference methods.},

In this work, the entropy effect using a formulaic entropy can be computed from one single structure according to variations in the polar and non-polar solvents accessible surface areas and the count of rotatable bonds in ligands. It was incorporated into MM/P(G)BSA methods to enhance their performance. Extensive benchmarking reveals that the integration of formulaic entropy systematically elevates the performance of both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA without incurring additional computational expenses. In addition, we found the inclusion of dispersion can deteriorate the correlation performance ( R p ) but reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of both MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA. Notably, MM/PBSA_S, including the formulaic entropy but excluding the dispersion, surpasses all other MM/P(G)BSA methods across a spectrum of datasets. Our investigation furnishes a valuable and practical MM/P(G)BSA method, optimizing binding free energy calculations for a variety of biological systems.},

  abstract     = {The Diels–Alder (DA) reaction between hexachlorocyclopentadiene and 1,2-dichloroethylene has been studied using the Molecular Electron Density Theory (MEDT) through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6−31G(d) level. The electronic structure of the reagents has been characterized through the electron localization function (ELF) and the conceptual DFT (CDFT). The DA reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with 1,2-dichloroethylene proceeds via a synchronous or low asynchronous one-step mechanism. Based on the conducted research, a two-step mechanism with a biradical intermediate was completely ruled out. Bonding Evolution Theory (BET) study of the DA reaction shows that this reaction is topologically characterized by nine different phases. The reaction begins with the rupture of the double bonds in substrate molecules. Formation of the first C  C single bond takes place in phase VII, while the second C  C single bond takes place in phase IX. Formation of these two single bonds takes place by sharing the nonbonding electron densities of the two pairs of pseudoradical centers. In addition, this study evaluates some ligands as potential HIV-1 inhibitors. Docking results identified 5 and 5-F as the most promising candidates, surpassing AZT in theoretical affinity. ADME analysis revealed limitations in solubility and absorption for compounds 3 , 4 , and 5 , while 5-F showed better solubility but low absorption. Toxicity concerns around 5-F suggest the need for risk management, while the other compounds require further safety assessment.},

This study introduces the Computational Chemistry Parameter (CCPE), providing extraction, formatting, and presentation of the computational data obtained from Gaussian and VEDA programs. By integrating outputs from the widely used GAUSSIAN and VEDA programs, CCPE provides an efficient, user-friendly solution for extracting and organizing key data such as vibrational modes, frequency assignments, optimization parameters, and molecular orbital data. This tool significantly reduces the time required for these tasks from several days to a matter of minutes, while minimizing the likelihood of errors. The CCPE software, developed using the C# programming language, emphasizes reliability and adaptability, offering researchers a practical means of handling complex computational data. Through its ability to generate publication-ready outputs in widely accepted formats, CCPE aims to enhance productivity and data accuracy, presenting a transformative step in the field of computational chemistry.},

Moreover, the changes in the bond lengths (∆BL), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), and localized orbital locator purely contributed by π-orbitals (LOL-π) analyses were performed to study the hyperconjugative aromaticity upon anion accepting. The findings indicate that the anions are connected to the CPDB structure through the electron deficiency of the B atoms and can induce the aromaticity via Schleyer's hyperconjugative aromaticity to the CPBD's ring.

In this study, we employed the FP-LAPW method to explore the structural, electronic, and optical properties of Na 2 LiZF 6 (Z = Ir and Rh). Our findings confirm the stability of the cubic phase through a Goldschmidt tolerance factor of 0.99 and negative formation energies of −3.34 Ry for Na 2 LiIrF 6 and −3.22 Ry for Na 2 LiRhF 6 . Additionally, phonon dispersion analysis verifies their dynamic stability. Mechanical analysis indicates that these materials are structurally robust, with bulk moduli of 84.21 and 80.48 GPa, while their ductile nature is supported by Pugh's ratios of 2.21 and 2.41, respectively. From an electronic perspective, both compounds exhibit indirect bandgaps of 4.05 and 3.98 eV, making them suitable for UV applications. Optical studies further reveal strong UV absorption, with static dielectric constants of 1.42 and 1.50, along with refractive indices ( n (0)) of 1.19 and 1.22.

We found that DFT calculations with different functionals underestimate TAMRA maximum UV absorption peak by ~100 nm, resulting in the maximum at ca. 450 nm instead of the experimental value of ca. 550 nm. However, incorporating MD simulation snapshots of TAMRA in water, the UV maximum peak shifts and is in close agreement with the experimental results due to the rotation of TAMRA N(CH 3 ) 2 groups, effectively captured in MD simulations. The method is used to estimate the UV absorption spectra of TAMRA-labeled peptides, matching experimental values.},

Further simulations reveal that the molecule shows ultrafast internal conversion in the triplet manifold, similar to its singlet dynamics. Apart from these decay processes in the Franck-Condon region, this molecule can display thiol proton transfer via multiple singlet states due to low barrier energies along the reaction coordinate.

  abstract     = {Computational investigations of Inverted Singlet-Triplet (INVEST) emitters often rely on ADC(2) and TD-DFT excitation energies (EEs) obtained with the vertical approximation. Here, we first considered several cyclazine derivatives and examine the sensitivity of vertical EEs (VEEs) as well as singlet-triplet gaps, ΔE S1T1 gaps, to the level at which the ground state (S 0 ) structure was optimized. For cyclazine, VEEs and vertical gaps from ADC(2) or TD-DFT are spread over a narrow range (< 0.064 eV) whether the S 0 structure is optimized with various DFT, CCSD, and RI-MP2 methods. However, for asymmetric cyclazines, depending on the protocol for optimizing S 0 structures, not only are VEEs spread over a substantially wider range (up to 0.75 eV) but so are vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps (up to 0.30 eV), leading to cases where, with different S 0 structures, one obtains positive vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps or significantly negative gaps. We relate this behavior to the introduction of significant asymmetry and bond-length variations in the cyclazine derivatives, formed by ligand functionalization or modification of the cyclazine core. On a more positive note, adiabatic EEs (AEEs) and adiabatic ΔE S1T1 gaps display significantly lower sensitivity (7–30× less) to the geometry optimization protocols than their vertical analogs. Crucially, for cyclazine, the M06-HF functional with 100% non-local exchange provides the closest S 0 geometry to available CCSD(T) data. We show that this effect exists also for other frameworks (e.g., azulene, pentaazaphenalene, and non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons) that have been considered for the INVEST property, with VEEs spread over a broader range of up to 1.19 eV and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps over a range of 0.62 eV. For INVEST emitters, it is therefore extremely important to judiciously choose the computational protocol for optimizing ground state geometries, in computing VEEs and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps.},

In this case, the cofactor has a heme with a lysine as the proximal ligand and a charged nearby arginine. The role of a tyrosine, which is also close, has been less clear. There are also four bis-histidine-ligated hemes involved in the electron transfers. CcNiR has been studied before, using essentially the same methods as here. However, the mechanism is very complicated, involving six reductions, and quite different results for the mechanism have been obtained here. For example, the tyrosine has here been found to be redox active in the final step when ammonia is produced. Also, the arginine has here been found to stay protonated throughout the mechanism, which is different from what was found in the previous study. The present results are in very good agreement with experimental findings and are, therefore, another case where the methodology has been shown to work very well.

However, in high-entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d -band center should be treated as a response variable in machine-learning models. We calculated the d -band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d -band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element-based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater-type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.},

The dataset, containing 300 randomly selected elementary gas-phase reactions, was assembled using accurate DFT (ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP) values for activation energies E a from a database alongside semi-empirical computations. For accurate predictions, this approach required the inclusion of both physical organic and geometric/empirical descriptors in the training procedure. The best two ML models demonstrated efficient E a prediction capability, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.314 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.992 (Model 3) and (MAE) of 1.949 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.979 (Model 2) in validation tests. Notably, this performance approaches the threshold of “chemical accuracy” of 1 kcal mol −1 . Model's 3 robustness was tested across the reaction types present in the dataset, demonstrating its ability in properly predicting activation energies, which is critical for the study and optimization of chemical processes.},

  abstract     = {This study benchmarks the nuclear electronic orbital density functional theory (NEO-DFT) method for a set of molecules that is larger than in previous studies. The focus is on proton affinity predictions to assess the influences of computational parameters. NEO-DFT incorporates nuclear quantum effects for protons involved in protonation processes. Using a test set of 72 molecules with experimental proton affinities as reference, we evaluated various exchange-correlation functionals, finding that B3LYP-based functionals deliver the most accurate results. Among the tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP performs the best with an MAD value of 6.2 kJ/mol with respect to experimental data. In NEO-DFT, electron-proton correlation (epc) functionals were assessed, with LDA-type epc17-2 yielding comparable results to the GGA-type epc19 functional. Compared to traditional DFT (MAD value of 31.6 kJ/mol), which treats nuclei classically, NEO-DFT provides enhanced accuracy for proton affinities when electron-proton correlation is included. Regarding basis sets, the def2-QZVP electronic basis set achieved the highest accuracy with an MAD value of 5.0 kJ/mol, though at a higher computational cost compared to def2-TZVP and def2-SVP, while nuclear basis sets showed minimal impact on proton affinity accuracy and no consistent trend. Overall, this study demonstrates NEO-DFT's efficacy in addressing nuclear quantum effects for proton affinity predictions, providing guidance on optimal parameter selection for future NEO-DFT applications.},

  abstract     = {With the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs), its applications in chemistry have become increasingly widespread, especially in the prediction of various molecular properties. This work introduces the X2-PEC method, that is, the second generalization of the X1 series of ANN methods developed in our group, utilizing pair energy correction (PEC). The essence of the X2 model lies in its feature vector construction, using overlap integrals and core Hamiltonian integrals to incorporate physical and chemical information into the feature vectors to describe atomic interactions. It aims to enhance the accuracy of low-rung density functional theory (DFT) calculations, such as those from the widely used BLYP/6-31G(d) or B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) methods, to the level of top-rung DFT calculations, such as those from the highly accurate doubly hybrid XYGJ-OS/GTLarge method. Trained on the QM9 dataset, X2-PEC excels in predicting the atomization energies of isomers such as C 6 H 8 and C 4 H 4 N 2 O with varying bonding structures. The performance of the X2-PEC model on standard enthalpies of formation for datasets such as G2-HCNOF, PSH36, ALKANE28, BIGMOL20, and HEDM45, as well as a HCNOF subset of BH9 for reaction barriers, is equally commendable, demonstrating its good generalization ability and predictive accuracy, as well as its potential for further development to achieve greater accuracy. These outcomes highlight the practical significance of the X2-PEC model in elevating the results from lower-rung DFT calculations to the level of higher-rung DFT calculations through deep learning.},

Not only for unraveling important features of cancer development, a disease that affects the lives of many people worldwide, but also to understand drug–target interactions in a more real scenario, which can help to combat this disease. Therefore, aiming to contribute to new strategies against cancer, the present work used this approach to investigate the spectroscopy of 2-(2′-hydroxy-4′-aminophenyl)benzothiazole (HABT) when interacting with the PI3K enzyme, a widely associated target for the mentioned illness. The study consisted of evaluating the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) performance of HABT, in spectroscopic terms, when interacting with the PI3K enzyme in a local nonequilibrium regime. This scenario could be considered by investigating the metastable states of HABT in this system. From this, it was possible to observe that the ESIPT performance of HABT considerably differs when comparing the solution and protein environments, where 63% have appropriate geometry in the protein environment, against 97% in the aqueous environment. Thus, from an entirely theoretical methodology, the present work provides insights when modeling biological systems and contributes significantly to a better comprehension of promising probes for cancer diagnosis.},

For an extremely large steric repulsion in the covalent form, the ion pair can become the most stable form, even in the gas phase. DFT and CASSCF calculations indicate that the tert-butylfulleride anion and the tris[1-(5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethylazulenyl)]-cyclopropenylium cation form an ion pair. This is the first study of this ion pair, although it is the building block of a salt that has already been synthesized. DFT results indicate that this ion pair is considerably more stable than its covalent counterpart. Nevertheless, several properties of the ionic and covalent forms are similar.

The resulting formulation enables a solution with “a priori” localized orbitals. In the current contribution, we have explored this still unexplored possibility. Starting molecular orbitals were either localized using the Pipek-Mezey procedure or via an incomplete Cholesky decomposition of the density matrix. The Hartree-Fock solution was obtained within a VCCS iterative procedure, with the starting localized molecular orbitals used for the creation of the reference and the singly excited determinants. The same localized basis was kept in each iteration. For a series of medium-sized molecules, we have investigated the convergence behavior of the iterative procedure together with the sparsity of the single-excitation amplitude vector and the corresponding density matrix expressed in the localized basis.},

However, their physical meaning remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. It is the purpose of this work to shed new light on this issue. The main thesis developed here is that de-excitations are not a peculiarity of TDDFT but that they are a more fundamental property of the underlying wave functions reflecting how electrons are excited between partially occupied orbitals. The paraquinodimethane (pQDM) molecule is chosen as a convenient model system whose open-shell character can be modulated via twisting of its methylene groups. Using the one-electron transition density matrix as a rigorous basis for our analysis, we highlight qualitative and quantitative parallels in the way that de-excitations are reflected in multireference wave function and TDDFT computations. As a physically observable consequence, we highlight a lowering of the transition dipole moment that derives from destructive interference between the excitation and de-excitation contributions. In summary, we hope that this work will shed new light on formal and practical aspects regarding the application of TDDFT to excited-state computations, especially of diradicaloid systems.},

In 1990, a paper was published in which the physical causes for the rotational barrier in ethane, that is, the well-known finding that the potential energy in the eclipsed form is slightly higher than in the staggered form, appears as a consequence of a lowering of the nuclear-electron attraction and not as a greater electronic repulsion in the eclipsed form. Surprisingly, this finding has practically not found its way neither into the textbook literature nor into the scientific discourse. Here we will show, by a careful analysis of the components to the total energy and their dependence on the geometry of the molecule, that the kinetic energy of the electrons and the virial theorem play the decisive role.

We have taken into account a cluster with two layers of Pd and and atoms per layer (2L3 and 2L4, respectively) or with three layers and atoms per layer (3L3).

For 3L3, an indirect charge-transfer mechanism, occurring after 50 fs and inducing a hole injection into HCOO, has also been found. Moreover, we also used a tailored pulse to populate the antibonding molecular orbital localized on the C-H bond for 3L3.},

Our calculations reveal a step-wise chain propagation mechanism where the alkene product of each step reacts with a ligand-gold-alkyne complex, leading to the sequential addition of cyclobutene units. We demonstrate that electron-withdrawing substituents on the alkynes, such as chlorine, facilitate the dissociation of the gold catalyst (PMe 3 Au + ) from the cyclobutene adduct, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Solvent effects are also shown to significantly influence the reaction energetics. This finding highlights the significant impact of alkyne substitution on the catalytic cycle. The inherent exothermicity of ladderene formation, coupled with their unique structural features, suggests their potential for storing energy in the form of “covalently condensed acetylene”.},

Four distinct minima in the same conical intersection seam were discovered, serving as nonradiative decay channels. The aqueous environment slows photoisomerization and lowers its quantum yields and changes the structures near the conical intersection seam. Substituent position and electronegativity significantly impact the isomerization kinetics by altering energy gaps between MECIs and the S 1 state at the Franck-Condon region.

  abstract     = {Protein structural fluctuations, measured by Debye-Waller factors or B-factors, are known to be closely associated with protein flexibility and function. Theoretical approaches have also been developed to predict B-factor values, which reflect protein flexibility. Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of low-dimensional manifolds defined by kernel functions, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine-learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor predictions.},

We have first deduced the missing interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system within the SPICA/SDK CG force-field (CG-FF). By monitoring the electron density profiles, the orientational order parameter, and reproducing the all-atom MD-derived free energy for the insertion of ethanol from the bulk aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core of the POPC-CHOL lipid bilayer, we successfully determined all the missing non-bonding interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system. The proposed force field was applied to investigate the effect of ethanol at various concentrations on unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC and cholesterol. It was found that 40 mol% or more concentration of ethanol is required to disintegrate or rupture the POPC-CHOL vesicle membranes. While cholesterol offers some resilience against the detrimental effects of ethanol, we still observe an increase in vesicle size (swelling) and a contraction in the bilayer thickness (thinning) as ethanol concentration rises from 0 to 30 mol%. At ethanol concentrations exceeding 30 mol%, the vesicles become increasingly susceptible to disintegration due to enhanced penetration of ethanol and water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membranes.},

  abstract     = {A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) has been carried out to investigate its key photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer capable of generating singlet oxygen. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods have been used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin–orbit couplings (SOCs), respectively, in a model (mono-iodinated BODIPY) molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), method to this and similar molecules. Subsequently, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), possibly within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), using several exchange-correlation functionals has been tested on I-BODIPY against ADC(2), both employing a basis set with a two-component pseudopotential on the iodine atoms. Finally, the magnitudes of SOC between excited electronic states of all types found have thoroughly been discussed using the Slater–Condon rules applied to an arbitrary one-electron one-center effective spin–orbit Hamiltonian. The geometry dependence of SOCs between the lowest-lying states has also been addressed. Based on these investigations, the TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP approaches have been selected as the methods of choice for the subsequent nuclear ensemble approach absorption spectra simulations and mixed quantum-classical trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. Two bright states in the visible spectrum of I-BODIPY have been found, exhibiting a redshift of the main peak with respect to unsubstituted BODIPY caused by the iodine substituents. Excited-state MD simulations including both non-adiabatic effects and SOCs have been performed to investigate the relaxation processes in I-BODIPY after its photoexcitation to the state. The TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a time scale comparable to internal conversions and that after an initial phase of triplet population growth a “saturation” is reached where the ratio of the net triplet to singlet populations is about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 is in qualitative agreement with the previously reported experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99 0.06.},

Among the available methods, force fields such as MMFF94 are extensively used to calculate molecular potential energies, especially for small organic molecules. However, current implementations of MMFF94 are primarily available in commercial software or as closed-source modules. Open-source packages often offer limited functionality and lack extensibility. This paper introduces JMolecular Energy (JME), a novel, open-source Java library designed to implement MMFF94 with a robust and extendable API (Application Programming Interface) that allows for access to individual energy components. Leveraging the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK), JME provides a modular framework for potential energy calculation and facilitates functionalities previously absent in CDK, such as 3D conformation energy minimization. Additionally, JME establishes a framework for tailoring force field energy terms for various applications and facilitates the integration of custom-built force fields.},

Since different electronic structures are possible for these high valent systems, we perform DFT calculations coupled to CCSD(T) ones using the DLPNO-CCSD(T) scheme.

The band-edge correction and FNV correction accurately determine the defect formation energies of the Y i defects in different charge states. The presence of transition energy levels in the band gap may indicate that the Y i defect has a significant impact on the properties of the FE-KDP. The +3 charged Y i defects are more stable. The electronic properties in the 2p orbital mainly contribute to the defect states in the band gap, which provides the possibility of multiphoton transition of electrons. New transparent absorption bands near 3.47 eV (357 nm) and 5.66 eV (219 nm) were calculated in PE-KDP, and the absorption bands caused by Y i defects and strong electron–phonon coupling under the FE-KDP structure showed that the light in the wavelength bands near 5.09 eV (244 nm) and 5.79 eV (214 nm) below the phase transition temperature (123 K) damaged the KDP crystal. The distortion of atoms near the defects indicates that Y i defects may be accompanied by intrinsic defects. The calculated values are highly consistent with the critical absorption observed at 355 nm in the experiment and the new absorption weak at 230 nm produced in the crystal after low-temperature X-ray irradiation, which suggests that the Y defect may be the key factor affecting the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the KDP crystal.},

We investigated the electronic structures of the tetravalent uranium benzyl (Bn) complex U(CH 2 Ph) 4 and its derivatives U(2-CH 2 (NC 5 H 4 )) 4 , U( o -OMeBn) 4 , U( m -OMeBn) 4 , and the bonding nature between the uranium atom and methylene carbon atom (U–C me ) using scalar-relativistic quantum chemical calculations. The structures of the four uranium benzyl derivatives identify that the electronic structures are not sensitive to meta -OMe substitution, while they are significantly sensitive to the ortho -OMe and pyridine due to the coordination of O and N to the uranium atom. The U–C me bonds have highly polarized σ-bonding with partial covalency, which are predominantly composed of U 6d and 5f orbitals. Moreover, U 6d orbitals are favored for the U–C me bonds compared with U 5f orbitals. Furthermore, there are no additional π interactions in the U( o -OMeBn) 4 and the corresponding U–C me bonds appear the strongest covalent character among the four U(IV) system. The energy decomposition analysis suggests that the electrostatic interaction plays a dominant role between uranium and ligands. Finally, the complexes U(2-CH 2 (NC 5 H 4 )) 4 and U( o -OMeBn) 4 are the most thermodynamically accessible among the four complexes based on the binding energies. This study improves our understanding of tetravalent uranium benzyl derivatives bearing uranium-saturated carbon bondings.},

  abstract     = {The infrared (IR) spectrum of meta -fluorothiophenol (mFTP) isolated in a low-temperature N 2 matrix was recorded and interpreted with the aid of B3LYP vibrational frequency calculations for both cis and trans conformers. Then, photochemical transformations in the matrix-isolated compound were triggered through UV–Vis laser irradiations and their outcomes were monitored by IR spectroscopy. Upon excitation at λ = 285 nm, thiol-to-thione phototautomerization was identified as the sole reaction pathway, leading to the formation of three thione isomers. Among them, the ortho -isomer where the hydrogen atom reattaches to the fluorine-substituted side of the aromatic ring was identified as the predominant photoproduct. Identification of the photoproducts was confirmed by comparing the emerging experimental spectra with the IR absorptions predicted for the candidate structures. The photoreaction was found to be reversible, as irradiation at λ = 405 nm partially restored the reactant. The experimental results were complemented with the application of multireference/multiconfigurational (CASSCF, CASPT2, MR-CIS) and TD-DFT (TD-M062X, ωB97XD, and τ-HCTHhyb) methods to investigate the excited state properties of mFTP, including the simulation of its UV photoabsorption spectra. A comparative analysis of the results obtained by the different methods was performed. This combined experimental and theoretical approach provided valuable insights into the photochemical behavior and electronic structure of fluorinated thiophenols.},

  abstract     = {2-Carbamido-1,3-indanedione (CAID) is a fluorescent compound, existing in two tautomeric forms: A and B . Spectroscopic features of CAID suggest that the tautomeric equilibrium is possible both in ground and excited state. To further elucidate this, measurements of UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded in various solvents. The ground and low-lying excited states of CAID are modeled at SOS-MP2/ADC(2) computational level. The two tautomers A and B coexist in ground state with the amount of A amounting to 90% and a dynamic equilibrium is established. However, in all excited states the tautomer B is more stable and its amount is almost 100%. Along with fluorescence from the first excited state of both tautomers, a rare case of breaking Kasha's rule—fluorescence from the third excited state of the two tautomers—has been observed. A scheme is proposed to explain the photophysical processes and photoreactions of CAID in ethanol solution.},

Therefore, in this work, to explore emergent sensor materials, 3 d -metal dimers-doped hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) structures were investigated employing auxiliary density functional theory (ADFT) as novel CO and NO gas sensors. Firstly, the stabilities of Co 2 , Ni 2 , and Cu 2 dimers deposited on defective h-BN were determined. Then, sensitivities of 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures towards the NO and CO gases were investigated. It was found that the interaction energies of these 3 d -metal dimers embedded on defective h-BN are higher than those deposited on pristine h-BN structure, which indicates that the 3 d -metal dimers exhibit good stability on defective h-BN. Moreover, this work demonstrated that the CO and NO adsorption energies on 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures are higher than those computed in the literature for pristine h-BN structure. Consequently, the here considered 3 d -metal dimers-doped h-BN structures can be good candidates for toxic CO and NO gas detection.},

Multi-step mechanisms are proposed, where the activation energies of the rate-determining step are strongly lowered compared to gas phase reaction, exhibiting, however, a unique step. Also, these reactions are viewed to be favored thermodynamically in the presence of these catalysts and also in solvents, in particular in methanol. We suggest thus the use of NaBr and MgO nanoclusters for these reactions. Besides, the present findings allow to explain the experimentally observed regioselectivity of carbonylation of aziridines reactions, where CO is added on the more substituted C of aziridine three-membered ring. In sum, our work should motivate the use of such ecofriendly catalysts for carbonylation reactions without using transition metal catalysts.},

We used five different MD systems, ranging in size from about 82,000 to 204 million atoms, and evaluated their performance using two different Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries, Intel-MPI and Open-MPI. The largest system showed near-perfect strong scaling up to 512 nodes or 65,536 cores, maintaining a parallel efficiency above 0.9 even at the highest level of parallelization. Energy efficiency for a given number of nodes was generally equal to or slightly better than parallel efficiency. We achieved peak performances of 687 ns/d for the 82k atom system, 116 ns/d for the 53M atom system, and about 35 ns/d for the largest 204M atom system.

Polarizability and long-range LJ interactions increase the membrane surface viscosity, which decreases the translational diffusion constants. Simulated diffusion constants for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) extrapolated to infinite system size agree well with experiment for Drude2023, but overestimate experiment by 60% (on average) and a factor of 2.5 for C36/LJ-PME and C36, respectively. The relaxation time of lipid wobble is described about equally well by C36/LJ-PME and Drude2023, as consistent with the hexadecane viscosity for the FF, and both are more accurate than C36. Hence, physical improvements in the FF, which slowed down these dynamic processes led to better agreement with experiment. Lastly, bilayers containing 10 influenza fusion peptides and high fractions of lysolipids (which are known to accelerate pore formation) were simulated with C36 and Drude2023. Pore formation rates were comparable for the two FF for the bilayers with 80% and 90% lysolipid. However, while no pores formed in 24 μs (including a single 20 μs trajectory) in the 70% lysolipid with C36, 4 of 15 replicates formed pores in less than 1 μs with Drude. While the pathway to poration is qualitatively similar for the additive and polarizable FF for the systems studied, Drude2023 should be considered for quantitative studies of pore formation, and, in some cases, will accelerate the process.},

  abstract     = {Diphenylamine (DPA) derivatives, used as antioxidants in rubber-based products, inhibit autoxidation by donating hydrogen atoms to peroxyl radicals. Octanol–water partition coefficient (LogK ow ), an antioxidant index, helps predict their distribution in hydrophobic polymer matrices. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the structure of DPA derivatives and their antioxidant activities, using machine learning with quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) and quantum mechanics (QM). The structure of DPA derivatives was optimized using Density Functional Theory and analyzed for molecular properties. The QSAR models were trained using important descriptors identified through permutation importance. Among the models developed, the Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) showed the best performance, with R 2 of 0.983 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.642 for the test set. SHAP analysis revealed that molecular weight and electronic properties significantly influenced LogK ow predictions. For instance, a higher molecular weight was associated with increased LogK ow , and a higher positive charge of C2 correlated with higher LogK ow predictions. Consequently, the two potent compounds (D1 and D2) were designed based on QSAR model guidance. The GBR model predicted LogK ow values of 9.789 and 7.102 for D1 and D2, respectively, which are higher than the training compounds in the model. To gain molecular insight, the quantum chemical calculations with M062X/6–311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31G(d,p) were performed to investigate the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE). The results showed that D1 (79.50 kcal/mol) and D2 (72.43 kcal/mol) exhibited lower BDEs than the reference compounds, suggesting that the designed compounds have the potential for enhanced antioxidant activity. In addition, the antioxidant reaction mechanism was studied by using M062X/6–311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31G(d,p) which found that the hydrogen atom transfer is the key step, where D1 and D2 showed activation energy barriers of 10.38 and 6.29 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to reference compounds of R3 (10.39 kcal/mol), R1 (10.40 kcal/mol), and R2 (18.26 kcal/mol). Therefore, our findings demonstrate that integrating QSAR with quantum chemical calculations can effectively guide the design of DPA derivatives with improved antioxidant properties.},

  abstract     = {The Gibbs energies of protonation (Δ G p ) and the basic photophysical properties for single-benzene fluorophores (SBFs) containing guanidine and/or amino subunits and the changes that occur upon protonation were modeled by the TDDFT approach. The calculated Δ G p energies for amino SBFs in the S 1 state range from 985 to 1100 kJ mol −1 which are below the values for guanidines. The protonation of the guanidine-SBFs induces a hypsochromic shift of the absorption and the emission maxima with the Stokes shift of > 100 nm in both cases. Isomerization through the ESIPT process is less probable than in amino-SBFs due to the unfavorable thermodynamics. Still, if it occurs, it leads to a strong red shift of the emission by > 150 nm. Aromaticity indices point to strong antiaromatic character of the examined guanidino-SBFs in the FC region which decreases upon geometrical relaxation and ESIPT. The excited state proton transfer occurs in guanidine-SBF/phenol complexes in the S 1 state, stabilizing CT states and fluorescence quenching.},

The protocol is applied to a model exciplex formed by oligo-p-phenylenes (OPPs) and triethylamine (TEA), which is of interest in the context of photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ . AIMD facilitates efficient sampling of the conformational space of OPP3 and OPP4 exciplexes with TEA, offering a dynamic alternative to previously employed static methods. The AIMD-based protocol successfully reproduces experimental emission spectra for OPP-TEA exciplexes, agreeing with previous computational and experimental findings. The results show that AIMD simulations provide an efficient means of sampling the conformational space of these exciplexes, requiring less user input and, in some instances, fewer computational resources than multiple excited-state optimizations initiated from user-specified initial structures. The study also evaluates the yield of intersystem crossing (ISC) using AIMD and Landau-Zener probability. The results suggest that ISC is a minor decay channel for OPP3 and OPP4. This work provides new insights into the structural flexibility and emission characteristics of OPP-TEA photoredox catalyst systems, potentially contributing to improved design strategies for organic chromophores in CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ reduction applications.},

Significant differences of the electron positions maximizing Ψ 2 $$ {\left|\Psi \right|}^2 $$ are uncovered and explained by the presence of hydrogen atoms in acetylene and by electron arrangements resulting from calculations of the nitrogen and carbon atoms. Moreover, insights into the electron delocalization of both molecules are gained by investigating electron exchange paths.

  abstract     = {The proteins expressed during the cell cycle determine cell function and ensure signaling pathway activation in response to environmental influences. Developments in structural biology, biophysics, and bioinformatics provide information on the structure and function of particular proteins including that on the structural changes in proteins due to post-translational modification (PTM) and amino acid substitutions (AAS), which is essential for understanding protein function and life cycle. These are PTMs and AASs that often modulate the function and alter the stability and localization of a protein in a cell. PSSKB is a platform that integrates all necessary tools for modeling the five common natural modifications and all canonical AASs in proteins. The available tools are not limited to the local database, so the user can select a protein from Uniprot ID or PDB ID. The result will be a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the modified structure, as well as an analysis of the changes in the performance of the intact and modified structures after energy minimization compared with the original structure, which not only makes it possible to evaluate AAS/PTM influence of on a protein's characteristics but also to use the 3D model for further studies. Additionally, PSSKB enables the user to search, align, overlay, and determine the exact coordinates of protein structure fragments. The search results are a set of structural motifs similar to the query and ranked by statistical significance. The platform is fully functional and publicly available at https://psskb.org/ . No registration is required to access the platform. A tutorial video can be found at https://psskb.org/page/about . Services provided on the platform are based on previously developed and published software.

We utilized the highly correlated, multireference methods configuration interaction with single and double excitations with and without the Pople correction for size-extensivity (MR-CISD+Q and MR-CISD) and averaged quadratic coupled cluster theory (MR-AQCC). CAS (8,7) and CAS (10,8) active spaces involving σ, σ*, π, and π* orbitals were employed along with the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets. The larger active space included the two electrons in the nonbonding sp 2 hybrid orbital on sulfur. We find that all didehydro isomers exist as planar, stable ground state singlets. The singlet-triplet (S-T) adiabatic gaps range from 15 to 25 kcal/mol while the vertical splittings are 21–35 kcal/mol. The 2,3 isomer has the lowest absolute ground state singlet energy and the largest adiabatic and vertical S-T splitting. The ground states of the 2,3-, and 2,5-didehydrothiophene isomers are predicted to exhibit the smallest and largest diradical character, respectively, based on their electronic structures, spin densities and bonding analysis. To our knowledge, no experimental excitation energies of any of the didehydrothiophene isomers are available, and our computed MR-AQCC/cc-pVTZ data are believed to be among the most accurate computed results. This extensive study shows a competitive performance between MR-AQCC and MR-CISD+Q.},

  abstract     = {Halogenated benzenes (HBs) are hydrophobic organic chemicals belonging to persistent organic pollutants. Owing to their persistence, they represent a serious problem in environmental contamination, specifically of soils and sediments. One of the most important physical processes determining the fate of HBs in soils is adsorption to main soil components such as soil organic matter and soil minerals. Smectites, layered clay minerals of the 2:1 type, are common minerals in clay-rich soils, of which montmorillonite (Mt) is a typical representative. This work focuses on a systematic modeling study of the adsorption mechanism of selected HBs interacting with the basal (001) surface, which is the dominant surface of Mt particles. The HB···Mt interactions were studied by means of a quantum chemical approach based on the density functional theory method. HBs were represented by five molecules, particularly C 6 F 6 , C 6 Cl 3 F 3 , C 6 Cl 6 , C 6 Br 3 Cl 3 , and C 6 Br 6 . In mixed HBs (C 6 Cl 3 F 3 and C 6 Br 3 Cl 3 ) Cl atoms are in 1,3,5 or rather 2,4,6 positions. The effect of a different cation type on adsorption was investigated for M + /M 2+ -Mt models with cations from alkali group (M + : Li, K, Na, Rb, Cs) and alkaline earth metal group (M 2+ : Mg, Ca, Sr., Ba). The calculations were also performed on the gas phase HB···M + /M 2+ complexes for comparison. Adsorption energies and distances of the main HB molecular plane from the Mt surface were calculated as a measure of the adsorption strength. The results showed that the strongest HB adsorption is for the Na + -Mt and Ca 2+ -Mt surfaces. The strongest affinity was observed for hexabromobenzene, while the weakest adsorption was found for hexafluorobenzene. The decomposition of the adsorption energy showed that its dominant component is dispersion energy and less important is the cation-π interaction. The calculated adsorption energies showed a good correlation with experimentally determined log K d values.},

  abstract     = {The ensemble properties of a system are obtained by averaging over the properties calculated for the various configurations it can have at a finite temperature and thus cannot be captured by a single molecular structure. Such ensemble properties are often important in material discovery. In designing new materials, the goal is to predict those ensemble structures that display a tailored property. However, mapping this average property to multiple structures introduces ambiguities and unreliable convergence in supervised machine learning. This presents a major obstacle in designing new materials. Here, we introduce a hybrid unsupervised/supervised learning method and demonstrate how to predict the structural parameters defining the conformers of a heterogeneous system, melanin, from its ensemble-averaged spectra. This also shows a new way to identify different structural fingerprints responsible for an ensemble-averaged superposition spectrum.},

  abstract     = {The standard Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model for molecular electrostatics assumes a sharp variation of the permittivity and salt concentration along the solute-solvent interface. The discontinuous field parameters are not only difficult numerically, but also are not a realistic physical picture, as it forces the dielectric constant and ionic strength of bulk in the near-solute region. An alternative to alleviate some of these issues is to represent the molecular surface as a diffuse interface, however, this also presents challenges. In this work we analyzed the impact of the shape of the interfacial variation of the field parameters in solvation and binding energy. However we used a hyperbolic tangent function tanh k p x $$ \left(\tanh \left({k}_px\right)\right) $$ to couple the internal and external regions, our analysis is valid for other definitions. Our methodology, restricted to the linear PB, was based on a coupled finite element (FEM) and boundary element (BEM) scheme that allowed us to have a special treatment of the permittivity and ionic strength in a bounded FEM region near the interface, while maintaining BEM elsewhere. Our results suggest that the shape of the function (represented by k p $$ {k}_p $$ ) has a large impact on solvation and binding energy. We saw that high values of k p $$ {k}_p $$ induce a high gradient on the interface, to the limit of recovering the sharp jump when k p → ∞ $$ {k}_p\to \infty $$ , presenting a numerical challenge where careful meshing is key. Using the FreeSolv database to compare with molecular dynamics, our calculations indicate that an optimal value of k p $$ {k}_p $$ for solvation energies was around 3. However, more challenging binding free energy tests make this conclusion more difficult, as binding showed to be very sensitive to small variations of k p $$ {k}_p $$ . In that case, optimal values of k p $$ {k}_p $$ ranged from 2 to 20.},

  abstract     = {Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent known for intercalating into DNA. However, the exact modes of DOX interactions with various DNA structures remain unclear. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we explored DOX interactions with DNA duplexes (dsDNA), G-quadruplex, and nucleosome. DOX predominantly stacks on terminal bases of dsDNA and occasionally binds into its minor groove. In the G-quadruplex, DOX stacks on planar tetrads but does not spontaneously intercalate into these structures. Potential of mean force calculations indicate that while intercalation is the most energetically favorable interaction mode for DOX in dsDNA, the process requires overcoming a significant energy barrier. In contrast, DOX spontaneously intercalates into bent nucleosomal DNA, due to the increased torsional stress. This preferential intercalation of DOX into regions with higher torsional stress provides new insights into its mechanism of action and underscores the importance of DNA tertiary and quaternary structures in therapies utilizing DNA intercalation.},

We develop decision trees to assess the likelihood of chirality-at-metal in coordination complexes with coordination numbers 4–9 with mono and bidentate ligands. Using binary decision rules based on shape, ligand type, and quantity, the trees classify complexes as chiral or achiral. The theoretical formalism employs stereoisomer enumeration via Pólya's theorem, assuming ideal geometries and cis coordination of bidentate ligands. Additionally, analysis of over 2700 crystallographic structures reveals a high prevalence of metal-centered chirality, especially in complexes with higher coordination numbers. These powerful yet easy-to-use decision trees provide chemists with deeper insights into the stereochemistry of metal coordination complexes and with effective tools to identify and understand this often-overlooked stereochemical property and its impact on molecular interactions and crystal packing.},

The cavity used in this method is set up to represent the van der Waals (VDW) surface of the system by joining spheres sized according to the respective atomic VDW radii. The size of this surface can be varied via a scaling factor, and it can be shown that the compression forces exerted in X-HCFF in its current implementation depend on this factor. To address this dependency, we have developed a rescaling formalism for the applied forces, allowing us to drastically reduce the dependency of the compression forces on the chosen scaling factor. Independency from the scaling factor is important, as the scaling of the VDW spheres is often used to ensure an overlap of cavities in supramolecular complexes, which is necessary for the simulation of chemical reactions. Our rescaling formalism reduces the empiricism of the X-HCFF approach and boosts its applicability in the field of computational high-pressure chemistry.},

The rationale is to treat the external pair energy contributions by the coupled-cluster method, which provides accurate results for a large part of the correlation energy while being tractable as the involved pair cluster operators commute. For the internal and semi-internal contributions, for which the coupled-cluster part becomes involved due to non-commuting operators, a linearized approach based on the coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA) is used. For the latter, the CEPA(0) method, the averaged coupled pair functional (ACPF), the averaged quadratic coupled-cluster (AQCC) method, and the averaged CEPA method are tested. We test the methods concerning size consistency, potential energy curves for C 2 , N 2 , CN, and O 3 and for the singlet-triplet splitting of ortho-, meta-, and para-benzynes. Our results show that AQCC provides the most accurate results and stable performance. The main drawback of the method is that it shows small violations of size consistency.},

However, the structure–activity relationships of molecules targeting GPCRs are highly challenging in many cases since slight structural modifications can lead to drastic changes in biological functionality. Numerous molecular descriptors have been described, many of which successfully characterize the structural and physicochemical features of drug sets. Nonetheless, elucidating the structure–functionality relationships over extensive sets of drugs with multiple structural variations and known biological activity remains challenging in various biological systems. This work presents novel topological descriptors using Laplacian matrices, weighted, and scaled by atomic mass and partial charges.

While deep learning models based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have made significant advancements in this area, prior studies have primarily concentrated on molecule-level representations, often neglecting the impact of functional group structures and the potential relationships between fragments on molecular property predictions. To address this gap, we introduce the multi-scale feature attention graph neural network (MfGNN), which enhances traditional atom-based molecular graph representations by incorporating fragment-level representations derived from chemically synthesizable BRICS fragments. MfGNN not only effectively captures both the structural information of molecules and the features of functional groups but also pays special attention to the potential relationships between fragments, exploring how they collectively influence molecular properties. This model integrates two core mechanisms: a graph attention mechanism that captures embeddings of molecules and functional groups, and a feature extraction module that systematically processes BRICS fragment-level features to uncover relationships among the fragments. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MfGNN outperforms leading machine learning and deep learning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 8 out of 11 learning tasks across various domains, including physical chemistry, biophysics, physiology, and toxicology. Furthermore, ablation studies reveal that the integration of multi-scale feature information and the feature extraction module enhances the richness of molecular features, thereby improving the model's predictive capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium-containing molecules, including MgC 2 H, MgC 4 H, and MgC 6 H, have been detected in the interstellar medium, largely facilitated by their high dipole moments. However, despite great efforts, MgC 2 m + 1 H species remain elusive. Given the challenges in obtaining experimental data for these molecules, theoretical studies play a crucial role in guiding their detection. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of MgC n H isomers ( n = 4–7) using density functional theory and coupled-cluster methods to identify low-lying isomers and characterize their structural and electronic properties. Our findings reveal that across the entire series investigated, the global minimum geometry is linear for even values of n , whereas for odd values, a cyclic geometry is favored. Additionally, our calculations highlight the enhanced stability of anionic MgC n H − systems, providing insights that could aid future astronomical detections in the interstellar medium.},

  abstract     = {Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in inflammation by converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. The overexpression of enzyme is associated with conditions such as cancer, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it contributes to neuroinflammation. In silico virtual screening is pivotal in early-stage drug discovery; however, the absence of coding or machine learning expertise can impede the development of reliable computational models capable of accurately predicting inhibitor compounds based on their chemical structure. In this study, we developed an automated KNIME workflow for predicting the COX-2 inhibitory potential of novel molecules by building a multi-level ensemble model constructed with five machine learning algorithms (i.e., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) and various molecular and fingerprint descriptors (i.e., AtomPair, Avalon, MACCS, Morgan, RDKit, and Pattern). Post-applicability domain filtering, the final majority voting-based ensemble model achieved 90.0% balanced accuracy, 87.7% precision, and 86.4% recall on the external validation set. The freely accessible workflow empowers users to swiftly and effortlessly predict COX-2 inhibitors, eliminating the need for any prior knowledge in machine learning, coding, or statistical modeling, significantly broadening its accessibility. While beginners can seamlessly use the tool as is, experienced KNIME users can leverage it as a foundation to build advanced workflows, driving further research and innovation.},

In this study, we evaluated fluspirilene, a drug commonly used to treat schizophrenia, as a potential PDE5 inhibitor using computational methods. Molecular docking revealed that fluspirilene binds strongly to PDE5, supported by hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the fluspirilene–PDE5 complex is stable and maintains its structural integrity over time. Binding energy calculations further highlighted favorable interactions, indicating that the drug forms a strong and stable bond with PDE5. Additional analyses, including studies of protein dynamics and energy landscape mapping, revealed how the drug interacts dynamically with PDE5, adapting to different conformations and maintaining stability. These findings suggest that fluspirilene may modulate PDE5 activity, potentially offering therapeutic benefits for Alzheimer's disease. This study provides strong evidence for repurposing fluspirilene as a treatment for Alzheimer's and lays the foundation for further experimental and clinical investigations.},

We also introduce several novelties in MST, like a new definition of atom types based on hybridization and an automatic setup of the cavity for charged regions. The model is parametrized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) and PM6 levels of theory and compared to the performance of IEFPCM/MST. Then, we demonstrate the robustness of the parametrization on the SAMPL2, SAMPL4, and C10 datasets.

  abstract     = {Light-driven molecular rotary motors are nanometric machines able to convert light into unidirectional motions. Several types of molecular motors have been developed to better respond to light stimuli, opening new avenues for developing smart materials ranging from nanomedicine to robotics. They have great importance in the scientific research across various disciplines, but a detailed comprehension of the underlying ultrafast photophysics immediately after photo-excitation, that is, Franck–Condon region characterization, is not fully achieved yet. For this aim, it is first required to rely on an accurate description at ab initio level of the system in this potential energy region before performing any further step, that is, dynamics. Thus, we present an extensive investigation aimed at accurately describing the electronic structure of low-lying electronic states (electronic layout) of a molecular rotor in the Franck–Condon region, belonging to the class of overcrowded alkenes: 9-(2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]naphthalen-1-ylidene)-9H-fluorene. This system was chosen since its photophysics is very interesting for a more general understanding of similar compounds used as molecular rotors, where low-lying electronic states can be found (whose energetic interplay is crucial in the dynamics) and where the presence of different substituents can tune the HOMO-LUMO gap. For this scope, we employed different theory levels within the time-dependent density functional theory framework, presenting also a careful comparison adopting very accurate post Hartree–Fock methods and characterizing also the different conformations involved in the photocycle. Effects on the electronic layout of different functionals, basis sets, environment descriptions, and the role of the dispersion correction were all analyzed in detail. In particular, a careful treatment of the solvent effects was here considered in depth, showing how the implicit solvent description can be accurate for excited states in the Franck–Condon region by testing both linear-response and state-specific formalisms. As main results, we chose two cost-effective (accurate but relatively cheap) theory levels for the ground and excited state descriptions, and we also verified how choosing these different levels of theory can influence the curvature of the potential via a frequency analysis of the normal modes of vibrations active in the Raman spectrum. This theoretical survey is a crucial step towards a feasible characterization of the early stage of excited states in solution during photoisomerization processes wherein multiple electronic states might be populated upon the light radiation, leading to a future molecular-level interpretation of time-resolved spectroscopies.},

The present simulations suggest a ballistic mechanism of photodissociation, which is irrespective of the occupied electronic state. This is in contrast to the previously established mechanism of competitive intersystem crossing and dissociation. Selectivity of axial photodissociation is shown to be caused by the absence of an avoided crossing in the equatorial direction.},

  abstract     = {Various electronically excited states and the feasibility of direct laser cooling of SH, SeH, and TeH are investigated using the highly accurate ab initio and dynamical methods. For the detailed calculations of the seven low-lying Λ-S states of SH, we utilized the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach, considering the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. Our calculated spectroscopic constants are in very good agreement with the available experimental results. It is found that, from SH to TeH, the crossing points among the A 2 Σ + and three electronically excited states gradually shift downward toward the ground vibrational level of the A 2 Σ + state. This is consistent with our previous findings in other molecular systems and makes the laser cooling of TeH unfeasible. Our calculations indicate that the three crossing points, respectively, between the A 2 Σ + and a 4 Σ − , A 2 Σ + and B 2 Σ − , and A 2 Σ + and b 4 Π states of SH, all lie above the v' = 1 vibrational level of the A 2 Σ + state, as a result of which the crossings involving electronic states of higher energy would not hinder its laser cooling. Based upon our study on various excited states, we have constructed a viable laser-cooling scheme for SH, utilizing three laser beams and leveraging the A 2 Σ + → X 2 Π transition. This transition possesses a very large vibrational branching ratio R 00 (0.9558), an abundant number of scattered photons (9.30 × 10 3 ), and a short radiative lifetime (787 ns). Our work underscores the important role of excited-state crossings in molecular laser cooling and demonstrates that SH emerges as a very good candidate for ultracold molecules.},

In contrast, the explicit solvation model (ES) introduces significant changes, suggesting a kinetic preference for axial pathways. The reaction rate constants, employing Deformed Transition State Theory (d-TST), are consistently higher for axial abstraction. The preference for axial hydrogen abstraction, solvation effects on transition states, and temperature-dependent rate constants are highlighted. Furthermore, the identification of carbon–carbon orbital distortion suggests potential bond breakage.

Calculations using ωB97X-D3 functional, def2-TZVP basis set, and conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) solvation model reproduced key experimental spectral features, with increased model complexity improving agreement, particularly for the ~400 cm −1 band splitting in resonance Raman spectra. This work enhances our understanding of T1 copper sites' electronic properties and spectra, bridging the gap between simplified models and complex proteins. The findings contribute to the interpretation of spectroscopic data in blue copper proteins and may inform future studies on similar biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Using the QM/MM methodology and a local mode analysis, we investigated a character and a strength of FeS bonds of heme groups in oxidized and reduced forms of Bacterioferritin from Azotobacter vinelandii . The strength of the FeS bonds was correlated with a bond length, an energy density at a bond critical point, and a charge difference of the F and S atoms. Changing the oxidation state from ferrous to ferric generally makes the FeS bonds weaker, longer, more covalent, and more polar. We also investigated the SFeS bond bending and found that the stronger FeS bond, generally makes the SFeS bond bending stiffer, which could play a key role in the balance between ferric and ferrous oxidation states and related biological activities.},

By focusing on uncertain data points, active learning reduces training data size while maintaining high accuracy. Applied to the LIBE and MPcules datasets, the model achieved an R-squared ( R 2 ) values of 0.9977 with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.66 Ha for electronic energy and an R 2 values of 0.957 with an MAE of 13.94 cm −1 for average vibrational frequencies.

  abstract     = {We report a direct application of the molecular tailoring approach-based (MTA-based) method to calculate the individual hydrogen bond (HB) energy in molecular crystal. For this purpose, molecular crystals of nitromalonamide (NMA) and salicylic acid (SA) were taken as test cases. Notably, doing a correlated computation using a large molecular crystal structure is difficult. Among 15 density functional theory functionals, the B3LYP provides accurate estimates of HB energies closed to the CCSD(T) ones using the 6–311 + G(d,p) basis set for all atoms. The direct application of the MTA-based method to these crystal structures is although straightforward. For instance, the calculated energy suggests that three intramolecular HBs in NMA crystal are of stronger strength (7.3–17.0 kcal/mol) than the intermolecular ones (2.7–4.0 kcal/mol). On the other hand, intermolecular HB in SA crystal is moderately stronger (9.9 kcal/mol) than intramolecular one (8.1 kcal/mol). However, these energy calculations by the MTA-based method are very expensive. For instance, the time needed to evaluate the energy of all seven HBs in NMA crystal (having molecules within maximum of 15 unit cells) is 122,681 min (~2.7 months). In view of this, we assessed our recently proposed linear-scaling Fragments-in-Fragments ( Frags-in-Frags ) method for estimating the single-point energies of parent molecular crystal and fragments of the MTA-based method. It has been found that the estimated HB energies by the Frags-in-Frags method are in excellent linear agreement with their MTA-based counterparts (R 2 = 0.9993). Furthermore, root mean square deviation is 0.12 kcal/mol. Mean and maximum absolute errors are 0.10 and 0.5 kcal/mol, respectively, and the standard deviation is 0.14 kcal/mol. Importantly, the Frags-in-Frags method is computationally efficient; it needs only 18,289 min (~12.7 days) for the estimation of energy of all HBs in NMA crystal and 3499 min (~2.4 days) for all HBs in SA crystal.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen gas (H 2 ) can be produced via entirely solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting (PWS). A promising set of organic materials for facilitating PWS are the so-called inverted singlet-triplet, INVEST, materials. Inversion of the singlet (S 1 ) and triplet (T 1 ) energies reduces the population of triplet states, which are otherwise destructive under photocatalytic conditions. Moreover, when INVEST materials possess dark S 1 states, the excited state lifetimes are maximized, facilitating energy transfer to split water. In the context of solar-driven processes, it is also desirable that these INVEST materials absorb near the solar maximum. Many aza-triangulenes possess the desired INVEST property, making it beneficial to describe an approach for systematically and efficiently predicting the INVEST property as well as properties that make for efficient photocatalytic water splitting, while exploring the large chemical space of the aza-triangulenes. Here, we utilize machine learning to generate post hoc corrections to simplified Tamm–Dancoff approximation density functional theory (sTDA-DFT) for singlet and triplet excitation energies that are within 28–50 meV of second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), as well as the singlet-to-triplet, ΔE S1T1 , gaps of PWS systems. Our Δ-ML model is able to recall 85% of the systems identified by ADC(2) as candidates for PWS. Further, with a modest database of ADC(2) excitation energies of 4025 aza-triangulenes, we identified 78 molecules suitable for entirely solar-driven PWS.},

Applying EVIs to a diverse set of molecules for GGA functionals reveals constraint violations, particularly for semi-empirical functionals. We leverage EVIs to explore potential connections between these violations and errors in chemical properties. While no correlation is observed for atomization energies, a significant statistical correlation emerges between EVIs and total energies. Similarly, the analysis of reaction energies suggests weak positive correlations for specific constraints. However, definitive conclusions about error cancellation mechanisms cannot be made at this time. These observations revealed by EVIs may be useful for consideration when designing future generations of semilocal functionals.},

Calculating the solvation free energy for VDAC is crucial for understanding its stability, function, and interactions within the cellular environment. In this article, numerical schemes for computing the total solvation free energy for VDAC—comprising electrostatic, ideal gas, and excess free energies plus the nonpolar energy—are developed based on a nonuniform size modified Poisson–Boltzmann ion channel (nuSMPBIC) finite element solver along with tetrahedral meshes for VDAC proteins. The current mesh generation package is also updated to improve mesh quality and accelerate mesh generation. A VDAC Solvation Free Energy Calculation (VSFEC) package is then created by integrating these schemes with the updated mesh package, the nuSMPBIC finite element package, the PDB2PQR package, and the OPM database, as well as one uniform SMPBIC finite element package and one Poisson–Boltzmann ion channel (PBIC) finite element package. With the VSFEC package, many numerical experiments are made using six VDAC proteins, eight ionic solutions containing up to four ionic species, including ATP 4− and Ca 2+ , two reference states, different boundary values, and different permittivity constants. The test results underscore the importance of considering nonuniform ionic size effects to explore the varying patterns of the total solvation free energy, and demonstrate the high performance of the VSFEC package for VDAC solvation free energy calculation.},

One-carbon metabolism, facilitated by the folate cofactor, supports numerous physiological processes, including biosynthesis, amino acid homeostasis, epigenetic maintenance, and redox defense. Folates share a common pterin heterocyclic ring structure capable of undergoing redox reactions and existing in various protonation states. This study aimed to derive molecular mechanics (MM) parameters compatible with the CHARMM36 all-atom additive force field for pterins and biologically important folates, including pterin, biopterin, and folic acid. Three redox forms were considered: oxidized, dihydrofolate, and tetrahydrofolate states. Across all protonation states, a total of 18 folates were parameterized. Partial charges were derived using the CHARMM force field parametrization protocol, based on targeting reference quantum mechanics monohydrate interactions, electrostatic potential, and dipole moment. Bonded terms were parameterized using one-dimensional adiabatic potential energy surface scans, and two-dimensional scans to parametrize in-ring torsions associated with the puckering states of dihydropterin and tetrahydropterin. The quality of the model was demonstrated through simulations of three protein complexes using optimized and initial parameters. These simulations underscored the significantly enhanced performance of the folate model developed in this study compared to the initial model without optimization in reproducing structural properties of folate–protein complexes. Overall, the presented MM model will be valuable for modeling folates in various redox states and serve as a starting point for parameterizing other folate derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) have attracted attention for their potential applications in organic photovoltaics due to their tunable optical properties and charge-carrier mobilities. In this study, we investigate the excited-state dynamics of a DPP dimer using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal a near-barrierless hydrogen migration state intersection that facilitates ultrafast internal conversion with a lifetime of about 400 fs, leading to fluorescence quenching. Electronic density analysis along the relaxation pathway confirms a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. These findings highlight the critical role of state intersections in the photophysical properties of DPP dimers, providing new insights for the design of functionalized DPP systems aimed at suppressing nonradiative decay for enhanced performance in photovoltaic applications.},

  abstract     = {The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase which is responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. To address this issue, we employed a comprehensive computational approach integrating virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area) analysis to identify potential inhibitors and elucidate their binding mechanisms. Initially, virtual screening was conducted on 994 compounds from the ZINC database and, these compounds were docked against wildtype and T315I mutant ABL1 for the Type I and Type II ABL1 kinase inhibition mechanisms. In our molecular docking analysis for Type I inhibition, compound 911 demonstrated notable affinity towards the wildtype ABL1, with a binding energy of −14.91 kcal/mol, while compound 972 showed significant binding affinity towards the mutant ABL1, with a binding energy of −14.27 kcal/mol. In the Type II inhibition mechanism, the compounds with the highest binding affinity were compound 261 in wildtype ABL1 with −17.05 kcal/mol binding energy and compound 966 to the mutant ABL1 with a binding energy of −16.29 kcal/mol. Furthermore, analyses of MD simulations and MM/GBSA binding free energy (ΔG) were performed for target proteins with compounds, that exhibited the most favorable binding affinities with target proteins. The selected hit compounds showed ΔG scores ranging from −118.09 to −74.85 kJ/mol in both wildtype and mutant ABL1. Considering all in silico studies performed, it can be inferred that the identified molecules hold promise as potential candidates for drug design aimed at targeting CML.},

QM/MM MP2 calculations are performed to reveal the mechanism of ampicillin hydrolysis catalyzed by NDM-1. It is found that the rate-determining step is the dissociation of hydrolyzed ampicillin from the NDM-1 active site, which requires a proton transfer from the bridging neutral water molecule to the newly formed carboxylate group. The precedent reaction steps, including the hydroxide nucleophilic addition, C  N bond cleavage, and the protonation of the negative lactam N atom by a solvent water molecule, all require insignificant activation free energies. The calculated activation free energy for this rate-determining proton transfer step is 16.0 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experimental values of 13.7 ~ 14.7 kcal/mol. This proton transfer step exhibits a solvent hydrogen-deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 3.4, consistent with several experimental kinetic results.},

It is found that the Cr impurities prefer the central axis positions of the skeleton in these Cr 2 Pb n ( n = 3–20) clusters. For sizes n ≤ 6, their structures are exohedral structures with the two Cr atoms exposed outside, endohedral Cr@Pb n configuration with one Cr atom interior appears at size 7, and the resulting endohedral structure is then gradually covered by the additional Pb atoms to form endohedral Cr 2 @Pb n structures for n = 15–20. All Cr 2 Pb n clusters are antiferromagnets, except for the ferrimagnetic Cr 2 Pb 11 with a net magnetic moment of 2 μ B . The discovered stable Cr 2 Pb 17 cluster can assemble into dimers and trimers while maintaining its geometric structure and AFM properties, indicating the potential of becoming structural units for cluster-assembled AFM materials.},

However, unlike the analogous ethanol dimer, the ethanethiol dimer has not been thoroughly explored theoretically. In this study, ethanethiol and dimers were investigated using the MP2 method with various basis sets to determine the properties and stability of these structures. For the monomer, both trans and gauche structures were computed, with the gauche conformer being more stable, consistent with the available data in the literature. Local mode decomposition analysis of monomers showed that the CH 2 rocking mode, associated with the CSH bending, is present only for the gauche isomer aligning with the experimental assignments. Furthermore, eight stable dimer configurations were identified and categorized into three groups: trans–trans, gauche–gauche, and trans–gauche isomers. Among these, the trans–gauche isomer was found to be the most stable. Dispersion is the dominant term for the ethanethiol dimer.},

Conventional approaches to predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) frequently prove inadequate due to an insufficient representation of drugs and targets, resulting in ineffective feature capture and questionable interpretability of results. To address these challenges, we introduce CGPDTA, a novel deep learning framework empowered by transfer learning, designed explicitly for the accurate prediction of DTAs. CGPDTA leverages the complementarity of drug–drug and protein–protein interaction knowledge through advanced drug and protein language models. It further enhances predictive capability and interpretability by incorporating molecular substructure graphs and protein pocket sequences to represent local features of drugs and targets effectively. Our findings demonstrate that CGPDTA not only outperforms existing methods in accuracy but also provides meaningful insights into the predictive process, marking a significant advancement in the field of drug discovery.},

The Curie temperature (Tc) is determined using a Heisenberg model in the mean-field approximation. We obtained a half-metallic character for all compounds, making them promising materials for spintronic applications.

Results show that OP/TOP aligns with bonding models like the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and local vibrational modes theory, revealing insights such as overlap densities shifting towards the more electronegative atom in polar bonds. The Li–F dissociation profile using OP/TOP descriptors demonstrated sensitivity to ionic/neutral inversion during Li–F dissociation, highlighting their potential for elucidating complex bond phenomena and offering new avenues for understanding multiconfigurational chemical bond dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Electronic and vibrational relaxation processes can be optimized and tuned by introducing alternative pathways that channel excess energy more efficiently. An ensemble of interacting molecular systems can help overcome the bottlenecks caused by large energy gaps between intermediate excited states involved in the relaxation process. By employing this strategy, catenanes composed of mechanically interlocked carbon nanostructures show great promise as new materials for achieving higher efficiencies in electronic devices. Herein, we perform nonadiabatic excited state molecular dynamics on different all-benzene catenanes. We observe that catenanes experience faster relaxations than individual units. Coupled catenanes present overlapping energy manifolds that include several electronic excited states spatially localized on the different moieties, increasing the density of states that ultimately improve the efficiency in the energy relaxation. This result suggests the use of catenanes as a viable strategy for tuning the internal conversion rates in a quest for their utilization for new optoelectronic applications.},

This enables us to decompose near-field and far-field terms in what we believe is a simple and effective manner. The main result of this work is an acceleration of the evaluation of electrostatic potential integrals by at least one order of magnitude, and up to two orders of magnitude, while maintaining excellent accuracy (always better than the chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol). Moreover, the implementation is versatile enough to be used with molecular systems through QM/MM approaches. The code has been fully parallelized and is available in ORCA 6.0.},

The effect of Hartree–Fock exchange (HFX) in the hybrid functionals are investigated for the prediction of magnetic nature of the nonalternant hydrocarbon bridged diradicals. The utility of Borden and Davidson's proposal of disjoint and nondisjoint SOMOs for the prediction of magnetic nature of alternant hydrocarbon bridged diradicals is assessed for the nonalternant hydrocarbon based diradicals. The more affordable meta-GGA functionals was found to be outperforming the costlier hybrid and double-hybrid functionals in predicting the magnetic properties of nonalternant hydrocarbon-bridged diradicals. HFX significantly influences a functional's ability to predict a diradical's magnetic nature. Interestingly, Borden and Davidson's concept of disjoint and nondisjoint SOMOs, which is used to predict the magnetic behavior of alternant hydrocarbon diradicals, is reversed for nonalternant hydrocarbon-bridged diradicals. The difference in the magnetic nature of the two diradicals come from the canonical molecular orbitals of the diradicals, one has set of disjoint SOMOs and other has nondisjoint SOMOs.},

For states dissociating into the channel V + + H + , avoided crossings at large distances give rise to thermodynamic metastability but do not affect the characterization of the bound region. Configuration state functions with the 3σ orbital /doubly occupied give rise to covalent contributions to the bonding; the major contribution, however, comes from the electrostatic charge-induced dipole interaction. This explains the shape and proximity of the potential energy curves beyond their equilibrium distances. Dipole moment functions and vibrationally averaged dipole moments quantify the polarity of the molecule. Spin–orbit couplings give rise to complex and dense regions of very close-lying Ω states.},

While various methods can estimate rate constants for conformational transitions in molecular dynamics simulations, their applicability to studying chemical reactions remains uncertain due to the high and sharp energy barriers and complex reaction coordinates involved. This study focuses on the thermal cis-trans isomerization in retinal, employing molecular simulations and comparing rate constant estimates based on one-dimensional rate theories with those based on sampling transitions and grid-based models for low-dimensional collective variable spaces. Even though each individual method to estimate the rate passes its quality tests, the rate constant estimates exhibit considerable disparities. Rate constant estimates based on one-dimensional reaction coordinates prove challenging to converge, even if the reaction coordinate is optimized. However, consistent estimates of the rate constant are achieved by sampling transitions and by multi-dimensional grid-based models.},

Calculations are also performed for [R-CoTCNQ] −1 e supported on a H-terminated diamond (1 1 0) surface with reaction pathways being qualitatively similar to the [R-CoTCNQ] −1 e monolayer. The inclusion of boron-doping in the diamond support shows a slightly improved CO 2 ERR reaction pathway.

Our benchmark analysis concludes that ωB97XD density functional combined with 6-31G(d)/Def2-TZVP basis set is a better-suited method for simulating accurate MPr adsorption on graphene. It is shown that a reduced atomic model where the external organic shell of the structure is removed provides the same resulting optoelectronic properties of the original model, constituting an important speed-up of the calculations when studying porphyrins-derived molecules. We observe that ZnPr provides the highest light harvesting efficiency (LHE) value. In addition, we find out that the adsorption energy increases monotonically with the size of the graphene flake and the highest stability involves the use of graphene comprising above 500 atoms. Besides, CdPr and HgPr keep their properties as photosensitizers when they are bonded to graphene and show promising values in terms of LHE emerging as suitable solar energy harvesters.},

Unfortunately, current methods for the computation of rovibrational spectral data have been shown previously to exhibit large errors for aluminum-containing molecules. In this work, ten different methods are benchmarked to determine a method to produce experimentally-accurate rovibrational data for theorized aluminum species. Of the benchmarked methods, the explicitly correlated, hybrid F12-TcCR+TZ QFF consistently produces the most accurate results compared to both gas-phase and Ar-matrix experimental data.

Very few theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted on the azepinium ions. Related clozapine and olanzapine cations (diazepinium ions) were observed during drug metabolism studies. In this work, quantum chemical analysis has been carried out to estimate the stability, aromaticity, and electrophilicity of several derivatives of azepinium ions. A few of the designed azepinium ions carry Δ E S-T values in the range of 50 kcal/mol favoring singlet state; π donating groups at the 2nd position increase the singlet-triplet energy differences. Most of the substituents reduce the NICS(1) values compared to the parent system. Ring fusion with heterocyclic five-membered rings generally increases the aromaticity and the stability of the azepinium ion ring systems.

  abstract     = {Based on DFT calculations (ωB97XD/def2-SVP/SVPfit), the ability and mechanism of noble gas encapsulation by series of cryptophanes were investigated. The focus was set to study the influence of different functionalization groups placed at the “gates” of cryptophanes cavity entrance by which the energy criteria were chosen as a main indicator for selective encapsulation of noble gases. Chosen functionalization groups were  CH 3 ,  OCH 3 ,  OH,  NH 2 , and  Cl, and the encapsulation process of these cryptophanes was compared to a cryptophane without any functionalization group on its outer rim. Those groups were selected based on their different chemical properties and based on their size which will subsequently put additional steric restrictions on the cavity entrance. Chosen functionalization groups, beside their steric influence on the energy barrier magnitude, influence also the gating process through its chemical nature by which they can put an additional stabilization on noble gases encapsulation transition states enhancing the encapsulation process. Objective of this study was clearly to get better insights on the influence of those functional groups on the whole encapsulation process of noble gases. Large-size noble gases (Xe and Rn) from all noble gases are best accommodated in the cavities of selected cryptophanes, on the other hand these noble gases require to pass the highest energy barrier through the gating process. From the series of investigated cryptophanes, the cryptophane with the  OCH 3 functionalization group has been identified as the one with the best capabilities to host investigated noble gases, but on the other side this cryptophane puts the highest energy criteria required for the previous gating process.},

  abstract     = {Predicting drug target binding affinity has huge relevance in Modern drug discovery and drug repositioning processes which assist doctors to come up with new drugs or even use the existing drugs for new target proteins. In silico models, using advanced deep learning techniques could further assist these prediction tasks by providing most prominent drug target pairs. Considering these factors, a deep learning based algorithmic framework is developed in this study to support drug target interaction prediction. The proposed SeqDPI model extract the relevant drug and protein features from the one dimensional Sequential representation of the dataset considered using optimized CNN networks that deploy convolutions on varying length of amino acid subsequence's to capture hidden pattern, the convolved drug- protein features obtained are then used as an input to L2 penalized feed forward neural network which matches the local residue patterns in protein classes with molecular fingerprints of drugs to predict the binding strength for all drug target pairs. The proposed model reduces the convolution strain typically encountered in existing in silico models that utilize complex 3D structures of drug protein datasets. The result shows that the SeqDPI model achieves a mean square error MSE of (0.167) across cross validation folds, outperforming baseline models such as KronRLS (0.406), Simboost (0.226), and DeepPS (0.214). Additionally, SeqDPI attains a high CI score of 0.9114 on the benchmark KIBA dataset, demonstrating its statistical significance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. This gives the relevance and effectiveness of SeqDPI model in accurately predicting binding affinities while working with simpler one-dimensional data, making it a robust and computationally cost-effective solution for drug-target interaction prediction.},

In this work, we demonstrate how the p ⁢ K a $$ \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} $$ in one solvent can be accurately determined using reference data in another solvent, corrected by solvation energy calculations from the COSMO-RS method. We benchmark this approach in 10 different solvents, and find that p ⁢ K a $$ \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} $$ values calculated in six solvents deviate from experimental data on average by less than 1 p ⁢ K a $$ \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} $$ unit. We observe comparable performance on a more diverse test set including amino acids and drug molecules, with higher error for large molecules. The model performance in four other solvents is worse, with one MAE exceeding 3 p ⁢ K a $$ \mathrm{p}{K}_{\mathrm{a}} $$ units; we discuss how such errors arise due to both model error and inconsistency in obtaining experimental data. Finally, we demonstrate how this technique can be used to estimate the proton transfer energy between different solvents, and use this to report a value of the proton's solvation energy in formamide, a quantity that does not have a consensus value in literature.},

These ensembles are subsequently docked against the Platinum Diverse Dataset, the PoseBusters dataset and the DUDE-Z dataset to assess binding pose reproducibility and screening power. Notably, different sampling methods exhibit varying performance due to their unique preferences, such as dihedral angle sampling ranges on rotatable bonds.

To address this limitation, we introduced a robust GNN training framework, applied to various chemical databases to identify potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) against the challenging K103N-mutated HIV-1 RT. Leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training to tackle data scarcity, we screened 1,824,367 compounds, using multi-step approach that incorporated machine learning (ML)-based screening, analysis of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) prediction, drug-likeness properties, and molecular docking. Ultimately, 45 compounds were left as potential candidates with 17 of the compounds were previously identified as NNRTIs, exemplifying the model's efficacy. The remaining 28 compounds are anticipated to be repurposed for new uses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on repurposed candidates unveiled two promising preclinical drugs: one designed against Plasmodium falciparum and the other serving as an antibacterial agent. Both have superior binding affinity compared to anti-HIV drugs. This conceptual framework could be adapted for other disease-specific therapeutics, facilitating the identification of potent compounds effective against both WT and mutants while revealing novel scaffolds for drug design and discovery.},

Overcoming these problems requires more ligand design. In this work, reliable theoretical calculations were used to elucidate important ligand features necessary for achieving more rate acceleration and selectivity. These features include increasing the ligand-substrate repulsion and creating a negative charge in the space around the fluoride ion bonded to the palladium. The investigated L5 ligand presents these features, and the calculations predict that this ligand completely suppresses the regioisomer formation in the difficult case of 4-bromoanisole. In addition, the free energy barriers are decreased by 2–3 kcal mol −1 in comparison with the catalysis involving the AlPhos ligand. Thus, the present study points out a direction for new developments in palladium-catalyzed fluorination.},

Nanoparticles (NPs) were developed in vitro to address these issues by loading CDDP into various types of NPs, including metal, lipid, and biological NPs. Citrate was employed as a biocompatible compound in nanomedicine to reduce cytotoxicity and enhance stability. In our study, the physicochemical and electronic properties of CDDP and citrate have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT), with a comparison of their behavior in water and DMSO. Additionally, TD-DFT was applied to analyze the UV–Vis spectra results. Six complexes have been proposed to better understand the interaction between citrate and CDDP. The results demonstrated that the CDDP could form stable complexes with citrate in both water and DMSO, and the considered complexes exhibited UV–Vis spectra within the experiment range. The frontier orbitals, electron densities mapping, and electrostatic potential analysis revealed that complex 5, where citrate di-substituted on two chlorides, is the most likely and effective complex. In summary, our investigation sheds light on the potential of CDDP-citrate complexes to address the limitations of CDDP, offering insights into their stability and interaction in solvents and highlighting the promising efficacy of specific complex formations for future therapeutic applications.},

Calculations were performed using the M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ formalism, along with QTAIM, ELF and NCI methods for electron density analysis and MBIE and LMO-EDA energy decomposition analyses for interaction enthalpies. The protonation of the MH 2 – and M 2 H 4 –Base complexes occurs at the negatively charged hydrogen atoms of the MH 2 and M 2 H 4 moieties through typical hydride abstraction reactions, while protonation at the N atom of the base is systematically less exothermic. The preference for the hydride transfer mechanism is directly associated with the significant exothermicity of H 2 formation through the interaction between H − and H + , and the high hydride donor ability of these complexes. The basicity of both, MH 2 and M 2 H 4 compounds increases enormously upon association with the corresponding bases, with the increase exceeding 40 orders of magnitude in terms of ionization constants. Due to the smaller exothermicity of HF formation, the basicity of fluorides is lower than that of hydrides. In Be complexes, the protonation at the N atom of the base dominates over the fluoride abstraction mechanism. However, for the Mg complexes the fluoride abstraction mechanism is energetically the most favorable process, reflecting the greater facility of Mg complexes to lose F − .},

Large-scale testing encompassing thousands of simulations were employed to interrogate the methods in terms of multiple metrics which include numbers of duplicate molecules generated, pairwise-similarity, focused library reconstruction rates, fragment and torsion frequencies, fragment and torsion rank scores, interaction energy and drug-likeness scores, and 3D pose comparisons. The biasing algorithms, particularly those that include fragment and torsion components simultaneously, led to molecules that more closely mimicked the distributions of fragments and torsions found in drug-like libraries. The new parallel-based clustering and pruning algorithms, compared with the existing serial approach, also led to larger ensembles comprised of topologically unique molecules with much greater efficiency by removing redundant growth paths.},

  abstract     = {Formation of molecular complexes and subsequent heterolytic halogen-halogen bond splitting upon reactions of molecular Cl 2 with nitrogen-containing Lewis bases (LB) are computationally studied at M06-2X/def2-TZVPD and for selected compounds at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pvtz//CCSD/aug-cc-pvtz levels of theory. Obtained results are compared with data for ICl and I 2 molecules. Reaction pathways indicate, that in case of Cl 2 ∙LB complexes the activation energies for the heterolytic Cl-Cl bond splitting are lower than the activation energies of the homolytic splitting of Cl 2 molecule into chlorine radicals. The heterolytic halogen splitting of molecular complexes of X 2 ∙Py with formation of [XPy 2 ] + … X 3 − contact ion pairs in the gas phase is slightly endothermic in case of Cl 2 and I 2 , but slightly exothermic in the case of ICl. Formation of {[ClPy 2 ] + … } 2 dimers makes the overall process exothermic. Taking into account that polar solvents favor ionic species, generation of donor-stabilized Cl + in the presence of the Lewis bases is expected to be favorable. Thus, in polar solvents the oxidation pathway via donor-stabilized Cl + species is viable alternative to the homolytic Cl-Cl bond breaking.},

  abstract     = {The photophysical and photochemical properties of the sulfonyl azide-based fluorescent probe DNS–Az and its reduction product DNS by hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) have been investigated theoretically. The calculated results indicated the first excited states of DNS–Az was dark state (oscillator strength less than 0.03) and DNS was bright state (oscillator strength more than 0.1), which determined the predicted radiative rate k r of DNS–Az was much smaller than that of DNS, meanwhile, due to more larger reorganization energy of DNS–Az, its predicted internal conversion rate k ic was four times larger than that of DNS; moreover, owing to the effect of heavy atom from sulfur atom in DNS–Az, its predicted intersystem crossing rate k isc was seven times larger than that of DNS, thus the calculated fluorescence quantum yield of DNS–Az was only 2.16% and that of DNS was more than 77.2%, the above factors is the basis for DNS–Az molecule to function as a fluorescent probe. Regarding both DNS-Az and DNS molecules, their maximum Huang-Rhys factors, which are less than unity, signify the reliability of 0–0 transitions between their S 0 and S 1 electronic states. In addition, for DNS, our simulated emission peak of the 0–0 transition is 515 nm, a value that exhibits enhanced accuracy and coherence when compared to the experimental datum of 528 nm. The reaction mechanism of DNS-Az generating DNS by H 2 S has been investigated too, according to the potential energy profile, we found that the fluorescent probe firstly protonated, then this organic ion broke down into DNS with the aid of a proton.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between different metals (M), axial ligands (L), and ring substituents (R) in porphyrins was investigated using density functional theory. Different combinations of iron and cobalt as metal centers; imidazole, chlorine, and an n-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as axial ligands, and unsubstituted, octaethyl-, and tetraphenyl-porphyrins were explored in their low, intermediate, and high-spin states, alongside oxygen affinity. Remarkably, the n-heterocyclic carbene enhanced the affinity of cobalt porphyrins to oxygen, with binding energies on average 4.4 kcal mol −1 higher than FeP with the same ligand, and 0.78 kcal mol −1 higher than FeP with imidazole. The planarity of the iron tetraphenyl porphyrin with imidazole compared to its ruffled cobalt counterpart is noteworthy in both oxy- and deoxy-forms, highlighting imidazole's stabilizing influence on the porphyrin structure, particularly iron porphyrins, alongside imidazole's stabilizing effect on the affinity to O 2 . Despite the significant non-planarity induced by NHC as an axial ligand -regardless of the metal or ring substituent used-, it did not hinder the affinity of CoP to O 2 (14.26 kcal mol −1 , on average) as it did with the FeP with NHC (9.88 kcal mol −1 , on average). Cobalt porphyrins with n-heterocyclic carbene ligands show promising potential for O 2 activation or oxygen transport applications. The results show the complex interactions between the different parts of metalloporphyrins and highlight the capability of tailoring their affinity to O 2 . It also exemplifies the stabilizing effect of imidazole on the porphyrins, providing a very narrow range of binding energies and smaller differences in their geometries.},

Using this approximation as the initial guess for the MEP, followed by further refinement with the string method (referred to as the fast marching tree (FMT)-string combined approach), significantly reduces the number of iterations required for MEP convergence. This approach saves substantial time compared to using linear interpolation (LI) for the initial guess. Our method offers a viable solution for obtaining an effective initial guess of the MEP when an approximate or converged FEL is available. This work highlights the potential of applying FMT-based approaches to extract the MEP in chemical reactions.},

  abstract     = {A proper understanding of excited state properties of indole derivatives can lead to rational design of efficient fluorescent probes. The optically active L a and L b excited states of a series of substituted indoles, where a substituent was placed on position four, were calculated using equation of motion coupled cluster and time dependent density functional theory. The results indicate that most substituted indoles have a brighter second excited state corresponding to experimental absorption maxima, but a few with electron withdrawing substituents absorb more on the first excited state. Absorption on the first excited state may increase their fluorescence quantum yield, making them better probes. Electronic structure methods were found to predict the energies of the systems with electron withdrawing substituents more accurately than those with electron donating substituents. The excited states of both states correlated well with electrophilicity, similar to the experimental trends for the absorption maxima. Overall, these computational studies indicate that theory can be used to predict excited state properties of substituted indoles, when the substituent is an electron withdrawing group.},

  abstract     = {The biomolecules interact with their partners in an aqueous media; thus, their solvation energy is an important thermodynamics quantity. In previous works ( J. Chem. Theory Comput. 14 (2): 1020–1032), we demonstrated that the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) approach reproduces solvation energy calculated via thermodynamic integration (TI) protocol if the structures of proteins are kept rigid. However, proteins are not rigid bodies and computing their solvation energy must account for their flexibility. Typically, in the framework of PB calculations, this is done by collecting snapshots from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, computing their solvation energies, and averaging to obtain the ensemble-averaged solvation energy, which is computationally demanding. To reduce the computational cost, we have proposed Gaussian/super-Gaussian-based methods for the dielectric function that use the atomic packing to deliver smooth dielectric function for the entire computational space, the protein and water phase, which allows the ensemble-averaged solvation energy to be computed from a single structure. One of the technical difficulties associated with the smooth dielectric function presentation with respect to polar solvation energy is the absence of a dielectric border between the protein and water where induced charges should be positioned. This motivated the present work, where we report a super-Gaussian regularized Poisson–Boltzmann method and use it for computing the polar solvation energy from single energy minimized structures and assess its ability to reproduce the ensemble-averaged polar solvation on a dataset of 74 high-resolution monomeric proteins.},

In this work, based on extensive density-functional theory calculations and detailed electrostatic potential (ESP), natural bonding orbital (NBO), non-covalent interactions-reduced density gradient (NCI-RDG), and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analyses, we unveil the existence of fluxional halogen bonds (FXBs) in a series of linear (IC 6 F 4 I) m (OONC 6 H 4 NOO) n ( m + n = 2–5) complexes of tetrafluorodiiodobenzene with dinitrobenzene which appear to be similar to the previously reported fluxional hydrogen bonds (FHBs) in small water clusters (H 2 O) n ( n = 2–6). The obtained GS ⇌ TS ⇌ GS ' fluxional mechanisms involve one FXB in the systems which fluctuates reversibly between two linear C  I···O XBs in the ground states (GS and GS') via a bifurcated C  I O 2 N van der Waals interaction in the transition state (TS). The cohesive energies ( E coh ) of these complexes with up to four XBs exhibit an almost perfect linear relationship with the numbers of XBs in the systems, with the average calculated halogen bond energy of E coh/XB = 3.48 kcal·mol −1 in the ground states which appears to be about 55% of the average calculated hydrogen bond energy ( E coh/HB = 6.28 kcal·mol −1 ) in small water clusters.},

  abstract     = {In protein-ligand docking, the score assigned to a protein-ligand complex is approximate. Especially, the internal energy of the ligand is difficult to compute precisely using a molecular mechanics based force-field, introducing significant noise in the rank-ordering of ligands. We propose an open-source protocol ( https://github.com/UnixJunkie/MMO ), using two quantum mechanics (QM) single point energy calculations, plus a Monte Carlo (Monte Carlo) based ligand minimization procedure in-between, to estimate ligand strain after docking. The MC simulation uses the ANI-2x (QM approximating) force field and is performed in the dihedral space. On some protein targets, using strain filtering after docking allows to significantly improve hit rates. We performed a structure-based virtual screening campaign on nine protein targets from the Laboratoire d'Innovation Thérapeutique—PubChem assays dataset using Cambridge crystallographic data centre genetic optimization for ligand docking. Then, docked ligands were submitted to the strain estimation protocol and the impact on hit rate was analyzed. As for docking, the method does not always work. However, if sufficient active and inactive molecules are known for a given protein target, its efficiency can be evaluated.},
