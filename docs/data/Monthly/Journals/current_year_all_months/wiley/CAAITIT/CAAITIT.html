  abstract     = {Lexical analysis is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which involves several subtasks, such as word segmentation (WS), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). Recent works have shown that taking advantage of relatedness between these subtasks can be beneficial. This paper proposes a unified neural framework to address these subtasks simultaneously. Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification. Firstly, the model detects the word and named entity boundaries by multi-label classification over character spans in a sentence. Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively. Furthermore, a Gated Task Transformation (GTT) is proposed to encourage the model to share valuable features between tasks. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on Chinese and Thai public datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

Energy management is a challenging issue that is critical in cloud data centres and an important concern of research for many researchers. In this paper, we proposed a cuckoo search (CS)-based optimisation technique for the virtual machine (VM) selection and a novel placement algorithm considering the different constraints. The energy consumption model and the simulation model have been implemented for the efficient selection of VM. The proposed model CSOA-VM not only lessens the violations at the service level agreement (SLA) level but also minimises the VM migrations. The proposed model also saves energy and the performance analysis shows that energy consumption obtained is 1.35Â kWh, SLA violation is 9.2 and VM migration is about 268. Thus, there is an improvement in energy consumption of about 1.8% and a 2.1% improvement (reduction) in violations of SLA in comparison to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous estimation issues have been solved due to the developments in data-driven artificial neural networks (ANN) and graph neural networks (GNN). The primary limitation of previous methodologies has been the dependence on data that can be structured in a grid format. However, physiological recordings often exhibit irregular and unordered patterns, posing a significant challenge in conceptualising them as matrices. As a result, GNNs which comprise interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights are defined by anatomical junctions or temporal relationships have received a lot of consideration by leveraging implicit data that exists in a biological system. Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks. The trials used an authentic dataset, including 800 brain x-ray pictures, consisting of 560 instances classified as moderate cases and 240 instances classified as severe cases. Based on empirical evidence, our methodology demonstrates superior performance in classification, surpassing other comparison methods with a notable achievement of 92.27% in terms of area under the curve as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.62.},

However, in the face of increasingly complex optimization challenges, the Bat algorithm encounters certain limitations, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to initial solutions. In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllableâwordâsentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllableâwordâsentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

  abstract     = {Modern automated generation control (AGC) is increasingly complex, requiring precise frequency control for stability and operational accuracy. Traditional PID controller optimisation methods often struggle to handle nonlinearities and meet robustness requirements across diverse operational scenarios. This paper introduces an enhanced strategy using a multi-objective optimisation framework and a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SNSGA). The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61Â years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43Â years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE).

CD-GAD classifies anomalies as unique or common based on their presence in both the source and target graphs. However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Selecting appropriate tourist attractions to visit in real time is an important problem for travellers. Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARsâconcatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic prediction with high precision is always the unremitting pursuit of intelligent transportation systems and is instrumental in bringing smart cities into reality. The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024Â ÃÂ 1024 images in just 0.045Â s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17Ã across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},

Differential privacy stands out as a crucial method for preserving privacy, garnering significant interest for its ability to offer robust and verifiable privacy safeguards during data training. However, classic differentially private learning introduces the same level of noise into the gradients across training iterations, which affects the trade-off between model utility and privacy guarantees. To address this issue, an adaptive differential privacy mechanism was proposed in this paper, which dynamically adjusts the privacy budget at the layer-level as training progresses to resist member inference attacks. Specifically, an equal privacy budget is initially allocated to each layer. Subsequently, as training advances, the privacy budget for layers closer to the output is reduced (adding more noise), while the budget for layers closer to the input is increased. The adjustment magnitude depends on the training iterations and is automatically determined based on the iteration count. This dynamic allocation provides a simple process for adjusting privacy budgets, alleviating the burden on users to tweak parameters and ensuring that privacy preservation strategies align with training progress. Extensive experiments on five well-known datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy and resilience against membership inference attacks.},

  abstract     = {Data augmentation plays an important role in boosting the performance of 3D models, while very few studies handle the 3D point cloud data with this technique. Global augmentation and cut-paste are commonly used augmentation techniques for point clouds, where global augmentation is applied to the entire point cloud of the scene, and cut-paste samples objects from other frames into the current frame. Both types of data augmentation can improve performance, but the cut-paste technique cannot effectively deal with the occlusion relationship between the foreground object and the background scene and the rationality of object sampling, which may be counterproductive and may hurt the overall performance. In addition, LiDAR is susceptible to signal loss, external occlusion, extreme weather and other factors, which can easily cause object shape changes, while global augmentation and cut-paste cannot effectively enhance the robustness of the model. To this end, we propose Syn-Aug, a synchronous data augmentation framework for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. Specifically, we first propose a novel rendering-based object augmentation technique (Ren-Aug) to enrich training data while enhancing scene realism. Second, we propose a local augmentation technique (Local-Aug) to generate local noise by rotating and scaling objects in the scene while avoiding collisions, which can improve generalisation performance. Finally, we make full use of the structural information of 3D labels to make the model more robust by randomly changing the geometry of objects in the training frames. We verify the proposed framework with four different types of 3D object detectors. Experimental results show that our proposed Syn-Aug significantly improves the performance of various 3D object detectors in the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, proving the effectiveness and generality of Syn-Aug. On KITTI, four different types of baseline models using Syn-Aug improved mAP by 0.89%, 1.35%, 1.61% and 1.14% respectively. On nuScenes, four different types of baseline models using Syn-Aug improved mAP by 14.93%, 10.42%, 8.47% and 6.81% respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/liuhuaijjin/Syn-Aug .},

  abstract     = {In the field of organic synthesis, the core objective of retrosynthetic methods is to deduce possible synthetic routes and precursor molecules for complex target molecules. Traditional retrosynthetic methods, such as template-based retrosynthesis, have high accuracy and interpretability in specific types of reactions but are limited by the scope of the template library, making it difficult to adapt to new or uncommon reaction types. Moreover, sequence-to-sequence retrosynthetic prediction methods, although they enhance the flexibility of prediction, often overlook the complexity of molecular graph structures and the actual interactions between atoms, which limits the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Molecular Retrosynthesis Top-k Prediction based on the Latent Generation Process (MRLGP) that uses latent variables from graph neural networks to model the generation process and produce diverse set of reactants. Utilising an encoding method based on Graphormer, the authors have also introduced topology-aware positional encoding to better capture the interactions between atomic nodes in the molecular graph structure, thereby more accurately simulating the retrosynthetic process. The MRLGP model significantly enhances the accuracy and diversity of predictions by correlating discrete latent variables with the reactant generation process and progressively constructing molecular graphs using a variational autoregressive decoder. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as USPTO-50k, USPTO-Full, and USPTO-DIVERSE demonstrate that MRLGP outperforms baseline models on multiple Top-k evaluation metrics. Additionally, ablation experiments conducted on the USPTO-50K dataset further validate the effectiveness of the methods used in the encoder and decoder parts of the model.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graphs generally refer to graphs with different types of nodes and edges. A common approach for extracting useful information from heterogeneous graphs is to use meta-graphs, which can be seen as a special kind of directed acyclic graph with same node and edge types as the heterogeneous graph. However, how to design proper meta-graphs is challenging. Recently, there have been many works on learning suitable meta-graphs from a heterogeneous graph. Existing methods generally introduce continuous weights for edges that are independent of each other, which ignores the topological structures of meta-graphs and can be ineffective. To address this issue, the authors propose a new viewpoint from tensor on learning meta-graphs. Such a viewpoint not only helps interpret the limitation of existing works by CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, but also inspires us to propose a topology-aware tensor decomposition, called TENSUS , that reflects the structure of DAGs. The proposed topology-aware tensor decomposition is easy to use and simple to implement, and it can be taken as a plug-in part to upgrade many existing works, including node classification and recommendation on heterogeneous graphs. Experimental results on different tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the state-of-the-arts for all these tasks.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the deficiencies of single-modal emotion recognition based on facial expression or bodily posture in natural scenes, a spatial guidance and temporal enhancement (SG-TE) network is proposed for facial-bodily emotion recognition. First, ResNet50, DNN and spatial ransformer models are used to capture facial texture vectors, bodily skeleton vectors and whole-body geometric vectors, and an intraframe correlation attention guidance (S-CAG) mechanism, which guides the facial texture vector and the bodily skeleton vector by the whole-body geometric vector, is designed to exploit the spatial potential emotional correlation between face and posture. Second, an interframe significant segment enhancement (T-SSE) structure is embedded into a temporal transformer to enhance high emotional intensity frame information and avoid emotional asynchrony. Finally, an adaptive weight assignment (M-AWA) strategy is constructed to realise facial-bodily fusion. The experimental results on the BabyRobot Emotion Dataset (BRED) and Context-Aware Emotion Recognition (CAER) dataset indicate that the proposed network reaches accuracies of 81.61% and 89.39%, which are 9.61% and 9.46% higher than those of the baseline network, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves 7.73% and 20.57% higher accuracy than single-modal methods based on facial expression or bodily posture, respectively, and 2.16% higher accuracy than the dual-modal methods based on facial-bodily fusion. Therefore, the proposed method, which adaptively fuses the complementary information of face and posture, improves the quality of emotion recognition in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Realistic human reconstruction embraces an extensive range of applications as depth sensors advance. However, current state-of-the-art methods with RGB-D input still suffer from artefacts, such as noisy surfaces, non-human shapes, and depth ambiguity, especially for the invisible parts. The authors observe the main issue is the lack of geometric semantics without using depth input priors fully. This paper focuses on improving the representation ability of implicit function, exploring an effective method to utilise depth-related semantics effectively and efficiently. The proposed geometry-enhanced implicit function enhances the geometric semantics with the extra voxel-aligned features from point clouds, promoting the completion of missing parts for unseen regions while preserving the local details on the input. For incorporating multi-scale pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features, the authors use the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention to capture and fully use channel interdependencies. For the multi-view reconstruction, the proposed depth-enhanced attention explicitly excites the network to âsenseâ the geometric structure for a more reasonable feature aggregation. Experiments and results show that our method outperforms current RGB and depth-based SOTA methods on the challenging data from Twindom and Thuman3.0, and achieves a detailed and completed human reconstruction, balancing performance and efficiency well.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is one of the major causes of deaths in women. However, the early diagnosis is important for screening and control the mortality rate. Thus for the diagnosis of breast cancer at the early stage, a computer-aided diagnosis system is highly required. Ultrasound is an important examination technique for breast cancer diagnosis due to its low cost. Recently, many learning-based techniques have been introduced to classify breast cancer using breast ultrasound imaging dataset (BUSI) datasets; however, the manual handling is not an easy process and time consuming. The authors propose an EfficientNet-integrated ResNet deep network and XAI-based framework for accurately classifying breast cancer (malignant and benign). In the initial step, data augmentation is performed to increase the number of training samples. For this purpose, three-pixel flip mathematical equations are introduced: horizontal, vertical, and 90Â°. Later, two pre-trained deep learning models were employed, skipped some layers, and fine-tuned. Both fine-tuned models are later trained using a deep transfer learning process and extracted features from the deeper layer. Explainable artificial intelligence-based analysed the performance of trained models. After that, a new feature selection technique is proposed based on the cuckoo search algorithm called cuckoo search controlled standard error mean. This technique selects the best features and fuses using a new parallel zero-padding maximum correlated coefficient features. In the end, the selection algorithm is applied again to the fused feature vector and classified using machine learning algorithms. The experimental process of the proposed framework is conducted on a publicly available BUSI and obtained 98.4% and 98% accuracy in two different experiments. Comparing the proposed framework is also conducted with recent techniques and shows improved accuracy. In addition, the proposed framework was executed less than the original deep learning models.},

  abstract     = {Internal learning-based video inpainting methods have shown promising results by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the video to fill in the missing region without external dataset supervision. However, existing internal learning-based video inpainting methods would produce inconsistent structures or blurry textures due to the insufficient utilisation of motion priors within the video sequence. In this paper, the authors propose a new internal learning-based video inpainting model called appearance consistency and motion coherence network (ACMC-Net), which can not only learn the recurrence of appearance prior but can also capture motion coherence prior to improve the quality of the inpainting results. In ACMC-Net, a transformer-based appearance network is developed to capture global context information within the video frame for representing appearance consistency accurately. Additionally, a novel motion coherence learning scheme is proposed to learn the motion prior in a video sequence effectively. Finally, the learnt internal appearance consistency and motion coherence are implicitly propagated to the missing regions to achieve inpainting well. Extensive experiments conducted on the DAVIS dataset show that the proposed model obtains the superior performance in terms of quantitative measurements and produces more visually plausible results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Extrapolation on Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) aims to predict future knowledge from a set of historical Knowledge Graphs in chronological order. The temporally adjacent facts in TKGs naturally form event sequences, called event evolution patterns, implying informative temporal dependencies between events. Recently, many extrapolation works on TKGs have been devoted to modelling these evolutional patterns, but the task is still far from resolved because most existing works simply rely on encoding these patterns into entity representations while overlooking the significant information implied by relations of evolutional patterns. However, the authors realise that the temporal dependencies inherent in the relations of these event evolution patterns may guide the follow-up event prediction to some extent. To this end, a T emporal Re lational Co n text-based Temporal D ependencies Learning Network (TRenD) is proposed to explore the temporal context of relations for more comprehensive learning of event evolution patterns, especially those temporal dependencies caused by interactive patterns of relations. Trend incorporates a semantic context unit to capture semantic correlations between relations, and a structural context unit to learn the interaction pattern of relations. By learning the temporal contexts of relations semantically and structurally, the authors gain insights into the underlying event evolution patterns, enabling to extract comprehensive historical information for future prediction better. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the model.},

  abstract     = {The bat algorithm (BA) is a metaheuristic algorithm for global optimisation that simulates the echolocation behaviour of bats with varying pulse rates of emission and loudness, which can be used to find the globally optimal solutions for various optimisation problems. Knowing the recent criticises of the originality of equations, the principle of BA is concise and easy to implement, and its mathematical structure can be seen as a hybrid particle swarm with simulated annealing. In this research, the authors focus on the performance optimisation of BA as a solver rather than discussing its originality issues. In terms of operation effect, BA has an acceptable convergence speed. However, due to the low proportion of time used to explore the search space, it is easy to converge prematurely and fall into the local optima. The authors propose an adaptive multi-stage bat algorithm (AMSBA). By tuning the algorithm's focus at three different stages of the search process, AMSBA can achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation and improve its exploration ability by enhancing its performance in escaping local optima as well as maintaining a certain convergence speed. Therefore, AMSBA can achieve solutions with better quality. A convergence analysis was conducted to demonstrate the global convergence of AMSBA. The authors also perform simulation experiments on 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC 2017 as the objective functions and compare AMSBA with some original and improved swarm-based algorithms. The results verify the effectiveness and superiority of AMSBA. AMSBA is also compared with eight representative optimisation algorithms on 10 benchmark functions derived from IEEE CEC 2020, while this experiment is carried out on five different dimensions of the objective functions respectively. A balance and diversity analysis was performed on AMSBA to demonstrate its improvement over the original BA in terms of balance. AMSBA was also applied to the multi-threshold image segmentation of Citrus Macular disease, which is a bacterial infection that causes lesions on citrus trees. The segmentation results were analysed by comparing each comparative algorithm's peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index and feature similarity index. The results show that the proposed BA-based algorithm has apparent advantages, and it can effectively segment the disease spots from citrus leaves when the segmentation threshold is at a low level. Based on a comprehensive study, the authors think the proposed optimiser has mitigated the main drawbacks of the BA, and it can be utilised as an effective optimisation tool.},

Furthermore, this study introduces a muscle activation model that merges linear and non-linear states of muscle, avoiding the impact of non-linear shape factors on model accuracy present in traditional models. A muscle strength assessment model based on optimised generalised regression (WOA-GRNN) is also proposed, with a root mean square error of 0.017,347 and a mean absolute percentage error of 1.2461%, serving as critical assessment indicators for the effectiveness of rehabilitation.

It retains the feature extraction module of PointMLP but replaces the classification layer with a regression layer to predict the coordinates of feature points instead of conducting regular classification. A flowchart for an automatic feature points extraction method was presented, and a series of experiments was conducted on a clinical pelvic dataset to confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the method. PointMLP_RegNet extracted feature points more accurately, with 8 out of 10 points showing less than 4Â mm errors and the remaining two less than 5Â mm.

  abstract     = {Automated prostate cancer detection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is of significant importance for cancer patient management. Most existing computer-aided diagnosis systems adopt segmentation methods while object detection approaches recently show promising results. The authors have (1) carefully compared performances of most-developed segmentation and object detection methods in localising prostate imaging reporting and data system (PIRADS)-labelled prostate lesions on MRI scans; (2) proposed an additional customised set of lesion-level localisation sensitivity and precision; (3) proposed efficient ways to ensemble the segmentation and object detection methods for improved performances. The ground-truth (GT) perspective lesion-level sensitivity and prediction-perspective lesion-level precision are reported, to quantify the ratios of true positive voxels being detected by algorithms over the number of voxels in the GT labelled regions and predicted regions. The two networks are trained independently on 549 clinical patients data with PIRADS-V2 as GT labels, and tested on 161 internal and 100 external MRI scans. At the lesion level, nnDetection outperforms nnUNet for detecting both PIRADS â¥ 3 and PIRADS â¥ 4 lesions in majority cases. For example, at the average false positive prediction per patient being 3, nnDetection achieves a greater Intersection-of-Union (IoU)-based sensitivity than nnUNet for detecting PIRADS â¥ 3 lesions, being 80.78%Â Â±Â 1.50% versus 60.40%Â Â±Â 1.64% ( p <Â 0.01). At the voxel level, nnUnet is in general superior or comparable to nnDetection. The proposed ensemble methods achieve improved or comparable lesion-level accuracy, in all tested clinical scenarios. For example, at 3 false positives, the lesion-wise ensemble method achieves 82.24%Â Â±Â 1.43% sensitivity versus 80.78%Â Â±Â 1.50% (nnDetection) and 60.40%Â Â±Â 1.64% (nnUNet) for detecting PIRADS â¥ 3 lesions.

  abstract     = {Real-time water-medium endoscopic images can assist doctors in performing operations such as tissue cleaning and nucleus pulpous removal. During medical operating procedures, it is inevitable that tissue particles, debris and other contaminants will be suspended within the viewing area, resulting in blurred images and the loss of surface details in biological tissues. Currently, few studies have focused on enhancing such endoscopic images. This paper proposes a water-medium endoscopic image processing method based on dual transmittance in accordance with the imaging characteristics of spinal endoscopy. By establishing an underwater imaging model for spinal endoscopy, we estimate the transmittance of the endoscopic images based on the boundary constraints and local image contrast. The two transmittances are then fused and combined with transmittance maps and ambient light estimations to restore the images before attenuation, ultimately enhancing the details and texture of the images. Experiments comparing classical image enhancement algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could effectively improve the quality of spinal endoscopic images.},

  abstract     = {Robots are increasingly expected to replace humans in many repetitive and high-precision tasks, of which surface scanning is a typical example. However, it is usually difficult for a robot to independently deal with a surface scanning task with uncertainties in, for example the irregular surface shapes and surface properties. Moreover, it usually requires surface modelling with additional sensors, which might be time-consuming and costly. A human-robot collaboration-based approach that allows a human user and a robot to assist each other in scanning uncertain surfaces with uniform properties, such as scanning human skin in ultrasound examination is proposed. In this approach, teleoperation is used to obtain the operator's intent while allowing the operator to operate remotely. After external force perception and friction estimation, the orientation of the robot end-effector can be autonomously adjusted to keep as perpendicular to the surface as possible. Force control enables the robotic manipulator to maintain a constant contact force with the surface. And hybrid force/motion control ensures that force, position, and pose can be regulated without interfering with each other while reducing the operator's workload. The proposed method is validated using the Elite robot to perform a mock B-ultrasound scanning experiment.},

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis is a major cause of bone fracture and can be characterised by both mass loss and microstructure deterioration of the bone. The modern way of osteoporosis assessment is through the measurement of bone mineral density, which is not able to unveil the pathological condition from the mesoscale aspect. To obtain mesoscale information from computed tomography (CT), the super-resolution (SR) approach for volumetric imaging data is required. A deep learning model AESR3D is proposed to recover high-resolution (HR) Micro-CT from low-resolution Micro-CT and implement an unsupervised segmentation for better trabecular observation and measurement. A new regularisation overcomplete autoencoder framework for the SR task is proposed and theoretically analysed. The best performance is achieved on structural similarity measure of trabecular CT SR task compared with the state-of-the-art models in both natural and medical image SR tasks. The HR and SR images show a high correlation ( r =Â 0.996, intraclass correlation coefficientsÂ =Â 0.917) on trabecular bone morphological indicators. The results also prove the effectiveness of our regularisation framework when training a large capacity model.},

  abstract     = {Conventional model transfer techniques, requiring the labelled source data, are not applicable in the privacy-protected medical fields. For the challenging scenarios, recent source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has become a mainstream solution but losing focus on the inter-sample class information. This paper proposes a new Credible Local Context Representation approach for SFDA. Our main idea is to exploit the credible local context for more discriminative representation. Specifically, we enhance the source model's discrimination by information regulating. To capture the context, a discovery method is developed that performs fixed steps walking in deep space and takes the credible features in this path as the context. In the epoch-wise adaptation, deep clustering-like training is conducted with two major updates. First, the context for all target data is constructed and then the context-fused pseudo-labels providing semantic guidance are generated. Second, for each target data, a weighting fusion on its context forms the anchored neighbourhood structure; thus, the deep clustering is switched from individual-based to coarse-grained. Also, a new regularisation building is developed on the anchored neighbourhood to drive the deep coarse-grained learning. Experiments on three benchmarks indicate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the link prediction algorithms primarily focus on studying the interaction between nodes based on chain structure and star structure, which predominantly rely on low-order structural information and do not explore the multivariate interactions between nodes from the perspective of higher-order structural information present in the network. The cycle structure is a higher-order structure that lies between the star and clique structures, where all nodes within the same cycle can interact with each other, even in the absence of direct edges. If a node is encompassed by multiple cycles, it indicates that the node interacts and associates with a greater number of nodes in the network, and it means the node is more important in the network to some extent. Furthermore, if two nodes are included in multiple cycles, it signifies the two nodes are more likely to be connected. Therefore, firstly, a multi-information fusion node importance algorithm based on the cycle structure information is proposed, which integrates both high-order and low-order structural information. Secondly, the obtained integrated structure information and node feature information is regarded as the input features, a two-channel graph neural network model is designed to learn the cycle structure information. Then, the cycle structure information is utilised for the task of link prediction, and a graph neural link predictor with multi-information interactions based on the cycle structure is developed. Finally, extensive experimental validation and analysis show that the node ranking result of the proposed node importance index is more consistent with the actual situation, the proposed graph neural network model can effectively learn the cycle structure information, and using higher-order structural informationâcycle information proves to significantly enhance the overall link prediction performance.},

Specifically, it shows deficiencies in terms of limited local exploration capabilities and less precise solutions. Therefore, this research aims to integrate the topological search (TS) mechanism with the gradient search rule (GSR) into the framework of RUN, introducing an enhanced algorithm called TGRUN to improve the performance of the original algorithm. The TS mechanism employs a circular topological scheme to conduct a thorough exploration of solution regions surrounding each solution, enabling a careful examination of valuable solution areas and enhancing the algorithmâs effectiveness in local exploration. To prevent the algorithm from becoming trapped in local optima, the GSR also integrates gradient descent principles to direct the algorithm in a wider investigation of the global solution space. This study conducted a serious of experiments on the IEEE CEC2017 comprehensive benchmark function to assess the enhanced effectiveness of TGRUN. Additionally, the evaluation includes real-world engineering design and feature selection problems serving as an additional test for assessing the optimisation capabilities of the algorithm. The validation outcomes indicate a significant improvement in the optimisation capabilities and solution accuracy of TGRUN.},

  abstract     = {Most prevailing attention mechanism modules in contemporary research are convolution-based modules, and while these modules contribute to enhancing the accuracy of deep learning networks in visual tasks, they concurrently augment the overall model complexity. To address the problem, this paper proposes a plug-and-play algorithm that does not increase the complexity of the model, Laplacian attention (LA). The LA algorithm first calculates the similarity distance between feature points in the feature space and feature channel and constructs the residual Laplacian matrix between feature points through the similarity distance and Gaussian kernel. This construction serves to segregate non-similar feature points while aggregating those with similarities. Ultimately, the LA algorithm allocates the outputs of the feature channel and the feature space adaptively to derive the final LA outputs. Crucially, the LA algorithm is confined to the forward computation process and does not involve backpropagation or any parameter learning. The LA algorithm undergoes comprehensive experimentation on three distinct datasetsânamely Cifar-10, miniImageNet, and Pascal VOC 2012. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the advanced attention mechanism modules in recent years, such as SENet, CBAM, ECANet, coordinate attention, and triplet attention, the LA algorithm exhibits superior performance across image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.},

As IoT systems become increasingly prevalent, secure and efficient data transmission becomes crucial. The proposed algorithm addresses this need by offering a robust yet resource-efficient solution for image encryption. Traditional image encryption relies on confusion and diffusion steps. These stages are generally implemented linearly, but this work introduces a new RSP (Random Strip Peeling) algorithm for the confusion step, which disrupts linearity in the lightweight category by using two different sequences generated by the 1D Tent Map with varying initial conditions. The diffusion stage then employs an XOR matrix generated by the Logistic Map. Different evaluation metrics, such as entropy analysis, key sensitivity, statistical and differential attacks resistance, and robustness analysis demonstrate the proposed algorithm's lightweight, robust, and efficient. The proposed encryption scheme achieved average metric values of 99.6056 for NPCR, 33.4397 for UACI, and 7.9914 for information entropy in the SIPI image dataset.

By combining prior dynamic knowledge and actual sampled data, the proposed approach effectively mitigates the defect caused by the inaccurate dynamic model and significantly improves the training speed of the ADP algorithm. Initially, the dataset is enriched with sufficient reference data collected based on a nominal model without considering modelling bias. Also, the control object interacts with the real environment and continuously gathers adequate sampled data in the dataset. To comprehensively leverage the advantages of model-based and model-free methods during training, an adaptive tuning factor is introduced based on the dataset that possesses model-referenced information and conforms to the distribution of the real-world environment, which balances the influence of model-based control law and data-driven policy gradient on the direction of policy improvement. As a result, the proposed approach accelerates the learning speed compared to data-driven methods, concurrently also enhancing the tracking performance in comparison to model-based control methods. Moreover, the optimal control problem under disturbances is formulated as a zero-sum game, and the actor-critic-disturbance framework is introduced to approximate the optimal control input, cost function, and disturbance policy, respectively. Furthermore, the convergence property of the proposed algorithm based on the value iteration method is analysed. Finally, an example of AUV path following based on the improved line-of-sight guidance is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

These limitations hinder the ability of systems to provide highly accurate and personalised recommendations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a clustering-based recommendation method that integrates an enhanced Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (GOA), termed LCGOA, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of recommendation systems by optimising cluster centroids in a dynamic environment. By combining the K-means algorithm with the enhanced GOA, which incorporates a LÃ©vy flight mechanism and multi-strategy co-evolution, our method overcomes the centroid sensitivity issue, a key limitation in traditional clustering techniques. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that the proposed LCGOA-based method significantly outperforms conventional recommendation algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy, offering more relevant content to users and driving greater customer satisfaction and business growth.},

In this study, the authors aim to explore the potential of unsupervised learning methods in classifying different types of skin lesions in dermatoscopic images.

To achieve this, enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN) was fine-tuned to strengthen the resolution of skin lesion images, making critical features more visible. The authors extracted histogram features to capture essential colour characteristics and used the DaviesâBouldin index and silhouette score to determine optimal clusters. Fine-tuned k-means clustering with Euclidean distance in the histogram feature space achieved 87.77% and 90.5% test accuracies on the ISIC2019 and HAM10000 datasets, respectively.

  abstract     = {Existing Chinese named entity recognition (NER) research utilises 1D lexicon-based sequence labelling frameworks, which can only recognise flat entities. While lexicons serve as prior knowledge and enhance semantic information, they also pose completeness and resource requirements limitations. This paper proposes a template-based classification (TC) model to avoid lexicon issues and to identify nested entities. Template-based classification provides a template word for each entity type, which utilises contrastive learning to integrate the common characteristics among entities with the same category. Contrastive learning makes template words the centre points of their category in the vector space, thus improving generalisation ability. Additionally, TC presents a 2D table-filling label scheme that classifies entities based on the attention distribution of template words. The proposed novel decoder algorithm enables TC recognition of both flat and nested entities simultaneously. Experimental results show that TC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on five Chinese datasets.},

  abstract     = {Acute Bilirubin Encephalopathy (ABE) is a significant threat to neonates and it leads to disability and high mortality rates. Detecting and treating ABE promptly is important to prevent further complications and long-term issues. Recent studies have explored ABE diagnosis. However, they often face limitations in classification due to reliance on a single modality of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). To tackle this problem, the authors propose a Tri-M2MT model for precise ABE detection by using tri-modality MRI scans. The scans include T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and apparent diffusion coefficient maps to get indepth information. Initially, the tri-modality MRI scans are collected and preprocessesed by using an Advanced Gaussian Filter for noise reduction and Z -score normalisation for data standardisation. An Advanced Capsule Network was utilised to extract relevant features by using Snake Optimization Algorithm to select optimal features based on feature correlation with the aim of minimising complexity and enhancing detection accuracy. Furthermore, a multi-transformer approach was used for feature fusion and identify feature correlations effectively. Finally, accurate ABE diagnosis is achieved through the utilisation of a SoftMax layer. The performance of the proposed Tri-M2MT model is evaluated across various metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis, and the proposed methodology provides better performance compared to existing methodologies.},

To enhance the performance of deep learning-based methods in practical applications, the authors propose Dense-YOLO, a fast surface defect detection network that combines the strengths of DenseNet and you only look once version 3 (YOLOv3). The authors design a lightweight backbone network with improved densely connected blocks, optimising the utilisation of shallow features while maintaining high detection speeds. Additionally, the authors refine the feature pyramid network of YOLOv3 to increase the recall of tiny defects and overall positioning accuracy. Furthermore, an online multi-angle template matching technique is introduced based on normalised cross-correlation to precisely locate the detection area. This refined template matching method not only accelerates detection speed but also mitigates the influence of the background. To validate the effectiveness of our enhancements, the authors conduct comparative experiments across two private datasets and one public dataset. Results show that Dense-YOLO outperforms existing methods, such as faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7, and SSD, in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and detection speed. Moreover, Dense-YOLO outperforms networks inherited from VGG and ResNet, including improved faster R-CNN, FCOS, M2Det-320 and FRCN, in mAP.},

The point of this task is how to synthesise person image from a single source image under arbitrary poses. Prior methods generate the person image with target pose well; however, they fail to preserve the fine style details of the source image. To address this problem, a robust style injection (RSI) model is proposed, which is a coarse-to-fine framework to synthesise target the person image. RSI develops a simple and efficient cross-attention based module to fuse the features of both source semantic styles and target pose for achieving the coarse aligned features. The adaptive instance normalisation is employed to enhance the aligned features in conjunction with source semantic styles. Subsequently, source semantic styles are further injected into the positional normalisation scheme to avoid the fine style details erosion caused by massive convolution. In training losses, optimal transport theory in the form of energy distance is introduced to constrain data distribution to refine the texture style details. Additionally, the authorsâ model is capable of editing the shape and texture of garments to the target style separately. The experiments demonstrate that the authorsâ RSI achieves better performance over the state-of-art methods.},

Human gait classification in video sequences is an important biometrics attribute and is used for security purposes. A new framework for human gait classification in video sequences using deep learning (DL) fusion assisted and posterior probability-based moth flames optimization (MFO) is proposed. In the first step, the video frames are resized and fine-tuned by two pre-trained lightweight DL models, EfficientNetB0 and MobileNetV2. Both models are selected based on the top-5 accuracy and less number of parameters. Later, both models are trained through deep transfer learning and extracted deep features fused using a voting scheme. In the last step, the authors develop a posterior probability-based MFO feature selection algorithm to select the best features. The selected features are classified using several supervised learning methods. The CASIA-B publicly available dataset has been employed for the experimental process. On this dataset, the authors selected six angles such as 0Â°, 18Â°, 90Â°, 108Â°, 162Â°, and 180Â° and obtained an average accuracy of 96.9%, 95.7%, 86.8%, 90.0%, 95.1%, and 99.7%.

Then, five external sentiments are introduced to prompt the model learning sentimental preferences among modalities. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of verbal descriptions embedded in illustrations and incorporate additional knowledge-sharing modules to fuse such image-like features.

  abstract     = {Audio-visual scene classification (AVSC) poses a formidable challenge owing to the intricate spatial-temporal relationships exhibited by audio-visual signals, coupled with the complex spatial patterns of objects and textures found in visual images. The focus of recent studies has predominantly revolved around extracting features from diverse neural network structures, inadvertently neglecting the acquisition of semantically meaningful regions and crucial components within audio-visual data. The authors present a feature pyramid attention network (FPANet) for audio-visual scene understanding, which extracts semantically significant characteristics from audio-visual data. The authorsâ approach builds multi-scale hierarchical features of sound spectrograms and visual images using a feature pyramid representation and localises the semantically relevant regions with a feature pyramid attention module (FPAM). A dimension alignment (DA) strategy is employed to align feature maps from multiple layers, a pyramid spatial attention (PSA) to spatially locate essential regions, and a pyramid channel attention (PCA) to pinpoint significant temporal frames. Experiments on visual scene classification (VSC), audio scene classification (ASC), and AVSC tasks demonstrate that FPANet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, with a 95.9 F1-score on the ADVANCE dataset and a relative improvement of 28.8%. Visualisation results show that FPANet can prioritise semantically meaningful areas in audio-visual signals.},

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) was incorporated into the FP model to attain the minimum exit temperature for the hot kerosene process stream under varying process conditions. A dataset comprised of optimum process conditions was generated through FP-GA integration and was utilised to develop an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model. Subsequently, the ANN model was merged with the FP model by substituting the GA, to form a GB model. The developed GB model, that is, ANN and FP integration, achieved higher effectiveness and lower outlet temperature than those derived through the standalone FP model. Performance of the GB framework was also comparable to the FP-GA approach but it significantly reduced the computation time required for estimating the optimum process conditions. The proposed GB-based method improved the STHE's ability to extract energy from the process stream and strengthened its resilience to cope with diverse process conditions.},

The transformer can extract the global information well but adapting it to small medical datasets is challenging and its computational complexity can be heavy. In this work, a serial and parallel network is proposed for the accurate 3D medical image segmentation by combining CNN and transformer and promoting feature interactions across various semantic levels. The core components of the proposed method include the cross window self-attention based transformer (CWST) and multi-scale local enhanced (MLE) modules. The CWST module enhances the global context understanding by partitioning 3D images into non-overlapping windows and calculating sparse global attention between windows. The MLE module selectively fuses features by computing the voxel attention between different branch features, and uses convolution to strengthen the dense local information. The experiments on the prostate, atrium, and pancreas MR/CT image datasets consistently demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over six popular segmentation models in both qualitative evaluation and quantitative indexes such as dice similarity coefficient, Intersection over Union, 95% Hausdorff distance and average symmetric surface distance.},

A novel deep time series aggregation scheme (DTSAs) is proposed to generate typical operational scenarios, considering the large amount of historical operational snapshot data. Specifically, DTSAs analyse the intrinsic mechanisms of different scheduling operational scenario switching to mathematically represent typical operational scenarios. A Gramian angular summation field-based operational scenario image encoder was designed to convert operational scenario sequences into high-dimensional spaces. This enables DTSAs to fully capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of new power systems using deep feature iterative aggregation models. The encoder also facilitates the generation of typical operational scenarios that conform to historical data distributions while ensuring the integrity of grid operational snapshots. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method extracted new fine-grained power system dispatch schemes and outperformed the latest high-dimensional feature-screening methods. In addition, experiments with different new energy access ratios were conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed method. DTSAs enable dispatchers to master the operation experience of the power system in advance, and actively respond to the dynamic changes of the operation scenarios under the high access rate of new energy.},

In this paper, a novel training-free method that utilises the Pre-Trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) model as a data augmentation tool (PTSAM-DA) is proposed to generate the augmented annotations for images. Without the need for training, it obtains prompt boxes from the original annotations and then feeds the boxes to the pre-trained SAM to generate diverse and improved annotations. In this way, annotations are augmented more ingenious than simple manipulations without incurring huge computation for training a data augmentation model. Multiple comparative experiments on three datasets are conducted, including an in-house dataset, ADE20K and COCO2017. On this in-house dataset, namely Agricultural Plot Segmentation Dataset, maximum improvements of 3.77% and 8.92% are gained in two mainstream metrics, mIoU and mAcc, respectively.

Only one feature extractor block is used in each level of the encoder and decoder. Normally, images degrade quality and lose important information during down-sampling. To overcome this loss, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) alongside max-pooling is used in the down-sampling process. Inverse DWT is used to regenerate original images during up-sampling. In the bottleneck of the proposed model, atrous spatial channel pyramid pooling (ASCPP) is used to extract effective high-level features. The ASCPP is the modified pyramid pooling having atrous layers to increase the area of the receptive field. Spatial and channel-based attention are used to focus on the location and class of the identified objects. Finally, watershed transform is used as a post processing technique to identify and refine touching boundaries of nuclei. Nuclei are identified and counted to facilitate pathologists. The same domain of transfer learning is used to retrain the model for domain adaptability. Results of the proposed model are compared with state-of-the-art models, and it outperformed the existing studies.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz imaging technology has great potential applications in areas, such as remote sensing, navigation, security checks, and so on. However, terahertz images usually have the problems of heavy noises and low resolution. Previous terahertz image denoising methods are mainly based on traditional image processing methods, which have limited denoising effects on the terahertz noise. Existing deep learning-based image denoising methods are mostly used in natural images and easily cause a large amount of detail loss when denoising terahertz images. Here, a residual-learning-based multiscale hybrid-convolution residual network (MHRNet) is proposed for terahertz image denoising, which can remove noises while preserving detail features in terahertz images. Specifically, a multiscale hybrid-convolution residual block (MHRB) is designed to extract rich detail features and local prediction residual noise from terahertz images. Specifically, MHRB is a residual structure composed of a multiscale dilated convolution block, a bottleneck layer, and a multiscale convolution block. MHRNet uses the MHRB and global residual learning to achieve terahertz image denoising. Ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of MHRB. A series of experiments are conducted on the public terahertz image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MHRNet has an excellent denoising effect on synthetic and real noisy terahertz images. Compared with existing methods, MHRNet achieves comprehensive competitive results.},

  abstract     = {Offline policy evaluation, evaluating and selecting complex policies for decision-making by only using offline datasets is important in reinforcement learning. At present, the model-based offline policy evaluation (MBOPE) is widely welcomed because of its easy to implement and good performance. MBOPE directly approximates the unknown value of a given policy using the Monte Carlo method given the estimated transition and reward functions of the environment. Usually, multiple models are trained, and then one of them is selected to be used. However, a challenge remains in selecting an appropriate model from those trained for further use. The authors first analyse the upper bound of the difference between the approximated value and the unknown true value. Theoretical results show that this difference is related to the trajectories generated by the given policy on the learnt model and the prediction error of the transition and reward functions at these generated data points. Based on the theoretical results, a new criterion is proposed to tell which trained model is better suited for evaluating the given policy. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed criterion is demonstrated on both benchmark and synthetic offline datasets.},

Medical imaging still faces a number of difficulties, including intra-class similarity, a scarcity of training data, and poor contrast skin lesions, notably in the case of skin cancer. An optimisation-aided deep learning-based system is proposed for accurate multi-class skin lesion identification. The sequential procedures of the proposed system start with preprocessing and end with categorisation. The preprocessing step is where a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is initially proposed for lesion identification with healthy regions. Instead of flipping and rotating data, the outputs from the middle phases of the hybrid enhanced technique are employed for data augmentation in the next step. Next, two pre-trained deep learning models, MobileNetV2 and NasNet Mobile, are trained using deep transfer learning on the upgraded enriched dataset. Later, a dual-threshold serial approach is employed to obtain and combine the features of both models. The next step was the variance-controlled Marine Predator methodology, which the authors proposed as a superior optimisation method. The top features from the fused feature vector are classified using machine learning classifiers. The experimental strategy provided enhanced accuracy of 94.4% using the publicly available dataset HAM10000. Additionally, the proposed framework is evaluated compared to current approaches, with remarkable results.},

The fusion of visible and near-infrared (NIR) aims to enhance the quality of images acquired by video monitoring systems for the ease of user observation and data processing. Unfortunately, current fusion algorithms produce artefacts and colour distortion since they cannot make use of spectrum properties and are lacking in information complementarity. Therefore, an information complementarity fusion (ICF) model is designed based on physical signals. In order to separate high-frequency noise from important information in distinct frequency layers, the authors first extracted texture-scale and edge-scale layers using a two-scale filter. Second, the difference map between visible and near-infrared was filtered using the extended-DoG filter to produce the initial visible-NIR complementary weight map. Then, to generate a guide map, the near-infrared image with night adjustment was processed as well. The final complementarity weight map was subsequently derived via an arctanI function mapping using the guide map and the initial weight maps. Finally, fusion images were generated with the complementarity weight maps. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both avoiding artificial colours as well as effectively utilising information complementarity.},

Optimised datasets were utilised to develop an artificial neural networks (ANN) model for the prediction of optimum values of cut points. The ANN model was then used to replace the hybrid framework of the Taguchi method and the GA. The integration of the ANN and FP model makes it a grey-box (GB) model. For the case of Zamama crude, the GB model helped in the decrease of up to 38.93% in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and an 8.2% increase in diesel production compared to the stand-alone FP model under uncertainty. Similarly, for Kunnar crude, up to 18.87% decrease in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and a 33.96% increase in diesel production was observed in comparison to the stand-alone FP model.},

  abstract     = {Bilingual lexicon induction focuses on learning word translation pairs, also known as bitexts, from monolingual corpora by establishing a mapping between the source and target embedding spaces. Despite recent advancements, bilingual lexicon induction is limited to inducing bitexts consisting of individual words, lacking the ability to handle semantics-rich phrases. To bridge this gap and support downstream cross-lingual tasks, it is practical to develop a method for bilingual phrase induction that extracts bilingual phrase pairs from monolingual corpora without relying on cross-lingual knowledge. In this paper, the authors propose a novel phrase embedding training method based on the skip-gram structure. Specifically, a local hard negative sampling strategy that utilises negative samples of central tokens in sliding windows to enhance phrase embedding learning is introduced. The proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with exceptional results recorded for distant languages. Additionally, we develop a phrase representation learning method that leverages multilingual pre-trained language models. These mPLMs-based representations can be combined with the above-mentioned static phrase embeddings to further improve the accuracy of the bilingual phrase induction task. We manually construct a dataset of bilingual phrase pairs and integrate it with MUSE to facilitate the bilingual phrase induction task.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent sorting is an important prerequisite for the full quantitative consumption and harmless disposal of kitchen waste. The existing object detection method based on an ImageNet pre-trained model is an effective way of sorting. Owing to significant domain gaps between natural images and kitchen waste images, it is difficult to reflect the characteristics of diverse scales and dense distribution in kitchen waste based on an ImageNet pre-trained model, leading to poor generalisation. In this article, the authors propose the first pre-trained model for kitchen waste sorting called KitWaSor, which combines both contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modelling (MIM) through self-supervised learning (SSL). First, to address the issue of diverse scales, the authors propose a mixed masking strategy by introducing an incomplete masking branch based on the original random masking branch. It prevents the complete loss of small-scale objects while avoiding excessive leakage of large-scale object pixels. Second, to address the issue of dense distribution, the authors introduce semantic consistency constraints on the basis of the mixed masking strategy. That is, object semantic reasoning is performed through semantic consistency constraints to compensate for the lack of contextual information. To train KitWaSor, the authors construct the first million-level kitchen waste dataset across seasonal and regional distributions, named KWD-Million. Extensive experiments show that KitWaSor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the two most relevant downstream tasks for kitchen waste sorting (i.e. image classification and object detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed KitWaSor.},

  abstract     = {Images obtained from hyperspectral sensors provide information about the target area that extends beyond the visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to sensor limitations and imperfections during the image acquisition and transmission phases, noise is introduced into the acquired image, which can have a negative impact on downstream analyses such as classification, target tracking, and spectral unmixing. Noise in hyperspectral images (HSI) is modelled as a combination from several sources, including Gaussian/impulse noise, stripes, and deadlines. An HSI restoration method for such a mixed noise model is proposed. First , a joint optimisation framework is proposed for recovering hyperspectral data corrupted by mixed Gaussian-impulse noise by estimating both the clean data as well as the sparse/impulse noise levels. Second , a hyper-Laplacian prior is used along both the spatial and spectral dimensions to express sparsity in clean image gradients. Third , to model the sparse nature of impulse noise, an â 1 âÂ norm over the impulse noise gradient is used. Because the proposed methodology employs two distinct priors, the authors refer to it as the hyperspectral dual prior (HySpDualP) denoiser. To the best of authors' knowledge, this joint optimisation framework is the first attempt in this direction. To handle the non-smooth and non-convex nature of the general âp âÂ norm-based regularisation term, a generalised shrinkage/thresholding (GST) solver is employed. Finally , an efficient split-Bregman approach is used to solve the resulting optimisation problem. Experimental results on synthetic data and real HSI datacube obtained from hyperspectral sensors demonstrate that the authorsâ proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both visually and in terms of various image quality assessment metrics.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data always exhibit an imbalanced and long-tailed distribution, which leads to poor performance for neural network-based classification. Existing methods mainly tackle this problem by reweighting the loss function or rebalancing the classifier. However, one crucial aspect overlooked by previous research studies is the imbalanced feature space problem caused by the imbalanced angle distribution. In this paper, the authors shed light on the significance of the angle distribution in achieving a balanced feature space, which is essential for improving model performance under long-tailed distributions. Nevertheless, it is challenging to effectively balance both the classifier norms and angle distribution due to problems such as the low feature norm. To tackle these challenges, the authors first thoroughly analyse the classifier and feature space by decoupling the classification logits into three key components: classifier norm (i.e. the magnitude of the classifier vector), feature norm (i.e. the magnitude of the feature vector), and cosine similarity between the classifier vector and feature vector. In this way, the authors analyse the change of each component in the training process and reveal three critical problems that should be solved, that is, the imbalanced angle distribution, the lack of feature discrimination, and the low feature norm. Drawing from this analysis, the authors propose a novel loss function that incorporates hyperspherical uniformity, additive angular margin, and feature norm regularisation. Each component of the loss function addresses a specific problem and synergistically contributes to achieving a balanced classifier and feature space. The authors conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. The experimental results demonstrate that the authorsâ loss function outperforms several previous state-of-the-art methods in addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced and long-tailed datasets, that is, by improving upon the best-performing baselines on CIFAR-100-LT by 1.34, 1.41, 1.41 and 1.33, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI), the detrimental influence of noise and distortions on data quality is profound, which has severely affected the following-on analytics and decision-making such as land mapping. This study presents an innovative framework for assessing HSI band quality and reconstructing the low-quality bands, based on the Prophet model. By introducing a comprehensive quality metric to start, the authors approach factors in both spatial and spectral characteristics across local and global scales. This metric effectively captures the intricate noise and distortions inherent in the HSI data. Subsequently, the authors employ the Prophet model to forecast information within the low-quality bands, leveraging insights from neighbouring high-quality bands. To validate the effectiveness of the authorsâ proposed model, extensive experiments on three publicly available uncorrected datasets are conducted. In a head-to-head comparison, the framework against six state-of-the-art band reconstruction algorithms including three spectral methods, two spatial-spectral methods and one deep learning method is benchmarked. The authorsâ experiments also delve into strategies for band selection based on quality metrics and the quality evaluation of the reconstructed bands. In addition, the authors assess the classification accuracy utilising these reconstructed bands. In various experiments, the results consistently affirm the efficacy of the authorsâ method in HSI quality assessment and band reconstruction. Notably, the authorsâ approach obviates the need for manually prefiltering of noisy bands. This comprehensive framework holds promise in addressing HSI data quality concerns whilst enhancing the overall utility of HSI.},

  abstract     = {Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) possesses robust disturbance rejection capabilities, making it well-suited for longitudinal velocity control. However, the conventional Extended State Observer (ESO) in ADRC fails to fully exploit feedback from first-order and higher-order estimation errors and tracking error simultaneously, thereby diminishing the control performance of ADRC. To address this limitation, an enhanced car-following algorithm utilising ADRC is proposed, which integrates the improved ESO with a feedback controller. In comparison to the conventional ESO,Â the enhanced version effectively utilises multi-order estimation and tracking errors. Specifically, it enhances convergence rates by incorporating feedback from higher-order estimation errors and ensures the estimated value converges to the reference value by utilising tracking error feedback. The improved ESO significantly enhances the disturbance rejection performance of ADRC. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through the Lyapunov approach and experiments.},
