The H ∞ control system and the secondary regulation electro-hydraulic drive system of the mobile platform are designed. In view of the nonlinear characteristics such as dead zone, hysteresis loop, and Coulomb friction of the secondary regulation hydrostatic transmission system, the Hamiltonian form of the system was constructed by applying the Hamiltonian functional method. Based on the Hamiltonian function, the robust controller was designed, and simulation and experimental studies were carried out. Good control performance was achieved, and the dynamic characteristics of the system were significantly improved, such as faster response, minimal overshoot, and reduced static error.

  abstract     = {With the exponential growth of multimedia content, visual sentiment classification has emerged as a significant research area. However, it poses unique challenges due to the complexity and subjective nature of the visual information. This can be attributed to the significant presence of semantically ambiguous images within the current benchmark datasets, which enhances the performance of sentiment analysis but ignores the differences between various annotators. Moreover, most current methods concentrate on improving local emotional representations that focus on object extraction procedures rather than utilizing robust features that can effectively indicate the relevance of objects within an image through color information. Motivated by these observations, this paper addresses the need for efficient algorithms for labeling and classifying sentiment from visual images by introducing a novel hybrid model, which combines content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and a multi-input convolutional neural network (CNN). The CBIR model extracts color features from all dataset images, creating a numerical representation for each. It compares a query image to dataset images’ features to find similar features. This process continues until the images are grouped according to color similarity, which allows accurate sentimental categories based on similar features and feelings. Then, a multi-input CNN model is utilized to extract and efficiently incorporate high-level contextual visual information. This model comprises 70 layers, with six branches, each containing 11 layers. It seeks to facilitate the fusion of complementary information by incorporating multiple input categories that differ according to the color features extracted by the CBIR technique. This feature enables the model to understand the target and generate more precise predictions fully. The proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over existing algorithms, as evidenced by evaluations of six benchmark datasets of varying sizes. Also, it outperforms the state of the art in sentiment classification accuracy, getting 87.88%, 84.62%, 84.1%, 83.7%, 80.7%, and 91.2% accuracy for the EmotionROI, ArtPhoto, Twitter I, Twitter II, Abstract, and FI datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the model is evaluated on two newly collected large datasets, which confirm its scalability and robustness in handling large-scale sentiment classification tasks, and thus achieves a significant accuracy of 85.21% and 83.72% with the BGETTY and Twitter datasets, respectively. This paper contributes to the advancement of visual sentiment classification by offering a comprehensive solution for analyzing sentiment from images and laying the foundation for further research.},

  abstract     = {Current​ fine-tuning techniques for large pretrained language models (LLMs) face significant challenges, particularly regarding the high computational costs associated with adapting billions of parameters and their limitations in effectively addressing diverse language understanding tasks. These methods often result in an inability to manage inter-task dependencies effectively, leading to underutilization of inter-task information. To address these issues, we propose tasks-embedded reparameterization (TER), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that exploits multitask learning to enhance task-specific capabilities. The TER model integrates prompt tuning and multitask reparameterization, merging task-specific experts and hidden states of target tasks in a unified model framework. Furthermore, it employs a dynamic, task-oriented gating mechanism to optimize the prompts output by the model. This method dynamically adjusts the parameters according to the differing requirements of the task, ensuring that the model optimally adjusts the parameters according to the specific requirements of the task, so that the task can find a suitable balance between different tasks and improve knowledge sharing and task adaptability. Experimental evaluations using the SuperGLUE benchmark demonstrate that TER consistently outperforms existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques in both performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for task-specific language understanding in both research and industry.},

  abstract     = {The extensive coverage of satellite constellations has rendered the satellite–terrestrial integrated network (STIN) a pivotal solution for communication and computation services in internet of vehicles (IoVs) rescuing in remote or disaster areas with limited terrestrial networks. To optimise network resource utilisation and service quality, the integration of the service function chain (SFC) into STIN-enabled IoV rescuing systems has become essential. However, traditional SFC-based STIN systems encounter challenges in flow scheduling flexibility, stemming from the sequential execution of subtasks on satellites equipped with virtual network functions (VNFs). This leads to a trade-off between data volume reduction and the additional communication and computation energy costs incurred in the orbit. To address this issue, this paper introduces a space ground collaborative SFC (SGC-SFC) flow scheduling strategy. This strategy enables the execution of subtasks on either VNF-equipped satellites or the ground vehicle formation, contingent on network conditions. Firstly, we carry out a computation–space–time graph (CSTG) model specifically for the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system with SFC. This model integrates the computational layer into the space–time graph (STG), accurately capturing the data volume reduction characteristics and sequential execution constraints of SFC in the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system. Secondly, a SGC-SFC flow scheduling algorithm is designed to identify a set of feasible paths with minimal energy cost and maximum processable data volume. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SGC-SFC under diverse conditions.},

Meanwhile, the development of Deepfake detectors represents another branch of models striving to recognize AI-generated fake faces and protect people from the misinformation of Deepfake. This ongoing cat-and-mouse game between generation and detection has spurred a dynamic evolution in the landscape of Deepfake. This survey comprehensively studies recent advancements in Deepfake generation and detection techniques, focusing particularly on the utilization of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs). For both GAN-based and DM-based Deepfake generators, we categorize them based on whether they synthesize new content or manipulate existing content. Correspondingly, we examine various strategies employed to identify synthetic and manipulated Deepfake, respectively. Finally, we summarize our findings by discussing the unique capabilities and limitations of GANs and DM in the context of Deepfake. We also identify promising future directions for research, including the development of hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both GANs and DM, the exploration of novel detection strategies utilizing advanced AI techniques, and the ethical considerations surrounding the development of Deepfake. This survey paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to understand the state-of-the-art in Deepfake technology, its implications, and potential avenues for future research and development.},

  abstract     = {Due to the intricate chaotic environments encountered in distributed sensor applications, such as sea monitoring, machinery fault diagnosis, and EEG weak signal detection, neural networks often face insufficient data to effectively carry out detection tasks. In contrast to traditional machine learning models, a statistical approach employing multidimensional nonlinear correlation (MNC) exhibits an unparalleled signal pattern prediction capability and possesses a streamlined yet robust framework for signal processing. However, the direct application of MNC to weak pulse signal detection remains constrained. To surmount these challenges and achieve high-precision signal detection, we explore a novel MNC approach, integrating phase reconstruction and manifold broad learning, specifically tailored for distributed sensor fusion detection amidst chaotic noise. Initially, the distributed observational data undergoes phase space reconstruction, transforming it into fixed-size arrays. These reconstructed tuples are then processed through the high-dimensional sequence of manifold broad learning, serving as inputs for the nonlinear correlation module to extract spatiotemporal features. Subsequently, a MNC system augmented with a QRS detector layer is devised to predict and classify the presence of a weak pulse signal. This integrated MNC approach, combining phase reconstruction and broad learning, operates within an enhanced feature space of the source domain, realizing detection fusion across distributed sensors through a majority voting principle. Simulation studies and experiments conducted on sea clutter datasets demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed MNC method, leveraging phase reconstruction and manifold broad learning strategies, for distributed sensor weak pulse signal fusion detection within chaotic backgrounds.},

For the path query on graph data in the case of cloud outsourcing, it is necessary to consider both the construction of query algorithms and the protection of privacy information. The processing of graph privacy information through encryption, and then outsourcing to the cloud platform, is a common measure. The semantic-based path query supporting multikeyword search is an extended path query method, which can improve the query function. For users, it is very troublesome to access and process the encrypted graph data. In this article, we propose a protecting-privacy semantic-based multikeyword path query scheme on the ciphertext graph (PSMP). Firstly, based on the principle of searchable encryption and vector operation, a secure index is constructed, and then the cloud server uses the secure index to implement path queries. This article demonstrates its security through formal analysis and verifies its effectiveness through experimental comparison and analysis.

  abstract     = {With advancements of in-vehicle computing and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is increasingly capable of supporting Vehicle-oriented Edge Intelligence (VEI) applications, such as autonomous driving and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). However, IoV systems that rely solely on vehicular sensors often encounter limitations in forecasting events beyond current roadways, which are critical for regional transportation management. Moreover, the inherent temporal dependency in VEI application data poses risks of interruptions, impeding the seamless tracking of incremental information. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a joint task offloading and resource allocation strategy within an MEC environment that collaboratively integrates vehicles and Roadside Infrastructure Sensors (RISs). The strategy carefully considers the Doppler shift from vehicle mobility and the Tolerance for Interruptions of Incremental Information (T3I) in VEI applications. We establish a decision-making framework that actively balances delay, energy consumption, and the T3I metric by formulating the task offloading as a stochastic network optimization problem. Utilizing Lyapunov optimization, we dissect this complex problem into three targeted subproblems that include optimizing local computational capacity, MEC computational capacity and comprehensive offloading decisions. To tackle the efficient offloading, we develop algorithms that separately optimize offloading scheduling, channel allocation and transmission power control. Notably, we incorporate a Potential Minimum Point (PMP) algorithm to boost parallel processing and simplify computational scale through matrix decomposition. Evaluations of our algorithm show that it excels in both complexity and accuracy, with accuracy improvements ranging from 74.3% to 114.0% in asymmetric resource environments. Simulation and experimental studies on offloading performance validate the effectiveness of our framework, which significantly balances network performance, reduces latency, and improves system stability.},

  abstract     = {The multiobjective immune optimization algorithms (MOIAs) utilize the principle of clonal selection, iteratively evolving by replicating a small number of superior solutions to optimize decision vectors. However, this method often leads to a lack of diversity and is particularly ineffective when facing large-scale optimization problems. Moreover, an overemphasis on elite solutions may result in a large number of redundant offspring, reducing evolutionary efficiency. By delving into the causes of these issues, we find that a key factor is that existing algorithms overlook the role of weak solutions during the evolutionary process. With this in mind, we propose a weak population–empowered large-scale multiobjective immune algorithm (WP–MOIA). The core of this algorithm is to construct, in addition to the traditional elite population, a cooperative evolutionary population based on a portion of the remaining solutions, referred to as the weak population. During the evolution, both populations work together: the elite population maximizes its advantageous status for local searches, focusing on exploitation, while the weak population seeks greater variation to escape its disadvantaged position, engaging in broader exploration. At the same time, the sizes of both populations are dynamically adjusted to collaboratively maintain the balance of evolution. Through comparisons with nine state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and four powerful MOIAs on 30 benchmark problems, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both small-scale and large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), and exhibits better convergence efficiency. Especially in large-scale MOPs, the new algorithm’s performance nearly surpasses all 13 advanced algorithms being compared.},

The FDSS incorporates three sensors: an infrared camera, an optical camera, and a 3D LiDAR, as well as a fire suppression system mounted on a pan and tilt control system. The FDSS features three key characteristics. First, an ensemble learning network simultaneously classifies and detects fire/smoke regions by integrating a classification neural network, an object detection neural network, and a cumulative alarm. This novel architecture significantly improves fire detection accuracy and reduces false alarm rates. Second, multimodal information precisely localizes overheat and fire/smoke regions, enabling the FDSS to automatically aim and extinguish fires by controlling the pan and tilt system. Third, a graph-based neural network accurately classifies the affected components in the nacelle using point cloud data from the 3D LiDAR. This novel neural network for object classification provides sufficient information for the location of a fire accident. Field and virtual experiments conducted in a fire test room and virtual nacelle environments demonstrate the FDSS’s effectiveness. Quantitative comparisons of three deep learning networks further highlight that these neural networks outperform other state-of-the-art deep learning models. Consequently, the FDSS provides a cost-effective and autonomous surveillance solution, enhancing the safe operation of wind turbines with advanced technologies in the fourth industrial revolution.},

  abstract     = {Air quality modeling and forecasting has become a key problem in environmental protection. The existing prediction models typically require large-scale and high-quality historical data to achieve better performance. However, insufficient data volume and significant differences between data distribution across different regions will definitely reduce the effectiveness of the model reuse. To address the above issues, we propose a novel hybrid recurrent network based on domain adversarial transfer to achieve a stronger generalization ability when training air quality data from multisource domains. The proposed model mainly consists of three fundamental modules, i.e., feature extractor, regression predictor, and domain classifier. One-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) are used to extract temporal feature of data from source and target stations. Bi-directional gated recurrent unit (bi-GRU) and bi-directional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) are utilized to learn temporal dependencies pattern of multivariate time series data. Two adversarial transfer strategies are employed to ensure that our model is capable of finding domain invariant representations automatically. Experiments with different number of source domains are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed domain transfer strategies. The experimental results also show that our composite model has superior performance for forecasting air quality in various regions. As further evidence, the adversarial training method could promote the positive transfer and alleviate the negative effect of irrelevant source data. Besides, our model exhibits preferable generalization capability as more robust prediction results are achieved on both unseen target domains and original source domains.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technology, renowned for its foundational attributes of decentralization, security, and immutability, offers substantial potential for diverse applications. At the heart of blockchain functionality are consensus mechanisms, crucial for preserving the decentralized integrity of the network. However, traditional consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) typically require significant computational and communication resources, which may not be feasible for resource-limited environments. The purpose of this paper is to explore hybrid consensus algorithms that integrate conventional consensus mechanisms with advanced nonlinear data structures. We comprehensively analyze a wide range of hybrid consensus mechanisms, emphasizing their architectural design, operational efficiencies, and ability to address both consensus-specific vulnerabilities and network-level threats, such as Sybil attacks, double-spending, and partitioning attacks. To achieve this, we employ a set of comprehensive evaluation criteria for blockchain technologies, namely, validation, IoT, real-time processing, application suitability, security, and implementation. These criteria help assess the adaptability and efficacy of each mechanism in diverse operational contexts. Through this examination, the paper seeks to illuminate the significant contributions and implications of hybrid consensus mechanisms, guiding stakeholders, researchers, and developers toward making informed decisions about optimizing blockchain technology for their specific needs and inspiring the development of innovative solutions.},

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework that combines ARIMA-based virtual data generation with deepfake technology. ARIMA is used to predict and reconstruct missing physique data from historical records, while deepfake technology synthesizes virtual data that mimic the physical attributes of the test subjects. This hybrid approach enhances the robustness and accuracy of physique tests, especially in scenarios where data are incomplete.

  abstract     = {Prominent achievements of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been recognized in the last few years, but effective cooperation among agents remains a challenge. Traditional methods neglect the modeling of action semantic relations in the learning process of joint action latent representations. In other words, the uncertain semantic relations might hinder the learning of sophisticated cooperative relationships among actions, which may lead to homogeneous behaviors across all agents and their limited exploration efficiency. Our aim is to learn the structure of the action semantic space to improve the cooperation-aware representation for policy optimization of MARL. To achieve this, a scheme called graph learning of semantic relations (GLSR) is proposed, where action semantic embeddings and joint action representations are learned in a collaborative way. GLSR incorporates an action semantic encoder for capturing semantic relations in the action semantic space. By leveraging the cross-attention mechanism with action semantic embeddings, GLSR prompts the action semantic relations to guide mining the cooperation-aware joint action representations, implicitly facilitating agent cooperation in the joint policy space for more diverse behaviors of cooperative agents. The experimental results on challenging tasks demonstrate that GLSR attains state-of-the-art outcomes and shows robust performance in multiagent cooperative tasks.},

  abstract     = {The problem of environmental pollution has been extensively discussed, especially in the production phase of the supply chain. Many enterprises seek innovation and strive to achieve a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits. However, the cooperation and competition between enterprises are likely to cause the interruption of the supply chain. Therefore, by combining the green production strategy with supply chain risk management, this paper builds an evolutionary game model between suppliers and manufacturers, to deeply understand the impact of supply chain disruption on the choice of the green production strategy by suppliers and manufacturers and reveal the conditions under which the system evolves into different stability strategies. The results show that (1) under different conditions, the system will have an evolutionarily stable strategy. When the total revenue of green production alone by the supplier or manufacturer is greater than the expenditure and the cost of supply chain disruption is greater than the difference between the investment cost of green production and the total revenue of green production alone, the system will produce two different evolution results. (2) The cooperation willingness of the supplier and manufacturer, the investment cost of green production, and the risk coefficient of supply chain break will all affect the evolution trajectory of the system, and the greater the absolute difference between these factors and the threshold, the faster the system convergence speed. By formulating relevant policies, the system can meet the conditions of evolutionary stability strategy (1, 1), which can promote the upstream and downstream enterprises of the supply chain to realize cooperative green production faster. This paper contributes to the understanding of green supply chain management and evolutionary game theory, while providing insights into how companies along the supply chain can achieve cooperative green production for the benefit of society and the environment.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) plays a vital role in the intelligent transportation system. It is crucial to ensure secure communication among entities in the VANET for realizing an efficient transportation system. In this scenario, the current communication scheme is vulnerable to the leakage of private information from entities. The research primarily centers on single-domain vehicular networks, with only a limited number of researchers exploring cross-domain authentication among vehicle entities. Cross-domain communication schemes have received little attention from scholars. Furthermore, there are issues, including the susceptibility of in-vehicle conversations to eavesdropping, the vulnerability of long-distance transmissions to interruptions, and the exposure of wireless networks to traffic attacks. To address these issues, a multidomain secure communication and intelligent traffic detection model in VANET is proposed. This model offers several notable advantages as follows: (1) It employs a key self-verification algorithm for local computation and authentication of entity keys. This approach mitigates the risks of identity impersonation attacks and key leakage results from third-party key escrow. (2) A multidomain communication scheme is devised to categorize vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios into intradomain and interdomain, which correspond to situations where the communicating parties are within the same domain and across different domains, respectively. (3) We propose the implementation of new session message encryption algorithms for V2V communication. This involves generating dynamic random keys to ensure secure data sharing and facilitates long-distance cross-domain communication among vehicles. (4) An intelligent two-layer traffic detection paradigm is proposed to improve the efficiency of detecting attack traffic in vehicular networks. This paper provides security proofs and performance analysis of the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that within the communication module, the comparative scheme exhibits high computational demands and significant delays, whereas our approach provides superior security and better computational performance. Compared to the traditional detection model, our two-layer detection paradigm reduces model training time by 69–4477 ms and testing time by 9–1469 ms.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate anomaly causes interpretation provides insight into the root cause of information system anomalies, identifying the direct factors that trigger anomalies and revealing potential systemic flaws. However, current research generally focuses on two directions: on the one hand, anomaly diagnosis research for nodes with high anomaly degree; on the other hand, single-layer anomaly causes interpretation graph construction based on explicit features capturing anomaly locations and their neighborhood structures. These approaches pay insufficient attention to the attack defense of anomaly causes interpretation graph, thereby weakening the credibility and reliability of anomaly causation interpretation. Therefore, we systematically explore the attack strategy and defense mechanism of the multivariate anomaly causes interpretation graph. Firstly, we propose an adaptive learning method for constructing a dual-layer anomaly causes interpretation graph. The method reduces the dependence on artificial a priori assumptions by introducing an adaptive mechanism and realizes the dynamic decoupling of the spatiotemporal coupling relationships of multivariate data, thus providing a diversified perspective for the multivariate anomaly causes interpretation. Second, considering the vulnerability of the multivariate spatiotemporal correlation after decoupling and the structural characteristics of the dual-layer anomaly causes interpretation graph, we further propose a structural protection mechanism based on dual-layer complex networks to improve the structural robustness and resistance to the interference of anomaly causes interpretation graph. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed model by testing various attack defense scenarios such as noise attack, gradient attack, and structure attack. The experimental results show that the model in this paper can effectively defend against multiple attack methods and ensure the integrity and reliability of the anomaly causes interpretation graph.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as a complex neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia. In recent years, the emergence of multiview data has brought new possibilities for the diagnosis of AD. However, due to uneven density and uncertainty in the multiview data, existing algorithms still face challenges in extracting consistent and complementary information across views. To address this issue, a multiview fuzzy clustering algorithm, which integrates high-density knowledge point extraction and low-rank tensor regularization (K-LRT-MFC), is proposed in this paper. First, high-density knowledge point extraction is employed to tackle the issue of uneven density in high-dimensional data, enhancing the stability and accuracy of single-view clustering. Second, low-rank tensor regularization is applied to effectively capture high-order complementary information among multiview data, significantly improving the precision and computational efficiency of multiview clustering. Experimental results on several publicly available AD diagnostic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, providing an efficient and accurate solution for early AD diagnosis.},

Many international studies indicate that the start of drug abuse occurs mostly in adolescence, which is the period that young people spend in schools, institutes, and universities. Drugs in the student community have become a scourge that raises increasing concern, whether among families or educators, over the fate of school children and educational attainment. Regarding their behaviors, an addicted student often exhibits abnormal behaviors such as permanent lethargy, anxiety, tremors, and aggressive behavior toward others. Moreover, to obtain drugs, the addicted student becomes compelled to resort to various means and ways, and they gradually become criminal addicts. To this endeavor, a detector of abnormal behaviors in schools has become a necessity. In this paper, we built an automatic system able to analyze and detect abnormal behaviors of addicted students and inform the educational staff and parents to know how to manage and treat them. On a technical level, we used deep learning and the recent computer vision techniques in the suggested solution due to their contributions to human behavior and emotion recognition fields. The best-recorded result (97.5%) is obtained with fused handcrafted features based on skeleton joints and deep features extracted with the MobileNet pretrained model and forwarded to a deep proposed network based on two TimeDistributed layers, one BiLSTM layer, and several Dense layers.},

In contrast, steganalysis plays a key role in ensuring information security. Although various effective steganalysis algorithms have been proposed, existing studies typically treat color images as three independent channels and do not fully consider robust features suitable for JPEG images. To address this limitation, we propose a robust steganalysis algorithm based on high-dimensional mapping. By analyzing the changes in color images during the JPEG compression and decompression processes, we observe that the embedding of secret information causes shifts in the JPEG coefficients, which subsequently affects feature representation during decompression. Based on this observation, our method captures steganographic traces by utilizing the transformation errors produced during decompression. Additionally, due to the imbalance between luminance and chrominance, the feature weights of each channel are uneven. To ensure balanced analysis across the three channels, we adjust the distribution differences of each channel through high-dimensional mapping, thereby reducing intraclass feature variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in most cases.},

The findings were summarized and reported in tables and figures according to the study objectives. Results: From 1706 retrieved articles, 28 studies were included according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in 2023 (13 out of 28). 13 groups of specialists used Metaverse to diagnose diseases; oncologists and neurologists used it more than others. The most important technological aspects of the Metaverse were six main categories, including computer vision, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, blockchain, digital twin, and cloud computing. The Metaverse’s main effects in diagnostic interventions were 22 subcategories in five categories, including improving diagnosis, facilitating interactions, improving education, a better future, and uncertainty. The Metaverse’s role in improving diagnosis was particularly significant. The challenges of the Metaverse in diagnosis were seven subcategories: challenges related to the conducted studies, financial limitations, technological issues, structural issues, legal and ethical issues, its acceptance, and challenges about the nature of the Metaverse. Conclusion: Given the pivotal role of accurate diagnosis in patients treatment plans, the Metaverse’s potential in complex and challenging diagnoses is significant. However, it is important to note that this potential can only be fully realized through further research on utilizing the Metaverse in healthcare, specifically in disease diagnosis. This call for additional research is not just a suggestion but a necessity for the future of healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been widely used in semantic segmentation tasks and have achieved high segmentation accuracy. However, most algorithms based on DCNN have high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for real-time segmentation. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a real-time semantic segmentation algorithm based on the STDC network. The algorithm adopts an “encoder–decoder” embedded in a U-shaped architecture to realize real-time segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. Following the encoder, a mixed pooling attention module is designed to expand the receptive field, enhancing the network model’s learning ability in complex scenarios. Then, a feature fusion module is used for combining features from different stages, and channel attention based on atrous convolution is employed to expand the receptive field and avoid dimensionality reduction learning. Finally, a Tversky-based detail loss function is used to encode more spatial details. The proposed algorithm was extensively tested on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and the experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm obtained 76.4% and 72.8% of mIoU, respectively. Meanwhile, our algorithm achieves 105.2 FPS and 165.6 FPS inference speed with a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU, meeting the real-time segmentation requirements. The proposed algorithm can conduct real-time segmentation while maintaining high accuracy, achieving a good balance between accuracy and speed.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of malware has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques, significantly escalating the challenges for researchers in obtaining and labeling new instances for analysis. Conventional deep learning detection approaches struggle to identify new malware variants with limited sample availability. Recently, researchers have proposed few-shot detection models to address the above issues. However, existing studies predominantly focus on model-level improvements, overlooking the potential of domain adaptation to leverage the unique characteristics of malware. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a few-shot learning-based malware family detection framework (MalFSLDF). We introduce a novel method for malware representation using structural features and a feature fusion strategy. Specifically, our framework employs contrastive learning to capture the unique textural features of malware families, enhancing the identification capability for novel malware variants. In addition, we integrate entropy graphs (EGs) and gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs) into the feature fusion strategy to enrich sample representations and mitigate information loss. Furthermore, a domain alignment strategy is proposed to adjust the feature distribution of samples from new classes, enhancing the model’s generalization performance. Finally, comprehensive evaluations of the MaleVis and BIG-2015 datasets show significant performance improvements in both 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models such as ChatGPT holds promise in reshaping the conceptualization, development, and commercialization of IoT devices. Through real-world data utilization, AI enhances the effectiveness, adaptability, and intelligence of IoT devices and wearables, expediting their production process from ideation to deployment and customer assistance. However, integrating ChatGPT into IoT–based devices and wearables poses ethical concerns including data ownership, security, privacy, accessibility, bias, accountability, cost, design, quality, storage, model training, explainability, consistency, fairness, safety, transparency, trust, and generalizability. Addressing these ethical principles necessitates a comprehensive review of the literature to identify and classify relevant principles. The author identified 14 ethical principles from the literature using a systematic literature review (SLR) with a criteria of frequency ≥ 50% based on similarities. Four categories emerge based on the identified ethical principles, culminating in the application of Fuzzy-TOPSIS for analyzing, categorizing, ranking, and prioritizing these ethical principles. From the Fuzzy-TOPSIS technique results, the principle of data security and privacy is the highly ranked ethical principle for IoT–based software wearable devices with the ranking value of “0.925” as a consistency coefficient index. This method, well-established in computer science, effectively navigates fuzzy and uncertain decision-making scenarios. The pioneer outcomes of this study provide a taxonomy-based valuable insight for software manufacturers, facilitating the analysis, ranking, categorization, and prioritization of ethical principles amid the integration of ChatGPT in IoT–based devices and wearables’ research and development.},

HER’s primary goal is to accurately recognize and classify emotions from digital inputs. Emotion recognition (ER) and feature extraction have long been core elements of HER, with deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), playing a critical role due to their superior visual feature extraction capabilities. This study proposes improving HER by integrating EfficientNet with transfer learning (TL) to train CNNs. Initially, an efficient R-CNN accurately recognizes faces in online and offline videos. The ensemble classification model is trained by combining features from four CNN models using feature pooling. The novel VGG-19 block is used to enhance the Faster R-CNN learning block, boosting face recognition efficiency and accuracy. The model benefits from fully connected mean pooling, dense pooling, and global dropout layers, solving the evanescent gradient issue. Tested on CK+, FER-2013, and the custom novel HER dataset (HERD), the approach shows significant accuracy improvements, reaching 89.23% (CK+), 94.36% (FER-2013), and 97.01% (HERD), proving its robustness and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Dance style recognition through video analysis during university training can significantly benefit both instructors and novice dancers. Employing video analysis in training offers substantial advantages, including the potential to train future dancers using innovative technologies. Over time, intricate dance gestures can be honed, reducing the burden on instructors who would, otherwise, need to provide repetitive demonstrations. Recognizing dancers’ movements, evaluating and adjusting their gestures, and extracting cognitive functions for efficient evaluation and classification are pivotal aspects of our model. Deep learning currently stands as one of the most effective approaches for achieving these objectives, particularly with short video clips. However, limited research has focused on automated analysis of dance videos for training purposes and assisting instructors. In addition, assessing the quality and accuracy of performance video recordings presents a complex challenge, especially when judges cannot fully focus on the on-stage performance. This paper proposes an alternative to manual evaluation through a video-based approach for dance assessment. By utilizing short video clips, we conduct dance analysis employing techniques such as fine-grained dance style classification in video frames, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with channel attention mechanisms (CAMs), and autoencoders (AEs). These methods enable accurate evaluation and data gathering, leading to precise conclusions. Furthermore, utilizing cloud space for real-time processing of video frames is essential for timely analysis of dance styles, enhancing the efficiency of information processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation method in terms of accuracy and F1-score calculation, with accuracy exceeding 97.24% and the F1-score reaching 97.30%. These findings corroborate the efficacy and precision of our approach in dance evaluation analysis.},

In recent years, vision transformer (ViT) models have been applied to FER tasks. The direct use of the original ViT structure consumes a lot of computational resources and longer training time. To overcome these problems, we propose a FER method based on octonion orthogonal feature extraction and octonion ViT. First, to reduce feature redundancy, we propose an orthogonal feature decomposition method to map the extracted features onto seven orthogonal sub-features. Then, an octonion orthogonal representation method is introduced to correlate the orthogonal features, maintain the intrinsic dependencies between different orthogonal features, and enhance the model’s ability to extract features. Finally, an octonion ViT is presented, which reduces the number of parameters to one-eighth of ViT while improving the accuracy of FER. Experimental results on three commonly used facial expression datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models with a significant reduction in the number of parameters.},

These issues limit overall performance and unnecessarily increase computational consumption. In this paper, we have designed a novel and universally applicable integrated radio detection and identification deep architecture and corresponding training method, which organically combines detection and identification networks. Furthermore, we extract signal features using only one-dimensional horizontal convolution based on the characteristics of the impact of wireless channels on time-domain signals. Experiments show that the proposed methods perform signal detection and identification more efficiently, which can not only reduce unnecessary computational consumption but also improve the accuracy and robustness of both detection and identification simultaneously. More specifically, the ability to distinguish different modulated signal categories tends to increase with the rise in SNRs, and the upper limit of detection accuracy can exceed 95% at SNRs above 0 dB. The proposed method can improve both signal detection and identification accuracy from 83.44% to 83.56% and from 61.27% to 62.32%, respectively.},

In addition, I2I translation is applied in real-world tasks such as image synthesis, super-resolution, virtual fitting, and virtual live streaming. Traditional I2I translation models demonstrate strong performance when handling similar datasets. However, when the domain distance between two datasets is large, translation quality may degrade significantly due to notable differences in image shape and edges. To address this issue, we propose Long-Domain Search GAN ( LDSGAN ), an unsupervised I2I translation network that employs a GAN structure as its backbone, incorporating a novel Real-Time Routing Search ( RTRS ) module and Sketch Loss. Specifically, RTRS aids in expanding the search space within the target domain, aligning feature projection with images closest to the optimization target. Additionally, Sketch Loss retains human visual similarity during long-domain distance translation. Experimental results indicate that LDSGAN surpasses existing I2I translation models in both image quality and semantic similarity between input and generated images, as reflected by its mean FID and LPIPS scores of 31.509 and 0.581, respectively.},

Existing contribution evaluation mechanisms based on Shapley values uniquely allocate the total utility of a federation based on the marginal contributions of participants. However, in practical engineering applications, participants from different data sources typically exhibit significant differences and uncertainties in terms of their contributions to a federation, thus rendering it difficult to represent their contributions precisely. To evaluate the contribution of each participant to FL more effectively, we propose a novel interval federated Shapley value (IntFedSV) contribution evaluation mechanism. Second, to improve computational efficiency, we utilize a matrix semitensor product-based method to compute the IntFedSV. Finally, extensive experiments on four public datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, AG_NEWS, and IMDB) demonstrate its potential in engineering applications. Our proposed mechanism can effectively evaluate the contribution levels of participants. Compared with the case of three advanced baseline methods, the minimum and maximum improvement rates of standard deviation for our proposed mechanism are 11.83% and 99.00%, respectively, thus demonstrating its greater stability and fault tolerance.

This study presents a novel deep learning framework for enhancing the interpretability and reliability of skin lesion predictions from clinical images, which are more inclusive, accessible, and representative of real-world conditions than dermoscopic images. We comprehensively analyzed 13 deep learning models from four main convolutional neural network architecture classes: DenseNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet. Different data augmentation strategies and model optimization algorithms were explored to access the performances of the deep learning models in binary and multiclass classification scenarios. In binary classification, the DenseNet-161 model, initialized with random weights, obtained a top accuracy of 79.40%, while the EfficientNet-B7 model, initialized with pretrained weights from ImageNet, reached an accuracy of 85.80%. Furthermore, in the multiclass classification experiments, DenseNet121, initialized with random weights and trained with AdamW, obtained the best accuracy of 65.1%. Likewise, when initialized with pretrained weights, the DenseNet121 model attained a top accuracy of 75.07% in multiclass classification. Detailed interpretability analyses were carried out leveraging the SHAP and CAM algorithms to provide insights into the decision rationale of the investigated models. The SHAP algorithm was beneficial in understanding the feature attributions by visualizing how specific regions of the input image influenced the model predictions. Our study emphasizes using clinical images for developing AI algorithms for skin lesion diagnosis, highlighting the practicality and relevance in real-world applications, especially where dermoscopic tools are not readily accessible. Beyond accessibility, these developments also ensure that AI-assisted diagnostic tools are deployed in diverse clinical settings, thus promoting inclusiveness and ultimately improving early detection and treatment of skin cancers.},

  abstract     = {The channel estimation technique is crucial for the development of wireless communication systems. By accurately estimating the channel state, transmission parameters such as power allocation, modulation schemes, and encoding strategies can be optimized to maximize system capacity and transmission rate. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model for channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication system. By combining the advantages of convolutions and gated recurrent units (GRUs), the generalization capability of deep learning models across various wireless communication scenarios can be fully utilized. Furthermore, a series of regularization techniques such as data augmentation and structural complexity constraints have been introduced to avoid overfitting problems. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based on error backpropagation is used to iteratively train the model to convergence. During the simulation process, we have validated the effectiveness of the hybrid deep learning model on two wireless channel conditions, including quasi-static block fading and time-varying fading condition. All the samples are generated offline with SNRs from 10 to 40 dB with a step size of 5 dB. The comparison results with a series of conventional methods and deep learning models have proven the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases is crucial due to their high prevalence. Screening is often inefficient with existing methods, and the complexity of medical images challenges single-model approaches. Leveraging diverse model features can improve accuracy and simplify detection. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning model tailored for the diagnosis of GI diseases through the analysis of endoscopy images. This innovative model, named MultiResFF-Net, employs a multilevel residual block-based feature fusion network. The key strategy involves the integration of features from truncated DenseNet121 and MobileNet architectures. This fusion not only optimizes the model’s diagnostic performance but also strategically minimizes complexity and computational demands, making MultiResFF-Net a valuable tool for efficient and accurate disease diagnosis in GI endoscopy images. A pivotal component enhancing the model’s performance is the introduction of the Modified MultiRes-Block (MMRes-Block) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). The MMRes-Block, a customized residual learning component, optimally handles fused features at the endpoint of both models, fostering richer feature sets without escalating parameters. Simultaneously, the CBAM ensures dynamic recalibration of feature maps, emphasizing relevant channels and spatial locations. This dual incorporation significantly reduces overfitting, augments precision, and refines the feature extraction process. Extensive evaluations on three diverse datasets—endoscopic images, GastroVision data, and histopathological images—demonstrate exceptional accuracy of 99.37%, 97.47%, and 99.80%, respectively. Notably, MultiResFF-Net achieves superior efficiency, requiring only 2.22 MFLOPS and 0.47 million parameters, outperforming state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and cost-effectiveness. These results establish MultiResFF-Net as a robust and practical diagnostic tool for GI disease detection.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. To improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction, we developed a traffic flow prediction framework—namely, traffic flow multicomponent network—that appropriately processes the noise, volatility, and nonlinearity in traffic flow data. This framework comprises three components: a factor selection component, traffic flow decomposition component, and traffic flow prediction component. The factor selection component considers the dynamic effects of weather-related, environmental, and spatiotemporal factors on traffic flow; it then extracts and analyzes factors exhibiting strong correlations with traffic flow. The traffic flow decomposition component optimizes the parameters of variational mode decomposition on the basis of the envelope entropy by using the sparrow search algorithm; it then transforms traffic flow into multiple intrinsic mode functions to enable accurate traffic flow prediction. Finally, the traffic flow prediction component constructs dynamic feature matrices by using a bidirectional gated recurrent unit model to identify relationships within the data. Moreover, it uses an attention mechanism to assign different weights to different features on the basis of the importance of these features to traffic flow prediction, thereby enabling the efficient processing of a large volume of data. The performance of the proposed framework was examined in experiments conducted on large volumes of traffic flow data with different time granularities. The results indicated that the proposed framework achieved high prediction accuracy and stability for various time granularities, data samples, dataset sizes, and noise conditions. Moreover, it generally outperformed existing traffic flow prediction models under all experimental conditions.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the feature reconstruction network based on an autoencoder in the training phase is to force the network to reconstruct the input features well. The network tends to learn shortcuts of “identity mapping,” which leads to the network outputting abnormal features as they are in the inference phase. As such, the abnormal features based on reconstruction error cannot be distinguished from normal features, significantly limiting the detection performance of such methods. To address this issue, we propose a feature transformation reconstruction (FTR) network, which can avoid the identity mapping problem. Specifically, we use a normalizing flow model as a feature transformation (FT) network to transform input features into other forms. The training goal of the feature reconstruction (FR) network is no longer to reconstruct the input features but to reconstruct the transformed features, effectively avoiding the shortcut of learning the “identity map.” Furthermore, this paper proposes a masked convolutional attention (MCA) module, which randomly masks the input features in the training phase and reconstructs the input features in a self-supervised manner. In the testing phase, the MCA can effectively suppress the excessive reconstruction of abnormal features and further improve anomaly detection performance. FTR achieves the scores of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) at 99.5% and 97.8% on the MVTec AD and BTAD datasets, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, FTR is faster than the existing methods, with a high speed of 137 frames per second (FPS) on a 3080ti GPU.},

To address the challenges of achieving consistently high-quality denoising in both high-noise and low-noise environments, adapting to various complex scenarios with high robustness, and enhancing the model’s resilience against attacks, we propose the NOP-GAN, a powerful image denoising model. This model modifies the GAN architecture by integrating a U-Net with a pyramid coordinate attention mechanism and a noise optimization algorithm into a generator of the GAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the NOP-GAN possesses superior performance in denoising tasks and robustness against adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {A new spectrum sharing protocol with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is proposed to cope with the increasingly prominent problem of spectrum and energy scarcity. It operates within a cognitive radio network (CRN) in the context of cellular IoV (C-IoV), enabling bidirectional communication between two vehicles parked within the base station coverage (VnBSs) while facilitating cooperation for a pair of primary users (PUs), i.e., VnBSs can act as relays to provide cooperation communication for the cell–edge vehicle user (eVU). Unlike most existing work, both VnBSs can use time switching (TS) to obtain energy from radio frequency (RF) signals emitted from the base station. In order to enhance the reliability of the network, this study incorporates the automatic repeat request (ARQ) technique in the CRN supported by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and SWIPT, which has not been performed in other works. Based on this, the transmission is divided into one energy harvesting (EH) phase and three information processing (IP) phases. A new packet for PUs is transmitted in the first IP phase and is allowed to be retransmitted twice in the last two IP phases depending on the decoding. VnBSs act as relays to obtain energy in the EH phase to assist in retransmitting the PU’s packets and sending their own packets in the last two IP phases. The system states are analyzed by building a one-dimensional Markov chain, and the end-to-end outage probability (OP) is calculated for each state under the Nakagami-m fading channel. Using these two results, the OP of the primary and secondary networks, system throughput and energy efficiency (EE) are derived. Finally, the validity of the derived results is verified by Monte Carlo simulation using MATLAB and compared with the protocol without ARQ, and the protocol proposed shows a better performance.},

To achieve this, we propose a defense strategy called SLGD, which enhances model robustness by combining sparse learning and gradient perturbation techniques. The core idea of this approach consists of two parts. First, before processing training data at the RSU, we preprocess the data using sparse techniques to reduce data transmission and compress data size. Second, the strategy extracts feature representations from the model and performs gradient filtering based on the l 2 norm of this layer. Selected gradient values are then perturbed using Von Mises–Fisher (VMF) distribution to obfuscate gradient information, thereby defending against gradient reconstruction attacks and ensuring model security. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method across different datasets and attack scenarios.},

The primary objective of this paper is to propose a novel CC explicitly tailored for spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs), aiming to address the limitations and drawbacks associated with existing CCs. Our approach employs statistical concepts to quantify the correlation between variables and datasets within the context of SFSs. We formulate our proposed CC for SFSs by incorporating variance and covariance as fundamental components. This innovative approach not only accurately quantifies the degree of correlation between two SFSs but also characterizes the nature of their relationship, whether it is positive, neutral, or negative. As a result, our CC yields numerical values within the range of [−1, 1]. In contrast, existing methods focus solely on measuring the degree of association between two SFSs and are unable to differentiate the nature of the relationship, especially in cases of inverse correlation. We conduct a comparison to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed scheme in comparison to existing techniques, using numerical examples to showcase the dominance of our method. The comparative results indicate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and produces more reliable and precise results.

Despite being extensively researched, the classification of brain tumors into meningioma, glioma, and pituitary types using magnetic resonance (MR) images presents significant challenges. Although biopsies are currently the gold standard for evaluating tumors, the need for noninvasive and accurate methods to grade brain tumors is increasing due to the risks associated with invasive biopsies. The objective is to introduce a noninvasive brain tumor grading system based on MR imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) utilizing probabilistic selection techniques. In the proposed method, the best three of the seven state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks are chosen after extensive experimentation and combined with a probabilistic selection technique to enhance the overall performance of the proposed classification model. The results elucidate that the proposed model successfully classifies the tumor types into Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary achieving a sensitivity of 0.928, 0.939, and 0.992, respectively for each tumor type. Also, the precision in classifying the tumor classes is attained as 0.969, 0.932, and 0.957, respectively claiming an accuracy of 0.966, 0.956, and 0.983 for each of the three classes. The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 96.06%, surpassing the state-of-the-art advanced and sophisticated techniques. Extensive experiments were performed on brain MRI datasets to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed approach. The suggested probabilistic selection technique yielded promising classification results for brain tumors and exhibited the potential to leverage the strengths of various models.},

  abstract     = {In image analysis scenarios such as the Internet of Things and the metaverse, the introduction of federated learning (FL) is an effective solution to safeguard user data security and meet low-latency requirements during the machine learning process. However, due to the constrained computational power and memory of devices, facilitating the local training of complex models becomes challenging, thereby posing a significant obstacle to the application of FL. Consequently, a lightweight dynamic hierarchical neural network model and its learning paradigm are proposed in this study. Specifically, a lightweight compression method is designed based on enlarged receptive fields and separable convolutions to reduce redundancy in convolutional layer feature maps. A dynamic model partitioning method is devised, grounded in the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm, to enable collaborative model training across multiple devices and enhance the utilization efficiency of device computing and storage resources. Furthermore, a hierarchical federated partition learning (HFSL) paradigm based on complete weight sharing is introduced to facilitate the compatibility of partitioned models with FL. Experimental results show that our lightweight model outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, lightweight degree, and efficiency on image analysis tasks. Moreover, the proposed HFSL paradigm achieves performance comparable to centralized training.},

As an important part of intelligent cognitive communication, cognitive radio (CR) offers promising prospects for efficient spectrum utilization. However, with the introduction of cognitive capabilities, CR networks (CRNs) face not only common security threats in wireless systems, but also unique security threats, including primary user emulation (PUE) attacks, endangering communication reliability and confidentiality. In order to enhance the defense ability of CRNs against PUE attacks, this paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-assisted approach. Leveraging ISAC technology, our scheme enhances location detection precision. We introduce a high-resolution perception signal parameter estimation method and a position-based identity authentication scheme. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning is used to dynamically optimize the authentication threshold to ensure the stability of authentication in dynamic scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective in resisting PUE attacks and improves the security and reliability of CRNs.},

Machine learning models have been widely employed in SDP, but they ignore the impact of class imbalance, noise and outliers on the prediction performance. This study proposes a fuzzy cost broad learning system (FC-BLS). FC-BLS not only handles class imbalance problems but also considers the specific sample distribution to address noise and outliers in software defect datasets. Our approach draws fully on the idea of the cost matrix and fuzzy membership functions. It introduces them to BLS, where the cost matrix prioritises the training errors on the minority samples. Hence, the classification hyperplane position is more reasonable, and fuzzy membership functions calculate the membership degree of the sample in a feature mapping space to remove the prediction error caused by noise and outlier samples. Then, the optimisation problem is constructed based on the idea that the minority class and normal instances have relatively high costs. By contrast, the majority class and noise and outlier instances have relatively small costs. This study conducted experiments on nine NASA SDP datasets, and the experimental findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on most datasets.},

  abstract     = {As Smart City (SC) infrastructures evolve rapidly, securing critical systems like smart water management (SWM) becomes paramount to protecting against cyber threats. Enhancing the security, sustainability and execution of conventional schemes is considered significant in developing smart environments. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be effectively leveraged to realise this security objective in an Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart environment. This research addresses this need by proposing a novel IDS model called TabNet architecture optimised using Sailfish Optimisation (SFO). The TabNet-SFO model was specifically developed for SWM in SC applications. The proposed IDS model includes data collection, preprocessing, feature selection and classification processes. For training the model, this research used the CIC-DDoS-2019 dataset, and for evaluation, real-time data collected using an IoT-based smart water metre are used. The preprocessing step eliminates unnecessary features, cleans the data, encodes labels and normalises the applied datasets. After preprocessing, the TabNet model selects significant features in the dataset. The TabNet architecture was optimised using the SFO algorithm, which allows hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation. The proposed model demonstrated improved detection accuracy and efficiency on both the simulated and real-time datasets. The model attained a 98.90% accuracy, a 98.85% recall, a 98.80% precision, a 98.82% specificity and a 98.78% f1 score on the CIC-DDoS dataset and a 99.21% accuracy, a 99.02% recall, a 99.05% precision, a 99.10% specificity and a 99.18% f1 score on real-time data. Compared to existing models, the TabNet-SFO model outperformed all existing models in terms of performance metrics and validated its efficiency in detecting attacks.},

Furthermore, the repulsive potential field function and turning cost are introduced into the heuristic function, to consider the relative position of obstacles while minimizing turns in the path. In order to reduce the comparison of nodes with similar cost values, the bounded suboptimal method is used, and the idea of simulated annealing is introduced to overcome the local optima trapped by node expansion. Simulation experiments show that the average running time of the improved algorithm has decreased by about 70%, the number of extended nodes has decreased by 92%, and the path has also been shortened, proving the effectiveness of the algorithm improvement.},

To reduce the channel estimation overhead, the joint model pruning and vector quantization algorithm for network gradient parameters is presented to reduce the amount of exchange information between the centralized server and devices. This scheme allows for local fine-tuning to adapt the global model to the channel characteristics of each device. In addition, we also provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and quantization error bound in closed form, respectively.

This study aimed to develop an intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using deep learning models (DLMs) to enhance the efficiency of ultrasound screening and diagnostic accuracy of CLA. We retrospectively collected 4089 ultrasound images of cervical lymph nodes across four categories from two hospitals: normal, benign CLA, primary malignant CLA, and metastatic malignant CLA. We employed transfer learning, data augmentation, and five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DLMs with different architectures. To boost the application potential of DLMs, we investigated the potential impact of various optimizers and machine learning classifiers on their diagnostic performance. Our findings revealed that EfficientNet-B1 with transfer learning and root-mean-square-propagation optimizer achieved state-of-the-art performance, with overall accuracies of 97.0% and 90.8% on the internal and external test sets, respectively. Additionally, human–machine comparison experiments and the implementation of explainable artificial intelligence technology further enhance the reliability and safety of DLMs and help clinicians easily understand the DLM results. Finally, we developed an application that can be implemented in systems running Microsoft Windows. However, additional prospective studies are required to validate the clinical utility of the developed application.

Specifically, based on statistical channel state information (CSI), approximate closed-form expressions for secrecy throughput, average age of information (AoI), and channel parameter estimation errors are derived and analyzed to characterize the performance of communication security, information freshness, and sensing security. The asymptotic analyses between secrecy throughput and blocklength, number of antennas, and number of RIS reflecting elements are established. Furthermore, an optimization problem for maximizing sum secrecy throughput is established under the timeliness, sensing security, transmit power, and RIS unit modulus constraints. To handle the intractable stochastic nonconvex problem, a joint alternating optimization method based on noncooperative game and stochastic successive convex approximation (NCG-SSCA) is proposed by jointly designing RIS phase shift, transmit beamforming vector, sensing signal covariance, and blocklength. Simulation results validate our theoretical derivations and conclusions in the performance analysis. It is also shown that compared with SSCA and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, the NCG-SSCA method proposed in this paper achieves an increase in sum secrecy throughput by 10.4% and 16.3% with faster convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is crucial for improving the quality of patient care, particularly in the context of bone scans. However, existing automated methods, which are predominantly data-driven, exhibit limited performance and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates human domain knowledge with data patterns to enhance CNN-based metastasis lesion segmentation in bone scans. The proposed method comprises two phases: Stage I detects hotspots in bone scans using a CNN-based model, while Stage II identifies actual metastases by leveraging clinical knowledge of uptake intensity asymmetry. Our approach incorporates a dual-sampling scheme inspired by diagnostic patterns and an enhanced feature extractor within the hotspot segmentation network, thus augmenting the detection capabilities of traditional data-driven CNN models. The assessment of symmetrical uptake intensity starts with the symmetry axis of the trunk in the image, followed by a composite similarity measure that considers both geometric symmetry and intensity consistency. Experimental evaluations on 302 clinical cases reveal that our proposed segmentation network improves the Dice similarity coefficient score by 4.34% compared to the baseline method. Furthermore, integrating clinical knowledge significantly reduces false positives, improving the class pixel accuracy score by 2.39% and demonstrating notable adaptability to other segmentation models. Comparative analysis with existing models for metastasis lesion segmentation demonstrates the superior performance of our approach. By incorporating domain knowledge into data patterns, our method enhances automated segmentation performance and bridges the gap between domain expertise and data-driven methodologies in the automated analysis of low-resolution bone scans.},

While deep learning (DL) has shown excellent performance in this area, existing approaches have struggled to apply DL models across different anomaly tasks without extensive retraining. This repeated retraining is time-consuming, computationally intensive, and unfair. To address this limitation, a new DL framework is introduced in this study, consisting of three key components: transfer learning to enhance feature generalization, model fusion to improve feature representation, and multitask classification to generalize the classifier across multiple tasks without training from scratch when a new task is introduced. The framework’s main advantage is its ability to generalize without requiring retraining from scratch for each new task. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, achieving an accuracy of 97.99% on the RLVS (violence detection), 83.59% on the UCF dataset (shoplifting detection), and 88.37% across both datasets using a single classifier without retraining. Additionally, when tested on an unseen dataset, the framework achieved an accuracy of 87.25% and 79.39% on violence and shoplifting datasets, respectively. The study also utilises two explainability tools to identify potential biases, ensuring robustness and fairness. This research represents the first successful resolution of the generalization issue in anomaly detection, marking a significant advancement in the field.},

  abstract     = {Understanding complex traffic patterns has become more challenging in the context of rapidly growing city road networks, especially with the rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems that add further dynamics to traffic flow management. This involves understanding spatial relationships and nonlinear temporal associations. Accurately predicting traffic in these scenarios, particularly for long-term sequences, is challenging due to the complexity of the data involved in smart city contexts. Traditional ways of predicting traffic flow use a single fixed graph structure based on the location. This structure does not consider possible correlations and cannot fully capture long-term temporal relationships among traffic flow data, making predictions less accurate. We propose a novel traffic prediction framework called Multi-scale Attention-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Recurrent Network (MASTGCNet) to address this challenge. MASTGCNet records changing features of space and time by combining gated recurrent units (GRUs) and graph convolution networks (GCNs). Its design incorporates multiscale feature extraction and dual attention mechanisms, effectively capturing informative patterns at different levels of detail. Furthermore, MASTGCNet employs a resource allocation strategy within edge computing to reduce energy usage during prediction. The attention mechanism helps quickly decide which services are most important. Using this information, smart cities can assign tasks and allocate resources based on priority to ensure high-quality service. We have tested this method on two different real-world datasets and found that MASTGCNet predicts significantly better than other methods. This shows that MASTGCNet is a step forward in traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are devastating and shorten the patient’s life. It has an impact on the physical, psychological, and financial well-being of both patients and family members. Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce patients’ chances of survival. Detecting and diagnosing brain cancers using MRI scans is time-consuming and requires expertise in that domain. Nowadays, instead of traditional approaches to brain tumor analysis, several deep learning models are used to assist professionals and mitigate time. This paper introduces a stack convolutional self-attention network that extracts important local and global features from a freely available MRI scan dataset. Since the medical domain is one of the most sensitive fields, end-users should put their trust in the deep learning model before automating tumor classification. Therefore, the Grad-CAM method has been updated to better explain the model’s output. Combining local and global features improves brain tumor classification performance, with the suggested model reaching an accuracy of 96.44% on the relevant dataset. The proposed model’s precision, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score are reported as 96.5%, 98.83%, 96.44%, and 96.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the layers’ insights are examined to acquire a deeper knowledge of the decision-making process.},

This paper proposes a novel framework for deepfake image recognition for athletic celebrities using locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH, an efficient technique for high-dimensional nearest neighbor searches, is employed to detect and differentiate deepfake images from authentic media. By extracting high-dimensional features from images and videos using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), LSH is applied to hash similar content into clusters for quick and accurate deepfake detection.

  abstract     = {This study addresses the pressing need for improved lung cancer diagnosis and treatment by leveraging computational methods and omics data analysis. Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, highlighting the urgency for more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Current diagnostic methods, such as imaging and biopsies, suffer from limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and accessibility, often due to factors such as poor data quality, small sample sizes, and variability in data sources. These limitations highlight the necessity for the development of advanced noninvasive techniques. Computational methods utilizing omics data have shown promise in overcoming these challenges by comprehensively understanding the molecular pathways involved in lung cancer. We propose a novel approach that utilizes RNA-Seq data and employs LASSO regression with attention mechanisms to identify lung cancer biomarkers. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in identifying potential biomarkers for lung cancer, including well-known genes such as TP53, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and PIK3CA, validating the model’s ability to uncover key genes associated with lung cancer development and progression. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed significant associations of the identified genes with critical biological processes and pathways, including protein synthesis, folding, cell adhesion, gene regulation, and immune responses. The PPI network analysis, constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape application, highlighted a highly interconnected interaction landscape, with central hub genes playing pivotal roles in lung cancer progression. RPSA emerged as a crucial hub gene, consistently identified across different centrality measures. This study sheds light on the potential of computational methods and omics data analysis in improving lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, offering new insights for future research directions and personalized medicine strategies.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has marked a transformative shift in various industries, with logistics distribution service being one of the prime sectors reaping the benefits. UAVs offer substantial benefits in speed, cost, and reach, promising to revolutionize logistics, especially in remote areas. On the one hand, they are poised to meet demands for quick and versatile delivery options. On the other hand, their deployment comes with challenges. Weather variabilities such as rainfall, wind speed, and the need for safe take-off intervals can compromise UAV safety and operation. Conventional route optimization often overlooks these dynamic factors, resulting in inefficient or unworkable delivery routes. The repeated time-consuming calculations are caused by repeated trials when making UAV group distribution plans. Recognizing these gaps, this study proposes a data representation to effectively transform the flight flyable area of UAVs into a time-varying network that maintains spatiotemporal connectivity and establishes a mathematical model that represents the complexities of UAV group distribution. Then, a multistage dynamic optimization algorithm specifically tailored for large-scale time-varying network distribution route search is designed to obtain the stable and optimal solution. Subsequent experimental validations on actual case datasets have confirmed the correctness, effectiveness, and adaptability of the algorithm. Benchmarking against traditional CPLEX methods demonstrated that the algorithm not only rivals the best solutions but does so with a 38.8 times increase in computational speed. When pitted against the shortest path Dijkstra and A ∗ algorithms, the method consistently outperformed, delivering solutions up to 3.5 times faster in large-scale applications. Moreover, the parameter sensitivity analysis is performed on the algorithm by adjusting the safe flight thresholds of rainfall and wind speed parameters and revealed that the performance of the algorithm has a strong positive correlation with the size of the time-varying network.},

To enhance the servo performance of the two-degree-of-freedom rotation stage, we proposed a novel adaptive control approach: SSA–GA optimization of RBFNN integration into PID control. This method leverages the SSA–GA algorithm to optimize the parameters within the RBFNN, which is then seamlessly integrated into the PID control framework. This integration enables precise control of the two-degree-of-freedom rotation stage, overcoming the limitations of traditional PID controllers. By simulating various real-world situations such as step, noise, sinusoidal, transient excitation, impulse and modelling errors, it is demonstrated that the proposed control method achieves significant improvement in terms of control accuracy, fast response and robustness. It offers a more effective and reliable method for controlling the two-degree-of-freedom rotation stage, addressing the challenges posed by various interfering factors.

Deep learning-based classification methods have recently gained significant attention in PolSAR image classification since they have demonstrated excellent performance in the computer vision field. However, the main issue with deep learning-based methods is that they require large amounts of training data. Additionally, the scarcity of labeled data is a significant challenge in the PolSAR image field. Therefore, in this article, we proposed an advanced semisupervised deep self-training algorithm for PolSAR image classification, which utilized both labeled and unlabeled data in a semisupervised way. Then, a training optimization method and a high-confidence sample selection strategy are proposed by integrating consistency regularization. In addition, to achieve stronger feature extraction capabilities, we designed a deep learning-based classifier that combines residual blocks with an efficient multiscale attention module. We have conducted experiments on three popular real PolSAR datasets: 1989 Flevoland, 1991 Flevoland, and Oberpfaffenhofen. The classification results on these datasets demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms several other comparison algorithms, with overall accuracy up to 99.3%, 99.15%, and 94.12%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of neurons is a crucial step in the digital reconstruction of neurons and serves as an important foundation for brain science research. In neuron segmentation, the U-Net and its variants have showed promising results. However, due to their primary focus on learning spatial domain features, these methods overlook the abundant global information in the frequency domain. Furthermore, issues such as insufficient processing of contextual features by skip connections and redundant features resulting from simple channel concatenation in the decoder lead to limitations in accurately segmenting neuronal fiber structures. To address these problems, we propose an encoder–decoder segmentation network integrating frequency domain and spatial domain to enhance neuron reconstruction. To simplify the segmentation task, we first divide the neuron images into neuronal cubes. Then, we design 3D FregSNet, which leverages both frequency and spatial domain features to segment the target neurons within these cubes. Then, we introduce a multiscale attention fusion module (MAFM) that utilizes spatial and channel position information to enhance contextual feature representation. In addition, a feature selection module (FSM) is incorporated to adaptively select discriminative features from both the encoder and decoder, increasing the weight on critical neuron locations and significantly improving segmentation performance. Finally, the segmented nerve fiber cubes were assembled into complete neurons and digitally reconstructed using available neuron tracking algorithms. In experiments, we evaluated 3D FregSNet on two challenging 3D neuron image datasets (the BigNeuron dataset and the CWMBS dataset). Compared to other advanced segmentation methods, 3D FregSNet demonstrates more accurate extraction of target neurons in noisy and weakly visible neuronal fiber images, effectively improving the performance of 3D neuron segmentation and reconstruction.},

However, there is a need for improvement in terms of accuracy and efficiency in the existing models to obtain optimal diagnostic results. This limitation of existing models particularly hampers the resolution and clarity of MRI where there is a need for finer details for the accurate diagnoses of the problem. To limit this gap, our research represents a pioneering approach that merges GAN and spectral clustering. Our research shows the innovative amalgamation of two technologies. The GAN model is enhanced by the sturdy segmentation abilities of spectral clustering, resulting in the significant betterment in diagnosis of problems. This GAN is specifically designed for medical imaging; it consists of a deep convolutional network based on U-Net architecture. GAN consists of a generator that generates the MRI image through a series of convolutional and deconvolutional layers, and a discriminator checks whether the MRI image is real or generated. This approach not only improves the quality of the image but also leads to a more brisk and accurate diagnosis of cervical spine deformities. The methodology was meticulously tested on diverse datasets, including Medscape, RSNA 2022, and CTSpine1k. The results were remarkable, showing an 8.3% increase in accuracy, 5.5% improvement in precision, 8.5% higher recall, 3.5% greater AUC, 4.9% increased specificity, and a 1.9% reduction in delay compared to the existing classification methods. The influence of this work is profound, providing a consideration spike in the capability of diagnosing problems of cervical spondylosis. By providing improved image resolution and highly precise diagnostic tools, this advancement helps clinicians to make more accurate decisions as well as provides various innovations that help in medical imaging in the future.},

To this end, embedding cost learning frameworks based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been proposed and achieved success for spatial image steganography. However, the application of GAN to JPEG steganography is still in the prototype stage; its antidetectability and training efficiency should be improved. In conventional steganography, research has shown that the side information calculated from the precover can be used to enhance security. However, it is hard to calculate the side information without the spatial domain image. In this work, an embedding cost learning framework for JPEG image steganography via a GAN (JS–GAN) has been proposed, the learned embedding cost can be further adjusted asymmetrically according to the estimated side information (ESI). Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically learn a content-adaptive embedding cost function, and using the ESI properly can effectively improve the security performance. For example, under the attack of a classic steganalyzer GFR with a quality factor of 75 and 0.4 bpnzAC, the proposed JS–GAN can increase the detection error by 2.58% over J-UNIWARD, and the ESI–aided version JS–GAN (ESI) can further increase the security performance by 11.25% over JS–GAN.},

  abstract     = {As the electromagnetic environment becomes more complex, a significant number of interferences and malfunctions of authorized equipment can result in anomalies in spectrum usage. Utilizing intelligent spectrum technology to sense and identify anomalies in the electromagnetic space is of great significance for the efficient use of the electromagnetic space. In this paper, a method for intelligent sensing and identification of anomalies in spectrum with alpha-stable noise is proposed. First, we use a delayed feedback network (DFN) to suppress alpha-stable noise. Then, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder-based attention mechanism to sense anomaly. Finally, we use the deep forest model to identify abnormal spectrum. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses alpha-stable noise, and it outperforms existing methods in abnormal spectrum sensing and identification.},

Also, traditional sentiment analysis and not considering the possible aspects of tweets can cause the deep model to be misleading in predicting the price trend of cryptocurrencies. In this research, a model using transfer learning and the combination of pretrained DistilBERT networks, BiGRU deep neural network, and attention layer is presented to analyze the sentiments based on the aspect of tweets and predict the price trend of eight cryptocurrencies. These tweets are the opinions of 70 cryptocurrency expert influencers. After preprocessing, these tweets are injected into the hybrid model of DistilBERT, BiGRU, and attention layer (HDBA) to extract the aspect and determine the polarity of each aspect. The output of the HDBA model is entered into the combined model of BiGRU and the attention layer (HBA) to predict the price trend of each cryptocurrency in intervals of 1–10 days. The output of the HBA model is the best time interval of the influence of the sentiments of tweets on the price trend of cryptocurrencies. The results show that the HDBA model has improved the performance of the aspect-based sentiment analysis task by an average of 3% in the benchmark datasets. The results of the HBA model also show that this model has been able to predict the best time frame of the impact of sentiments on the behavior of the cryptocurrency market with an average accuracy of 68% and a precision of 73%.},

In practice, AMC is challenging due to the influence of communication environment and signal parameters, such as unknown channels, noise, symbol rate, signal length, and sampling frequency. In this survey, we investigated a series of typical AMC methods, including key technology, performance comparisons, advantages, challenges, and future key development directions. According to the methodology and processing flow, AMC methods are divided into three categories: likelihood-based (Lb) methods, feature-based (Fb) methods, and deep learning methods. The technical details of various types of methods are introduced and discussed, such as likelihood distributions, artificial features, classifiers, and network structures. Then, extensive experimental results of state-of-the-art AMC methods on public or simulated datasets are compared and analyzed. Despite the achievements that have been made, there are still limitations of the individual methods, including generalization capability, reasoning efficiency, model complexity, and robustness. In the end, we summarized the severe challenges faced by AMC and key future research directions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aerial images have extended across various industries such as intelligent building, agriculture, transportation, and Industry 4.0. Notably, the security of UAV-assisted data acquisition during transmission has become a critical concern. The reversible data hiding (RDH) method can hide data in aerial images for transmission and ensure secure communication. In general, an aerial image may exhibit substantially different orientation regularity from a natural scene image. This casts major challenges to the RDH method, for which existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to capture such content type variations, and thus are difficult to generalize from one type to another. In this paper, the orientation-aware selectivity mechanism is introduced to achieve an accurate orientation-aware prediction along different directions in local regions with different structure regularity. Furthermore, we propose a progressive brainstorming optimization algorithm (BSO)-guided optimal PSNR value strategy, which can obtain a superior perceptual performance and the corresponding thresholds by further exploring the pixel correlations within the UAV aerial images. Experimental results on the USC-SIPI Miscellaneous dataset and two challenging aerial datasets, including the USC-SIPI High Altitude Aerial Imagery dataset and the Kaggle dataset, demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the imperceptibility powerfully in marked UAV aerial images and ensures sufficient embedding capacity effectively. The average PSNR of the marked image obtained by the proposed method is 63.85 dB when embedded with 30,000 bits of data, which is an improvement of 0.59 dB compared to the current state-of-the-art RDH methods.},

  abstract     = {Background: Model drift is a major challenge for applications of clinical prediction models. We aimed to investigate the effect of two strategies to mitigate model drift based on a previously reported prediction model for acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: Deidentified electronic medical data of inpatients in Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022, were collected. AKI was defined by the KDIGO criteria. The top 50 laboratory variables, alongside with sex, age, and the top 20 prescribed medicines were included as predictive variables. In model optimization, the convolution neural network module was replaced by a self-attention module. Periodical refitting with accumulative data was also conducted before temporally external validations. The performance of the innovated model (ATRN) was compared with the previous model (ATCN) and other four models. Results: A total of 150,373 admissions were identified. The annual incidences of AKI varied between 5.57% and 5.8%. The performance of the models which had used temporal features profoundly declined over time. The ATRN model with module more suitable to capture short-term time dependencies outperformed the other five models both in C-statistics and recall rates perspectives. Periodic refitting the prediction model with accumulative data also helped to effectively mitigate the model drift, especially in models with time series data. Conclusions: Enhancing the model’s ability to capture short-term time dependencies in time series data and periodic refitting with accumulative data were both capable of mitigating the model drift. The best improvement of model performance was observed in the combination of these two strategies.},

Recently, the efficient machine-learning-assisted methods have attracted intensive attentions in multifunctional metasurfaces design. However, the conventional machine-learning-assisted metasurfaces design is to fit the internal relationship in the form of black box, which ignores the underlying physical logic, resulting in the increased complexity of machine learning architecture with the parameters increasing. In order to adapt to the multiparameter optimization in multifunctional metasurfaces design, we propose a multiplexing neural network (MNN) based on decoupling at the physical layer to simplify both the structural parameters and the network architecture. The four interacting parameters are simplified into four independently regulated parameters so that the facile design of four functions can be realized only by multiplexing a simple neural network. For verification, four functions of scattering, anomalous reflection, focusing, and hologram are integrated in the same metasurface aperture by MNN. Performances of the metasurface are fully demonstrated by simulation and measurement. Importantly, this work paves the way for the bidirectional simplification of machine learning and metasurface design via physical inspiration, which provides an integrated design method of multifunctional metasurfaces and can be potentially applied to satellite communications and other fields.},

It is a commonly used approach to reduce the variation of input distribution using BN. However, the complex parameters computed at the classifier layer of convolutional neural network (CNN) are the reason for model overfitting and consumption of long training time. This study is proposed to make a comparative analysis of models’ performances on multiclass and multilabel classifiers with and without BN at dense layers of CNN. Consequently, for both classifications, BN layers are incorporated at the fully connected layer of CNN. To build a model, we used datasets of medical plant leaves, potato leaves, and fashion images. The pretrained models such as Mobile Net, VGG16, and Inception Net are customized (tuned) using the transfer learning technique. We made adjustments to training and model hyperparameters, including batch size, number of layers, learning rate, number of epochs, and optimizers. After several experiments on the three models, we observed that the best way to improve the model’s accuracy is by applying BN at the CNN’s dense layer. BN improved the performances of the models on both multiclass and multilabel classifications. This improvement has more significant change in the multilabel classification. Hence, using medicinal plant dataset, the model achieved accuracy of 93% and 83% for multilabel with and without BN, respectively, while achieving 99.2% and 99% for multiclass classification. The experiment also proved that the effectiveness of BN is affected on type datasets, depth of CNN, and batch sizes.},

Earlier and more accurate heart disease detection helps people to save their valuable lives. Many existing systems remain costly and inaccurate.

Initially, the heart disease data are allowed for data normalization, which is performed by min–max normalization. These normalized data are forwarded to the feature selection phase, which is conducted based on chord distance. Finally, heart disease detection is performed using a parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) that is trained using the EFOA. Here, the EFOA is developed by the combination of the fossa optimization algorithm (FOA) and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). The performance of the proposed EFOA-PCNN is analysed by three metrics, such as specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, and the F 1 score that gained superior values of 91.95%, 91.76%, 91.86%, and 92.39%.

Moreover, it reaches an average AUC of 0.974 in 5-fold cross-validation on a private CRC dataset, matching the performance of patch-based approaches. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in mitigating the OOD challenge in WSI classification.

This feedback mechanism simulates the human postediting process, where errors are systematically identified and corrected. Generated by a dedicated optimization model trained on a synthetic dataset (using GLM-4 and inspired by multidimensional quality metrics (MQM), this feedback provides fine-grained error details including spans, categories, and quantities from initial LLM translations.

  abstract     = {The global economy and society are seriously threatened by the pervasive spread of counterfeit goods. Their high level of simulation makes real and fake goods extremely similar in appearance and difficult to distinguish. The existing identification techniques mostly use CNNs and transformer architectures. However, CNNs have limitations in modeling long-range dependencies, leading to their limited classification performance, while vision transformers (ViTs), although excellent in modeling long-range dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity of their self-attention mechanism makes it difficult to be widely used in real-world scenarios with limited computational resources. According to recent research, long-range relationships can be accurately modeled using the state space model (SSM), which is represented by Mamba, while preserving linear computational complexity. Motivated by this, we proposed CGMamba, a SSM-based intelligent recognition model for counterfeit goods. Specifically, we constructed a novel hybrid basic block called global-local feature aggregation (GLFA). This block greatly enhances the feature extraction capability for counterfeit goods by deeply integrating the local feature extraction capability of the CNN and the global modeling capability of SSM. It is composed of three components: a local feature extractor, a global feature extractor, and an adaptive feature aggregation module (AFAM).

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of image generation techniques, it becomes much more difficult to distinguish high-quality computer-generated (CG) images from photographic (PG) images, challenging the authenticity and credibility of digital images. Therefore, distinguishing CG images from PG images has become an important research problem in image forensics, and it is crucial to develop reliable methods to detect CG images in practical scenarios. In this paper, we proposed a forensics contrastive learning (FCL) framework to adaptively learn intrinsic forensics features for the general and robust detection of CG images. The data augmentation module is specially designed for CG image forensics, which reduces the interference of forensic-irrelevant information and enhances discrimination features between CG and PG images in both the spatial and frequency domains. Instance-wise contrastive loss and patch-wise contrastive loss are simultaneously applied to capture critical discrepancies between CG and PG images from global and local views. Extensive experiments on different public datasets and common postprocessing operations demonstrate that our approach can achieve significantly better generalization and robustness than the state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework for rice disease diagnosis, leveraging variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to address the limitations of traditional and deep learning models in precision agriculture. The proposed Quantum Variational Rice Disease Network (QVRDN) integrates quantum feature encoding, variational quantum processing, and adaptive optimization to achieve superior classification accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Using a curated dataset of 3000 annotated rice leaf images spanning major disease categories, the QVRDN framework applies dimensionality reduction and quantum angle encoding to transform the image features into quantum states, which are then processed by parameterized quantum circuits for disease classification. Experimental results demonstrate that QVRDN outperforms classical models, including SVM, random forest, CNN, and ResNet50-achieving, the highest accuracy of 97.8%, faster inference times, and greater resilience to noise and limited data. The compact design of the framework enables edge deployment without GPU dependency, making it suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. By demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of quantum machine learning in crop health monitoring, this study establishes a foundation for quantum-enhanced, data-efficient agricultural diagnostics and paves the way for future advances in intelligent, field-ready quantum geoinformatics systems.},

  abstract     = {The slime mold algorithm (SMA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of slime molds. Compared to other optimization algorithms, SMA has fewer parameters, faster convergence speed, and stronger optimization capabilities. However, the standard SMA uses two randomly selected individuals to guide the search direction of the population, which results in excessive randomness during the search process. This can lead to the loss of valuable information and waste computational resources. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an enhanced slime mold algorithm (S2SMA) based on a spiral sensing search mechanism. The main contributions of this study are as follows: Firstly, a fitness–distance balanced oscillation search mechanism is introduced to solve the issue of lack of guidance in the individual oscillatory search phase in the original SMA, thus enhancing the global exploration ability of the algorithm. Secondly, the spiral sensing search mechanism is introduced, reshaping the random redistribution behavior in SMA. This aims to fully utilize the effective information in the existing population, improve search efficiency, and enhance population diversity. Finally, the computational logic of SMA is restructured based on the existing parameters, improving the algorithm’s performance while avoiding additional computational overhead. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed S2SMA, experiments were conducted on 71 test instances from the IEEE CEC2017 and IEEE CEC2021 benchmark sets, as well as three engineering problems. The algorithm was compared with classical algorithms, high-performance algorithms, and advanced SMA variants. Experimental results show that S2SMA outperforms the classical algorithms, high-performance algorithms, and other SMA variants in terms of both performance and robustness, demonstrating its potential application in engineering optimization.},

  abstract     = {Time-series classification is a relevant step supporting decision-making processes in various domains, and deep neural models have shown promising performance in this respect. Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to deep learning. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time-series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time-series classification utilizing 117 datasets from UCR benchmark archive, from multiple different domains. More specifically, we investigate (a) the transferability of reference architectures designed for regression to classification tasks, (b) the hyperparameter and implementation configurations for an architecture that best generalizes across 117 datasets, (c) the associated complexity trade-offs, and (d) KANs interpretability. Our results demonstrate that (1) the Efficient KAN outperforms MLPs in both performance and training times, showcasing its suitability for classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN exhibits greater stability than the original KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, especially when lower learning rates are employed. (3) KAN achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as HIVE-COTE2 and InceptionTime, while maintaining smaller architectures and faster training times, highlighting its favorable balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model, as confirmed by SHAP analysis, reinforces its capacity for transparent decision-making.},

Our primary goal is to develop an innovative method for accurately classifying sports activities using advanced analytical techniques that consider various physiological signals. This study aims to improve classification accuracy and provide real-time analytics for sports performance. To achieve this, we employ spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to dynamically weight critical signals, enabling precise tracking of movement transitions across different sports. The model is trained on comprehensive datasets comprising respiration rate, ECG, and heart rate (HR), providing a multifaceted analysis of athletic performance. Extensive experiments validate the model, which achieves a remarkable accuracy of 90.32%. It is the first model of its kind, outperforming established models like 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), LSTM, BiLSTM, and 1D CNN-BiLSTM.

However, due to the diversity of objects within water conservancy scenarios and the complexity of related factors, research and application of digital twins in the field of water conservancy remain immature. There are still significant challenges in constructing fine-grained, high-fidelity digital twin for water conservancy objects and their corresponding scenarios. In this context, taking polder areas as research subjects, a digital twin polder area system is proposed, which includes the data representation of the main elements in the polder area; based on 3D engine Unity, the modeling and rendering of the polder area’s terrain, water body, water conservancy projects, and different weather conditions are achieved; the Xin’anjiang model, N-BEATS model, and the feature engineering model we proposed are integrated to predict water level and flow rate, thereby driving the visual scenario to simulate the extent of the impact of waterlogging at different future moments. Based on satellite imagery data, actual water level data, and flow rate data from a polder area in the Lixiahe river network of Jiangsu Province in China, we measure the efficiency of scene rendering and the accuracy of the prediction models. The results show that the performance and model accuracy of the digital twin polder area system meet the practical requirements.

PDHFS would be an improved version of the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) where both membership and nonmembership hesitant quality is considered for all its probability of existence. Additional information on the degree of acceptance or rejection contains such allocated probabilities. More conveniently, we create a comprehensive type of PDHFS called interval-valued PDHFS (IVPDHFS) to interpret the probability data that exist in the hesitancy. This study describes several basic operating laws by stressing the advantages and enriching the utility of IVPDHFS in MAGDM. To aggregate IVPDHF information in MAGDM problems and extend its applications, we present the Muirhead mean (MM) operator of IVPDHFSs and study some attractive properties of the suggested operator. Besides that, in order to compute attribute weights, a new organizational framework is designed by using partial knowledge of the decision makers (DMs). Subsequently, a standardized technique with the suggested operator for MAGDM is introduced, and the realistic usage of the operator is illustrated by the use of a problem of regenerative energy source selection. We discuss the influence of the parameter vector on the ranking results. Finally, to address the benefits and limitations of the recommended MAGDM approach, the findings of the proposal are contrasted with other approaches.},

The first layer employs the extreme gradient boosting algorithm to detect reconnaissance attacks, which are typically the initial stage of a multistage cyberattack. In the second layer, an artificial neural network is utilized to classify various IoT-specific attacks. Our model is evaluated using three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and IoT-ID20. The proposed model demonstrates a first-stage accuracy of 99.98%, sensitivity of 99.14%, and specificity of 94.47%. In the second stage, we achieved accuracy rates of 96.97%, 99.99%, and 98.70% across the datasets. This two-stage approach not only improves detection accuracy but also ensures early intervention by identifying reconnaissance attacks, thereby reducing the potential impact of subsequent attack stages. The primary objective of this model is to efficiently detect reconnaissance attacks with minimal resource consumption, thereby reducing the workload of the ANN model. Our findings underscore the importance of a staged defense mechanism in IoT networks, leveraging the strengths of different machine learning algorithms to provide robust security.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the primary cause of death for women around the world, necessitating the development of highly accurate, interpreted, and technologically advanced predictive approaches to support early diagnosis and treatment. In this research, we introduce a deep learning (DL) model for predicting breast cancer using both public and private datasets. The model uses the internet of things (IoT) to improve data collection and real-time monitoring, and it also uses the SMOTE method to resolve issues of class imbalance. The proposed model combines an explainable AI approach with SHAP values to ensure model interpretability. To identify the best DL algorithm for this method, we assess and compare six different DL algorithms: temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), neural factorization machines (NFMs), long short–term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and deep kernel learning (DKL). IoT devices allow for the continuous acquisition of patient data, which, when integrated with our predictive models, improve the capacity for early detection. Reliable cancer detection relies on our method’s enhanced predictive accuracy and sensitivity. Furthermore, we offer crucial transparency in clinical settings by using SHAP to give detailed explanations of model decisions. By employing thorough statistical analysis and cross-validation, we guarantee that our model is resilient and can be applied to various patient populations. The results show that our proposed IoT integrated method has the potential to improve prediction performance and boost confidence in AI-powered medical diagnostics by making them more accessible and easier to use. From a performance perspective, the proposed approach, which uses the TCN algorithm and SMOTE, achieved the best accuracy for BC prediction. With the public dataset, the experimental results were 99.44%, 100.0%, 99.01%, 98.75%, 99.37%, and 99.89% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and AUC, respectively.

  abstract     = {The rise of digitalization and Industry 4.0 has led to significant changes in industrial warehouse management. However, managing warehouses remains challenging due to reliance on manual labor and limited automation. This article focuses on addressing issues in warehouse management, specifically in drug identification and counting. Although traditional methods such as barcode systems and RFID are common, artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution. In this paper, an advanced visual recognition based on Faster R-CNN is introduced to accurately identify and count pharmaceutical items in pharmacies. The obtained results suggest that intelligent warehouse management in pharmacies can lead to cost savings and improved efficiency. The study also compares the proposed model with popular classification methods such as CNN, SVM, KNN, YOLOv5, and SSD, showing the effectiveness of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {Detecting financial reporting fraud is vital for preserving market integrity and protecting investors from substantial losses. Yet, the challenges of high dimensionality and noisy financial data often undermine the effectiveness of existing financial fraud detection systems. To address these issues, this study proposes SISAE-METADES, a novel framework that integrates a supervised input-enhanced stacked autoencoder (SISAE) with a meta-learning–based dynamic ensemble selection (METADES) strategy. Unlike conventional stacked autoencoders, SISAE concatenates the original input at each encoding stage and incorporates label supervision, thereby learning task-relevant and class-discriminative representations. These enriched deep features improve both the diversity and competence of base classifiers and enable METADES to achieve more reliable local competence estimation. We validate the proposed framework using financial statement data from Chinese A-share listed companies (2005–2023), covering 71 indicators. Experimental results show that SISAE-METADES significantly outperforms standalone SISAE, traditional METADES, and several state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, recall, and F1-score, underscoring the robustness and effectiveness of combining supervised deep representation learning with dynamic ensemble selection for financial fraud detection. These findings highlight the framework’s practical significance in reducing investor losses, strengthening market confidence, and promoting the stability of the financial system.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel recognition approach for operation states of hydroelectric generating units based on data fusion and visualization analysis. First, the principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to simplify signals from multiple channels into a single fused signal, thereby reducing data computation for multiple-channel signals. To reflect the features of fused signals under different operation states, the Gramian angular field (GAF) method is applied to convert the fused signals into image formats, including Gramian angular differential field (GADF) images and Gramian angular summation field (GASF) images, then a depthwise separable convolution neural network (DSCNN) model is established to achieve the operation state recognition for the unit by GADF and GASF images. Based on the operation data from a Kaplan hydroelectric unit at a hydropower station in Southwest China, an experiment on operation recognition is conducted. The proposed PCA–GAF–DSCNN method achieves an accuracy rate of 95.21% with GADF images and 96.41% with GASF images, which were higher than the results obtained using original signals with the GAF–DSCNN method. The results indicate that the fused signal with PCA demonstrates superior performance in the operation recognition compared to the original signals, and PCA–GAF–DSCNN can be used for hydroelectric units effectively. This approach accurately identifies abnormal states in units, making it suitable for monitoring and fault diagnosis in the daily operations of hydroelectric generating units.},

In this study, we present an approach for obtaining BPA based on the normal cloud model called combined fuzzy similarity measure (CFSM). The method first constructs the normal cloud model of each class of sample in each attribute by an interval number and uses the mean standard deviation to obtain the interval number for the test sample, thereby obtaining the normal cloud model. Then, the similarity between the test samples and the training samples is quantified based on the area relationship, thereby obtaining the BPA of the test samples. Finally, the evidence combination method based on the intuitionistic fuzzy earth mover’s distance (IFEMD) is used for experimental analysis.

In particular, detecting deepfakes in image sequences (e.g., agricultural product packaging) is particularly difficult because the anomalies introduced by the tampering techniques are often subtle and temporally continuous. In this paper, we propose a new deepfake detection method based on time series, combining independent component analysis (FastICA) with anomaly detection techniques. We first apply FastICA to extract independent components from image sequences to identify anomalous visual patterns that are unique to deepfake tampering. In addition, we use an efficient anomaly detection algorithm, LSHiforest, to achieve scalable and accurate identification of suspicious sequences. Experimental results show that the proposed method can still detect deepfake content with high accuracy in challenging scenarios with complex temporal dynamics. Our work provides a promising solution for real-time and large-scale detection of deepfake content in dynamic media.},

In this paper, we build a novel universal detector of AIGIs without the need to perform training on these images. Starting with a study on the effectiveness of various pretrained image models for the AIGI detection task, we then chose to build our detector based on the features of the popular CLIP model. Unlike existing methods, we use a small number of real images and their carefully processed counterparts as AIGI proxies during training, combined with a novel margin-based loss to promote generalization.

Believing the synthetic videos of a celebrity and trumping up impersonated forgery videos as authentic are just a few consequences generated by DeepFakes. We investigate current detectors that blindly deploy deep learning techniques that are not effective in capturing subtle clues of forgery when generative models produce remarkably realistic faces. Inspired by the fact that synthetic operations inevitably modify the regions of eyes and mouth to match the target face with the identity or expression of the source face, we conjecture that the continuity of facial movement patterns representing expressions that existed in the veritable faces will be disrupted or completely broken in synthetic faces, making it a potentially formidable indicator for DeepFake detection. To prove this conjecture, we utilize a dual-branch network to capture the inconsistent patterns of facial movements within eyes and mouth regions separately. Extensive experiments on popular FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF-v1, Celeb-DF-v2, and DFDC-Preview datasets have demonstrated not only effectiveness but also the robust capability of our method to outperform the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, this work represents greater robustness against adversarial attacks, achieving ASR of 54.8% in the I-FGSM attack and 43.1% in the PGD attack on the DeepFakes dataset of FaceForensics++, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) servers integrated with multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) present a new system the multi-UAV-assisted MEC system. This system relies on the mobility of the UAVs to reduce the transmission distance between the servers and mobile users, thereby enhancing service quality and minimizing the overall energy consumption. Achieving optimal UAV deployment and precise task scheduling is crucial for improved coverage and service quality in this system. This problem is framed as a nonconvex optimization problem known as joint task scheduling and deployment optimization. Recently, an optimization technique based on a dual-layer framework: Upper layer optimization and lower layer optimization have been proposed to tackle this problem and achieved superior performance compared to the alternative methods. In this framework, the lower layer was responsible for task scheduling optimization, while the upper layer was designed to assist in optimizing UAV deployment and thus achieving improved coverage and enhanced task scheduling for mobile users, thereby minimizing the total energy consumption. However, further refinement of upper layer optimization is needed to improve the deployment process. In this study, the upper layer undergoes enhancement through key modifications: First, random selection of the solutions is replaced with sequential selection to maintain the unique characteristics of each individual throughout the optimization process, fostering both exploration and exploitation. Second, a selection of recently reported metaheuristic algorithms, such as spider wasp optimizer (SWO), generalized normal distribution optimization (GNDO), and gradient-based optimizer (GBO), are adapted to optimize UAV deployments. Both improved upper layer and lower layer optimization led to the development of novel, more effective optimization approaches, including IToGBOTaS, IToGNDOTaS, and IToSWOTaS. These techniques are evaluated using nine instances with a variety of mobile tasks ranging from 100 to 900 to test their stability and then compared to different optimization techniques to measure their effectiveness. This comparison is based on several statistical information to determine the superiority and difference between their outcomes. The results reveal that IToGBOTaS and IToSWOTaS exhibit slightly superior performance compared to all other algorithms, showcasing their competitiveness and efficacy in addressing the optimization challenges of the multi-UAV-assisted MEC system.},

The current landscape of deepfake detection technologies is marred by limited generalization across diverse generative models and a subpar detection rate for images generated through diffusion processes. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel detection model designed for high generalizability, leveraging multiscale frequency and spatial domain features. Our model harnesses an array of specialized filters to extract frequency-domain characteristics, which are then integrated with spatial-domain features captured by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). The integration of the Attentional Feature Fusion (AFF) mechanism within the feature fusion module allows for the optimal utilization of the extracted features, thereby enhancing detection capabilities. We curated an extensive dataset encompassing deepfake images from a variety of GANs and diffusion models for rigorous evaluation. The experimental findings reveal that our proposed model achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to existing baseline models when confronted with deepfake images from multiple generative sources. Notably, in cross-model detection scenarios, our model outperforms the next best model by a significant margin of 29.1% for diffusion-generated images and 15.1% for GAN-generated images. This accomplishment presents a viable solution to the pressing issues of generalization and adaptability in the field of deepfake detection.},

  abstract     = {Existing facial image inpainting methods demonstrate high reliance on the precision of prior knowledge. However, the acquisition of precise prior knowledge remains challenging, and the incorporation of predicted prior knowledge in the restoration process often leads to error propagation and accumulation, thereby compromising the reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel facial image inpainting framework that leverages knowledge distillation, which is specifically designed to mitigate error propagation caused by imprecise prior knowledge. More specifically, we develop a teacher network incorporating accurate facial prior information and establish a knowledge transfer mechanism between the teacher and student networks via knowledge distillation. During the training phase, the student network progressively acquires the prior information encoded in the teacher network, thus improving its restoration capability for missing or corrupted regions. Additionally, we introduce a Coordinate Attention Gated Convolution (CAG) module, which enables effective extraction of both structural and semantic features from intact regions. Experiments conducted on the public facial datasets (CelebA-HQ and FFHQ) show that our method achieves performance improvements over existing approaches in terms of multiple quantitative evaluation metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, MAE, and LPIPS. Thus, the knowledge transfer from teacher to student network via knowledge distillation significantly reduces the dependence on prior knowledge characteristic of existing methods, facilitating more precise and efficient facial image inpainting.},

Conventional methods such as technical analysis (based on historical market data) and fundamental analysis (based on economic variables) suffer from data noise, processing delays, and insufficient data. To make predictions more accurate, faster, and able to handle more data, the suggested method combines several steps: extracting important information, labeling it, choosing the best features, merging different models, and fine-tuning the model settings. Based on the price data, this approach initially generates 5 labels with a new labeling method based on the percentage of average price changes in several days and generates signals (hold, buy, sell, strong sell, and strong buy). Thereafter, it extracts 768 features from technical studies using the TA-Lib library and from an authoritative site. The TLBOA algorithm, which does not get stuck in the local optimum with two updates, was used to select and reduce features to 15 to avoid overfitting. A variety of ML models, including support vector machine and Naive Bayes, use these selected features for training. By using the evolutionary DE algorithm to optimize the XGBoost meta-parameters, we increased the accuracy by 1%–4%. The proposed strategy has performed better than other models, such as XGBoost with 85.66% and gradient boosting with 84.15%, and has achieved an accuracy of 91%–92%.},

This work enhances disease diagnosis performance through preprocessing and early, precise PD detection. Several information collected from the given dataset are initially taken as input. Then, the preprocessing stage converts raw data into a structured format. Afterward, Spearman’s Rank Feature Selective and Jaccard Index–based Convolutional Deep Neural Learning Classifier with four layers, one input layer, one output layer, and two hidden layers, are deployed for diagnosing PD by efficiently performing the data classification. Experimental evaluation uses the Early Biomarkers of the PD dataset by different factors. Findings support the claim that the proposed KISRJCDNL technique enhances accuracy by 14%, reducing feature selection time, error rate, overall time, and space complexity by 16%, 43%, 36%, and 22% compared to the existing deep learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning–based classifiers have been used for text classification, such as sentiment analysis, news classification, and toxic comment classification. However, supervised machine learning models often require large amounts of labeled data for training, and manual annotation is both labor-intensive and requires domain-specific knowledge, leading to relatively high annotation costs. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) into an active learning framework, achieving high cross-task text classification performance without the need for any manually labeled data. Furthermore, compared to directly applying GPT for classification tasks, our approach retains over 93% of its classification performance while requiring only approximately 6% of the computational time and monetary cost, effectively balancing performance and resource efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the efficient utilization of LLMs and active learning algorithms in text classification tasks, paving the way for their broader application.},

However, initial data are often not clearly defined, and some necessary information about the system’s behavior may be missing. Most mathematical models in reliability analysis primarily address aleatory uncertainty. However, recently, many problems in reliability analysis increasingly need to take into consideration epistemic uncertainty. Therefore, methods for developing mathematical models based on uncertain initial data should be refined to account for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. This is particularly true for models that represent a system using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). This paper proposes a new method for constructing a system’s mathematical model in the form of a BDD based on incomplete and uncertain data. Machine learning approaches and principles are employed in this method to account for the epistemic uncertainty of the initial data. A fuzzy classifier, specifically a fuzzy decision tree (FDT), is used to build a BDD from epistemically uncertain data. The use of a tree-based classifier allows simplifying the transformation between FDT and BDD.},

For the first step, we utilize the K–S test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Pearson’s correlation to select variables. Then, we employ CRITIC and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) methods to score the risk of listed companies. Following this, self-organizing maps (SOM) clustering is utilized to segment the samples into five distinct risk levels. For the second step, we utilized triangulated maximally filtered graph (TMFG) and maximally filtered clique forest (MFCF) to minimize the number of indicators based on the dependent relationships between variables. These are then combined with Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and Copula algorithms to address nonlinear situations, forming what we refer to as the LoGo model. To further enhance the accuracy of LoGo models, we utilize the square Mahalanobis distance to compute the log-likelihoods as part matrix. The results reveal that the enhanced LoGo model with part matrix improves average accuracy by 7% compared with the original models without part matrix, albeit with a tenfold increase in execution time. MFCF demonstrates superior performance over TMFG in linear situations, achieving a 40% higher accuracy. However, under nonlinear circumstances, TMFG only requires half the execution time of MFCF, yet achieves a slightly higher average accuracy. Furthermore, compared with the widely used CNN models, the enhanced LoGo models show superior performance as they achieved closed accuracy in a shorter time.},

We analyze the effectiveness of various models and techniques. Our review finds that while deep learning models, particularly transformer-based architectures, are increasingly effective for ATC, challenges such as dialectal variations and insufficient labeled datasets remain key obstacles. However, developing suitable representation models and designing classification algorithms is still challenging for researchers, especially in Arabic. A basic introduction to ATC is provided in this survey, including preprocessing, representation, dimensionality reduction (DR), and classification with many evaluation metrics. In addition, the survey includes a qualitative and quantitative study of the ATC’s existing works. Finally, we conclude this work by exploring the limitations of the existing methods.

We extend the P-OWA and P-IOWA operators with the different means such as generalized mean and quasi-arithmetic mean. This article also includes different families of P-OWA and P-IOWA operators. The value of these new operators is demonstrated through a case study centered on investment matters. This study evaluates the economic and governance performance of seven South Asian nations utilizing nine indicators from 2021 data. The research examines 5 economic indicators including GDP growth, exports and imports (% of GDP), inflation, and labor force metrics, alongside 4 governance indicators focusing on corruption control, government effectiveness, and political stability. We use min–max normalization to standardize the varied values, which originally ranged from 0.5% to 77.7% across various metrics. Following this, the normalized inverse penalty method is used to derive optimal weights for these indicators, tackling the task of combining multidimensional data. Subsequently, we implement and evaluate various penalty-based aggregation methodologies on the normalized data, each offering a distinct approach to penalizing outliers and balancing indicator weights. The study compares the results obtained from these operators to assess their impact on country rankings and overall performance evaluation. This approach allows for a comprehensive comparison of countries’ performances, integrating both economic and governance dimensions into a single, quantifiable framework.},

  abstract     = {Fake news detection (FND) is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) focused on identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities in understanding semantics and performing logical inference. However, their tendency to generate hallucinations poses significant challenges in accurately detecting deceptive content, leading to suboptimal performance. In addition, existing FND methods often underutilize the extensive prior knowledge embedded within LLMs, resulting in less effective classification outcomes. To address these issues, we propose the CAPE–FND framework, context-aware prompt engineering, designed for enhancing FND tasks. This framework employs unique veracity-oriented context-aware constraints, background information, and analogical reasoning to mitigate LLM hallucinations and utilizes self-adaptive bootstrap prompting optimization to improve LLM predictions. It further refines initial LLM prompts through adaptive iterative optimization using a random search bootstrap algorithm, maximizing the efficacy of LLM prompting. Extensive zero-shot and few-shot experiments using GPT-3.5-turbo across multiple public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our CAPE–FND framework, even surpassing advanced GPT-4.0 and human performance in certain scenarios. To support further LLM–based FND, we have made our approach’s code publicly available on GitHub (our CAPE–FND code: https://github.com/albert-jin/CAPE-FND [Accessed on 2024.09]).},

It is estimated that there are 75,000 photographs of grains, with 15,000 images corresponding to each type. The training is improved by the use of preprocessing and optimization approaches. The performance of the model was assessed based on sensitivity, specificity, precision, F 1 score, and confusion matrix analysis. The results show that EfficientNet-b1 achieved an accuracy of 99.87%, which is higher than the accuracy achieved by AlexNet (96.00%) and ResNet50 (99.00%). This study shows that EfficientNet-b1 is superior to other models that have emerged as state-of-the-art automated classification models for rice varieties. This indicates that there is a balance between the computational efficiency and the accuracy of EfficientNet-b1.

Such complexity poses challenges to clinical decision-making and the effective planning of end-of-life care in these patients. This study proposes the development of a novel intelligent clinical decision support system, designed to predict 1-year mortality in COPD patients following an acute exacerbation. The system is constructed upon a database of over 500 patients, comprising demographic, clinical, and social variables. First, a feature selection process is conducted to identify the variables that possess the greatest predictive power. Based on these, the data for each patient are encapsulated in a pseudosymbol construct that represents and consolidates them. The construction of the pseudosymbol comprises two distinct steps: (1) transforming the variables into a sound composition and (2) generating the corresponding spectrogram, which constitutes a visual representation (i.e., an image). The system employs a convolutional neural network, SqueezeNet, as the inference engine to calculate the 1-year mortality risk based on the images. Ten percent of the data was reserved for testing the system, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) close to 0.85, indicating a high predictive power. Despite this promising initial result, further clinical validations in real-world settings will be necessary to confirm the system’s applicability and usefulness.},

Traditional sensor-based methods suffer from high deployment costs and limited scalability, while centralized machine learning approaches raise significant privacy concerns. Recent crowdsensing-based systems leverage smartphone sensor data but face two major challenges: user privacy protection and unreliable participant contributions. To address these issues, this study proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates differential privacy with the exponential mechanism to ensure user anonymity during decentralized training. Furthermore, a novel utility-based filtering mechanism is employed to detect and exclude low-quality or adversarial data, enhancing model reliability. Advanced deep learning models, including long short–term memory (LSTM) and ensemble learning, are integrated to improve prediction accuracy in temporal and noisy environments. The dataset consists of mobile sensor data, including battery temperature, CPU usage, and environmental temperature measurements, collected from participants in real-world settings. The framework achieved high accuracy, with the LSTM model outperforming others (federated MAE: 1.292, MAPE: 0.0511) and performing comparably to centralized models (MAE: 1.179, MAPE: 0.0462) while ensuring privacy. The proposed framework showed comparable performance to centralized models while ensuring strong privacy guarantees. The integration of privacy-preserving mechanisms and robust data filtering enables a scalable and reliable solution suitable for practical deployment in large-scale ambient temperature estimation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Ming potential patterns from patient data are usually treated as a high-dimensional data clustering problem. Evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithms with feature selection (FS) are widely used to handle this problem. Among the existing algorithms, FS can be performed either before or during the clustering process. However, research on performing FS at both stages (hybrid FS), which can yield robust and credible clustering results, is still in its infancy. This paper introduces an improved high-dimensional patient data clustering algorithm with hybrid FS called variable dimensional multiobjective lifetime constrained quantum PSO with reinforcement learning (VLQPSOR). VLQPSOR consists of two main independent stages. In the first stage, a dimensionality reduction ensemble strategy is developed before clustering to reduce the patient dataset’s dimensionality, resulting in subdatasets of varying dimensions. In the second stage, an improved multiobjective QPSO clustering algorithm is proposed to simultaneously conduct dimensionality reduction and clustering. To accomplish this, several strategies are employed. Firstly, the variable dimensional lifetime constrained particle learning strategy, the continuous-to-binary encoding transformation strategy, and multiple external archives elite learning strategy are introduced to further reduce the dimensionality of the subdatasets and mitigate the risk of QPSO getting trapped in local optima. Secondly, an improved reinforcement learning–based clustering method selection strategy is proposed to adaptively select the optimal classical clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that VLQPSOR outperforms five representative comparative algorithms across four validity indexes and clustering partitions for most patient datasets. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in enhancing the performance of QPSO.},

Classical AI models, which rely on labeled data for learning, struggle to adapt to dynamic, unstructured environments due to their offline learning paradigms. Conversely, embodied intelligence emphasizes interactive learning, acquiring richer information through environmental interactions for training, thereby enabling autonomous learning and action. Early embodied tasks primarily centered on navigation. With the surge in popularity of large language models (LLMs), the focus shifted to integrating LLMs/multimodal large models (MLM) with robots, empowering them to tackle more intricate tasks through reasoning and planning, leveraging the prior knowledge imparted by LLM/MLM. This work reviews initial embodied tasks and corresponding research, categorizes various current embodied intelligence schemes deployed in robotics within the context of LLM/MLM, summarizes the perception–planning–action (PPA) paradigm, evaluates the performance of MLM across different schemes, and offers insights for future development directions in this domain.},

  abstract     = {The crayfish optimization algorithm (COA) is a recent bionic optimization technique that mimics the summer sheltering, foraging, and competitive behaviors of crayfish. Although COA has outperformed some classical metaheuristic (MH) algorithms in preliminary studies, it still manifests the shortcomings of falling into local optimal stagnation, slow convergence speed, and exploration–exploitation imbalance in addressing intractable optimization problems. To alleviate these limitations, this study introduces a novel modified crayfish optimization algorithm with multiple search strategies, abbreviated as MCOA. First, specular reflection learning is implemented in the initial iterations to enrich population diversity and broaden the search scope. Then, the location update equation in the exploration procedure of COA is supplanted by the expanded exploration strategy adopted from Aquila optimizer (AO), endowing the proposed algorithm with a more efficient exploration power. Subsequently, the motion characteristics inherent to Lévy flight are embedded into local exploitation to aid the search agent in converging more efficiently toward the global optimum. Finally, a vertical crossover operator is meticulously designed to prevent trapping in local optima and to balance exploration and exploitation more robustly. The proposed MCOA is compared against twelve advanced optimization algorithms and nine similar improved variants on the IEEE CEC2005, CEC2019, and CEC2022 test sets. The experimental results demonstrate the reliable optimization capability of MCOA, which separately achieves the minimum Friedman average ranking values of 1.1304, 1.7000, and 1.3333 on the three test benchmarks. In most test cases, MCOA can outperform other comparison methods regarding solution accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. The practicality of MCOA has been further corroborated through its application to seven engineering design issues and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning tasks in complex three-dimensional environments. Our findings underscore the competitive edge and potential of MCOA for real-world engineering applications. The source code for MCOA can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.5400731.v1 .},

  abstract     = {The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare, law, and defense demands robust mechanisms to ensure transparency and explainability in decision-making processes. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have advanced significantly, their growing complexity presents persistent interpretability challenges. Existing maturity frameworks, such as Capability Maturity Model Integration, fall short in addressing the distinct requirements of explainability in AI systems, particularly where ethical compliance and public trust are paramount. To address this gap, we propose the Maturity Model for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence: Analysis and Evaluation (MM4XAI-AE), a domain-agnostic maturity model tailored to assess and guide the practical deployment of explainability in AI-based applications. The model integrates two complementary components: an analysis model and an evaluation model, structured across four maturity levels—operational, justified, formalized, and managed. It evaluates explainability across three critical dimensions: technical foundations, structured design, and human-centered explainability. MM4XAI-AE is grounded in the PAG-XAI framework, emphasizing the interrelated dimensions of practicality, auditability, and governance, thereby aligning with current reflections on responsible and trustworthy AI. The MM4XAI-AE model is empirically validated through a structured evaluation of thirteen published AI applications from diverse sectors, analyzing their design and deployment practices. The results show a wide distribution across maturity levels, underscoring the model’s capacity to identify strengths, gaps, and actionable pathways for improving explainability. This work offers a structured and scalable framework to standardize explainability practices and supports researchers, developers, and policymakers in fostering more transparent, ethical, and trustworthy AI systems.},

  abstract     = {Lithium batteries are one class of key components in new-energy vehicles, and surface defects are easily generated during production, causing serious threats to safety. Most deep learning methods of surface defect detection heavily rely on lots of high-quality labeled samples. Unfortunately, it is very difficult and expensive to prepare defect datasets of lithium batteries in practice. To deal with this issue, this paper presents cross-object transfer learning (COTL)–based few-shot surface defect detection of lithium batteries by resort to massive defect samples of other objects. The COTL model is composed of image preprocessing, feature extraction, feature fusion, and contrastive learning-based defect detection modules. The ResNeXt-101 network is used as the backbone to enhance feature extraction capability. The path aggregation feature pyramid network (PAFPN) is used to realize multiscale feature fusion. The contrastive learning branch is added to improve the discrimination ability among different categories of region proposals under few defect samples and increase the generalization ability. Then, experiments are done to testify the proposed method, where base-class defect dataset from other objects and new-class defect dataset from soft-pack lithium batteries are adopted for training and testing. Furthermore, model comparison and ablation studies are performed. The results show that the recall rate, the AP50, the mAP, and the F1 values of the COTL model are much better than those of other existing models when only using few defect samples. In particular, when there are only 30 new-class defect samples, the above four metrics of the COTL model are already larger than 0.90. The results testify that the proposed COTL model provides a more effective solution for few-shot surface defect detection of lithium batteries.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a new dense pest counting problem to predict densely distributed pests captured by digital traps. Unlike traditional detection-based counting models for sparsely distributed objects, trap-based pest counting must deal with dense pest distributions that pose challenges such as severe occlusion, wide pose variation, and similar appearances in colors and textures. To address these problems, it is essential to incorporate the local attention mechanism, which identifies locally important and unimportant areas to learn locally grouped features, thereby enhancing discriminative performance. Accordingly, this study presents a novel design that integrates locally grouped and scale-guided attention into a multiscale CenterNet framework. To group local features with similar attributes, a straightforward method is introduced using the heatmap predicted by the first hourglass containing pest centroid information, which eliminates the need for complex clustering models. To enhance attentiveness, the pixel attention module transforms the heatmap into a learnable map. Subsequently, scale-guided attention is deployed to make the object and background features more discriminative, achieving multiscale feature fusion. Through experiments, the proposed model is verified to enhance object features based on local grouping and discriminative feature attention learning. Additionally, the proposed model is highly effective in overcoming occlusion and poses variation problems, making it more suitable for dense pest counting. In particular, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin, with a remarkable contribution to dense pest counting. To be specific, the proposed model can improve accuracy by approximately 1058.2%, 90.8%, and 31.3% in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) compared with Faster RCNN, YOLOv7, and multiscale CenterNet, respectively, for a uniform dataset.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been employed for a variety of inspection and monitoring tasks, including agricultural applications and search and rescue (SAR) in remote areas. However, traditional monitoring methods tend to focus on optimizing one aspect. This study aims to propose a complete framework by integrating advanced methods to provide a robust and accurate path coverage solution. The combination of edge detection and area decomposition with a pathfinding algorithm can improve the overall performance. An effective edge detection model is developed that simultaneously detects the boundary and segments the area of interest (AOI) from the aerial land images and provides precise area mapping of the area. An intuitive grid decomposition with grid-to-graph mapping improves the flexibility of the area decomposition and ensures maximal coverage and safe operation routes for the UAVs. Finally, a robust modified simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm is introduced to determine the shortest path coverage route. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested on aerial imagery. Area decomposition ensures that there are no gaps in the AOI during the coverage planning. The MSA algorithm obtains the minimum length cost, charge consumption cost, and minimum number of turns to cover the area. It is shown that the integration of these techniques enhances the performance of the coverage path planning (CPP). A comparison of the proposed approach with benchmark algorithms further demonstrates its effectiveness. This study contributes to creating a complete CPP application for UAVs, which may assist with precision agriculture as well as safe and secure rescue operations.},

There is an urgent demand to shift the adaptive manufacturing from passive scheduling to proactive scheduling.

This paper aims at the production scheduling and mixed-flow assembly line maintenance and proposes an improved hybrid Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm (hybrid TSGA)–based proactive scheduling method for production prediction. Initially, the method constructs a real-time state model for the equipment state, workshop manufacturing efficiency, manufacturing resource state, and manufacturing execution system feedback information. The production process status information is used as input to a mathematical modeling method, which is used to obtain the production trend of mixed flow assembly line in the workshop. Afterward, the hybrid TSGA is deployed and its sequential decision-making capability is used to generate a proactive scheduling scheme based on the production trend prediction. The proposed methodology was implemented in a robotic flexible welding automobile production line for production scheduling, with its efficacy empirically validated. Simulation results demonstrated a 6% reduction in total completion time for multimachine, multiprocess scheduling scenarios, demonstrating superior performance.},

Despite the excellent performance of attention mechanisms in global modeling, they often overlook local correlations between seasonal cycles. Drawing on the idea of trend-seasonality decomposition, we design a seasonal cycle-aware time-series forecasting model (SCA-Net). This model uses a dual-branch extraction architecture to decompose time series into seasonal and trend components, modeling them based on their intrinsic features, thereby improving prediction accuracy and model interpretability. We propose a method combining global modeling and local feature extraction within seasonal cycles to capture the global view and explore latent features. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain attention mechanism for global modeling and use multiscale dilated convolution to capture local correlations within each cycle, ensuring more comprehensive and accurate feature extraction. For simpler trend components, we apply a regression method and merge the output with the seasonal components via residual connections. To improve seasonal cycle identification, we design an adaptive decomposition method that extracts trend components layer by layer, enabling better decomposition and more useful information extraction. Extensive experiments on eight classic datasets show that SCA-Net achieves a performance improvement of 12.1% in multivariate forecasting and 15.6% in univariate forecasting compared to the baseline.},

The information that is acquired additionally from fused images can be effectively employed for highly accurate positioning of abnormality. Since diverse kinds of images produce various information, IF becomes more complicated for conventional methods to generate fused images. Here, a unified image fusion convolutional neural network (UIFCNN) is designed for IF utilizing medical images. To execute the IF process, two input images, namely, native T1 and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) are taken from a dataset.

The two segmented outputs are fused utilizing the UIFCNN that is introduced by assimilating unified and unsupervised end-to-end IF network (U2Fusion) with IF framework based on the CNN (IFCNN).

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has made human tasks easier compared to earlier days. It has revolutionized various domains, from paper drafting to video editing. However, some individuals exploit AI to create deceptive content, such as fake videos, audios, and images, to mislead others. To address this, researchers and large corporations have proposed solutions for detecting fake content using classical deep learning models. However, these models often suffer from a large number of trainable parameters, which leads to large model sizes and, consequently, computational intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose various hybrid classical–quantum models that use a classical pre-trained model as a front-end feature extractor, followed by a quantum-based LSTM network, that is, QLSTM. These pre-trained models are based on the ResNet architecture, such as ResNet34, 50, and 101. We have compared the performance of the proposed models with their classical counterparts. These proposed models combine the strengths of classical and quantum systems for the detection of deepfake video (without audio). Our results indicate that the proposed models significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, as well as quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) parameters, which leads to a smaller model size than the classical models. Despite the reduced parameter, the performance of the proposed models is either superior to or comparable with that of their classical equivalent. The proposed hybrid quantum models, that is, ResNet34-QLSTM, ResNet50-QLSTM, and ResNet101-QLSTM, achieve a reduction of approximately 1.50%, 4.59%, and 5.24% in total trainable parameters compared to their equivalent classical models, respectively. Additionally, QLSTM linked with the proposed models reduces its trainable parameters by 99.02%, 99.16%, and 99.55%, respectively, compared to equivalent classical LSTM. This significant reduction highlights the efficiency of the quantum-based network in terms of resource usage. The trained model sizes of the proposed models are 81.35, 88.06, and 162.79, and their equivalent classical models are 82.59, 92.28, and 171.76 in MB, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Handling class imbalance is a fundamental challenge in supervised learning, particularly in real-world scenarios where minority classes are critical yet underrepresented. This paper presents a novel dynamic-balancing pipeline that enhances automated machine learning (AutoML) performance on imbalanced tabular datasets. The proposed approach integrates both traditional and generative resampling techniques with adaptive, class-specific thresholds, enabling automated and dataset-sensitive balancing strategies. To assess its generalizability, the pipeline is applied uniformly across binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks. Each configuration is evaluated within an AutoML framework using performance and efficiency metrics, with outcomes validated through statistical testing and effect size analysis. The study also incorporates dataset complexity measures—including feature-label dependency and class overlap—to investigate how structural characteristics affect balancing efficacy. By combining principled resampling, exhaustive grid search, and rigorous evaluation, the pipeline enables more robust and efficient AutoML workflows. This work contributes a flexible and reproducible framework for addressing class imbalance, particularly in multilabel contexts, and establishes a foundation for scalable, complexity-aware resampling in automated model development.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disease. In addition to the functional deterioration of memory and cognition, patients with severe conditions lose their self-care ability. Patients exhibiting symptoms are often attributed to aging and thus lack proper medical care. If it can be diagnosed early, the doctor can provide adequate treatments to mitigate the symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reflect the characteristics of different human tissues and organs, and is a common tool implemented in clinical examinations. In this study, we tested learning-based approaches to detect disease progression in AD patients using MRI. Specifically, each patient is categorized as one of the following four classes: cognitive normal, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and AD. To extract 3D information in MRI, we proposed a 3D convolutional neural network structure based on ResNet3D-18. We designed various multiclass classification frameworks. Moreover, we implemented ensemble classification combining these frameworks. Experiments demonstrated great potential for learning-based approaches on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. The ensemble approach performed the best with an accuracy of 0.950, which is competitive with neurologists in diagnosing AD progression in clinical practice. With precise detection, patients can understand their conditions early and seek proper treatments.},

Subsequently, factors such as network performance and economic cost are comprehensively considered, and integrated into a single index using the entropy weighting method. The proportion of different indicators is then determined, and a formula for calculating the required number of heterogeneous nodes under various network conditions is derived by considering parameters such as network area size, node communication threshold distance, and the number of common nodes.

They fail to fully utilize the frequency domain’s multiscale features and spatial relationships. For this situation, this study proposes a time series forecasting method based on the multiscale fusion transformer for financial data, which aims to extract significant periodic patterns using frequency domain analysis effectively. Besides, the multiscale attention mechanism and graph convolution module are introduced to realize the detailed modeling of the time series simultaneously, effectively capture the spatial relationship, and obtain the correlation between different series on multiple frequency scales.

  abstract     = {In e-commerce, customer reviews wield significant influence over business strategies. This study proposes a robust sentiment analysis (SA) model tailored to e-commerce recommendations. It aims to address the key limitations of existing methods, including challenges in generalizability, feature extraction, class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning. Our process uses an autoencoder (AE) to extract key features from the input sentence. We employ DistilBERT for word embedding, which performs faster than the standard BERT model (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers). The proposed architecture integrates an AE with a transductive long short-term memory (TLSTM) unit, which is trained with a modified generative adversarial network (GAN). TLSTM leverages transductive learning to emphasize training samples that closely resemble those in the test distribution, enhancing the flexibility and predictive accuracy of the model. Within the GAN, the generator is designed to exclude gradients from dominant batch instances, encouraging greater output diversity and generalization. Once the AE is trained, its compressed feature representations are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier. To tackle class imbalance issues during classification, we implement a reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism. This strategy prioritizes the minority class by applying a reward mechanism to balance the classification outcomes. Moreover, we use the Bayesian optimization hyperband (BOHB) algorithm to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model. Experimental results on the AIV, AA, and Yelp datasets demonstrate superior performance, with F-measure scores of 91.603%, 89.504%, and 90.397%, respectively. These outcomes validate the robustness of the model and its potential to significantly enhance recommendation quality in dynamic e-commerce environments.},

We propose a novel deep learning model, VAN-ConvLSTM, for rapid and accurate prediction of UAV downwash airflow. Unlike conventional ConvLSTM-based frameworks, which struggle with modeling long-range dependencies and detailed spatial variations, our model introduces a visual attention unit (VAN) to enhance spatiotemporal sensitivity. The model architecture combines a convolutional encoder for spatial feature extraction, a VAN module for attention-guided temporal modeling, and a ConvLSTM decoder for sequence generation. This synergistic design improves both the accuracy and interpretability of airflow prediction. Experimental results show that the VAN-ConvLSTM model achieves an SSIM score of 0.96, demonstrating high consistency with CFD simulations. Compared to baseline methods, our model reduces error while improving stability and spatial fidelity. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of VAN and ConvLSTM modules. The results, verified through three representative case studies, confirm that VAN-ConvLSTM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, while offering significantly enhanced computational efficiency. This demonstrates its strong potential as a reliable and scalable alternative to traditional CFD methods in rotor airflow prediction scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic speed prediction holds immense significance in mitigating traffic congestion and enhancing traffic safety. However, traffic data exhibit distinct patterns across different cycles (such as weekdays, weekends, and holidays), making it challenging for traditional models to effectively capture this multiperiod heterogeneity in traffic data. Furthermore, most existing research on traffic speed prediction struggles to efficiently capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of dynamic traffic data simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, this paper first introduces spatiotemporal-aware position encoding (STAPE) technology, which addresses the multiperiod heterogeneity in traffic data by integrating temporal cycle information with spatial position information. Second, a multilevel spatiotemporal feature extraction architecture is designed, leveraging graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the topological structure and spatial features of the traffic road network. By applying gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture the temporal dependencies of traffic data, and combining GCN and GRU in multiple stages, this architecture deeply explores the spatiotemporal features of traffic data. Additionally, this paper integrates a multihead attention mechanism, which, in conjunction with the parallelized attention channel adaptive mechanism and the multilevel spatiotemporal feature extraction architecture, enhances the model’s ability to adaptively model different spatiotemporal patterns dynamically, thereby efficiently capturing the dynamically changing spatiotemporal features. Extensive performance evaluation experiments conducted on the METR-LA and PEMS-BAY datasets demonstrate that the predictive performance of the proposed model surpasses that of nine other baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Early and accurate identification of malignant melanoma continues to be a major challenge for clinicians in the field. Traditional diagnostic approaches, including physical examination, histology, imaging, and nodal assessments, are frequently costly, require significant expertise, and can display large variations among clinicians. These factors may result in missed or misdiagnosis, which often significantly affects a patient’s prognosis. We examine in detail how the application of AI methods such as machine learning and deep learning can be used to advance early detection and identification of melanoma. We review various AI algorithms, including standard classifiers, ensemble techniques, and complex deep learning models. Hybrid models that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) are emphasized in this review, as they show enhanced performance and improved resistance to variations in the diagnostician’s input. Better utility of transfer learning and data augmentation approaches is discussed to overcome the challenges posed by small and unbalanced medical datasets. The authors consider the combination of various types of medical information for more effective cancer diagnosis. However, significant obstacles, including model explainability, privacy safeguarding, and clinical evaluation, still need to be addressed. Extensive efforts are needed to overcome these barriers if AI systems are to be effectively adopted within healthcare environments. We suggest that AI offers the opportunity to revolutionize melanoma care by enabling rapid decision support and individualized treatment plans. Realizing this opportunity will depend on effective partnerships between researchers, clinicians, and industry to bring together advances in technology and their effective implementation in the healthcare system.},

However, standard AI-based systems suffer from catastrophic forgetting when undertaking sequential learning of multiple tasks in dynamic environments. Continual learning has emerged as a promising approach to address catastrophic forgetting. It enables AI systems to learn, transfer, augment, fine-tune, and reuse knowledge for future tasks. The techniques used to achieve continual learning are inspired by the learning processes of the human brain. In this study, we present a comprehensive review of research and recent developments in continual learning, highlighting key contributions and challenges. We discuss essential functions of the biological brain that are pivotal for achieving continual learning and map these functions to the recent machine-learning methods to aid understanding. Additionally, we offer a critical review of five recent types of continual learning methods inspired by the biological brain. We also provide empirical results, analysis, challenges, and future directions.

However, centralized IDM solutions come with high trust costs, single points of failure, and a need for appropriate security response. This paper proposes a novel decentralized IDM framework utilizing blockchain technology and automatic provisioning (AP) techniques to improve cloud computing’s security, scalability, and operational efficiency. The framework employs Ethereum smart contracts and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure, transparent, and automated management of user identities. Key features include support for single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus for secure transaction validation. Our proposed scheme utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts for managing user access, ensuring transparent and immutable record-keeping. The scheme introduces RBAC mechanisms to ensure precise privilege allocation and dynamic updates. The scheme also supports key IDM processes, including SSO, MFA, and lifecycle management of identities. The framework incorporates DPoS consensus to enhance security for efficient transaction validation and the prevention of fraud. To address fraudulent activities, the scheme uses machine learning to detect blockchain fraud with 99.1% accuracy, demonstrating robustness and efficiency for large-scale cloud infrastructures.},

Online reviews have become a reliable data source for extracting consumer preferences. Importance-performance analysis (IPA) is widely used in preference analysis, but it normally ignores the effects of the performance of competitors as well as the asymmetric between requirements and satisfaction. Therefore, this study extends the IPA model and proposes a preference analysis method that considers asymmetric impact and competitors based on group wisdom and influence mining from online reviews. To do so, after identifying service attributes from online reviews, preferences hidden in massive online reviews are quantified using linguistic distribution assessments. Then, the influence of reviewers is measured by introducing both the relationship influence and the information influence from different types of reviewers as group wisdom to determine the performance of service attributes. The concept of competitive dominance degree is defined as the degree of competitive advantage relative to that of competitors under realistic contexts. The preference analysis method of this study reflects group wisdom and competitive environments more realistically. Its applicability and effectiveness have been testified in the hospitality industry.},

This method utilizes lightweight detection agents based on CNN deployed on each controller to extract traffic features preliminarily. Then it inputs the feature data into the GRU-based deep detection model hosted in the cloud for collaborative training and completes the final abnormal detection task. Since the feature extraction tasks are distributed across multiple controllers, the cloud server only needs to relearn and classify the extracted feature data, which is less costly than directly extracting feature information from the original traffic data and occupies less bandwidth resources than transmitting complete data packets. The experiment shows that the method achieves an abnormal detection accuracy of 0.9939, a recall rate of 0.9831, and a false alarm rate of only 0.0244, obtaining a higher precision and lower false alarm rate than traditional detection methods.},

Existing automatic inspection approaches lack high robustness, as well as portability, and have movement restrictions and complexity. This study presents the design and development of a scalable, comprehensive automated inspection, cleaning, and evaluation mechanism (CAICEM) for large-sized pipelines and barrels with diameters in the range of 105 mm–210 mm. The proposed system is divided into electrical and mechanical assemblies that are independently designed, tested, fabricated, integrated, and controlled with industrial grid controllers and processors. These actuators are suitably programmed to provide the desired actions through toggle switches on a simple housing subassembly. The stress analysis and material specifications are obtained using ANSYS to ensure robustness and practicability. Later, on-ground testing and optimization are performed before industrial prototyping. The inspection system of the proposed mechanism includes barrel-mounted and brush-mounted cameras with sensors utilized to keep track of the pipeline deposits and monitor user activity. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is cost-effective and achieves the desired objectives with minimum human efforts in the least possible time for both smooth and rifled large-diameter pipes and barrels.},

  abstract     = {The convergence of machine learning and searchable encryption enhances the ability to protect the privacy and security of data and enhances the processing power of confidential data. To enable users to efficiently perform machine learning tasks on encrypted data domains, we delve into oblivious keyword search with authorization (OKSA). The OKSA scheme effectively maintains the privacy of the user’s query keywords and prevents the cloud server from inferring ciphertext information through the searching process. However, limitations arise because the traditional OKSA approach does not support multi-keyword searches. If a data file is associated with multiple keywords, each keyword and corresponding data must be encrypted one by one, resulting in inefficiency. We introduce an innovative approach aimed at enhancing the efficiency of search processes while addressing the limitation of current encryption and search systems that handle only a single keyword. This method, known as the oblivious multiple keyword search with authorization (OMKSA), is designed for more effective keyword retrieval. One of our important innovations is that it uses the arithmetic techniques of bilinear pairs to generate new tokens and new search methods to optimize communication efficiency. Moreover, we present a detailed and rigorous demonstration of the security for our proposed protocol, aligned with the predefined security model. We conducted a comparative experiment to determine which of the two schemes, OKSA and OMKSA, is more efficient when querying multiple keywords. Based on our experimental results, our OMKSA is very efficient for data searchers. As the number of query keywords increases, the computational overhead of connected keyword searches remains stable. Finally, as we move into the 5G era, the potential applications of OMKSA are huge, with clear implications for areas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Our findings pave the way for further exploration and deployment of these frontier areas.},

As various LLM alternatives have been developed, the current study proposes a novel decision-support framework for evaluating and benchmarking LLMs based on multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. In the proposed framework, an improved version of the best-worst method (BWM) is proposed to effectively reduce the computational complexity of assigning a critical weight for the evaluation criteria of LLMs. Then, the improved BWM is integrated with the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method for ranking LLM alternatives. Findings show that the improved BWM successfully computes the criteria weights with low computational complexity compared to the original BWM. According to the enhanced BWM, the ‘factual errors’ criterion received the highest significant weight (0.2681), while the ‘logical inconsistencies’ criteria obtained the lowest (0.0827). The rest of the criteria were distributed in between that range. Subsequently, CoCoSo ranked the involved LLM alternatives in two different runs based on the extracted weights. Sensitivity analysis was employed to evaluate the effect of the assessment criteria on LLMs’ evaluation.},

  abstract     = {The winch’s performance under complex sea conditions is significantly influenced by its collecting and releasing processes. To enhance its performance and reliability, an optimization approach considering wave disturbances and control laws is proposed to balance time efficiency and tension stability. Within a multiobjective optimization framework, the method designs constant tension control and robust adaptive speed control and introduces sinusoidal acceleration trajectories to minimize tension surges and reduce system impacts caused by rapid starts/stops. The constant tension controller reduces wave disturbances, while the speed controller manages the working process. These controllers are designed with unknown reference signals determined during the optimization process. Additionally, the objective functions in the optimization phase aim to reduce working time and tension fluctuations, with constraints ensuring system safety and mission requirements. Furthermore, an experimental platform constructed on a ship validates the accuracy of the winch model. The optimized process not only shortens operational time, as collecting same length only consumption 127.44 s compared 143.14 s without optimization, but also reduces tension and acceleration. More importantly, transitions between states become more gradual. This indicates that the proposed method is both time-efficient and effective in dampening tension fluctuations and mitigating the effects of abrupt changes during the working process.},

Due to the security and privacy requirements, anonymous authentication schemes are widely used in IoV. However, traditional certificate-based anonymous authentication schemes suffer from several drawbacks such as poor scalability and high management costs of certificates. Furthermore, centralized authentication architectures are susceptible to a single point of failure. To this end, we propose a blockchain-based certificateless anonymous cross-domain authentication (BCACA) scheme for IoV. In this scheme, we adapt a network model with multiple domain managers (DMs) based on blockchain, in which DMs establish distributed trust within the network and act as miners to upload vehicle registration and authentication transactions to the blockchain, assisting in cross-domain authentication. Based on this framework, a certificateless signature scheme is designed, which supports authentication across different domains without the need for complex certificate exchange mechanisms. In addition, this scheme provides an identity revocation mechanism encompassing both intradomain and cross-domain scenarios to ensure the security and reliability of the IoV. Security proofs demonstrate that the scheme is provably secure under the random oracle model and exhibits strong resistance against known attacks. Performance analysis indicates that the proposed scheme has lower computational overhead and transmission delay compared to other relevant schemes.},

To address this, we propose the cross contrast patch embedding (CCPE) module based on the Swin Transformer. This module leverages multiscale spatial contrast information in both vertical and horizontal directions to enhance the network’s discrimination of underlying details. By combining cross contrast with the transformer, we exploit the advantages of the transformer in the global receptive field and context modeling while compensating for its inability to capture very low-level details, resulting in a more powerful backbone network tailored for smoke recognition tasks. In addition, we introduce the separable negative sampling mechanism (SNSM) to address supervision signal confusion during training and release the SKLFS-WildFire test dataset, the largest real-world wildfire test set to date, for systematic evaluation.

  abstract     = {In the area of ecology, counting animals to estimate population size and types of species is important for the wildlife conservation. This includes analysing massive volumes of image, video or audio/acoustic data and traditional counting techniques. Automating the process of identifying, classifying and counting animals would be helpful to researchers as it will phase out the tedious human–labour tasks of manual counting and labelling. The intention of this work is to address manual identification and counting methods of images by implementing an automated solution using computer vision and deep learning. This study applies a classification model to classify species and trains an object detection model using deep convolutional neural networks to automatically identify and determine the count of four mammal species in 3304 images extracted from camera traps. The image classification model reports a classification accuracy of 98%, and the YOLOv8 object detection model automatically detects buffalo, elephant, rhino and zebra school mean average precision of 50 of 89% and mean average precision of 50–95 of 72.2% and provides an accurate count over all animal classes. Furthermore, it performs well across various image scenarios such as blurriness, day, night and images displaying multiple species compared to the RT-DETR model. The results of the study display that the application of computer vision and deep learning methods on data-scarce and data-enriched scenarios, respectively, can conserve biologists and ecologists an enormous amount of time used on time-consuming human tasks methods of analysis and counting. The high-performing deep learning models developed capable of accurately classifying and localising multiple species can be integrated into the existing conservation workflows to process large volumes of camera trap images in real time. This integration can significantly reduce the manual labour required for labelling and counting, improve the consistency and speed of wildlife surveys and enable timely decision-making in habitat protection, population assessment and antipoaching initiatives. Additionally, these automated identification techniques can contribute towards enhancing wildlife conservation and future studies.},

  abstract     = {Quantum information processing introduces novel approaches for classical data encoding to encompass the complex patterns of input data of practical computational challenges using basic principles of quantum mechanics. The classification of diabetes is an example of a problem that can be efficiently resolved by using quantum unitary operations and the variational quantum classifier (VQC). This study demonstrates the effects of the number of qubits, types of feature maps, optimizers’ class, and the number of layers in the parametrized circuit, and the number of learnable parameters in ansatz influences the effectiveness of the VQC. In total, 76 variants of VQC are analyzed for four and eight qubits’ cases and their results are compared with six classical machine learning models to predict diabetes. Three different types of feature maps (Pauli, Z, and ZZ) are implemented during analysis in addition to three different optimizers (COBYLA, SPSA and SLSQP). Experiments are performed using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). The results conclude that VQC with six layers embedded with an error correction scaling factor of 0.01 and having ZZ feature map and COBYLA optimizer outperforms other quantum variants. The optimal proposed model attained the accuracy of 0.85 and 0.80 for eight and four qubits’ cases, respectively. In addition, the final quantum model among 76 variants was compared with six classical machine learning models. The results suggest that the proposed VQC model has outperformed four classical models including SVM, random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and linear regression (LR).},

  abstract     = {Container-based cloud brokers are third-party services that act as an intermediate entity between users and multiple cloud providers. The cloud brokers intended to perform discovery and provisioning of cloud services with an affordable pricing scheme. As cloud services can be provisioned on-demand basis for multiple users, the cloud brokers are unable to provide the most suited services to the users on time. To address this issue, the proposed work introduces a novel approach for efficient cloud service provisioning by utilizing container-based cloud service brokerage and implementing service arbitrage across various cloud providers. A microservice architecture-based service discovery mechanism is developed which incorporates a service registry for tracking newly available services from the providers. Docker containers are employed to orchestrate the services, which ensures streamlined management and deployment of offered services. Further, the proposed system recommends and evaluates the services to the cloud users based on probability matrices, mapping matrices, and user feedback. The performance of the proposed model is compared with existing techniques, namely, rough multidimensional matrix (RMDM) and similarity-enhanced hybrid group recommendation approach (HGRA). Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing models in terms of clustering accuracy and execution time.},
