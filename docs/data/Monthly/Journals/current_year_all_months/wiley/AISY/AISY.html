  abstract     = {Wave-based mechanisms inspired by traveling wave locomotion in animals have shown great potential use in robots to navigate unstructured environments. Herein, the dual actuator wave-like navigator (DAWN), a multisurface robot employing two actuated helical wave generators to produce continuous traveling waves on flexible link tracks enclosed in elastomer skins, is presented. These skins provide mechanical resilience, enhanced friction, and adaptability on uneven terrain. The robot demonstrates steering and controlled locomotion on flat surfaces, inclines, and declines. To characterize the robot, locomotion tests are performed on plywood, PMMA, and sand, achieving average linear speeds of 16.00, 15.76, and 1.63 mm s −1 , respectively. A key innovation is cyclic pneumatic actuation of the skins with actuation frequencies of 0.5 and 0.9 Hz, improving locomotion performance on sand to 2.22 and 2.70 mm s −1 . DAWN's capability to move on sand, grass, gravel, and wet soil is also demonstrated. Its modular design enables plug-and-play assembly of components including helical wave generators, flexible link tracks, and elastomer skins, allowing for easy maintenance, modification, and replacements. Potential applications include navigation in complex terrains for search and rescue, inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The high reliance on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) knowledge and practical skills has led to prolonged training cycles for therapists and a significant talent shortage, posing a severe challenge to the standardization of TCM physiotherapy in rehabilitation. Meanwhile, most physiotherapy robots based on rigid robotics technology suffer from insufficient safety and adaptability, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment effects. This paper presents a novel wearable pneumatic soft physiotherapy device, designed to achieve high-safety and personalized physiotherapy for shoulder and neck acupoint massage. The device integrates four soft massage actuators, four embedded thin-film stress sensors, two miniature airflow sources, and a power supply system, enhancing its portability. Additionally, a hybrid control strategy combining feedforward inverse compensation and PID feedback is proposed to regulate and customize the therapy intensity on human acupoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed device can apply therapeutic intensities ranging from 0 to 3.45 N to human acupoints, effectively adapting to the human shoulder and neck region to achieve good wearing comfort, and performing safe acupoint massage with customized physiotherapy intensities. This study explores and realizes the integration of emerging soft robotics technology with TCM, providing a paradigm for the development of more soft physiotherapy devices.},

  abstract     = {Tensegrity robotic joints, inspired by the musculoskeletal systems of vertebrate animals, have gained interest due to their unique interplay of tension and compression forces, offering a high strength-to-weight ratio and inherent adaptability. However, their use in legged and grasping applications remains challenging. A key challenge is striking the right balance between high compliance, which can undermine stability and control, and high stiffness, which can restrict essential movement and demand more powerful actuators. This study presents a tensegrity-inspired spine-like joint that integrates thin McKibben pneumatic artificial muscles and rubber cords directly into its tensile network. The artificial muscles enable active joint bending while also serving as tensile elements. The rubber cords counteract these forces, storing elastic energy to facilitate smooth recovery to the original position. The joint's topology design is primarily influenced by the artificial muscles’ limited 20% contraction. To optimize the balance between range of motion, payload capacity, and structural stability, the joint's geometry is refined through an evolutionary algorithmic form-finding process. Two generated joints are integrated into two functional robotic applications: a crawling robot and a gripper, showcasing their adaptability for diverse robotic applications.},

The design methodology of these modules is reported and two potential use cases are presented. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that how it is possible to intuitively control the modular soft robotic devices, monitor their state, and use limited sensing capability with machine learning models to enable interpretations of interactions with users and the surrounding environment.},

A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the discrete elastic rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry, the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like finite element method, particularly in handling contact interactions—an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. The simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and interlayer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Biological organisms excel in dynamically reshaping their bodies to navigate and manipulate ever-changing environments, and some can even tune their mechanical properties for enhanced adaptability. Many existing shape-morphing robots rely on the inherent softness of materials or structures, which sacrifices load-bearing capacity. Despite efforts to achieve both morphing and stiffness tuning in one system, these strategies often rely on separate mechanisms, such as heating liquid metal components to reduce rigidity before employing other mechanisms to change the shape, leading to bulky and complex systems that limit practicality and scalability. Here, a tunable-stiffness architected morphing structure (TSAMS) is introduced, which unifies shape morphing and tunable stiffness in a single, compact platform. By combining 3D-printed tessellated particles with shape memory alloy springs, TSAMS transitions smoothly from soft to rigid states, exhibiting a ≈308 times increase in bending stiffness while concurrently executing intricate shape transformations through electrothermal actuation. This design is demonstrated with the following robotic applications, including rolling robots that can explore diverse terrains by climbing slopes, avoiding obstacles, and carrying loads; compact manipulators that lift objects nearly 50 times heavier than themselves; and snake-inspired robots performing undulation and sidewinding gaits. These results highlight TSAMS's potential to advance next-generation soft robots and bioinspired systems that demand both dynamic shape reconfiguration and robust structural performance in diverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in locomoting robotics have demonstrated how shape morphing can enhance efficiency, mobility, and speed during transitions between domains, such as from land to water. However, prior approaches often optimize a robot's propulsor shape, stiffness, and gait to minimize the cost of transport in distinct domains while neglecting the energy required to achieve these shape and stiffness changes at domain interfaces. Additionally, many shape-morphing robots rely on thermally driven materials that couple shape and stiffness changes to environmental temperatures, limiting their applicability in real-world multidomain scenarios. This work introduces the Jamming Amphibious Robotic Turtle (JART), which employs pressure-responsive, topologically altered kirigami laminar jamming to transform its limbs between hydrodynamic flippers and load-bearing legs. Energetic analyses reveal that JART achieves a 98.5% reduction in the energetic cost of morphing compared to thermally driven predecessors. Its pressure-responsive morphing mechanism also enables temperature-independent energy expenditures when morphing, rapid stiffness switching, decoupled control of stiffness and shape, and robust postloading shape recovery. System-level evaluations highlight JART's ability to efficiently transition between domains, demonstrated through a continuous terrestrial–aquatic–terrestrial transition at an ocean inlet. This study provides valuable insights into the design of deployable, multidomain robots, advancing their potential for real-world applications.},

This study presents the design, fabrication, and wing-morphing behavior of 3D-printed magnetic butterflies, focusing on optimal material and design parameters to replicate monarch wing-morphing behavior. Using composite of thermoplastic polyurethane and micron-sized Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic powder, 12 unique butterfly designs—varying in size, vein patterns, and stiffness—are fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printing, resulting in 84 specimens. Lightweight and batch-producible with minimal postprocessing, the specimens have weights per unit area of ≈270, 480, and 1045 g m −2 for small, medium, and large sizes, respectively. A permanent magnet induces deformation in the specimens—mimicking monarch butterflies, without embedded electronics. A systematic analysis combining finite element simulations and experiments reveals the effects of size, geometric features, and laser energy scale on wing morphing. Lower laser energy scales result in porous, fast-bending specimens, while higher scales specimen show greater mechanical strength and varied deformation, with vein structures further improving deformation. The results provide a detailed dataset for optimizing wing-morphing designs while highlighting the potential of the PBF process in creating lightweight magnetic bioinspired structures capable of optimal shape morphing.},

To achieve 3D programmable shape morphing (PSM), the deployment of array-based actuators is essential. However, a critical knowledge gap in 3D PSM is controlling the complex systems formed by these soft actuator arrays to mimic the morphology of the target shapes. This study, for the first time, represents the configuration of shape-morphing devices using point cloud data and employing deep learning to map these configurations to control inputs. Shape Morphing Net (SMNet), a method that realizes the regression from point cloud to high-dimensional control input vectors, is proposed. It has been applied to 3D PSM devices with three different actuator mechanisms, demonstrating its universal applicability to inversely reproduce the target shapes. Further, applied to previous 2D PSM devices, SMNet significantly enhances control precision from 82.23% to 97.68%. In the demonstrations of morphology mimicking, 3D PSM devices successfully replicate arbitrary target shapes obtained either through 3D scanning of physical objects or via 3D modeling software. The results show that within the deformable range of 3D PSM devices, accurate reproduction of the desired shapes is achievable.},

To address this problem, a Cu-based ultrathin ECRAM (UT-ECRAM) that uses a single 5 nm HfO x active layer and a ≈1.2 nm AlO x liner is designed. The highly efficient gate-tunable fast Cu-ion transport in the AlO x /HfO x UT-ECRAM enables 1) near-ideal linearity in weight updates (0.45) even achieved with a pulse width ( t w ) of 50 μs, 2) dynamic multilevel retention of 10 4 s, and 3) reliable cycling endurance of 10 4 cycles. A numerical analysis based on device scaling quantitatively reveals that a relatively high concentration of field-driven Cu ions (≈10 20 cm −3 ) contributes to each synaptic weight update per gate voltage ( V G ) pulse in the UT-ECRAM without becoming deactivated by traversing thicker layers. This improved gate sensitivity can ultimately overcome the linearity and the ratio/speed tradeoff relationships, paving the way for robust neuromorphic synaptic units.},

  abstract     = {Quadrupedal mobile manipulators are receiving increasing attention due to their excellent terrain adaptability and nearly unlimited workspace. Recent achievements have integrated legged mobility with manipulation capabilities, yet the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking remains a challenge, which is crucial for practical applications. This study proposes an innovative approach that integrates coordinated trajectory generation with decoupled tracking control to enhance the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking. This approach also expands the end-effector's workspace and improves the smoothness of the robot's movements. The trajectory optimization-based coordinated trajectory generator leverages the active motion of the quadruped's body to produce smooth movements. Meanwhile, the decoupled tracking control models the robotic arm and quadrupedal robot as independent floating-base systems, incorporating interaction forces to enhance the overall system's tracking accuracy. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully perform a variety of trajectory-tracking tasks, reducing the root mean squared error by 82.7% compared to independent control in the stance mode, and cutting additional computational overhead by 53.4% compared to the unified control.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and public health problem. Cardiac assist devices are crucial treatment modalities for end-stage HF, but they still face limitations, such as direct blood contact and high power consumption. We present a lightweight (<60 g), compact, electroactive polymer (EAP)-based cardiac assist device (E-CAD) as a nonblood-contacting, low-power alternative to address these limitations. E-CAD consists of EAP units paired with negative bias springs (NBSs), mounted on a flexible sleeve that wraps around the heart to assist in cardiac compression. The device is designed to be biomimetic to match the regionally varying mechanical stiffness of the heart. Benchtop silicone phantom and ex vivo porcine tests demonstrated E-CAD's ability to increase volume displacement by 1.21-fold in benchtop tests with a silicone phantom and 1.17-fold in ex vivo settings, along with an associated increase in ejection fraction, compared to cases without the device. Furthermore, it operates on low power (<0.3 W), enabling a compact design with a thin driveline (outer diameter = 0.3 mm), which reduces infection risk. In summary, we showed that EAP-based direct cardiac compression was feasible with low power demand. The improvement in cardiac output may translate into clinical benefits for advanced HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Collecting detailed information from trees via hovering with an aerial robot is both energetically inefficient and often infeasible in dense forest canopies. Perching on trees offers a promising solution by enabling prolonged observations with reduced energy consumption. To overcome perching location limitations, in this article, a bird-inspired passive perching mechanism specifically optimized for vertical tree trunks is proposed. Similar to the tail action of treecreepers ( Certhiidae family) when perching on vertical tree trunks, the proposed aerial robotic platform perches on tree surfaces using a main clawed gripping mechanism combined with a supporting “tail” mechanism featuring arrays of embedded microspines. To cope with the complex curvature of tree trunks, adaptive elastic joints that allow the mechanism to passively contact the tree's surface are introduced. By incorporating the region of attraction for the mechanism, the aerial platform is designed to be more reliable during perching maneuvers by adjusting angular movement, thereby defining suitable initial velocities and accelerations for achieving stable equilibrium. The proposed system is validated in a motion capture environment using vertical trunks with diameters ranging from 40 to 220 mm, and further demonstrates in outdoor perching tests. Results confirm the feasibility of dynamic perching on vertical tree trunks under realistic forest conditions.},

Although the application of liquid metals (LM) and their composites has improved the stretchability of various tactile sensors, there remains a considerable gap between the performance of current flexible tactile sensors and human skin, attributed to their limited sensitivity and narrow working range. In this work, a liquid metal droplet (LMD)-based flexible tactile sensor that achieves both high-pressure sensitivity of 3 × 10 −2 kPa −1 and a wide working range from 50 Pa to 1.2 MPa is proposed. The novel sensor consists of an LMD array in which each pair of droplets is connected by an electrolyte solution within the polydimethylsiloxane microchannel grid. It is demonstrated that the 2-LMD sensor is capable of detecting human motion and physiological signals, while the electrical impedance tomography-based 3.5 × 3.5 cm sensor can detect the shape and position of single-point, multipoint, and other complex contact using only eight evenly distributed electrodes along the sensor's edge. These findings highlight the promising potential of the sensors in future robotic and wearable electronic applications.},

This mechanism allows soft robots to perform rhythmic movements. A mathematical model is developed to describe the self-excited oscillations of the jet hose. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of various parameters on system oscillations. The system operates under pressures from 90 to 150 kPa. By adjusting the pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the oscillation frequency of the pressure can be tuned between 5.9 and 11.1 Hz. The comparison between simulation results and experimental data verifies the correctness of the mathematical model. Finally, a soft robot capable of crawling based on anisotropic friction is designed and fabricated. Powered solely by the soft pneumatic pressure regulation system, the robot achieves self-rhythmic crawling.

  abstract     = {6D object pose estimation, a critical component in computer vision and robotics domains, involves determining the 3D location and orientation of an object relative to a canonical reference frame. Recently, the widespread proliferation of RGB-D sensors has precipitated a marked increase in interest towards 6D pose estimation leveraging RGB-D data. A deep bidirectional fusion network is developed, DBF-Net, achieving efficient yet accurate 6D object pose estimation. Specifically, a sparse linear Transformer (SLT) with linear computation complexity is introduced to effectively leverage cross-modal semantic resemblance during the feature extraction stage, such that it fully models semantic associations between various modalities and efficiently aggregates the globally enhanced features of each modality. Once acquiring two feature representations from two modalities, a feature balancer (FB) based on SLT is proposed to adaptively reconcile the importance of these feature representations. Leveraging the global receptive field of SLT, FB effectively eliminates the ambiguity induced by visual similarity in appearance representation or depth missing of reflective surfaces in geometry representations, thereby enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that DBF-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art works by nontrivial margins across multiple benchmarks.

This framework enables seamless switching among guidance modes, such as waypoint following, path following, and trajectory tracking, to achieve optimal attitude control. For comprehensive control of roll, pitch, yaw, and longitudinal velocity, an augmented-twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (A-TD3) algorithm streamlines the training of the control agent. It enables adaptation to large-range attitude variations using small-scale training data, thereby reducing computational costs for diverse missions. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach: A-TD3 improves training speed by 30.8% while mitigating issues such as excessive rudder motion, poor operability, and high energy consumption across different missions. The attitude control experiments on the X-AUV prototype validate that A-TD3's control performance with PID method.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir computing (RC) provides a route to use physical systems for computation and machine learning. Owing to their inherent nonlinearity, nanomechanical systems constitute an interesting technology to serve as reservoir. While RC platforms are built using microelectromechanical systems, the energy efficiency, response time, and footprint of these systems can be significantly improved by using nanoscale devices. Herein, the use of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) is investigated, which can be used in RC, utilizing inherent nonlinearities and the fading memory effect from the transient response of NEMS. The smaller size and higher operating frequencies of NEMS enable faster processing rates compared to micromechanical systems, while their compact footprint, low power consumption, and ability to operate under ambient conditions simplify integration into practical applications. In modified national institute of standards and technology (MNIST) handwritten digit–recognition test, this system achieves 90% accuracy with a 3.3 μs processing time per pixel. Also the effect of driving frequency and amplitude on NEMS classification accuracy is investigated using experiments and simulations and it is shown that no significant dependency in any of the parameters is observed. Herein, an estimate for energy consumption of core NEMS RC system on MNIST data is provided. These results highlight the potential for various applications that require efficient and fast information processing in resource-constrained environments.},

  abstract     = {Energy efficiency is a critical concern in built environment. Identifying key features that drive energy consumption is essential for optimizing building performance. Traditionally, studies have focused on single-domain datasets. These approaches overlook the potential insights gained from integrating data across different domains. This research addresses this gap using a cross-domain dataset that includes building characteristics, energy usage, and environmental factors. Feature selection techniques, including filter methods (correlation, mutual information), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest, and gradient boosting), and dimensionality reduction are used to identify the most significant features contributing to the energy efficiency of residential properties. These techniques identify the most significant features influencing energy consumption. The findings show that cross-domain features like energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and heating cost play a key role in predicting energy performance. By integrating data from multiple domains, the feature selection process reveals areas for energy optimization that are previously overlooked in single-domain studies. The results provide valuable insights for energy consultants, building managers, and policymakers aiming to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings. This research highlights the importance of cross-domain data integration and offers a robust framework for feature selection.

By positioning a vibrating microrobot on tissue surfaces, the resonant frequencies of the resulting vibrations are analyzed to create detailed elasticity maps. These maps reveal tumor margins and provide critical information about the tumor's properties spatially. This approach leverages the high spatio-temporal resolution and noncontact nature of LSCI to offer a minimally invasive elastography method for potential use in colonoscopy, providing an alternative to complex and time-consuming biopsy analysis and advancing future cancer diagnostics.},

These accelerators require a large network of synaptic elements with high degree of plasticity, high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow programing energy. Although emerging nonvolatile memories exhibit promising potential as synaptic devices, their widespread application in training accelerators is limited due to their low endurance and immature fabrication technology. In contrast, capacitor-less 1 transistor-dynamic random-access memories (1T-DRAMs) have recently emerged as lucrative alternative to the conventional (1T/1C) DRAMs owing to their high scalability and low footprint. Considering the high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow write energy of the 1T-DRAMs, in this work, for the first time, their potential is explored as synaptic elements for online learning. The proposed 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element exhibits multi-level capability (up to 6 bits), a large dynamic range (3.91 × 10 3 ), an ultralow energy, and an appreciable linearity for potentiation/depression. The 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element also exhibits a paired pulse facilitation with an exponential decay similar to the biological synapses. Furthermore, a multilayer perceptron utilizing the proposed 1T-DRAM synapses achieves an accuracy of 87.10% on MNIST dataset.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks could compare the difference among all samples (nodes in graph) and transmit the interrelationship among them to obtain a global landscape. Compared with radiomics and clinical feature-based machine learning methods, whether a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) based on radiomics and clinical features improve the performance in distinguishing benign and malignant pulmonary nodules is not well studied. We propose an approach based on multimodal GCNNs that integrates patients’ lung computed tomography images with clinical information to differentiate between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Leveraging large-scale and multisource data from multiple hospitals (i.e., 6033/290/524 patients for three hospitals respectively) enhances the diversity of features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are used to evaluate the performance. We achieved the average accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/AUROC of 0.8612/0.9425/0.6786/0.9025 for the main dataset via the novel GCNN proposed, respectively, maintaining the robustness of the deep learning procedures. Especially for the external testing dataset (hospital 2/hospital 3), the specificity is much higher than comparison methods (0.6250–0.6731 vs. 0.2569–0.2788). The graph neural network-based deep learning method holds the potential to assist clinicians, aiding in treatment planning, patient management, follow-up strategies, resource optimization, and overall healthcare decision-making.},

  abstract     = {With increasing miniaturization of portable electronic devices, conventional positioning systems have become inefficient in terms of size and energy consumption. As workspaces shrink, the need for precise autonomous manipulation in confined and isolated environments increases, particularly in areas such as electronics and biological assemblies. Herein, an autonomous, untethered, holonomic, mobile micromanipulator driven by piezoelectric actuators with nanometer resolution is developed. The micromanipulator comprises a driving circuit, single-board computer, battery, manipulator, and small camera; it is lightweight (515 g), compact (90 × 116 × 104 mm), and untethered, capable of independently operating in confined and dangerous spaces for humans. The micromanipulator can autonomously position a single object with a positioning error of 0.18 ± 0.51 mm and an angular deviation of −0.4° ± 1.2°, utilizing image recognition, machine learning, and visual feedback. Moreover, the micromanipulator is verified to function in extreme conditions that simulate draft chambers and clean benches, where it successfully performs circuit mounting in confined space. The device can arrange droplets under microscopy for applications in chemical and biomedical fields, demonstrating its versatility and precise positioning capabilities. Additionally, its multi-scale applications are explored from centimeters to sub-micrometers and adjusted to the magnification capabilities of various microscopes.},

  abstract     = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is extensively applied to measure the nanomechanical properties of living cells. Despite its popularity, some applications on mechanobiology are limited by the low throughput of the technique. Currently, the analysis of AFM-nanoindentation data is performed by model fitting. Model fitting is slow, data intensive, and prone to error. Herein, a supervised machine-learning regressor is developed for transforming AFM force–distance curves into nanorheological behavior. The method reduces the computational time required to process a force volume of a cell made of 2.62 × 10 5 curves from several hours to minutes. In fact, the regressor increases the throughput by 50-fold. The training and the validation of the regressor are performed by using theoretical curves derived from a contact mechanics model that combined power–law rheology with bottom effect corrections and functional data analysis. The regressor predicts the modulus and the fluidity coefficient of mammalian cells with a relative error below 4%.},

  abstract     = {Medical ultrasound (US) has been widely used in clinical practices due to its merits of being low cost, real time, and radiation free. However, its capability to reveal the underlying tissue properties remains underexplored. A physics-constrained learning framework is studied to reversely approximate tissue property representations from multiple B-mode images acquired with varying dynamic ranges. First, an extractor network is used to generate property maps, that is, attenuation coefficient α , reflection coefficient β , border probability ρ b , scattering density ρ s , scattering amplitude ϕ , and one perturbation p map characterizing the variations caused by varying dynamic range. The α − ϕ maps are loosely regularized by rendering them forward to realistic US images using ray-tracing simulator. To further enforce the physics constraints, a ranking loss is introduced to align the disparity between two estimated p maps with the discrepancy between two distinct inputs. Due to the missing ground truth α − ϕ maps, alternatively, the method is validated by evaluating the consistency between the feature maps inferred from distinct images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly extract consistent intermediate maps from images. Furthermore, one potential downstream application is showcased to perform realistic US augmentation by introducing specific noise into the physics-inspired α − ϕ maps.},

The gripper consists of pneumatically driven hierarchical adhesive modules (bio-toe) with the capability of contact sensing, and rolling inward/outward module (rolling module). The bio-toe manufactured using soft materials can safely and flexibly cater to curved and flat surfaces. The rolling module developed using four-bar linkage mechanism allows the opposing bio-toes to roll inward to enhance adhesion (adhesion forces up to 6.3 N on a flat surface and 23 N on an 18 m −1 curved surface) and roll outward to decrease the force in releasing (less than 3 N and especially less than 0.8 N on the flat surface). Embedded resistive strain gauges provide real time signals for the controller to determine the status of the bio-toe, such as bending, adhesion/release, and even adhesive contact rates, thereby allowing the gripper to autonomously approach, envelop, adhere to, and release objects of various shapes, with the potential for dynamic adhesion control in the future. The adhesive gripper equipped with adhesive contact sensing and biomimetic inward adhesion/outward release capabilities exhibits a broader grasping range and applicability in smart adhesive grabbing across industrial, agricultural, and human–robot interaction contexts.},

  abstract     = {During endoscopic submucosal dissection, precise and intuitive sensing of target tissues enhances surgical accuracy. Augmented reality (AR) technology currently offers a solution to provide intuitive guidance. To enhance the AR user experience, an automated method for calibrating and dynamically registering deformable tissues is proposed. First, an automatic calibration method is proposed to help register the target tissue from the virtual to the real world. The calibration method is based on a 6D pose estimator, which is built on the feature-matching network, SuperGlue and the depth estimation network, Metric3D. Subsequently, a dynamic registration method is proposed to track the deformation of the target tissue in real-time. Moreover, a piece of cloth is utilized for four automatic calibration trials, resulting in a mean absolute error (MAE) of calibration accuracy at 3.79 ± 0.64 mm. The dynamic registration accuracy is also assessed by varying the deformation of the target, yielding an MAE of 6.03 ± 0.96 mm. Finally, an ex vivo experiment involving a piece of small intestine is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, with an MAE of 3.11 ± 0.56 mm for AR calibration and 3.20 ± 1.96 mm for dynamic registration error.},

To address these limitations, we propose MultiMedRes, a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework that simulates human physicians’ communication by incorporating a learner agent to proactively acquire information from domain-specific expert models. MultiMedRes addresses medical multimodal reasoning problems through three steps i) Inquire: The learner agent decomposes complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) Interact: The agent engages in iterative “ask-answer” interactions with expert models to obtain domain-specific knowledge; and iii) Integrate: The agent integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to address the medical reasoning problems (e.g., identifying the difference of disease levels and abnormality sizes between medical images). We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments show that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing fully supervised methods, which demonstrates that MultiMedRes could offer trustworthy and interpretable assistance to physicians in monitoring the treatment progression of patients, paving the way for effective human–AI interaction and collaboration.},

Vine robots, a type of continuum robot, offer a promising solution with their unique ability to evert, allowing them to navigate complex environments while reducing friction. This article presents a novel vine robot design powered by magnetic fluid. The fluid drives both vine growth through pressurization and enables precise steering and manipulation using external magnetic fields. Unlike previous designs, the robot's high magnetic volume ensures precise control even under pressure, while maintaining a fully soft structure. This allows for controlled needle movements during biopsies. Additionally, the robot achieves passive stabilization by pressing against surrounding walls. This stabilization, combined with magnetic forces, can exert up to 1.26 N of insertion force at the tip, enabling effective tissue penetration. Experiments are conducted with a 5 mm diameter, 145 mm long magnetic fluid-driven vine robot, demonstrating movement in free space, through narrow constrictions, and within phantoms modeled after human bronchial anatomy. These results pave the way for the robot's potential application in minimally invasive surgeries, particularly in difficult-to-access areas of the body.},

In this study, we used simplified heat transfer models based on the finite element method (FEM) to generate realistic simulation data. We developed a novel management system that integrates two trained artificial neural networks with deep and wide networks using hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction speed, a known limitation of FEM. The system predicts temperature variations at multiple points on the coil, enabling strategic placement that minimizes temperature deviations and enhances cooling uniformity. This real-time computational approach eliminates the necessity for additional cooling equipment and ensures high product quality. The system's efficacy was validated through case studies, revealing dynamic adjustments and optimized placements. The proposed system achieved a mean absolute error of 3.44 and a mean absolute percentage error of 0.24%, outperforming conventional regression techniques. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in simulating real-world cooling scenarios and its feasibility for real-time cooling optimization in steel manufacturing.},

However, in most cases, human intervention remains essential for the healing process.

To address this gap, in this article, first, the different phases of the healing process in soft robotics are discussed and then the technologies that are or can be integrated into self-healing soft robots to allow each individual phase to be performed autonomously with minimal human involvement are reviewed. Finally, in this article, the challenges of integrating all phases into self-healing soft robots are discussed and the perspectives on achieving fully autonomous self-healing in the future are offered. These phases are classified into five: damage detection, damage cleaning, damage closure, stimulus-triggered material healing, and recovery assessment. Achieving these attributes requires employing physical intelligence at the material level through the use of stimuli-responsive materials or utilizing embodied intelligence at the system level by integrating healing-assistive subsystems or a synergistic combination of both. Consequently, self-healing soft robots can achieve self-sufficiency in their healing capabilities, rendering them a sustainable solution for broader applications.},

Amphibious robots address this need by operating in both aquatic and terrestrial settings, leveraging biomimetic designs and integrated mechanical propulsion systems. While these robots has traditionally drawn inspiration from reptiles, crustaceans, and amphibians, there has been comparatively less exploration of swimming-capable mammals and birds as biological models. In this work, DuckyDog, a quadruped amphibious robot using erect posture has been proposed and developed to take full advantage of the high mobility of mammals on land. By integrating a duck-like body and passive fins, it also has excellent swimming ability on the water surface. Whereas many robots rely on soft materials to construct compliant legs, DuckyDog is distinguished by its fused deposition modeling-printed legs made from polylactic acid (PLA) filament, featuring structurally induced variable stiffness and actuated through a tendon-driven mechanism. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate DuckyDog's terrestrial and aquatic locomotion performance in both laboratory settings and complex natural environments, where it achieves maximum speeds of 0.40 body lengths per second on land and 0.30 in water.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven robotic system utilizing a 3D-printed electrophysiological (EP) sensor for noninvasive, real-time monitoring of plant health signals across different irrigation levels, highlighting the crucial role of these technologies in enhancing smart agriculture and sustainability. The sensing system consists of a mobile robot with a 3D EP sensor and portable Faraday cage for data acquisition, using an AI-powered convolution neural network to analyze EP data in greenhouses and categorize irrigation levels to optimize water usage for scalable agricultural management. The findings reveal that the 3D EP sensor displays lower and more stable contact resistance (2.10 ± 0.52 MΩ) compared to flat thin-film sensors (2.96 ± 1.45 MΩ), ensuring high electrical reliability due to effective contact with hairy tomato leaves. The 3D EP sensor's high sensitivity (signal resolution of 0.0122 mV) detects subtle EP signal changes linked to irrigation levels, aiding water optimization and crop yield enhancement. For the first time, this study employs scalogram images for detailed analysis of plant EP signals, achieving a classification accuracy of 86.91%, comparable to red, gren, and blue image-based methods (86.37%). This system is a reliable tool for long-term monitoring in smart farming and provides insights into plant signal dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Perching significantly enhances the energy efficiency and operational versatility of aerial robots. This article introduces a passive and tunable perching mechanism designed for smooth surfaces. The design features a bistable mechanism (BM) with a soft suction cup, augmented by two sets of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators for active tuning. The BM enables rapid attachment upon surface contact. A set of SMA wires can increase the BM's triggering force to handle high contact speeds, while a set of SMA springs attached to the suction cup's edges can pull the cup to handle orientation misalignment. Experiments are conducted to characterize how the SMA actuators influence the BM's triggering force and the suction cup's displacement under continuous steady-state low-voltage heating. Additional experiments demonstrate fast tuning using momentary high-voltage heating of the SMA actuators to enhance energy efficiency. The mechanism enables successful perching on smooth surfaces and adapt to varying contact speeds and misalignments when properly tuned for three scenarios: pendulum-based perching, ground perching, and ceiling perching. With its tuning capability, the perching mechanism can alleviate the need for precise motion control for an aerial robot during perching, expanding the applications of aerial robots in areas like environmental monitoring or infrastructure inspection.},

It is becoming a major function in soft robotics; however, its application to support heavyweight is relatively niche. Although previous studies has developed several self-healing tensile modules for tendon-driven robots, these modules suffered from deficient healing strength because of the formation of surface oxides. This study proposes a biomimetic approach to enhance self-healing performance. This approach exploits the motion of the robot to trigger the sloshing of liquid metal, which decomposes surface oxide. The method is validated using a benchtop module test, resulting in a healed strength of over tens of kilograms. Moreover, the module enables the tendon-driven monopod testbed to perform a squat motion 13 times after a landing impact fracture and self-healing sequence. The self-healing module does not break during or after the squatting motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of active self-healing behavior using a life-sized legged robot. Thus, this study provides a novel approach in the field of self-healing robotics for improving self-healing, thus contributing to medical robot and mechatronic designs, including rehabilitation, surgical, and diagnostic robots.},

This article introduces a soft robotic diaphragm-assist device designed as a therapeutic treatment for diaphragm dysfunction, moreover a clinically relevant respiratory simulator is designed and proposed as a validation and testing tool for this treatment. The device uses fabric-based pneumatic actuators to provide targeted mechanical assistance during inhalation. A two-step control system is implemented to optimize synchronization and support: 1) detecting breath intention from the pleural pressure signal to trigger the device and 2) regulating the device's input pressure to assist in inhalation. Using the respiratory simulator, the device demonstrated the ability to restore pleural and abdominal pressures and significantly increased transdiaphragmatic pressure during simulated conditions of diaphragm dysfunction. This research advances the field of soft robotics in respiratory care, providing a foundational platform for the development of next-generation therapeutic devices aimed at improving the quality of life for patients with diaphragm dysfunction.},

The plasticity of the artificial synapse can be further modulated by a heterosynapse with an external bias caused by electric field-driven oxygen migration.

It uses the flexible multi-segment appendages to generate asymmetric force during the power stroke and recovery stroke for swimming. Meanwhile, the middle appendages are considered to help regulate stability. Inspired by this, a comprehensive study on a diving-beetle-like swimming robot is presented. The design of the robot is first demonstrated. Soft rubber is used as a passive flexible joint for the multi-flexible appendage, and the swimming gaits are mimicked. Next, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed appendage design, its dynamic model is established and the effects of overly high and overly low stiffness on net thrust generation are compared. Finally, extensive thrust and swimming tests are conducted. The experimental results show that by mimicking the diving beetle's appendage structure and swimming gaits, the proposed robot can effectively perform forward swimming and turning maneuvers. Furthermore, comparing only the hind appendage, the experimental results reveal that coordinating the hind appendage and the middle appendage gives the robot a faster turning speed. Additionally, utilizing the enhanced maneuverability, a proportional-derivative controller is employed to control the robot's yaw stability, and the experimental results demonstrate that the robot has good robustness and disturbance resistance.},

This article proposes an innovative shared control method based on multiobjective motion fusion (MoMF) by integrating multiple objective controllers into master–slave control mode. In addition, a state feedback mechanism with prediction and evaluation model is developed to balance the control inputs of different control objectives. Further, an objective priority partition function is designed to overcome the conflicts between control objectives. In the proposed method, objective controllers can be added or removed as needed. The theoretical stability of the proposed MoMF method is proved. As an example, a fusion controller that considers four control objectives of a surgical cutting operation is designed to demonstrate the practicability of this method. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MoMF method are validated by simulations and prosthesis experiments.},

Humans display a range of remarkable haptic skills, enabled by the synergistic interactions of the somatosensory system with higher-level cognitive processes. In contrast, robotics’ haptic sensing solutions have historically lacked the ability to achieve human-level perceptive capabilities, lacking in both the sensory system and its cognitive digital counterpart. Herein, part of this challenge is addressed by leveraging the success of the fields of soft robotics and deep learning to show how a soft robotic hand, equipped with low-resolution tactile sensing, can be used to accurately identify a diverse set of objects. In particular, ROSE-Net, a neural network that leverages multiple grasps to enable accurate pose-invariant object recognition, is developed. The multi-grasp haptic discrimination solution can lead to a significant increase in performance. The versatility and adaptability of this approach are also tested in two scenarios: a learning transfer scenario and a fault tolerance scenario. Finally, the framework is tested in an online discrimination task, where this approach is shown to naturally require additional grasps for objects that are more challenging to identify using a single grasp and low spatial resolution tactile sensing.},

However, in mixed traffic scenarios where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), the unpredictable behavior of HDVs poses challenges to safety and coordination. While many cooperative merging strategies focus on individual CAV control, fewer have addressed the coordination of multiple CAVs in such settings. This study introduces an optimization-based cooperative merging strategy for all CAVs within a control zone, considering interactions with HDVs of uncertain intentions. A key innovation is the strategic influence of CAVs on HDV behavior by slowing down the CAV preceding HDVs, thereby allowing other CAVs on the adjacent road to merge in front of the HDVs with reduced uncertainty. The optimal slowdown pattern is identified by evaluating CAV throughput across various candidate patterns, with dynamic optimization applied at each time a new vehicle enters the control zone to effectively manage HDV uncertainties. Experimental results from various mixed-traffic scenarios show that the proposed strategy reduces the average travel time delay by up to 31% compared to an existing optimization-based approach.},

They capture images in digital cameras, record the swipes of the fingers on the screens of the phones and tablets, or map pressure distribution over an area. Soft capacitive sensor arrays have been proposed to make electronic pressure-sensing skins capable of identifying the location and intensity of touch. However, large arrays of those sensors remain challenging to produce, as they require high-resolution patterning of electrodes and routing of long and thin electrical connections. These two tasks remain difficult or costly for the high-resistivity compliant electrodes of soft and stretchy capacitive sensors. Instead of relying on the complex patterning of arrays to provide location resolution, a plain, unstructured sensor with a single pair of electrodes is used and relied on computation to infer pressure location and amplitude from multifrequency sensing signals. Herein, a machine learning–based approach, which enables us to identify pressure location on a continuous 1D sensor split into 5 sensing zones with an accuracy greater than 97%, is proposed. A regression algorithm calculates the force amplitude with a mean absolute error of 5.2%.},

The BP network is pretrained offline based on the data collected in free spaces, while the RBF network could be updated online by the least squares method with the historical data in unstructured working spaces to avoid the local optimum problem. Furthermore, a modified loss function consisting of three terms is proposed for the RBF network to improve the estimated distal trajectories’ accuracy, smoothness, and stability in complex unstructured environments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed OCO estimation algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy, with an average relative estimation error of 1.36% in two types of unstructured environments with visual occlusion. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is improved by more than 30% in the trajectory estimation of two consecutive loops, demonstrating its outstanding online learning ability.

To solve the complete coverage cleaning path planning problem, a full coverage cleaning approach is proposed by integrating a deep Q-network (DQN)-based method with the BWCRS. The proposed method enhances the cleaning process by optimizing the robot's travel path using DQN, ensuring stable navigation on walls with obstacles through advanced biped loco-manipulation. The effectiveness of the reported approach is validated through extensive simulations and experimental investigations. Comparative studies reveal that the presented method outperforms the existing method. The results demonstrate the BWCRS's capability to efficiently and safely clean exoskeleton-structure windows.

The learning-from-mistakes algorithm, inspired by the brain's simple learning rules of inhibition and pruning, is one of the few brain-like training methods. This algorithm is implemented in neuromorphic memristive hardware through a codesign process that evaluates essential hardware trade-offs. While the algorithm effectively trains small networks as binary classifiers and perceptrons, performance declines significantly with increasing network size unless the hardware is tailored to the algorithm. This work investigates the trade-offs between depth, controllability, and capacity—the number of learnable patterns—in neuromorphic hardware. This highlights the importance of topology and governing equations, providing theoretical tools to evaluate a device's computational capacity based on its measurements and circuit structure. The findings show that breaking neural network symmetry enhances both controllability and capacity. Additionally, by pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all-memristive circuits can utilize stochastic resources to create local contrasts in network weights. Through combined experimental and simulation efforts, the parameters are identified that enable networks to exhibit emergent intelligence from simple rules, advancing the potential of neuromorphic computing.},

In-air actuating trilayer tape yarn consisting of poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrenesulfonate layers and an ionogel are developed. The former acts as polymeric electroactive electrodes and the latter as a solid-state electrolyte, providing ions for the actuation. Weaving is used for creating bending fabrics, possible to post-process like any fabric. By weaving, actuator tape yarns are assembled in parallel to upscale the total output force, or alternated with non-actuating yarns to make passive and active areas. The weaving method also allows for additional yarn functionalities to be incorporated, e.g., to make conductive pathways, enabling multi-actuation areas, and individual electrical control. Additionally, tape yarns are arranged to create textile structures with both actuation and sensing.

However, recently developed wearable strain sensors exhibit several limitations. For example, when a sensor is designed with high sensitivity to detect strain, it struggles to accurately measuring the deformation of low-stiffness materials like skin. Additionally, finding the optimal balance between sensitivity, durability, hysteresis, and strain range in sensor design is challenging. To address these challenges, a Buckled, Ultrasoft, Crack-based, Large strain, EpiDermal (BUCKLED) sensor is developed. This sensor integrates the benefits of soft structure engineering with high sensitivity of crack-based sensing mechanisms to ensure optimal skin deformation measurements. The BUCKLED sensor exhibits significant improvements in compliance (18 500 mm N −1 ), stretchability (100%), hysteresis (2%), durability (10 000 cycles with 100% strain), and force sensitivity ( ) owing to its buckled shape, confirming its ability to detect subtle movements with enhanced accuracy. The sensor's high compliance allows it to accurately measure low-stiffness objects, ensuring reliable performance. Furthermore, the sensor's tunability is demonstrating its effectiveness in applications such as respiratory monitoring, facial expression recognition, and silent speech interfaces. Consequently, the proposed sensor is versatile and holds great potential for a wide range of sensing applications.},

Despite being underactuated, with lateral motion not directly controlled, this design reduces complexity and energy consumption. The coupling of rotors reduces angular momentum issues, enhancing stability and efficiency without the challenges associated with tilting each motor individually, which would require higher servo torque due to significant gyroscopic torques. PairTilt's tiltable rotors enable agile maneuvers in confined spaces and reduce drag in high-speed flight, extending operational range. The system's dynamics are analyzed, and a cascaded controller is implemented to ensure stable flight across various scenarios. Simulations and real-world tests validate its superior agility, compact hovering, sensor pointing, and energy efficiency compared to conventional quadcopters. The primary contribution of this work lies in PairTilt's distinctive design, which achieves a unique balance of simplicity, efficiency, and agility. This balance is made possible by the pairwise rotor coupling, which reduces complexity and gyroscopic torque effects, and the prioritization of key degrees of freedom. This design approach opens new possibilities for aerial robotics applications requiring both maneuverability and efficient high-speed flight.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel compliant and morphologically aware aerial robot called Morphy. The system is small (primary dimension 25.2 cm), lightweight (260 g), and agile (thrust-to-weight ratio of 3.3) while simultaneously integrating sensorized flexible joints in its arms. These elastic joints unlock the potential of experiencing flexible deformations, thus enabling the robot to resiliently withstand collisions at high speeds and squeeze through openings more narrow than its nominal dimensions. Extensive analysis of the flexible joints’ behavior under static loads and in free flight is conducted. Driven by the deformations that the robot can experience, adaptive control allocation exploiting real-time angle deflection feedback from Hall-effect sensors embedded in the joints is proposed and combined with fixed-gain control. To demonstrate Morphy's performance, multiple experiments are conducted, including free flight trajectory tracking, impacts with the environment, and flying through narrow passages. As shown, the system can withstand collisions up to 7.6 m s −1 in drop tests and 3 m s −1 midflight while recovering back to hover. Finally, Morphy's capability to passively change its shape and squeeze through openings smaller than its nominal size is showcased both in the horizontal and in the vertical directions.},

Could larger ornithopters be improved further to hover longer? This paper reviews and examines the drive and power of hovering ornithopters, and elastic means of energy or thrust boosters. While the rotation of flexible wings enhance the thrust generation, two-winged ornithopters did not scale up well because of higher disk loading. In comparison, the X-winged or multiple-V-winged ornithopters enjoy a lower disk loading by beating multiple wings slower, at a smaller stroke angle or a longer span. Further, the clap-and-fling interaction of V and X-wings boosts the thrust generation. Future works can explore the wing flexibility and morphology change to improve the hoverability and flight agility of ornithopters.},

  abstract     = {Flying animals such as insects and birds have strain receptors on their wings. The functions and information processing capabilities of these strain receptors, however, are largely unknown. Herein, the potential ability of wing strain sensors to detect wind direction in flapping flight is experimentally explored. Seven strain gauges are attached to the biomimetic wing shafts of flexible wings. The wings flap through an electric mechanism emulating hovering flight in a wind tunnel with gentle wind, and a convolutional neural network model for wind direction classification is developed. The results show that with only one strain gauge, accurate wind classification is achieved using segmented data of ≈1 flapping cycle. Even with segmented data of only 0.2 flapping cycles, wind classification can be achieved with all seven strain gauges. Moreover, the use of wing shafts improves the classification accuracy, especially with shorter segmented data. Additional flapping phase information does not substantially improve classification performance. These results suggest that hovering animals determine the wind direction via strain sensing, which is useful for flight control. The implementation of wing strain sensors in flapping-wing aerial robots may improve flight control ability.},

In this article, a bimodal reconfigurable robot capable of operating in both regular quadcopter flight mode and a unique revolving flight mode is presented, which allows independent control of the vehicle's position and roll-pitch attitude. This design incorporates passive revolute joints that enable seamless mid-air transitions between the two modes, facilitated by centrifugal forces, without the need for additional actuators. In the regular mode, the robot operates with four vertical propellers, similar to conventional designs. In the revolving mode, the configuration shifts to two horizontal and two vertical propellers, achieving five degrees of freedom control with four actuators. This underactuated flight capability is made possible by exploiting the robot's fast revolving motion and the resulting cycle-averaged forces and torques. Experimental validations confirm the feasibility and enhance the maneuverability of this design. The revolving flight mode provides significant advantages in applications such as mapping and confined space navigation.},

  abstract     = {Adding compliance (softness) has been introduced as an effective way to improve the physical collision resilience characteristics of multirotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). This article answers the question “Where is the best place to apply compliance in a multirotor MAV to make it more collision-resilient?” by analyzing the output data of more than 1200 drone collision tests through two sets of accelerated and nonaccelerated collision experiments for four main configurations of micro-quadcopters each possessing a unique softness layout of physical frame. It is shown that while applying compliance to the protective propeller guards (bumpers) of a micro-quadcopter provides a more elastic collision, it does not improve its energy-dissipation (impact damping) characteristics. On the other hand, enhancing the inner frame of the micro-quadcopter with a softer structure results in higher rates of impact energy damping during the collisions and an increase in the impact time, which results in lower impact accelerations the MAV experiences during the crush. A mathematical model is developed representing the contact/collision interactions as nonlinear viscoelastic forces. Comparing the results of the simulations to the experiments suggests that this model can effectively mimic the impact behavior of contacting/colliding MAVs with different structural stiffness and damping.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive-morphology multirotors exhibit superior versatility and task-specific performance compared to traditional multirotors owing to their functional morphological adaptability. However, a notable challenge lies in the contrasting requirements of locking each morphology for flight controllability and efficiency while permitting low-energy reconfiguration. A novel design approach is proposed for reconfigurable multirotors utilizing soft multistable composite laminate airframes. These airframes show kinematically determinate morphologies corresponding to multiple minima in their elastic potential energy landscape. By varying design parameters, the methodology allows for tuning the energy landscape characteristics governing each morphology's structural stability and reconfiguration energetics. The airframe, composed of multistable composite laminate grids, is optimized to maximize rigidity under flight loads and minimize reconfiguration work. The 130-g reconfigurable multirotor design demonstrates self-locking properties in an open and a folded configuration, enabling a 48% reduction in width-span without compromising stability during flight. Soft pneumatic actuators, actuated using a tethered compressed air supply, enable reversible reconfiguration on the ground between open and folded configurations. The design resolves the conflicting requirements of high-stiffness to lock each flight configuration and low-actuation work for reconfigurability. By exploiting soft yet multistable structures, the approach combines the stability observed in rigid-linked reconfigurable multirotors with the low-effort reconfigurability of soft multirotors, offering new methods for designing adaptive-morphology multirotors.},

Organisms are able to navigate such unstructured environments with the ability to rapidly change shape, move swiftly in multiple locomotion modes, and do this efficiently and reversibly without external power sources, feats which are difficult for robots. Herein, a bio-inspired latch-mediated, spring-actuated (LaMSA) morphing mechanism is harnessed to near-instantaneously and reversibly reconfigure a multifunctional robot to achieve driving and flying configurations. This shape change coupled with a combined propeller/wheel leverages the same motors and electronics for both flying and driving, providing efficiency of morphing and locomotion for completely untethered operation. The adaptive robotic vehicle can move through confined spaces and rough terrain which are difficult to pass by driving or flying alone, and expands the potential range through power savings in the driving mode. This work provides a powerful scheme for LaMSA in robots, in which controlled, small-scale LaMSA systems can be integrated as individual components to robots of all sizes to enable new functionalities and enhance performance.},

Inspired by the mechanoreceptors of the remora ( Echeneis naucrates ) disc, the robot's hitchhiking device is equipped with two flexible bioinspired tactile sensors (FBTS) based on a triboelectric nanogenerator for tactile sensing of attachment status. Based on tactile sensing, the robot can perform reattachment after leakage or adhesion failure, enabling it to achieve long-term adhesion on complex surfaces. The rotor-based aerial–aquatic robot, which has two thrust vectoring units for underwater locomotion, can maneuver to pitch, yaw, and roll 360° and control precision motion position. The field tests show that the robot can continuously cross the air–water boundary, attach to the rough stone surface, and record video in both air and underwater.

However, highly adaptive, automated spatiotemporal optical control over these materials has not yet been realized. Herein, a system for an azobenzene liquid crystal elastomer soft robotic arm is created by dynamically patterning light for independently maneuverable joints. The nonlinear material response to optical actuation is characterized, and the broad actuation space is explored with diverse arm configurations. A neural network is trained on the arm configurations and corresponding laser pattern to automate the pattern generation for a desired configuration.

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis and prognostication of a central nervous system (CNS) infection is essential. This study aims to use immune-cell morphology to develop a deep-learning model for this purpose. Overall, 1427 3D images of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune cells from 14 patients with CNS infections are obtained using holotomography. The images are categorized into infection etiology groups (viral and non-viral) and prognosis groups (based on the modified Rankin Scale score at discharge). A deep-learning model is constructed to predict the etiology and prognosis of CNS infections using the immune-cell morphology. Cell morphological features and spatial distribution of CSF immune cells differ significantly between patients in the viral and nonviral groups and between prognosis groups. The model yields areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 and 0.79 for the diagnosis and prognosis, respectively. As more cell images are used, the prediction and model robustness improve. With <10 cells, both tasks exhibit a nearly 100% predictive performance. After dividing the cells into eight shells, significant refractive index variations are observed. This is the first study to use CSF cell morphology for the diagnosis and prognostication of CSF infections. These findings can help improve patient outcomes.},

Of many employable different actuation strategies, pneumatically driven soft robotics have gained attraction owing to their relative straightforward manufacturing and capability to produce significant force to their environment upon interaction. To enable more autonomous pneumatic systems, however, there is an emerging need for developing smarter fluidic elements responding to environmental cues, to provide embodied control and regulation. Herein, a liquid crystal network (LCN)-based fluid regulator is designed to impart stimuli responsiveness and regulation into fluidic circuits by combining radially aligned nematic and nonaligned isotropic LCNs. Assisted by a finite element method, the thermoresponsiveness of the LCN is discussed. Finally, the regulating behavior of the responsive pneumatic regulator is demonstrated, which alters its fluidic resistance with changing temperature. This work emphasizes the potential of advancing responsive soft robotics that can interact with their environment through multiphysical stimuli.},

Herein, the development of an electronic skin (e-skin) that integrates multifunctional tactile sensing capabilities, including dynamic pressure sensing and continuous sliding touch detection, along with human–robot interface is reported. To address the limitations of early works on multifunctionality in strain sensors based on resistive values, the innovative scheme harnesses the synergy of facile e-skin fabrication and advanced decoding algorithms, creating a robust stimuli-responsive platform. At the core of the system lies a straightforward integration of e-skin, achieved by generating laser-induced graphene on a liquid-crystal polymer film, followed by embedding the transfer-printed conductive graphene layer into an elastomeric substrate. This streamlined methodology optimizes existing sensor arrays without the need for intricate material combinations or interconnections, avoiding susceptibility to damage. The advanced decoding algorithms bypass geometric engineering and complex numerical calculations within the deep learning hyper-redundant system. In the experimental results, it is demonstrated that the e-skin system successfully achieves a Braille-readable e-skin and a surgery-enabled human–robot interface, highlighting the scalability and adaptability of the e-skin in coordination with decoding algorithm systems.},

However, the applicability of FL systems is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data, client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training process. A comprehensive overview of the several notions, theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments are delineated. Furthermore, the salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness quantitatively are examined. Finally, exciting open research directions that have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this pivotal area are envisaged.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven deep learning is effective in diagnosing known faults, but not so well when new or unknown faults occur. With unknown faults as a zero-shot learning problem, this article proposes a method for detecting and isolating unknown faults based on knowledge distillation within a teacher–student framework. Process data and image data are equivalent in their spatiotemporal dimensions, and convolutional neural networks are selected as the teacher model, pretrained on image data. Information under both normal and fault conditions is then effectively extracted from process data by the well-trained teacher model. Subsequently, knowledge distillation is used to transfer only the data of normal conditions in the teacher model to the student model. When an unknown fault arises, there exist differences between the information extracted by the teacher model and the student model. Contributions of variables to faults are calculated by quantifying these differences through gradients, thereby isolating the unknown fault. Finally, compared with a series of baseline methods and two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method improves fault diagnosis accuracy by 3.08% to 26.13% in the Tennessee Eastman process and by 3.48% to 41.45% in the sour water treatment process. Additionally, the physical consistency of fault isolation is visually assessed.},

In this approach, iPRISM incorporates gene expression, biological functional network, tumor microenvironment characteristics, immune-related pathways, and clinical data to provide a comprehensive view of factors influencing immunotherapy efficacy. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified key predictive features and validated iPRISM across multiple cohorts including melanoma, bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and stomach adenocarcinoma. We also find that iPRISM outperforms the existing methods, achieving high predictive accuracy and demonstrating significant prognostic value for overall and progression-free survival. By identifying key genetic and immunological factors, this model provides a new insight for more personalized treatment strategies and combination therapies to overcome resistance mechanisms. iPRISM can be accessed at CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=iPRISM .},

However, its low open-loop locomotion control precision makes it difficult to perform tasks requiring precise control, while the number of sensors that can be carried is limited due to their low load capacity, which significantly limits its application scenarios. To this end, an exoskeleton is proposed herein, which significantly improves the locomotion control accuracy and load capacity of cyborg insects. The exoskeleton, with a peripheral size of 7.2 cm × 14 cm, employs three wheels to carry the load and control the direction of motion of the cyborg insect. The exoskeleton-integrated cyborg insect excels in locomotion control precision. Without feedback control, it completes continuous circular and linear motions with minor offset errors. Compared to other cyborg insects, its load capacity is increased from less than 20–400 g or more, allowing it to be equipped with large, energy-intensive sensors. In addition, the exoskeleton supports switching between high-precision controlled motion and insect-driven active exploration modes. This design broadens the application scenarios of the cyborg insect and opens the possibility of performing more complex tasks.},

Over years of development, many microrobot fabrication methods have been developed; however, they typically require costly specialized physical vapor deposition (PVD) vacuum instrumentation and present homogeneity and conformality coating problems (especially in complex 3D structures). Herein, a solution-based polydopamine (PDA)-assisted electroless deposition method is developed to deposit a superparamagnetic nickel thin film on microrobots. The multilayered functional film design comprises PDA as an adhesive primer and reducing agent, silver nanoclusters as catalysts, and a nickel magnetic top film, all deposited in a batch solution-based process on glass and 3D-printed polymer substrates. This multilayer magnetic coating is implemented and demonstrated in three magnetic microrobot archetypes, including arbitrarily-shaped active particles, microrollers, and helical swimming microrobots, each using distinct actuation working mechanisms. Due to the material-independent interfacial adhesive properties of PDA, this multilayer functionalization strategy can open up new magnetic microrobot fabrication schemes with a broad compatibility with materials and structures (including complex 3D-printed polymer microstructures) and without the need for and limitations of PVD coating approaches.},

  abstract     = {A manual handling task is one of the most common causes of back injuries, accounting for nearly 31.9% of the total work-related injuries. To promote a safe working environment for workers, wearable robots (wearables) are rapidly emerging to fulfill various needs in human-robot interactive tasks. Although numerous studies have successfully developed wearables to assist humans, they are often limited to supporting a single degree of freedom (DoF) of the human body with a single actuator. However, as humans tend to use multiple parts of their bodies, additional actuators and mechanisms to transmit force/motion are necessary to realize multi-DoF, which increases the volume, price, and complexity of the wearables. To address these issues, a multi-DoF wearable robot (WeaRo) with an adjustable twisted string actuator (ATSA) and a two-stage transmission mechanism (2TM) is proposed. By introducing the novel ATSA and 2TM, the proposed WeaRo achieves multi-DoF (lumbar and arm) with only a single electric motor and ATSA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WeaRo effectively reduces the maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) of lumbar, biceps, and triceps muscles by a maximum of 18.2, 29.1, and 27.0%, respectively without constraining users’ movements. Additionally, the fabric-based design ensures a lightweight solution weighing 5.2 kg including batteries.},

The former lacks embodiment, inhibiting direct interactions with the physical world. The latter is restricted by a complex translation of abstract functions to the physical domain, e.g., negative feedback, if-then behavior, etc. Here, self-oscillators, a rudimentary type of central pattern generators, that find ground in both the pneumatic and electrical domains are demonstrated. First, the hysteretic behavior of previously developed conical membranes is analyzed in deformation space. This state-space behavior is then transformed to the electrical domain by means of a stretchable strain sensor. Next, an analog comparator distinguishes between the two states and instructs a pneumatic solenoid valve to counteract the current state. As a result, a stable oscillation emerges, with a frequency that is dominated by the physical characteristic of the pneumatic circuit. As such, the proposed electropneumatic oscillator provides a promising platform for building complex CPGs that control interactive neuromorphic robots.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are inspired by the brain, are a central pillar in the ongoing breakthrough in artificial intelligence. In recent years, researchers have examined mechanical implementations of ANNs, denoted as physical neural networks (PNNs). PNNs offer the opportunity to view common materials and physical phenomena as networks, and to associate computational power with them. In this work, mechanical bistability is incorporated into PNNs, enabling memory and a direct link between computation and physical action. To achieve this, an interconnected network of bistable liquid-filled chambers is considered. All possible equilibrium configurations or steady-states are first mapped, and then their stability is examined. Building on these maps, both global and local algorithms for training multistable PNNs are implemented. These algorithms enable to systematically examine the network's capability to achieve stable output states and thus the network's ability to perform computational tasks. By incorporating PNNs and multistability, it is possible to design structures that mechanically perform tasks typically associated with electronic neural networks, while directly obtaining physical actuation. The insights gained from this study pave the way for the implementation of intelligent structures in smart tech, metamaterials, medical devices, soft robotics, and other fields.},

Existing research has mostly focused on optimizing individual techniques, lacking comprehensive solutions that integrate the strengths of different methods. This article proposes a hybrid digital watermarking algorithm for medical images based on frequency domain transformation and deep learning convolutional neural networks. The algorithm combines the advantages of traditional frequency domain watermarking methods and deep learning techniques. Specifically, the algorithm first extracts feature vectors from medical images using discrete wavelet transform and discrete cosine transform, enhancing the robustness of the image watermark. It then integrates an improved Inception v3 network, optimizing the convolutional kernel design, thereby effectively enhancing the robustness of the watermarking process. To further improve the security of the watermark, the Logistic Map is used to scramble and encrypt the watermark information, and a hash function and XOR operation are employed for zero embedding of the watermark. The watermark extraction and decryption process relies on a key provided by a third party, enabling blind extraction of the watermark without requiring the original image. Through extensive experimental data analysis and comparisons with multiple existing algorithms, the results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid watermarking algorithm excels in terms of attack resistance and robustness, significantly improving the security and reliability of medical image watermarking.},

This work introduces a responsive joint attention system integrated into the social robot Mini. The system calculates the position of the user's head, body, and face orientations in real-time. With this information, the robot can perform natural movements based on the user's gaze and pointing directions. Moreover, the robot employs verbal expressions to alert the user when distractions are detected, enhancing the perception of the robot's responsiveness. This study also explores differences in user perception of the robot when the joint attention system is active. A user experiment involving an interactive gaming scenario is proposed.

Furthermore, π-PhenoDrug identifies drugs with potential killing effects on melanoma cells from a library of diverse compounds.

This simplification can lead to inaccuracies in the robot's understanding of human intent due to deviations in object dynamics. This article presents a method that eliminates the need for a force sensor on the human side during human–robot collaboration. Using an extended Kalman filter, the method estimates object parameters online and applies a disturbance observer to determine human force. This approach reduces human effort and improves tracking performance compared to traditional methods. It also avoids the hassle of installing and removing sensors in complex scenarios.

This work addresses rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and nonunique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and noninterpretable deep-learning-based methods, this work proposes the random-forest-based interpretable generative inverse design (RIGID), a single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterials with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest-based “design → response” forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex “response → design” inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. RIGID is validated on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.},

  abstract     = {Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a critical procedure in anesthesia and emergency medicine, which requires professional personnel for operations and has a high risk of occupational exposure. Herein, a special robotic stylet is developed based on a multisegment continuum mechanism for specialized assisting ETI, which needs to be inserted into the endotracheal tube and bends the tube to accommodate the airway lumen during insertion. Geometric parameters of the ETI route are measured, and design requirements of the robot are clarified based on medical images. Kinematic models which reflect the motion coupling of multisegment bending are derived. A prototype is designed and fabricated. Five bending phases of three segments are designed for kinematic validation, and results illustrate that the kinematic models present the same features with actual motions of the robotic stylet captured by optical tracking system. An airway model is built based on medical images and a simulated ETI experiment is conducted. Accomplishing this experiment, the design concept of the robotic stylet is approved, which is bending the tube by the multisegment continuum mechanism for guiding the ETI procedure. This study significantly contributes to specialized robot-aided ETI system, which can strengthen accurate, timely, and safe ETI in anesthesia and emergency treatment.},

  abstract     = {Analog in-memory computing, leveraging resistive switching cross-point devices known as resistive processing units (RPUs), offers substantial improvements in the performance and energy efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) training. Among the promising candidates for RPU devices, the capacitor-based synaptic circuit stands out due to its near-ideal switching characteristics. However, despite its potential, challenges such as large cell areas and retention issues remain to be addressed. In this work, we study the three-transistors-one-capacitor synaptic cell design, aiming to enhance computing performance and scalability. Through comprehensive device-level modeling and system-level simulation, assessment is done on how the transistor characteristics influence DNN training accuracy and reveal critical design strategies. A novel cell design methodology that optimizes computing performance while minimizing cell area is proposed, thereby enhancing scalability. Additionally, development guidelines for cell components are provided, identifying oxide-based semiconductors as a promising channel material for transistors. This research contributes valuable insights for the development of future analog DNN training accelerators using capacitor-based synaptic cell, with a focus on addressing the current limitations and maximizing efficiency.},

This representation not only exhibits parameter-like characteristics but also encapsulates essential physical meanings that enhance interpretability. Additionally, the trained predictive model demonstrates relatively high accuracy, making it a reliable tool for practical applications.

  abstract     = {Soft pneumatic robotics are emerging as a transformative force in the field of wearable robotics, especially for their ability to deliver high-force kinesthetic haptics using lightweight, soft, and compliant materials. Despite these advancements, the miniaturization of these systems and the integration of complex, large-scale actuators pose significant challenges. Therefore, this research proposes a novel hot-plugging logic-enabled pinch valve to facilitate seamless valve integration without disrupting the existing pneumatic system. The valve design incorporates a frame equipped with slots for two pneumatic actuators (PAs). A third slot positioned between these two actuators enables hot-plugging capabilities for the operational elastic tubing pinched between the actuators. This configuration allows the control of higher operational pressures while operating at lower control pressures, achieving an impressive gain of up to eight and a maximum operational frequency of 1 Hz. Furthermore, by utilizing two PAs and adjusting the control pressure, the valve can execute a range of logical functions, including NOT, NAND, and NOR, without modifying its pneumatic connections. The NAND function of the valve is successfully demonstrated as it transforms an unsecured gripper into a secured one, showcasing its practical implications for enhancing functionality in soft pneumatic robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel control approach, called adaptive fractional hybrid impedance control (AFH-IC), for rotary series elastic actuators (RSEAs) operating in flat terrains, such as solid floors (hard), carpet (medium), and grass (soft). The main objective is to develop a high-sensitivity torque and position control system capable of handling various motion trajectories, including sudden hard changes. Unlike traditional impedance control methods, AFH-IC, which is enhanced with fractional-order control and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm, is designed to eliminate torque errors in time-varying stiffness environments. The fractional parameters of the AFH-IC are optimized using particle swarm optimization for each terrain under different constraints. A custom-designed RSEA is utilized in both simulations and experiments. The proposed control structure demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional methods such as fractional hybrid impedance control and hybrid impedance control. The results confirm that AFH-IC significantly enhances force-tracking accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Individuals with upper limb amputation face significant difficulty in operating standard computer peripherals with their prostheses, particularly the mouse, due to the constraints imposed by current prosthetic hand designs and the irregular shape of the computer mouse. This work introduces a soft myoelectric prosthesis system for operating different physical computer mouses. The proposed prosthesis has two tendon-driven soft fingers and three fin-ray fingers. It enables an enveloping grasp of the computer mouse and facilitates diverse finger-based clicking and scrolling operations. In addition, a mapping between the hand movements (myoelectric signals) and the computer mouse operations is created by combining a neural network classifier and a post-processing algorithm. Herein, the proposed system's performance is evaluated through a series of cursor control tasks involving both the able-bodied and amputee participants. In the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed soft prosthesis system effectively enables individuals with transradial amputation to operate a physical computer mouse using their residual limbs. Compared to a traditional cursor control method based on surface electromyography, the participants exhibit improved task performance (shorter completion time and higher throughput) and improved user experience (reduced muscle use and higher questionnaire scores).},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with developing a novel structure of machine learning-based anomaly forecasting, by which both forecasting the future states and detecting the anomalies in these states can be achieved at the same time. The main idea of this article is to introduce a feedback connection to combine several algorithms with respect to the forecasting and the detecting in a single algorithm. More precisely, Xgboost and long short-term memory are used for forecastor and one-class support vector machine and robust random cut forest are used for detector. Combining those 2 × 2 schemes leads to the overall four algorithms, and future anomalies can be detected before they occur. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through some comparative simulations of an IEEE 3-bus system with various faults. More interestingly, the detecting accuracies obtained through the two schemes of taking robust random cut forest are shown to be improved by 10% than those of employing the one-class support vector machine. For the forecasting part, Xgboost is regarded as involving the fastest prediction speed for online implementations, and thus the combination of Xgboost and robust random cut forest can be the most suitable choice for anomaly forecasting for power system fault events.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction technology is essential for driving safety in autonomous vehicles and is advancing rapidly. Current research mainly aims to enhance prediction accuracy in typical traffic conditions. However, less attention has been paid to low-probability, high-risk safety-critical events. It is undeniable that multiagent interaction behaviors in safety-critical events are more complex and difficult to predict. To address this, an interaction mechanism based on generative adversarial networks training, named GACNet, aimed at effectively predicting multiagent interaction behaviors under potential collision risks is proposed. GACNet is a deep learning framework capable of learning and capturing complex interaction patterns between multiple agents from real vehicle trajectory data. In addition, A conflict analysis module, which analyzes the predicted future trajectories and assesses potential collisions to provide a more detailed characterization of the interaction behaviors in safety-critical events is designed and incorporated. This design enables the model to predict vehicle trajectory behaviors in safety-critical events more accurately, aligning them more closely with real-world trajectory distributions. This mechanism is validated in various highly interactive roundabout and urban road scenarios. The results demonstrate that GACNet accurately learns vehicle behavior characteristics from real traffic data and makes precise predictions of multiagent interaction behaviors in safety-critical events.},

  abstract     = {Human skin's touch perception, mediated by mechanoreceptors, can perceive tactile stimuli with a spatial resolution higher than the average spacing between mechanoreceptors, known as super-resolution. This characteristic enables its sensitivity to both stimulus location and velocity. However, existing robotic tactile sensors lag behind human tactile perception, failing to achieve high spatial resolution and rapid response simultaneously. This significantly hinders robots from executing accurate, time-sensitive interaction tasks, particularly during dynamic slight-contact events. Here, a 130 μm-thick flexible tactile sensor array is designed, with spatial resolution enhanced by a tailored deep learning model, multistage attention-based adaptive spatial–temporal graph convolutional networks (MS-AASTGCN), simultaneously achieving a dynamic response of ≈30 ms and a super-resolution factor of 75.19. The tactile sensor array, based on single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerators, can detect dynamic subtle stimuli. It features a bio-inspired topological structure, facilitating super-resolution performance while offering a large perception area with low sensor (taxel) density. Additionally, the MS-AASTGCN enhances positioning resolution by extracting features fromsensing data and revealing the hidden relationships among taxels. This research provides new insights into haptic perception systems, enabling the execution of precise, time-sensitive interaction tasks, such as tracking a bouncing table tennis ball.},

Previous approaches have simplified robot manufacturing by using fluidic control circuits, but these rely on labor-intensive methods like silicone molding and manual assembly, limiting accessibility and replicability. Recent work, including this work, has demonstrated 3D-printed robotic grippers and crawlers with embedded control circuits, but generating cyclic control outputs for legged locomotion in rough terrain remains challenging. This study addresses the challenge with a monolithic 3D-printable four-phase bistable oscillating valve, capable of generating coordinated motion of multiple limbs from a steady source of pressurized air. The ability of the oscillator to control an electronics-free autonomous legged robot capable of walking on rough terrain, which can be fully fabricated on a desktop 3D printer without postassembly is demonstrated. The robot is operational immediately upon connection to an air supply. This development marks a significant step toward accessible, customizable, and biodegradable autonomous soft robots that can be produced using desktop 3D printers with no human intervention.},

Herein, a photometric stereo-based modeling, optimization, and evaluation system is proposed to explore the best illumination for typical camera-based tactile sensors. First, this article constructs a tactile benchmark dataset, simulates the contact deformation of elastomer surface, rendering the tactile imaging under various illuminations, and constructs a metrics system to evaluate the performance. Then, the relationship between reconstruct accuracy and illumination direction distribution on the benchmark is depicted, and the best illumination is optimized. The optimized sensor is fabricated and evaluated by standard metrology experiments, which exhibits high reconstruction accuracy and convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design and optimization approach. Furthermore, intensive experiments are conducted on diverse objects, which additionally indicate the generality and adaptability of the designed sensor.

Radiographic assessment is a noninvasive approach to diagnose orbital lesions. This study aims to develop a hybrid model leveraging magnetic resonance imaging scans to discern between MALT and non-MALT orbital lymphomas. The occupation of the tumor alters the relative positions of structures in the orbit. Hence, for the first time, the relative spatial positional features are extracted between different orbital structures and the tumor, complemented by the texture characteristics of the tumor area, to perform hybrid modeling. To validate this idea, 114 orbital lymphoma patients were are included. Statistical analysis reveals significant differences between the two groups in terms of four spatial features (lymphoma lesion, eyeball, inferior rectus, and optic nerve) and two texture features (angular second moment and contrast). The accuracy of the classifier based on spatial, texture, and hybrid features is 84.7, 83.1, and 88.3%, respectively. The innovative hybrid model offers a supportive approach for the differentiation of MALT and non-MALT orbital lymphomas, enhancing the clinical decision-making process.

This study employs pseudo-labeling and transfer learning, built upon a 6D pose estimation framework. A CNN trained on synthetic images predicts bounding boxes (bbox) for an object's components in a real image. With as few as four bbox predictions, the framework solves for the object's pose relative to the camera and reprojects bboxes for all components onto that image. The pose and reprojections allow filtering of bad predictions, a common issue in pseudo-labeling. Thereby, enabling automated labeling of large datasets with minimal human intervention. Tested on color and long-wave infrared imagery captured during December 2023 flight tests, this process demonstrates increased predictions, enhanced performance across situations, reduced reprojection error, and stabilized pose predictions. This technique is significant as it enables labeling of real-world imagery without expensive truth systems, requiring only a camera. It supports learning and labeling of previously captured imagery without known camera calibrations, facilitating labeled data creation for impractical-to-simulate sensors. Ultimately, this transfer learning approach provides a low-cost and precise method for creating CNNs trained on operationally relevant data, previously unattainable by the everyday user.},

  abstract     = {High-throughput screening (HTS) can be used when ab initio information is unavailable for rational design of new materials, generating data on properties such as chemistry and topography that control cell behavior. Biomaterial screens are typically fabricated as microarrays or “chips,” seeded with the cell type of interest, then phenotyped using immunocytochemistry and high-content imaging, generating vast quantities of image data. Typically, analysis is only performed on fluorescent cell images as it is relatively simple to automate through intensity thresholding of cellular features. Automated analysis of bright-field images is rarely performed as it presents an automation challenge as segmentation thresholds that work in all images cannot be defined. This limits the biological insight as cell response cannot be correlated to specifics of the biomaterial feature (e.g., shape, size) as these features are not visible on fluorescence images. Computer Vision aims to digitize tasks humans do by sight, such as identify objects by their shape. Herein, two case studies demonstrate how open-source approaches, (region-based convolutional neural network and algorithmic [OpenCV]), can be integrated into cell-biomaterial HTS analysis to automate bright-field segmentation across thousands of images, allowing rapid, spatial definition of biomaterial features during cell analysis for the first time.},

It is still challenging to design local interactions toward desired global formations and even more challenging for dynamic formations in a physical robot swarm system. Herein, a self-organized method for emergent dynamic circling formation in a robot swarm through optical interactions is proposed. First, this method is quantitatively modeled based on the geometrical relations among robots. This model is further adjusted according to the characteristics of the robot swarm system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this model, the effects of three key parameters of this model are tested on the size and disorder level of the emergent dynamic circling formation. The experimental results are consistent with the model predictions. Overall, a robot swarm system, in the physical environment, is quantitatively controlled to emerge a dynamic circling formation in this article. This work advances the swarm robotics for quantitatively designing local interactions among robots to reliably emerge dynamic global patterns.},

This study presents a novel machine learning–based method to accelerate and enhance the accuracy of compact model generation for multiple devices simultaneously. By integrating a Berkeley short-channel Insulated-Gate Field-Effect Transistor (IGFET) model-common multigate (BSIM) model with an error-correction neural network, the proposed approach refines predictions for critical electrical behaviors such as drain current and gate capacitance. Extraction networks dynamically optimize parameter sets for both models, eliminating manual tuning and reducing the need for separate training for each device. The method was validated using TCAD-simulated 3 nm nanosheet field-effect transistors devices, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 1.8% for drain current, 2.8% for transconductance, 8.5% for output conductance, and 0.4% for capacitances. Compared with the BSIM model alone, error reductions of 75, 70, 39, 85, and 81%, respectively, were achieved. This approach showed significant error reductions compared to the BSIM model alone and demonstrated robust performance across devices with variations, proving its effectiveness for large-scale applications.},

Herein, an optimal optical sensing sleeve using a multilayer perceptron is introduced to achieve an accurate inter-day motion intent recognition. This sleeve, demonstrating a high correlation ( R 2 = 0.93) with grasping force, incorporates six novel optical waveguides. Each waveguide is specifically designed to respond to pressing with high linearity, achieved by minimizing bending with a 3D-printed base and limiting elongation through carbon fiber reinforcement. This novel configuration enhances the generalization of the optical waveguides across multiple donning and doffing sessions. Furthermore, the multilayer perceptron model, which maps sensing signals to grasping forces, shows optimal performance compared to linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomial models. Remarkably, the correlation in mapping does not decrease in inter-day experiments; instead, it increases by 4.54%, indicating improved model generalization. Additionally, 12 commonly used items are grasped and held by a prosthetic hand, controlled by the optical sensing sleeve, which suggests the robustness in daily life, for an amputee. The optimal optical sensing sleeve holds promise for contributing to advancements in other wearable robots and achieving an inter-day model generalization.},

  abstract     = {Flexible tactile sensors have the ability to provide unparalleled levels of tactile sensation, including information regarding roughness, contact force, and contact location. However, it remains a challenge to achieve precise contact location sensing that is decoupled from sensor strain and touching forces. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach for force contact location sensing (FCLS) with the influence of sensor strain and forces based on scatter signals (SS) of the ultrasonic waveguide. First, the envelope of the force contact scatter signal (FCSS) is extracted via the Hilbert transform, which retrieves the global features of SS. The time-frequency spectrogram is obtained via continuous wavelet transform, which extracts the local features of SS. Second, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to extract these features separately and concentrate them together. Third, based on the outputs of the CNN, a multilayer perception regression model is applied to acquire the force contact location. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed FCLS method has a mean absolute error of 0.627 mm and a mean relative error of 3.19%. This research provides a foundation for further multimodal sensing using ultrasonic waveguides and its application in robotic sensing.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic sampling is performed to reduce hardware energy consumption and prevent overfitting by reducing parameters, because not all data are required for learning. In this study, a new approach, pseudo-synaptic sampling (PS2) method, which approximates the conventional synaptic sampling machine (S2M) method through a hardware-friendly implementation while demonstrating superior efficiency, is introduced. By sampling in front of neurons rather than at each synapse, the PS2 method improves hardware energy efficiency and ensures scalability. Furthermore, it improves energy and area efficiency by eliminating the additional circuit required by other techniques, such as the random walk (RW) method previously used which requires an additional circuit to frequently charge/discharge the membrane potential. Herein, the average firing rate equation for the S2M method is modified to suit the experimental conditions of this study. Through this numerical simulations, it is confirmed that the activation function of the PS2 method aligns with that of the S2M method and verified that the PS2 method can implement stochasticity for restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) neurons. Experimental validation of the PS2 method, compared to the RW method, for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) training and inference on field-programmable-gate-array-implemented spiking RBM chips reveals promising results. In an MNIST 100-handwritten digit experiment, the PS2 method exhibits on-chip training accuracy (92%) comparable to that of the RW method (93%). Furthermore, in the energy consumption analysis, it is shown that the PS2 method reduces power consumption by 94.94% compared to the RW method, highlighting its enhanced power efficiency due to a reduced number of circuit elements. In the investigation into the impact of increasing the frequency at which random bits are generated, it is shown that the RW method experiences accuracy degradation even with slight increases, whereas the PS2 method maintains accuracy over significantly longer periods. This enables further power reduction by allowing for a longer period during random bit generation. In this study, a foundation is laid for maximizing the energy efficiency of spiking neural network processors by optimizing internal noise generation mechanisms.},

Using pattern-recognition accuracy as a performance metric, the required device specifications for each algorithm are revealed. The results demonstrate that the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm requires stringent device specifications. Conversely, TTv2 permits more lenient device specifications than the TTv1 across all examined non-idealities.

However, carpooling also poses a challenge to the privacy of the users, as they may not want to reveal their location or route information to others. This research study delves into a cutting-edge approach to address these privacy concerns by leveraging homomorphic encryption (HE) within the realm of carpooling services. The proposed solution makes use of a HE scheme that supports encrypted computation on real numbers, which is suitable for carpooling applications that involve distance and time calculations. The approach enables decision makers to perform efficient and accurate route matching over encrypted data, without disclosing their sensitive information about users, thus preserving the confidentiality of the data. The proposed system is evaluated through extensive experiments and simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of both security and privacy when the system operates in normal (ideal) and abnormal (under attack) conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed solution offers robust resistance to various attacks, including replay attacks and data exposure, providing a robust and privacy-centric solution for carpooling services.},

Providing a variable stiffness grasp ( n = 9, 37.5%) and a limited grasp capability ( n = 8, 33.3%) is the most common advantage and challenge, respectively, of soft–rigid grippers. Pneumatic actuators ( n = 12, 50.0%), followed by tendon-driven electric rotary actuators ( n = 9, 37.5%), are the predominant actuators used for soft–rigid grippers. Soft–rigid grippers are found to have a lower output force-to-weight ratio ( n = 9, median , standard deviation ( σ ) = 15.17) in comparison to industrial parallel rigid grippers ( n = 63, ), but can provide a larger range of motion ( n = 20, ). This is the first quantitative comparative analysis between industrial parallel rigid and soft–rigid grippers, enhancing the understanding of their status and prospects in industrial applications. Herein, a common approach is proposed to standardize reporting to facilitate benchmarking between research-based and industrial grippers and highlight controlling soft–rigid grippers is an underexplored area that can enhance the technology's performance.},

  abstract     = {Chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) materials is actively sought for combustion of carbonaceous materials to achieve complete conversion and capture of carbon dioxide. These materials may play a vital role in reducing atmospheric carbon via negative carbon output. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach as different operating conditions and feedstocks may require different CLOU materials. As a result, the exploration and discovery of high-performance CLOU materials can be a slow process. To address this challenge, a high-throughput inverse machine learning workflow that identifies optimum materials from perovskite oxides for a given set of targets is developed—temperature and Gibbs free energy of oxygen formation. The model is trained on high-throughput density functional theory calculations of CLOU materials and inverts the materials design process using a genetic algorithm to produce realistic substituted SrFeO 3-δ compositions as output. Using the inverse model, it is able to identify several interesting new families of CLOU materials: Sr 1- x A x Fe 1- y B y O 3-δ (e.g., A = Ca or K; B = Mg, Bi, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, or Zn). These materials have shown promising properties, and some of them even outperform the benchmark material in terms of oxygen release kinetics under relevant CLOU operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Replicating the human shoulder in anthropomorphic systems is notoriously challenging due to its complex combination of mobility and strength. This study presents the design, fabrication, and control of a new soft artificial shoulder that achieves a broad range of motion, torque, and compliance. Powered by soft robotic textiles consisting of a network of hydraulic artificial muscles, the engineered shoulder effectively mimics intricate shoulder movements, including flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and medial/lateral rotation. Experiments demonstrate that the artificial shoulder can generate a peak torque of 9.6 ± 0.1 Nm, covering 65.3% of the human shoulder workspace. The artificial shoulder capability is demonstrated through several experimental testbeds. First, it is employed to develop a gesture-controlled telemanipulation robotic system, applicable to robot-assisted surgery, hazardous environment operations, gaming, and rehabilitation. Second, it serves as a platform for simulating and studying neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. This approach offers a reliable in vitro testing ground for wearable device validation, providing a crucial intermediary step before progressing to user studies. The artificial shoulder marks a significant advancement in next-generation anthropomorphic systems, closely mimicking the human musculoskeletal system, with promising applications in wearable assistive devices, haptics, orthopedic testing, and medical technologies.},

  abstract     = {Microfluidics has evolved into a transformative technology with far-reaching applications in biomedical research. However, designing and optimizing custom microfluidic systems remains challenging because of their inherent complexities. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with microfluidics promises to overcome these barriers by leveraging AI algorithms to automate device design, streamline experimentation, and enhance diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. Psoriasis is an incurable dermatological condition that is difficult to diagnose and treat owing to its complex pathogenesis. Traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are often ineffective and fail to address individual variabilities in disease progression and treatment responses. However, AI-coupled microfluidic platforms have the potential to revolutionize psoriasis research and clinical applications with expansive dermatological applications. AI-driven microfluidic chips with embedded biosensors have the potential to precisely detect biomarkers (BMs), manipulate biological samples, and mimic psoriasis-like in vivo and in vitro models, thereby allowing real-time monitoring and optimized therapeutic testing. This review examines the transformative potential of AI and AI-powered microfluidic platforms for advancing psoriasis research. It examines the design and mechanisms of AI-coupled microfluidic platforms for cell screening, disease diagnosis, and drug delivery. It highlights recent advances, clinical applications, challenges, future perspectives, and ethical considerations to enhance personalized care and patient outcomes.},

The orientation of the suction cup with respect to an object surface could be predicted with an average error of 1.97° for latitude and 9.41° for longitude. In a closed-loop control experiment, the orientation of the suction cup with respect to the object surface is estimated by an initial touch and the suction cup is consequently reoriented to approach the object surface in a perpendicular manner. The passive compliance of the suction cup is sufficient to compensate for the prediction error and a seal could be created on all of the objects.

This study presents a 3D shape and color-based descriptor, TOPS2, for point clouds generated from red green blue-depth (RGB-D) images and an accompanying recognition framework, THOR2. The TOPS2 descriptor embodies object unity, a human cognition mechanism, by retaining the slicing-based topological representation of 3D shape from the TOPS descriptor (IEEE Trans. Robot. 2024, 40 , 886) while capturing object color information through slicing-based color embeddings computed using a network of coarse color regions. These color regions, analogous to the MacAdam ellipses identified in human color perception, are obtained using the Mapper algorithm, a topological soft-clustering technique. THOR2, trained using synthetic data, demonstrates markedly improved recognition accuracy compared to THOR, its 3D shape-based predecessor, on two benchmark real-world datasets: the OCID dataset capturing cluttered scenes from different viewpoints and the UW-IS Occluded dataset reflecting different environmental conditions and degrees of object occlusion recorded using commodity hardware. THOR2 also outperforms baseline deep learning networks and a widely used Vision Transformer adapted for RGB-D inputs trained using synthetic and limited real-world data on both the datasets. Therefore, THOR2 is a promising step toward achieving robust recognition in low-cost robots.},

  abstract     = {Masks protect respiratory health in the coal, oil, and gas industries. However, prolonged exposure to high humidity inside masks can cause discomfort and increase the risk of respiratory diseases. To address the issue, in this work, a porous polymer humidity sensor suitable for monitoring respiratory changes in high humidity environment is prepared and integrated into the power air-purifying mask. Combined with the transfer learning algorithm, the problem with respiratory resistance caused by delayed air supply due to signal processing in the traditional power air-purifying mask is overcome, and the respiratory signal is effectively predicted in advance, so as to achieve real-time on-demand air supply. The brief process is as follows: A porous polymer humidity sensor with fast response/recovery times (2.94/4.86 s) at 95% relative humidity (RH) is developed for monitoring respiratory rate changes in high humidity environments. By integrating this sensor with a powered air-purifying system and employing a transfer learning algorithm, the system predicts respiratory signals and adjusts the air supply in real-time. This reduces mask humidity from 95% RH to 40–50% RH in 1.8 s, ensuring comfortable, low-resistance breathing for workers.This work will be conductive to the development of comfortable poweredair-purifying respirators with low resistance and humidity.},

  abstract     = {Over recent decades, soft and reconfigurable robots have rapidly emerged thanks to their ability to interact safely with humans and adapt to complex environments. . However, their softness makes accurate control challenging, requiring high-fidelity sensing for posture and contact estimation.Traditional camera-based sensors and load cells have limited portability and accuracy, and they will inevitably increase the robot's cost and weight. In this study, instead of using specialized sensors, only distributed pressure data inside a pneumatics-driven soft arm are collected and the physical reservoir computing principle is applied to simultaneously predict its kinematic posture (i.e., bending angle) and payload status (i.e., payload mass). Results show that, with careful readout training, one can obtain accurate bending angle and payload mass predictions via simple, weighted linear summations of pressure readings. In addition,analysis show that, to guarantee low prediction errors within 10%, bending angle prediction requires less training data than payload prediction. This reveals that balanced linear and nonlinear body dynamics are critical for the physical reservoir to accomplish complex proprioceptive and exteroceptive information perception tasks. Finally, the method of exploring efficient readout training methods presented here could be extended to other soft robotic systems to maximize their perception capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Untethered soft robots (USRs) based on single-actuation methods face inherent limitations due to restricted energy resources, which adversely affect their performance. Pneumatic-tendon-coupled actuators (PTCAs) offer an effective approach for USRs by combining the compliance and variable stiffness of pneumatic actuation with the precision and rapid motion control of tendon-driven actuation. However, current PTCA-based USRs are limited in versatility and efficiency when executing complex tasks. This research introduces discrete pneumatic-tendon-coupled actuators with interconnected air circuit (DPTCAs-IAC) to address these limitations through two major design approaches: 1) multiple discrete DPTCAs with integrated micro pump, providing additional degrees of freedom and independent motion control while regulating internal pressure without significantly adding weight; and 2) interconnecting multiple DPTCAs through air circuits to facilitate gas flow and enhance efficiency. Theoretical modeling and experimental tests conducted on single DPTCA and DPTCAs-IAC show that the IAC effectively reduces actuation torque and that opposite-direction movements consume less energy compared to same-direction movements. An untethered soft robotic gripper and an untethered quadruped robot with soft legs based on DPTCAs-IAC are developed. Both demonstrate excellent controllability, compact system integration, and multifunctionality, highlighting the potential of DPTCAs-IAC in advancing the development of complex untethered soft robots.},

  abstract     = {Soft robotics have significantly influenced both scientific and industrial domains over the past decades. However, their inherent limitations of material or structural softness pose a persistent challenge in terms of shape retention and load capacity for various applications. To address this challenge, bistable and multistable structures with two or more mechanically stable states and snap-through switchability emerge as a promising solution. Herein, a multistable soft robot design assembled from bistable auxetic building blocks with negative Poisson's ratio and a large volumetric change is presented. The bistable mechanical behavior and optimal structural parameters have been investigated by mechanical modeling, finite element analysis, and experimental testing. To demonstrate the shape retention ability and enhanced load capacity of our robotic design, a multistable manipulator with a low-complexity closed-loop control system is presented, capable of maintaining 216 discrete stable states even when the pneumatic pressure supply is removed. To validate the multifunctionality of design, a multistable tube crawler with a notable load capacity of approximately five times its own body weight is developed.},

  abstract     = {Gastroretentive drug delivery systems can improve adherence in patients with chronic diseases (CDs), but current options lack dose flexibility and involve complex fabrication methods. Inspired by the hygroscopic deformation observed in multilayered pine cone scales, wherein hydration of the outer active layer induces cone closure, a one-step fabrication method of a personalized 4D-printed water-actuated four-arm polypill is demonstrated in this study. The bilayer-arm polypill self-deploys upon ingestion to prolong gastric retention and sustain drug release. By inversing the orientation of the swellable active layer at the polypill arms compared to pine cone scales, a differential swelling strain develops generating bending force that enables polypill deployment to constrain passage through the pylorus. Finite-element analysis is used to model spatial changes in polymer phase swelling to ensure adequate deployment within the timeframe of gastric emptying. In a stomach model, the polypill expanded to 30 mm over 2 h, exceeding the diameter of the stomach model's distal end. In an in vitro release screening, biocompatible polymer composites capable of providing up to 6 days of release for a three-drug combination for tuberculosis–HIV coinfected patients are identified. The bioinspired 4D-printed polypill can serve as drug delivery platform for a range of CDs.},

Although doubts may arise regarding the limit of the relationship between performance and power consumption in computers, these disappear when considering the brain, which is one of the most efficient computing systems. In this way, bioinspired applications try to benefit from the low-power consumption present in the biological nervous system. Previous work has shown the feasibility of implementing spiking neural networks that operate in a Boolean manner on digital platforms, such as SpiNNaker, using basic logic gates and a spiking memory, which suggests the potential for constructing a low-power consumption spiking computer. This work takes a first step in the implementation of a spiking central processing unit by developing an arithmetic logic unit, which is an essential block for instruction execution, demonstrating its correct operation on Dynap-SE1. The results confirm the feasibility of using this Boolean approach on this platform, despite certain limitations in the number of inputs and operating frequencies of the blocks, and pave the way for the construction of a spiking computer.},

Herein, an easily deployable, camera-based system for autonomous calibration of FDM printers that optimizes for both part quality and completion time is presented. Autonomous calibration is achieved through a novel, multifaceted computer vision characterization and a multitask learning extension to Bayesian optimization. The system is demonstrated on four popular filament types using two distinct 3D printers. The results show that the system significantly outperforms manufacturer calibration across the machine and material configurations, achieving an average improvement of 32.2% in quality and a 31.2% decrease in completion time with respect to a popular benchmark.},

Planar printing tool paths, utilized in layer-by-layer printing such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) and prevalently used in most slicing algorithms, severely limit the realization of complex topologies required in metamaterials. Utilizing parametric design principles, the proposed approach employs discrete and continuous 3D freeform tool paths for supported and unsupported direct ink writing (DIW) of elastomeric structures. The resulting textured, soft topologies significantly enhance the performance of various mechanisms in soft robotics and impact energy-absorbing wearable devices. Various bioinspired structures such as cilia, webs, leaf-like structures, and lattices are explored using extrusion-based silicone 3D printing, achieving features with high aspect ratios (L/D ≤ 12) without support. These complex structures are challenging to 3D print using conventional planar toolpaths. To demonstrate the enhanced functionalities enabled by these new topologies, cilia arrays added to suction cups increased the pull-off forces by 18%. Additionally, 3D-printed elastomeric lattice slabs used as energy-absorbing structures reduced the maximum impact peak forces by 85%. Further functionalities, including magnetic, thermochromic, and signal transmission properties, are also showcased using functional soft mechanical metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Electromyographic (EMG)-based admittance control by arm force can provide continuous motion control in robot-assisted rehabilitation. Natural and complex physical human–robot interactions utilizing intelligent EMG-based interfaces require a computational estimation model for 3D voluntary forces. Existing computational models infrequently directly encode the interconnections among the spatial-dimensional components of 3D arm forces and experience performance degradation caused by confounding variables like muscle fatigue in EMG-based control. Motivated by this challenge, a computational model is proposed using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which only requires a user-friendly calibration by an incremental GMM approach to reduce the effect of muscle fatigue. GMM aims to encode the multivariable connection between EMG and voluntary force by joint probability density distribution. The EMG-based control system retrieves the estimated voluntary forces given EMG from GMM by utilizing the Gaussian mixture regression. Herein, the performance of the proposed EMG-based admittance control is tested using GMM by trajectory-tracking experiments before and after the fatigue-inducing experiment. The experiments include eight healthy participants. The experimental outcomes prove that the EMG-based control using calibrated GMM shows an increase of 23.66% and 8.17% in tracking precision and motion compliance, showing potential application across diverse domains involving physical human–robot interactions.},

  abstract     = {Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) remains a diagnostic challenge due to its scarce prevalence, and delayed diagnosis usually results in blindness and even fatal outcomes. Herein, an artificial intelligence (AI) system is developed to identify VRL among 16 retinal diseases and conditions on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images with the cross-subject meta-transfer learning (CS-MTL) algorithm. Extensive experiments of few-shot VRL recognition tasks prove the robustness of our model on 1-, 3-, and 5-shot scenarios, achieving an F1 score of 0.8697 to 0.9367. The superiority of the model is shown with a higher F1 score (0.9310) compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms (0.5487–0.9018) and three doctors whose clinical experiences range between 3 to 10 years without the help of the CS-MTL (0.7773–0.8949). AI assistance significantly improves the F1 scores of doctors by 6.16–14.46% ( p < 0.001). Moreover, the F1 scores of AI-assisted senior doctor and retinal specialist (0.9414 and 0.9500), but not the junior doctor (0.8897), exceed that of the CS-MTL (0.9310). This study presents a promising approach for aiding in the diagnosis of VRL on retinal OCT images and may provide a novel insight into the collaboration of doctors with AI techniques, resulting in reducing the risk of diagnostic delays of rare diseases.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel dual-body negative-pressure ground-wall transition robot (DNPTR) aimed at expanding the application scenarios of climbing robots to meet the functional requirements of obstacle traversal and wall transition in high-altitude operations. As a typical representative of highly nonlinear and multivariable strongly coupled systems, the wall transition actions of the DNPTR are analyzed and planned based on the mechanical structure characteristics. Subsequently, unified kinematic and dynamic models of the bipedal negative-pressure climbing robot are established. To improve the automation and ensure safe, efficient operation of climbing robots, effective trajectory tracking control for the DNPTR is crucial. Addressing challenges such as model parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, this study proposes an adaptive trajectory tracking control method based on a radial basis function neural network. The method integrates a boundary layer with an improved exponential reaching law, forming a non-singular terminal sliding mode control strategy. Using Lyapunov theory, the global asymptotic stability of the system is verified. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves faster convergence and effectively suppresses oscillations during trajectory tracking. This research is of practical importance, offering valuable guidance for the design of high-accuracy, robust trajectory-tracking controllers for dual-body climbing robots.},

Despite these advances, the standard photovoltaic materials development workflow still involves manually performing multiple characterization techniques on every new device, requiring significant time and expenditures. One barrier to ML implementation is that most models reported to date are trained on computer simulated data, due to the difficulty in experimentally collecting the massive data sets needed for model training, limiting the ability to assess the limitations and validity of these methods, as well as to access new potential physical mechanisms absent in simulations. Herein, several neural networks trained on experimental data from PbS colloidal quantum dot thin-film solar cells are introduced. These models predict multiple, complex materials properties, including carrier mobility, relative photoluminescence intensity, and electronic trap-state density, from a single, simple measurement: illuminated current–voltage curves. The measurement system considers the spatial distribution of the materials parameters to gather and predict large amounts of data by treating an inhomogeneous device as a series of thousands of micro-devices, a novel feature compared to existing solutions. This model can be extended to other materials and devices, accelerating development times for new optoelectronic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Sweat rate measures key physiological states such as hydration levels and heat tolerance. Incorporating wearable technology with sweat rate sensors allows individuals to conveniently monitor their health, optimize workouts, and enhance occupational safety. However, challenges persist in such integration techniques, including intricate manufacturing, nonlinear responses to changes in sweat rates, and errors from the intermediate measurement of the distance sweat travels in the sensor. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive wearable platform that includes a fully printed, flexible sensor patch, readout electronics, and a mobile app for continuous, real-time monitoring of sweat rate. We fabricate a sensor patch with an area of 700 mm 2 and a weight of 380 mg by utilizing direct 3D printing and scalable microfluidic fabrication. The microfluidic channels are 850 μm wide and 164 μm thick, with serpentine electrodes measuring sweat rate using capacitance. The custom readout electronics capture these changes in capacitance to accurately measure sweat rate, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01 μL min −1 . The sensor's performance is validated against analytical models, simulations, and on-body trials with commercial sensors. This cost-effective, flexible, and fully integrated sweat-sensing solution has significant potential in precision health.},

In this work, we develop a wristband that integrates an array of 10 skin-conformal strain sensors based on laser-induced graphene, which is optimized for continuous measurement of skin strain. The device is characterized to identify several hand gestures and tasks while simultaneously using an optical camera-based hand-tracking system to estimate the joint locations for ground truth generation. Machine learning models are developed to predict gestures as well as specific hand joint angles with high accuracy of >90% and >95%, respectively. The findings show that the sensors placed closer to actuation-specific anatomical features contribute more toward the high accuracy. The sensor array is also integrated with a wearable readout system that wirelessly transmits the data in real time in order to control a robotic arm as a proof of concept for human–robot interaction applications. The developed skin-conformal device is expected to find wide applications in rehabilitation, sports sciences, and human–computer interaction, paving the way for low-profile prosthetic and orthotic control systems.},

With the memristor characteristics enough to mimic synaptic weight to be learnt and infer the Fashion-mnist dataset, the classification accuracy is satisfied as ≈84.36% with the loss of ≈16.8% to original level.

  abstract     = {Controlling soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is complex due to their ubiquitous deformation, prompting the use of reduced model-based controllers to provide sufficient state information for high dynamic response control performance. However, most modeling techniques face computational efficiency and complexity of parameter identification issues. To alleviate this, a paradigm coupling an analytical modeling approach based on pseudo-rigid body modeling and the logarithmic decrement method (PRBM + LDM) for parameter estimation is proposed. Using a soft robot hand test bed, the PRBM + LDM model for a closed-loop position controller is applied and is compared with a simple proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) static shape control of soft continuum robots using deep visual inverse kinematic models. Furthermore, the PRBM + LDM model-based force controller is compared with simple constant pressure grasping control by pinching tasks on low-weight, small objects—a screwdriver, a potato chip, and a brass coin. The PRBM + LDM-based position controller outperforms the simple PID position controller, and the PRBM + LDM-based force controller achieves a higher success rate than the constant pressure grasping control in the pinching tasks. In conclusion, the PRBM + LDM modeling technique proves to be a convenient and efficient way to model the dynamic behavior of soft actuators closely and can be applied to build high-precision position and force controllers.},

The neural networks are trained using 18 000 data points generated from numerical simulations with input powers ranging from sub-kW- to kW-class. The accuracy of the developed machine learning model is demonstrated using untrained 700 W- and 1 kW-class Hall effect ion sources, producing results with deviations of less than 10% compared to the experimentally measured thrust and discharge current, thus surpassing the accuracy of conventional scaling laws. As a high-fidelity surrogate for numerical simulations, the proposed prediction tool provides high prediction accuracy and calculation speed, offering an excellent complement to conventional scaling laws and enhancing the understanding of Hall effect ion source performance characteristics.},

Here, a graphical user interface version of SuperResNET was applied to publicly available direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) data of nucleoporin Nup96 and Nup107 labeled nuclear pores that present a highly organized octagon structure of eight corners. SuperResNET effectively segments nuclear pores and Nup96 corners based on differential proximity threshold analysis from 2D and 3D SMLM datasets. SuperResNET quantitatively analyzes features from segmented nuclear pores, including complete structures with eightfold symmetry, and from segmented corners. SuperResNET modularity analysis of segmented corners from 2D SMLM distinguishes two modules at 10.7 ± 0.1 nm distance, corresponding to two individual Nup96 molecules. SuperResNET is therefore a model-free tool that can reconstruct network architecture and molecular distribution of subcellular structures without the bias of a specified prior model, attaining molecular resolution from dSTORM data.

Herein, a computer vision-assisted light-driven LCE for accurate control of bending actions of the LCE actuator is proposed. The control system effectively mitigates instability in the bending angle caused by environmental factors such as light, wind, and changes in the surrounding medium. Furthermore, a “lift bridge” for ants moving between two platforms and an oscillator with modulable angular interval and frequency are demonstrated.

However, current neuroimaging techniques face several challenges when it comes to imaging the deep brain. These challenges include limited imaging depth, a narrow field of view, low resolution, and a lack of real-time imaging and stereotactic deployment capabilities. To address these challenges, a patient-mounted neuro optical coherence tomography (neuroOCT) system that combines a lightweight 5 degrees-of-freedom skull-mounted robot (Skullbot) with a neuroendoscope measuring ≈0.6 mm in diameter is introduced. This innovative system enables targeted and minimally invasive neuroimaging with an axial resolution of ≈2.4 μm and a transverse resolution of around 4.5 μm. The Skullbot can be securely attached to the head and precisely deploys the neuroendoscope with an accuracy of ±1.5 mm in the transverse direction and ±0.25 mm in the longitudinal direction. This allows for motion-insensitive stereotactic imaging within the brain. By utilizing the neuroOCT system, targeted imaging of a tumor in a brain phantom is successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the system's capability for in vivo micro-resolution volumetric neuroimaging of fine structures within a mouse brain is validated.},

It is demonstrated that bubbles acting as micro end-effectors rapidly and adaptively realize dexterous manipulation of microobjects such as biological organisms and droplets. They can function as microgrippers to grasp microobjects based on interface interaction-induced adhesion and act as soft micromanipulators to safely manipulate fragile objects. Moreover, the bubble micro end-effector can sense and perceive the designated objects for contact measurement of microforces or surface textures at a microscopic scale via the shape changes of their ultrasoft structures. The reported method successfully integrates grasping, manipulation, and measurement functions in liquid using a single microbubble of less than 1 mm 3 volume. These nondestructive functionalities showcase promising prospects for bubble-based micro end-effectors in biological manipulation and sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Aging society is a global challenge, with increasing healthcare demands and associated social costs. Monitoring body temperature is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment of medical conditions, particularly in the elderly. Herein, a smart denture with embedded thin-film temperature sensors designed to monitor the body temperature in real-time is presented, which can be commonly worn by the elderly population for advanced healthcare. This device is realized using polymethyl methacrylate resin plates and dentures, which are routinely employed materials in dentistry for prosthesis fabrication. The thin-film temperature sensor is patterned using femtosecond laser pulses, ensuring high mechanical strength, high lateral resolution, and high-temperature sensitivity (0.26% °C −1 ). Furthermore, experiments conducted in a virtual intraoral wet environment demonstrate the sensor's capability to accurately measure the small temperature variation of 0.1 °C within a short timeframe. The integration of temperature sensors into dentures holds promise for enhancing patient monitoring and improving overall healthcare outcomes for the elderly population. The versatility of direct laser writing concept with femtosecond lasers will enable the implementation of various sensors, energy storage devices, and circuitries into dentures for advanced smart healthcare.},

However, most of the existing methods are single-modal movement recognition, which has inherent limitations, such as limited feature representation and instability to noise, which will affect its practical performance. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel fusion approach that can integrate two biological signals, including electromyography (EMG) and bioelectrical impedance (BI). The fusion method combines EMG for capturing dynamic movement features and BI for discerning key postures representing discrete points within dynamic movements. In this method, the identification of key postures and their temporal sequences provide a guiding framework for the selection and weighted correction of probability prediction matrices in EMG-based dynamic recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the method, six dynamic upper limb movements and nine key postures are defined, and a Universal Robot that can follow movements is employed for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the dynamic movement reaches 96.2%, representing an improvement of nearly 10% compared with single-modal signal. This study illustrates the potential of multimodal fusion of EMG and BI in movement recognition, with broad prospects for application in HMI fields.},

Their functionalities span from cell sorting to microscale fiber assembly through periodic acoustic pressure fields. Conventional methods usually require parallel acoustic emitters and reflective surfaces, producing constrained standing wave patterns. In this paper, an effective approach for creating versatile acoustic standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. The deflector manipulates the direction of incoming acoustic waves coupled with the retroreflector to reflect these waves back to the source. The proposed design allows the creation of standing waves that are not constrained by the relative angles of the two surfaces involved and allows for customizable wave patterns beyond the standard limits with enhanced adaptability. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through computational simulations using finite element analysis and experimental validation based on a 3D-printed prototype. Results suggest that versatile standing waves between arbitrarily oriented surfaces can be produced through the careful design of the metasurface deflector and retroreflector. This approach can improve the performance of standing wave applications in particle manipulation, thus broadening the range of practical implementations for ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore alternative approaches that are fast, mild, and highly tunable. Herein, a novel fabrication strategy for contactless assembly of soft-robots is introduced for the first time. This technology exploits hydrodynamic instabilities at the free surface of a fluid layer, thus enabling the fabrication of centimeter-scale robots featuring diverse structural properties. These features show a wide range of deformation modes in response to magnetic fields, including folding, bending, and expanding. Furthermore, the design and assembly of novel actuators with customized shapes as fish- and butterfly-like structures is shown. The fabricated patterns exhibit different modes of motion under the influence of uniform magnetic fields. As a proof of concept, an innovative application of this technology combined with the proposed soft robots is represented by the enhanced release of extracellular vesicles.  Altogether, this novel fabrication method along with the newly developed magnetic soft robots enables the manufacturing of high-performance, multifunctional, and cytocompatible intelligent systems.},

Herein, a modeling structure for a mecanum-wheeled autonomous electric vehicle used for the heavy duties in iron–steel industry is proposed by taking the slippage information into account. The objective is to reach more travel distance and reduce the energy loss of the battery which causes to carry load less than planned.

Five tons of zinc ingots are carried from the storage area to the melting pot using an autonomous electric vehicle in a predefined reference route.

To achieve this goal, the upcoming generation of head-mounted displays (HMDs) necessitates a seamless transition between different XR modes, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) modes. Herein, an innovative cholesteric liquid crystal- (CLC-) based optical combiner for HMDs is introduced. This approach enables the display device to switch between AR, VR, and transparent modes via temperature modulation. Since CLC materials demonstrate varying optical properties at different temperatures, a real-time temperature monitoring system that is paired with an external controller is integrated. This allows for dynamic temperature adjustments of the optical combiner and enables smooth transitions between display modes. Furthermore, the Berreman 4 × 4 matrix method is used to simulate the optical properties of the optical combiner, finding strong agreement with the experimental results. The performance of the tunable optical combiners using 450, 532, and 635 nm laser sources is explored. The findings demonstrate that CLC-based optical combiners can effectively switch between the three distinct modes at corresponding temperatures, paving the way for versatile applications in future HMDs.},

  abstract     = {Grasp generation methods based on force-closure analysis can calculate the optimal grasps for objects through their appearances. However, the limited visual perception ability makes robots difficult to directly detect the complete appearance of objects. Building predefined models is also a costly procedure. These reasons constrain the application of force-closure analysis in the real world. To solve it, this article proposes an interactive robotic grasping method based on promptable segment anything model and force-closure analysis. A human operator can mark a prompt on any object using a laser pointer. Then, the robot extracts the edge of the marked object and calculates the optimal grasp through the edge. To validate feasibility and generalizability, the grasping generation method is tested on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets and a novel benchmark test set of 36 diverse objects is constructed to conduct real-world experiments. Furthermore, the contributions of each step are demonstrated through ablation experiments and the proposed method is tested in the occlusion scenarios.

The classification is based on structural and conformational characteristics (mono-, bi-, or multimaterial assemblies, their orientation, chemical structures, and geometrical configurations). Additionally, this review presents an alternative formulation and extension of the pioneering Timoshenko's model, which provides an understanding of the underlying mechanical principle of bilayer bending actuation. Finally, upscaled applications of this actuation principle are described, focusing mainly on biomimetic architecture. Attention is given to previously reported real-life applications based on bio-based materials and material systems. Furthermore, this review discusses the multiple challenges for synthetic materials when an upscaling perspective is intended. In this sense, key aspects such as time responsiveness and mechanical amplification, in terms of speed, displacement, and load-bearing capability, are discussed.},

Herein, the strength of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is investigated to achieve effective distinction of ovarian cancer (OC) from other blood cell populations based on label-free morphological biomarkers rather than conventional fluorescent imaging or other molecular parameters. At this purpose, QPI is implemented in high-throughput flow cytometry mode and combined with machine learning (ML), reliable and accurate OC cell phenotyping is achieved by developing ad-hoc multi-level ML classification architectures driven by a priori clinical information. It is shown that the latter allows increasing the overall classification accuracy when compared to noninformed ML classification systems. Thanks to its simplicity, the proposed intelligent system is compatible with various clinical applications, particularly in the context of CTC-based liquid biopsy during patient follow-up, when cancer subtype and other clinical information are already known.},

In this research, a new method called class-separable extreme learning machine auto-encoding (CS-ELM-AE) is proposed, to improve ELM-AE's efficacy in addressing the overlapping data problem and thereby increasing classification efficiency. CS-ELM-AE encodes points in the same class of the dataset to be closer together. Oversampling is also applied to the encoded dataset to solve the imbalanced data problem. The experiments demonstrate that CS-ELM-AE could significantly improve classification model performance and achieve higher levels of accuracy, as well as greater f1-score and G-mean values than the original ELM-AE.},

The active layers are mats of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers, embedded in an elastomeric matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The electrodes are made of a mixture of carbon black and PDMS, bonded to the active layers by electrostatic adhesion force. The effects of the nanofibers in the soft actuators are investigated. Specimens of the soft actuator are realized that differ in the thickness of the nanofibrous mats used for the active layers, that is, 60 and 120 μm. An electromechanical characterization is performed to analyze and measure the axial force and axial displacements of the soft actuators when different electric fields are applied to the specimens in the transversal direction. The experimental results show that the presence of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers enhances the force-to-weight ratio of the soft actuators by up to 43.5%, and the energy density by up to 12.9%, compared to a control specimen with the active layer made of PDMS only.},

Wood as a substrate reduces processing steps and enables the integration of intelligent functionalities in wooden furniture, offering biodegradability, nontoxicity, and derivation from renewable sources. In this work, sustainably printed transistors using zinc oxide nanoparticles as the active layer and honey electrolyte on wood substrates are demonstrated as a promising approach to reduce the environmental footprint of electronics. Despite the substrate's high roughness, the transistor exhibits excellent performance for screen-printed devices, with low on-voltage of 0.32 ± 0.12 V and high I on /I off of (2.4 ± 0.9) × 10 4 . Further analysis of hysteresis in transfer curves under varying scan rates and sweep ranges reveals the device's ability to adjust memory windows and on-current. Notably, these devices successfully emulate synapses, exhibiting neural facilitation and plasticity, indicating a shift toward sustainable computing. The device's dynamic response to single and successive presynaptic pulses demonstrates its ability to adjust synaptic weight, transition from transient to persistent memory, and pulse width-, frequency-, voltage-, and number-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents. The successful emulation of the learning–forgetting–relearning–forgetting process underscores the device's potential for use in sustainable high-performance neuromorphic systems.},

  abstract     = {For energy- and time-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) computing, implementing hardware-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) has become a core technology. In SNNs, synaptic devices store weights in memory, and neurons process received weighted information and generate spike signals. Upon feeding spike signals into synaptic arrays, the synaptic weights multiply the signals, which subsequently sum up to perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). Simultaneous access to multiple synaptic devices, however, reduces the equivalent resistance of these synaptic arrays. This reduction alters the voltage division between the pre-synaptic array and the input resistance of the neuron circuit, distorting the read voltage across synaptic devices. This phenomenon is known as the fan-in problem, which leads to non-ideal VMM operations and degrades system accuracy. To address this issue, a novel compensated current mirror (CCM) neuron circuit is proposed, which incorporates a single additional transistor into a conventional current mirror. This CCM neuron achieves exceptional current linearity ( R 2 > 0.999) and efficiently compensates for VMM error with low complexity and energy consumption (3.33 pJ spike −1 ). Furthermore, the CCM neuron demonstrates ≈7-%p higher inference accuracy than conventional ones when integrated with a 512 × 512 large-scale synaptic array, which is comparable to the accuracy of software-based SNNs.},

  abstract     = {Touchscreens are essential parts of many electronics in daily lives of sighted people in the digital information era. On the other hand, visually impaired users rely on tactile displays as one of the key communication devices to interact with the digital world. However, due to their working mechanism and the uneven surface of tactile displays, one of the key features of screens for sighted users is surprisingly challenging to implement: precision touch input. To overcome this, a hand gesture recognition system is developed using a frequency-modulated continuous wave millimeter-wave radar. A multifeature encoder method is used to obtain the range and velocity information from the radar to translate the data into spectrogram images. Gesture recognition is implemented for common input gestures: single/double-click, swipe-right/left, scroll-up/down, zoom-in/out, and rotate-anticlockwise/clockwise. The gesture recognition and classification are based on machine learning, support vector machines, deep learning, and convolutional neural network approaches. The chosen model You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOv8) shows a high accuracy of 97.1% by iterating only 30 epochs with only 500 collected data samples per gesture. This research paves the way toward using radar sensors not only for tactile displays but also for other digital devices in human–computer interaction.},

A linear actuator switches a compliant mechanism to cut off airflow through off-the-shelf tubing. The modular compliant logic devices can be configured as normally open or normally closed switches, as NOT, AND, and OR gates, and as nonvolatile memory elements. Their use is demonstrated in controlling a fluidic stepper motor, a worm-like robot, and a fluidic display. These fluidic switches are printable using inexpensive desktop 3D printers, can be reliably reproduced in large quantities, and offer a wide range of modifiable parameters, including scalability, adaptability in operating pressure, and the tunability of instability counts for computational and memory functions.},

In this work, a detailed characterization of a millimeter-scale (1–5 mm) adhesion modulation method is performed, demonstrating its effectiveness for switching adhesion on small, lightweight objects with smooth surfaces. This modulation phenomenon arises from the viscoelastic behavior when PDMS interacts with a rigid surface and is controlled via microvibration. A maximum apparent adhesion enhancement of 2400% and a reduction of 50% are achieved with a 1 mm-diameter PDMS hemisphere vibrating at a 30 μm amplitude and a 700 Hz frequency. The effects of different parameters, including size, actuation amplitude/frequency, surface roughness, and material properties, on adhesion performance are carefully measured and analyzed. A monotonic increase in maximum adhesion is observed with increased device size and surface smoothness, while nonlinear relationships of other factors are generalized with a numerical model. A long working lifespan and high endurance are also observed during the characterization. This work serves as a practical reference for the further design of small-scale soft grippers, highlighting its continuous, large modulation range, simple structure, and flexible control.},

However, a universal design rule of memristive H–H neurons is still lacking, hindering its development and applications. Herein, a universal H–H neuron circuit structure is proposed and its feasibility based on NbO x memristors is demonstrated. The constructed neuron achieves 23 types of firing behaviors observed in biological neurons, simplifying the communication between neurons. To better understand the correlation between circuit parameters and firing patterns, the firing patterns into three classes according to the switching cycle ratio of two memristors are categorized. The circuit design rules of each category of firing patterns are deeply elucidated and universal regularities for tuning circuit parameters to implement the switch between different firing behaviors are presented. Finally, the potential applications of different firing behaviors in neuromorphic intelligence systems are discussed. This work provides theoretical guidance for engineering memristive H–H neuron circuits, assisting in building high-order neuromorphic systems based on firing patterns.},

However, existing systems have been limited to a single or a few sensors in parallel, so they are not comparable to the state-of-the-art electrical resistive and capacitive touchpads, which can detect rich tactile information, including touch location, pressure, area, and even multiple touches simultaneously. This work reports a soft micropneumatic touchpad. The touchpad consists of 32 pneumatic channels inside soft elastomer, with 16 channels aligned row-wise and 16 column-wise. The flow resistance of each channel is measured using a pressure divider. When the pad is touched, the cross-sectional area of the channels close to the contact location deforms, which changes the flow resistance of those channels. With 32 sensing channels, the location, depth, area of the contact, and even two simultaneous touches can be detected. Letters hand-written on the touchpad can be reconstructed from the measured data. With the assumption of sparsity, a tactile pressure map, with a value at each 16 × 16 grid point, can also be reconstructed. This work opens a path to replace electronic tactile sensors in soft devices with all-fluidic alternatives.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an extended Cartesian space robot control framework that features a virtual force tracking impedance control to enhance the end-effector trajectory tracking performance. Initially, the concept of a virtual surface is introduced, which is assumed to be at some constant distance from the desired end-effector trajectory. This virtual surface generates a virtual contact force when interacting with the torque-controlled robot end-effector. The interaction is then manipulated using an impedance control model to track a constant desired force. If the robot end-effector deviates from the desired trajectory, the constant force-tracking impedance control generates a compliance trajectory that regulates the end-effector movements, constraining it to the desired trajectory. For robust force tracking, impedance parameters are optimally tuned using a closed-loop dynamic model incorporating both robot and impedance dynamics. Additionally, super twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) is integrated to overcome uncertainties and the impact of robot dynamics on force-tracking performance. Experimental validation confirms the theoretical claims of the proposed approach. It demonstrates that force-tracking impedance control improves the end-effector trajectory tracking by quickly reacting to the dynamic trajectories compared to position control only and effectively maintains it on the desired trajectories.},

Researchers delineate skin outlines from chest CT images obtained from two different institutions. Radiomics features are extracted from the chest CT data and skin contours. Organ doses are computed using Monte Carlo simulations as reference organ doses. Single- and cross-institutional support vector regression (SVR) models are trained with radiomics features to predict organ doses from chest CT scans. Model performance is assessed using metrics like maean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R -squared ( R 2 ). For chest organs (lungs, heart, spinal cord, trachea, and esophagus), single-institutional SVR models achieve MAPE values ranging from 4.72% to 15.31% and R 2 values from 0.73 to 0.93. Cross-institutional models have MAPE values in the range of 2.16–7.49% and R 2 values from 0.84 to 0.99.

They offer promising advantages, namely, a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. Herein, approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier transform are proposed. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, the approaches are applied to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for “ecstatic display,” a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. It is found that the approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. It is hoped that this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Online learning aims to solve a sequence of consecutive prediction tasks by leveraging the knowledge gained from previous tasks. Linearized confidence-weighted (LCW) learning is the first online learning algorithm introducing the concept of weight confidence into the prediction model through distributions over weights. It provides the flexibility for weights to update their values at different scales. The kernel trick in machine learning can be applied to LCW for a better prediction performance. However, the kernel-based LCW algorithm is subject to the curse of kernelization which makes it vulnerable to the unlimited growth of the prediction model in runtime and memory consumption. In this study, we present the budgeted LCW (BLCW) algorithm which puts a limit on the growth by a predefined budget with optimization. Consequently, BLCW performs the LCW update and then reduces the information loss by projection. Based on the resource perspective that reinterprets LCW in terms of resources and utilization degrees, we demonstrated that BLCW approximates the kernel-based LCW algorithm. We evaluate four budget maintenance strategies and suggest that the mean removal is the most stable. By various numerical experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that BLCW performs competitively and effectively when compared to leading budgeted online algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Soft manipulators, renowned for their compliance and adaptability, hold great promise in their ability to engage safely and effectively with intricate environments and delicate objects. Nonetheless, controlling these soft systems presents distinctive hurdles owing to their nonlinear behavior and complicated dynamics. Learning-based controllers for continuum soft manipulators offer a viable alternative to model-based approaches that may struggle to account for uncertainties and variability in soft materials, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Learning-based controllers can be trained through experience, exploiting various forward models that differ in physical assumptions, accuracy, and computational cost. In this article, the key features of popular forward models, including geometrical, pseudo-rigid, continuum mechanical, or learned, are first summarized. Then, a unique characterization of learning-based policies, emphasizing the impact of forward models on the control problem and how the state of the art evolves, is offered. This leads to the presented perspectives outlining current challenges and future research trends for machine-learning applications within soft robotics.},

  abstract     = {Micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are promising for biomedical applications due to their unconstrained nature and small enough size to pass through many tiny environments. However, the efficient movement of MNRs in liquid environments is still a challenge due to the low Reynolds number environment and the Brownian motion of particles. Herein, emerging MNRs with hydrogel-loaded magnetic particles are designed. The proposed hydrogel MNRs (HMNRs) exhibit biocompatible and controllable characteristics. The motion controllability of HMNRs is realized by applying oscillating magnetic field and customized magnetic field. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that the HMNR swarms driven by the oscillating magnetic field exhibit a faster motion speed than the MNR swarms composed of magnetic particles. The HMNRs show precise controllability of the movement in the complex pipeline under the control of customized magnetic field. This method can offer a more benign approach to the general production of HMNRs for biological applications.},

  abstract     = {A biological muscle's force is nonlinearly constrained by its current state (force, length, and speed) and state history. To investigate if artificial muscles can mimic (i.e. biomimetic) the complete mechanical state spectrum of biological muscles, this study uses a novel method to characterize twisted coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) mechanically. Thus, comprehensive and reproducible test procedures are established to verify artificial muscle biomimetics regarding stress, strain, and strain rate combinations intrinsic to biological muscle. A rheometer performs novel high-precision mechanical characterization methods to comprehensively verify biomimetic performance. Sample twist level, torque, length, force, and temperature are controlled and measured during twist-induced coiling, heatsetting/annealing, and mechanical testing. TCPAs are formed from linear low-density polyethylene monofilament. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) TCPAs generate larger stresses than biological muscle through the entire spectrum of strains—contracting more than 40%, exerting more than 0.3 MPa at rest length, and withstanding tension of 8 MPa without damage. Thus, the LLDPE TCPAs attain biological muscle performance statically, but additional tests are required to assess this dynamically. The mechanical performance of LLDPE TCPAs enables biomimetic actuation with an intelligent control and measurement system. Their high-throughput textile manufacturability positions them for advanced biomechatronic applications—including prosthetics and exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real-time estimations of the user's intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time-consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user-adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance control approach and its potential to enhance physical human–robot interaction in various applications that involve repetitive or continuous motion.},

Carnivorous plants feed by trapping insects, sunflowers grow by following the sun, and pine cones control the dispersal of their seeds under optimal conditions. This comprehensive review first analyses the mechanisms responsible for these adaptive movements highlighting the need for a gradient in one of the physico-chemical properties to enable morphing. Next, the main synthetic shape-changing soft systems are presented in terms of their mechanism of action. A gradient in water-swelling, magneto-rheological properties, residual deformation, or extensibility gives hygromorphs, magnetomorphs, mechanomorphs, and baromorphs, respectively. The various morphing triggers, namely light, heat, pH, tensile stress, pressure, electric, and magnetic fields, are described. The opportunities and challenges of each system are put into perspective. This report aims to provide the reader with a toolbox for designing shape-changing materials considering the targeted trigger, as well as providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms paving the way for future discoveries.},

However, most existing research in this area focuses on shape control for a provided explicit goal and does not consider physical constraints, which limits its applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this study, a self-supervised planning and control approach are proposed to address the challenge of rearranging deformable linear objects for implicit goals. Specifically, the context of making both ends of the object reachable (inside the robotic access range) and graspable (outside potential collision regions) by dual-arm robots is considered. Firstly, the object is described with sequential keypoints and the correspondence-based action is parameterized. Secondly, a generator capable of producing multiple explicit targets is developed, which adhere to implicit conditions. Thirdly, value models are learnt to assign the most promising explicit target as guidance and determine the goal-conditioned action. All models within the policy are trained in a self-supervised manner based on data collected from simulations. Importantly, the learned policy can be directly applied to real-world settings since we do not rely on accurate dynamic models. The performance of the new method is validated with simulations and real-world experiments.},

The magnetic elastomer is produced by combining NdFeB powders with a diameter of 5 μm into silicone, following a weight ratio of 50%, and then magnetized using 2D Halbach-array magnets. Simulation results reveal the capability to adjust magnetic field strength and distribution by altering the magnet's orientation. The sensor's efficacy in 3-axis sensing is validated through calibration with a linear model, achieving a good root-mean-square error below 0.7 N in force measurement. The H-PME sensor, with a thickness of merely 4.5 mm, can detect forces up to 50 N. It's simple 3-layer design allows the thickness to be reduced to as low as 2 mm, while also offering ease of replacement. Crucially, crosstalk evaluation experiments show that the proposed H-PME sensor can dramatically mitigate crosstalk interference.},

One critical problem that restricts their industrial application is the lack of scalable fabrication techniques due to the limitation of conventional machine tools. This study proposes a scalable surface texturing technique using a portable small (30 × 19 × 22 mm) three-leg robot that walks and works on the workpiece surface. Due to the elliptical tool vibration, microgrooves can be created on the workpiece surface periodically; meanwhile, the machining force drives the robot to walk forward. Surface texturing experiments are conducted on aluminum and copper workpieces to explore the machining performance of the small robot. The robot can reach a maximum moving velocity of 6.3 mm s −1 and can produce microstructures with a spacing of 4–14 μm on workpiece surfaces. Owing to its unique working principle, the small robot can maintain a constant depth of cut, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to the surface waviness of the workpiece. Finally, the motion straightness of the robot is greatly improved by combining it with the auxiliary track, and multiline microstructures are obtained. In short, the developed small robot presents a promising solution to the challenge of scalable surface texturing.},

  abstract     = {Direct printing methods are widely recognized as efficient techniques for manufacturing printed electronics. However, several challenges arise when printing on nonplanar surfaces, especially using the drop-on-demand (DoD) approach. These challenges include ink flow due to gravity, precise ink deposition, and reproducibility. This study introduces an innovative method for highly accurate DoD material jetting on nonplanar 3D conductive surfaces, enabling precise production and trajectory control of charged droplets. The technique involves using a grounded 3D substrate as the target, where in-flight droplets are subjected to an external electric field generated by gate electrode installed on a piezo activated droplet dispenser. Individual droplets are generated and controlled using a complex trigger system that relays variable-voltage signals to the gate electrode. Moreover, a predictive model for droplet deposition, exhibiting an accuracy of 87%, is developed utilizing supervised machine learning (ML). This approach significantly improves the accuracy and repeatability of droplet deposition. Overall, this study presents an effective method of integrating piezoelectric and electrohydrodynamic printing technologies, complemented by ML. It addresses the challenges associated with printing on nonplanar surfaces using the DoD material jetting technique and shows considerable promise for enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability in the manufacturing of printed electronics.},

This article introduces a bionic soft robot inspired by the star-nosed mole, which combines a pneumatic soft platform with a polydimethylsiloxane–polyethylene terephthalate cylindrical tactile sensor array based on bilayer single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerators, mimicking the muscle tissue of the mole's nose and the cylindrical appendages surrounded by Eimer's organs. The cylindrical sensor array enables multiangle spatial detection without an external power supply and remains unaffected by external materials. By implementing a constant curvature model for robot motion control, positional information is provided for the contact points between the cylindrical sensor array and the external environment. The robot effectively discriminates the distance and shape of various objects and achieves nonvisual 3D spatial detection and reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

This research presents a flexible self-driving laboratory (SDL) designed for the accelerated development and optimization of solid-phase extraction processes. As a use case, the SDL was used to optimize a DNA purification process using silica magnetic beads. Through the integration of robotics, machine learning, and data-driven experimentation, the SDL demonstrates a highly accelerated process optimization with minimal human intervention. In the multistep purification approach, the system is able to optimize buffer compositions for DNA extraction from complex samples, demonstrating effectiveness in both conventional chaotropic salt-based methods and innovative chaotropic salt-free buffers. The study highlights the SDL's capability to autonomously refine process parameters, achieving significant enhancements in yield and purity of the product.

  abstract     = {The lack of a sufficient and efficient way to simultaneously perceive general underwater mechanical stimuli, physical contact, and fluidic flow has been a bottleneck for many aquatic applications. To address this challenge, dynamics-oriented underwater mechanoreceptor interface (DOUMI), a bioinspired mechanoreception system that realizes simultaneous contact and flow perception using a single receptor, is introduced. This receptor, response-elevated-and-expanded hair-like tactile mechanoreceptor (REEM), is inspired by the mechanoreceptive mechanism of aquatic arthropods. REEM combines structural features from different mechanoreceptive sensilla, enabling it to capture a wide range of stimulus dynamics. Under different stimuli, REEM encodes stimuli dynamics as its oscillations with distinct spectral attributes. Those oscillations are efficiently transferred through mechanical processes and imaging, enabling vision-based extraction and further analysis. Therefore, by evaluating the oscillation dynamics with tailored wavelet-based indices, DOUMI can distinguish between contact- and flow-induced oscillations at each receptor unit with 90.5% accuracy. Furthermore, DOUMI provides comprehensive 2D mechanoreception with a scalable array of REEMs, delivering capabilities like stimuli spatiotemporal visualization, flow trend detection, and scenario classification with an accuracy of 99.5%. With its robustness and operational efficiency in underwater environments, DOUMI can be easily adapted to existing applications using common materials and hardware, establishing a new, streamlined paradigm for underwater general mechanoreception.},

The proposed method formulates a time-optimal trajectory using the Pontryagin's maximum principle as a policy. By utilizing a point mass model, the planner generates trajectories that are adaptable to different robot models. The approach incorporates a definition of a search space to guarantee convergence while considering the system limits. Simulation and real-world experiments are performed to validate the feasibility of our method with different configurations. Simulation results compared to a benchmark method demonstrate our approach's superior performance in terms of computational time, achieving near-optimal solutions.

In this approach, a designer specifies a mission that the swarm must perform, and an optimization algorithm searches for the control software that enables the robots to perform the given mission. Traditionally, research in automatic design has focused on missions specified by a single design criterion, adopting methods based on single-objective optimization algorithms. In this study, we investigate whether existing methods can be adapted to address missions specified by concurrent design criteria. We focus on the bi-criteria case. We conduct experiments with a swarm of e-puck robots that must perform sequences of two missions: each mission in the sequence is an independent design criterion that the automatic method must handle during the optimization process. We consider modular and neuroevolutionary methods that aggregate concurrent criteria via the weighted sum, hypervolume, or -norm. We compare their performance with that of Mandarina, an original automatic modular design method. Mandarina integrates Iterated F-race as an optimization algorithm to conduct the design process without aggregating the design criteria. Results from realistic simulations and demonstrations with physical robots show that the best results are obtained with modular methods and when the design criteria are not aggregated.},

To address this issue, a deep learning-based algorithm is developed for suppressing the image noise, grounded in self-supervised learning principles. In contrast to traditional image denoising methods, this approach successfully enhances the visibility of fine details while significantly reducing the noise in the X-ray images. Through this advancement, the potential of the approach for improving the accuracy and interpretability of the TXM-XANES data is demonstrated, thereby enabling more precise detection of nanoscale phenomena such as inhomogeneous cation redox and metal segregation in battery cathode materials.

Furthermore, these fibers can function as artificial muscles in the emerging field of interactive fiber rubber composites. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient method for creating PEDOT-based, biomimetic, fiber-shaped, linearly contracting ionic electroactive polymer actuators. To achieve this, a wet-spinning technique is presented, which enables a continuous production of PEDOT:polystyrene sulfate (PSS) fibers at high production rates of 34 m h −1 , an additional fiber washing step and a sulfuric acid posttreatment step to increase the fibers conductivity. The fibers provide a high conductivity of 1028 S cm −1 , maximum tensile strength reaching 182 MPa, and a maximum elongation of 24%. When utilized as CP actuators in an aqueous sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate electrolyte medium, the fibers demonstrate a repeatable maximum isometric contractile force of 1.64 mN and repeatable linear contractile strain up to 0.56%. Furthermore, a high level of cyclic long-term actuation stability can be demonstrated. Notably, these contractile strains are, to the best of knowledge, the highest reported values for pristine PEDOT:PSS fibers.},

The ML-based model demonstrates outstanding ability to discriminate between PDAC patients and control subjects, with a sensitivity of 90% and an area under the ROC receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 in the training and test groups. Application of the model to an independent validation cohort of 113 PDAC patients confirms its robustness and utility as a diagnosis tool.

Seven major research directions of OSCs are identified.

A donor–acceptor material map of PCE is constructed which provides a road map for OSCs, indicating the bottleneck of this field.

  abstract     = {Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) videos offer valuable histopathologic information about the prostate. Accurate prostate zonal segmentation in TRUS videos is vital for diagnosing prostate cancer and guiding surgery. However, TRUS videos are manually recorded by urologists, resulting in no standardized coordinate system, which limits direct prostate zonal segmentation in these videos. To overcome the limitation, a novel Prostate Zonal Segmentation Network (PZS-Net), based on U-Net, which learns critical cross-frame information and multi-scale features from sequential frames, is proposed. First, a sequential frame cross-attention (SFCA) module is designed to capture remote information from sequential frames to enhance the feature representation of the current frame. The SFCA module is embedded at each skip connection layer to extract crucial cross-frame information. Then, a multi-scale fusion (MSF) module that utilizes three parallel branches with different atrous convolutions is designed. The MSF module is placed at the bottleneck layer to dynamically fuse multi-scale context information from high-level features. Extensive experiments on TRUS image datasets show that the PZS-Net achieves higher accuracy in both the transitional zone (dice coefficient [Dice]: 68.90% ± 1.73%, mean intersection over union [mIoU]: 59.19% ± 2.09%, 95% Hausdorff distance [HD95]: 5.02 ± 0.83 mm) and the peripheral zone (Dice: 63.99% ± 3.16%, mIoU: 54.60% ± 3.35%, HD95: 5.28 ± 1.12 mm) and demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of its key components via comprehensive ablation studies.},

The goal of this article is, therefore, to unravel the strategies to implement different types of intelligence currently adopted in soft robots. A classification is made by making a distinction between agents that adapt to their environment by 1) their adaptive shape, 2) their adaptive functionality, and 3) their adaptive mechanics. Additionally, the perspectives on intelligence based on their computational approach are distinguished: centralized computation, decentralized computation, or embedded computation. It is concluded that a tailored robotic design approach attuned to specific environmental demands is needed. To unlock the full potential of soft robots, a fresh perspective on embodied intelligence is described, so-called mechanical intelligence, emphasizing the robot's responsiveness to changing external conditions of a real-world environment.},

  abstract     = {Direct ink writing, an extrusion-based 3D printing method, is well suited for high-mix low-volume manufacturing. However, an iterative approach, using random selection or constant expert guidance, is still used to create printable inks and optimize printing parameters by expending significant amounts of time, materials, and effort. Herein, a machine learning (ML) model that estimates ink rheology in-situ from a simple printed test pattern is reported. This ML model is trained with a rheologically diverse set of inks composed of different polymers. The model successfully correlated features of the simple printed test pattern to rheological properties, which could, in theory, inform both printed structures and future ink compositions. The behavior of this model is verified and analyzed with explainable artificial intelligence tools, linking printed feature importance to one's known physical understanding of the process.},

The tactile visualization can provide high-precision and multimodal force information to promote robotic dexterous manipulation development. Considering VTS's contribution to force measurement, this article reviews the advanced force measurement technologies of VTSs. First, the working principle of marker-type VTSs is introduced, including single-layer markers, double-layer markers, color coding, and optical flow. Then, the relationship between the marker type and the category of force measurement is discussed in detail. On this basis, the process of marker feature extraction is summarized, including image processing and marker-matching technologies. According to the learning approach, force measurement methods are classified into physical and deep learning models. Further, branches of each method are analyzed in terms of input types. Combined with measuring range and precision, the correlation of sensor design, materials, and recognition methods to force measurement performance is further discussed. Finally, the difficulties and challenges are analyzed, and future developments are proposed.

  abstract     = {Particle-jamming soft grippers demonstrate notable shape adaptability and adjustable stiffness, which improve their grasping efficiency. However, integrating tactile sensing into these grippers presents challenges due to the specific properties of the particle jamming mechanism. This study introduces a parallel particle jamming soft gripper equipped with tactile sensing capabilities. The gripper consists of two tactile sensing particle jamming pads (TSPJPs) that are integrated with flexible optoelectronic skins. These skins are made of silicone rubber membranes and are embedded with a 3 × 3 array of stretchable optical waveguide arrays (SOWAs). Testing indicates that incorporating these sensors enhances the gripper's tactile sensing capabilities, with minimal impact on its particle jamming-based grasping function. A single TSPJP can accurately detect various contact points and estimate the contract forces. The proposed soft gripper can reliably grasp a wide range of objects, varying in shape, hardness, and weight, and it provides detailed tactile feedback on contact locations and the intensity of the grasping through the SOWA sensor. It can precisely distinguish between different grasping postures using a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) learning model. Furthermore, it can effectively detect the slippage of grasped objects, facilitating accurate closed-loop control for secure manipulation.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of information systems in all areas of society demands more powerful, efficient, and low-energy consumption computing systems. Neuromorphic engineering has emerged as a solution that attempts to mimic the brain to incorporate its capabilities to solve complex problems in a computationally and energy-efficient way in real time. Within neuromorphic computing, building systems to efficiently store the information is still a challenge. Among all the brain regions, the hippocampus stands out as a short-term memory capable of learning and recalling large amounts of information quickly and efficiently. Herein, a spike-based bio-inspired hippocampus sequential memory model is proposed that makes use of the benefits of analog computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs): noise robustness, improved real-time operation, and energy efficiency. This model is applied to robotic navigation to learn and recall trajectories that lead to a goal position within a known grid environment. The model is implemented on the special-purpose SNNs mixed-signal DYNAP-SE hardware platform. Through extensive experimentation together with an extensive analysis of the model's behavior in the presence of external noise sources, its correct functioning is demonstrated, proving the robustness and consistency of the proposed neuromorphic sequential memory system.},

Traditional pneumatic suction cups rely on bulky and noisy vacuum sources and need for preloading while electrostatic adhesion-detachment devices generally cannot provide enough adhesion force. To address these shortcomings, a liquid-amplified electrostatically driven suction cup is proposed inspired by octopus's sucker, including a negative pressure chamber with a wrinkle-like membrane and a sealing ring. The negative pressure chamber generates the active adhesion force enhanced by the wrinkle-like membrane, increasing the adhesion strength tenfold compared to pure electrostatic adhesion. The suction cup proposed herein has a remarkable capacity to generate an adhesion force of 56.4 times its weight, without preloading. Additionally, it can adapt to different materials, not only the dry but also the oil-contaminated ones. This presented liquid-amplified electrostatically driven suction cup can offer enhanced adhesion performance for applications in challenging environments.},

  abstract     = {Accurately identifying user needs in terms of assist timing and magnitude presents challenges for wearable power-assist limb devices. Traditional approaches to gait perception—such as estimating joint angles and walking conditions—often rely on electronic sensors and neural networks, which can compromise wearability and impose high computational demands. Physical reservoir computing (PRC), which utilizes the inherent nonlinearity of physical systems for data processing, offers a promising alternative. This study proposes a novel self-estimated physical reservoir computing (SEPRC) model that improves traditional PRC models for gait perception using a wearable pneumatic physical reservoir. A core feature of the new model is the self-estimation structure, wherein the outputs of the physical reservoir are mutually estimated. Experimental evaluations indicate that the SEPRC model outperforms traditional PRC in clustering time-series reservoir output sequences with the same dimensionality. This enhanced clustering performance is subsequently leveraged in gait perception by incorporating Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy logic for joint angle estimation and a softmax activation function for walking condition recognition. The newly proposed time-sequence processing approach facilitates the traditional PRC model to achieve higher accuracy in gait perception and greater robustness against the user's walking pattern variations while preserving PRC's hardware simplicity.},

  abstract     = {Soft tactile sensors are soft and sufficiently flexible for attachment to a robot's gripper to enhance human-like sensory capabilities. However, existing tactile sensors exhibit large size and a limited force measurement range. This article presents a novel design of a new soft tactile sensor for a robotic gripper, incorporating a sandwich-like multilayered structure, together with a deep learning (DL) model, which overcomes the limitations of traditional sensors. The structure consists of three distinct layers: a 15 wt% iron magnetorheological elastomer, a flexible printable circuit board layer equipped with three-dimensional Hall sensors (TLE493D; Infineon), and permanent magnets. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network that can classify the loading state is adopted for the DL model. This new tactile sensor is capable of performing three distinct functions simultaneously: measurement of normal forces up to 3.73 kgf, identification of the precise location of force occurrence by subdivision into intervals of 2.5 mm, and differentiation between a wide (≈8 mm) and narrow (≈2 mm) contacted surface area. This newly developed soft tactile sensor has considerable potential for improvement in the performance of robotic grippers through its high accuracy, resolution, and large measurement range, as demonstrated by experimentation with the sensor attached to a real gripper.},

However, physical origami robots possess inherent material compliance and mechanical imperfections, presenting challenges in modeling and redundant actuation for accurate control of all degree of freedom (DoF). Herein, a data-driven kinematic modeling approach tailored for physical origami robots to effectively address the inherent compliance is introduced. This approach is applied to a multiloop origami spherical joint, which features a minimalistic design comprising two parallel waterbomb structures. This design allows for the integration of four actuators, thereby enabling full control over the structure's three DoF and its inherent compliance. It is demonstrated that a small dataset is adequate for accurately learning the forward kinematics, which then informs an optimization-based inverse kinematics. Additionally, through trajectory tracking experiments, it is verified that the modeling method is both rapid and accurate, making it suitable for real-time applications. To showcase a practical application, the joint and its models are utilized as a force feedback origami joystick, designed for intuitive drone control. This joystick offers an enhanced control experience and conveys crucial information about collisions and external forces to drone operators. Overall, the data-driven modeling approach introduces a new possibility of designing controllable compliant interfaces.},

AI-driven CBLs can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than human scientists at lower costs, achieving results in weeks rather than years.

AI-driven misinformation in research highlights the need for transparency and data integrity, which may be achieved by aligning incentivizes and engineered fail-safes to promote long-term human flourishing. To mitigate risks, strict compartmentalization of AI systems and CBLs with third-party supervision at fine temporal resolutions will be necessary.
