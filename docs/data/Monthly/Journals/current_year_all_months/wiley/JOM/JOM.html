  abstract     = {Although the spread of misinformation on centralized social media platforms has received significant attention, few studies compare centralized and decentralized platforms, and how to mitigate misinformation diffusion in newly emerging blockchain-based decentralized social network platforms. We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent-based simulations leveraging real-world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.},

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of vampire attack, a unique platform entry strategy in the blockchain ecosystem, on the operational performance of the incumbent platform. During the vampire attack period, the entrant (attacker) clones the incumbent platform and offers tokenized incentives to entice users away from the incumbent. Prior studies offer little insight into the impact of vampire attack strategy because of its uniqueness in platform cloning, tokenized incentives, and targeted attacks. We implement a quasi-experimental design by leveraging the first and most famous vampire attack launched by SushiSwap (the attacker) against Uniswap (the incumbent). We examine both the deposit-side and exchange-side impacts of the vampire attack on the operational performance of the liquidity pools on Uniswap. Surprisingly, we find that the vampire attack has no significant effect on the liquidity provision on the deposit side. Even more surprisingly, the vampire attack significantly increases the incumbent's trading volume on the exchange side. We further uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to these intriguing results. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the novel tokenized incentives strategy. We show the generalizability of our findings by examining an alternative vampire attack event in the context of non-fungible token marketplaces. Our study offers significant contributions to the literature on the implications of blockchain on platform operations and platform competition in operations management.},

  abstract     = {In the burgeoning marketplaces of digital assets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) revolutionize digital asset ownership and intellectual property (IP) protection, but high minting costs create barriers to marketplace entry and growth. This study examines the impact of “lazy minting,” a new NFT production method introduced by major NFT marketplaces to lower minting costs by deferring blockchain certification until the first sale. In response to the call for further research on emerging technologies in operations management, we explore how this policy affects the net sales performance of existing sellers in the NFT marketplaces. Based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the literature about different IP protection methods, we distinguish between lazy- and regular-minted NFTs by their differential transaction costs and utilize the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to conduct our analysis. We find that lazy minting adoption significantly boosts the net sales performance of existing sellers. This is attributed to their cost-adaptive IP protection behavior. Specifically, they achieve this by minting more NFTs with a larger proportion of style-consistent NFTs through lazy minting, while strategically employing regular minting for style-breaking NFTs, which is contingent upon their reputation. Our study has important theoretical and practical implications for operations management under the emerging technological revolution.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO-enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data from Steemit that captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power-up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi-experimental setting. Employing the PSM-DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management.},

  abstract     = {This study examines how task assignment mechanisms affect the participation of workers on decentralized blockchains. In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third-party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof-of-work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof-of-stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper-competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference-in-differences research design confirm my arguments.},

  abstract     = {Smart contracts, enabled by blockchain technology, are increasingly adopted by firms to automate the execution of agreements or contracts without the involvement of intermediaries. However, it is still unclear how smart contracts may affect firms' operational efficiency. We address this issue empirically by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the United States in which certain states have enacted relevant laws that increase in-state firms' propensity to adopt and use smart contracts. Our difference-in-differences estimation suggests that compared with out-of-state control firms, in-state treatment firms' operational efficiency increases significantly after the enactment of smart contract laws. Our post hoc analysis further suggests that state-level smart contract laws help increase in-state firms' actual smart contract activities, which in turn lead to operational efficiency improvement. We also find that the operational efficiency improvement varies across firms with different supply chain complexities. While firms with a large number of supply chain partners (i.e., high horizontal complexity) gain more operational efficiency improvement, the improvement becomes less pronounced if firms' supply chain partners are distributed across different countries (i.e., high spatial complexity). Overall, our research not only demonstrates smart contracts' ability to improve operational efficiency but also reveals the critical role of supply chain complexity in affecting the operational efficiency improvement.},

However, their decentralized architecture may conflict with the centralized control exercised by platform sponsors, giving rise to a centralization–decentralization paradox. This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain-based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in-depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept of semirigid limits to capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms.},

Why are enterprise blockchain adoptions highly susceptible to failure? In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high-performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision-making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low-performing cases struggle due to within-blockchain exploration and decentralized decision-making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes.},

Insight from the intra -organizational leadership literature suggests that an effective inter -organizational leadership model could help address project-level coordination challenges. Adopting an agency theory view complemented by role theory, this study examines the antecedents and outcomes of rotational leadership (i.e., shifting leadership roles in a process) in a buyer NPD project involving suppliers. The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between rotational leadership and project performance by analyzing a paired sample of quantitative and qualitative data for 279 NPD projects. In a post hoc qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study triangulates quantitative results using interview data, showing that buyers adopt boundary buffering to address potential rotational leadership risks while achieving high project performance. Both buyer risk-taking and supplier relationship-specific investments contribute to the emergence of rotational leadership. These results enrich supplier involvement in the NPD literature by demonstrating (1) when rotational leadership emerges and (2) how it affects project performance. The findings also provide managerial implications for leadership role arrangements and boundary-buffering decisions in the context of collaborative innovation in the supply chain.},

Traditionally, firms have focused on incorporating common product characteristics from a single market segment (e.g., genre) to minimize potential penalties associated with ambiguous product identities. However, recent trends show that “crossover” products, those that integrate distinctive features from multiple segments, have emerged due to their superior performance. Developing such innovative products requires profound expertise across multiple market segments, especially when supply chain partners collaborate. While prior research has explored the market performance of crossover products, it has offered limited understanding of the conditions required for their development. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in the input–output perspective of operations management, which examines how portfolio similarity between partners influences the ease of expertise reconfiguration and the breadth of segment-spanning expertise needed for crossover product development. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between portfolio similarity and the degree of crossover, suggesting that moderate similarity fosters the most effective reconfiguration of expertise. Further, we find that collaboration experience with the partner moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship.},

  abstract     = {How does the development of Analytics Capability (AC) of a firm influence its supply chain performance? With increasing numbers of firms adopting data analytics to enhance their supply chains and overall performance, this question has become particularly important. To answer the question, this study proposes and tests three dominant supply chain capabilities (integration, flexibility, and resilience) as key mechanisms through which AC is linked with operational performance. We use 405 effect sizes reported in 174 prior empirical studies based on data gathered from 104,296 informants to draw insights using a meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach. The theory developed herein contributes to the literature by demonstrating that integration, flexibility, and resilience mediate the association between AC and operational performance, which in turn affects customer service performance. Specifically, a substantial degree of variance in the effects of AC on operational performance is mediated by integration, flexibility, and resilience, respectively. We also find that the effect size for the association between AC and operational performance is higher in developing economies, while the link between operational performance and customer service performance is higher in developed economies. Our analyses are robust to several empirical challenges, including (a) common method bias, (b) outliers, (c) endogeneity, and (d) journal quality, attesting to the stability of the findings. Overall, our results suggest that supply chain integration, flexibility, and resilience are key domains of managerial and theoretical focus for implementing firms' data analytics initiatives, reinforcing the role of the supply chain in leveraging data analytics capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The concept of “chained vulnerability” addresses the cyberattack risks for organizations through interconnected internal and external actors (e.g., employees and suppliers). As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID-19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co-evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co-evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception-based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability-based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi-structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability.},

  abstract     = {Contributing to emerging research on corporate governance and operations management, our study examines the connection between board diversity and workplace safety. We propose that boards with a higher representation of female directors prioritize and thus enhance workplace safety due to women's distinct social-cognitive perspectives on stakeholders, risk avoidance, and regulatory compliance. We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm-year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation. Our findings deepen our understanding of how board diversity interacts with situational factors to influence operational outcomes.},

Even in possession of ideal CB-PM policies, imperfect adherence can lead to higher equipment downtime, maintenance costs, and increased safety hazards. Here, we describe a normative model of optimal CB-PM policy determination; specifically, a generalized means by which to determine a valuemaximizing quality threshold as a guideline for triggering PM (preventative maintenance). Motivated by field data, we consider the opportunity cost of not adhering to such optimal policies; that is, premature or delayed responses. We design and execute a controlled laboratory study, exposing participants to two critical manipulations that we theorize might influence adherence: (1) The presence of a supplemental secondary signal, of a type common to time-based preventive maintenance (TB-PM), (2) a pre-task priming intended to emphasize the value of discretized task completion. Results showed that the combination of CB-PM and TB-PM signals, along with completion priming, significantly increases adherence to CB-PM guidelines. We demonstrate that individuals exposed to this combination of treatments forfeit far less value than those receiving CB-PM signals alone.},

  abstract     = {Stroke is a highly time-sensitive medical emergency, and earlier treatment is crucial. Drawing on Temporal Motivation Theory, we investigate a “deadline effect” in stroke care and analyze how two deadlines, that is, a medically oriented one (administering Tissue Plasminogen Activator, TPA, within 4.5 h of symptom onset) and a goal-oriented one (the 60-min in-hospital target from Target : Stroke ), shape care consistency. We define a deadline effect as a variable task processing rate under time pressure from a pending task completion deadline, which can cause inconsistent care. Clinicians may work more slowly when patients arrive soon after symptom onset, given ample time remains before the 4.5-h TPA window. Using an accelerated-failure-time model and addressing patient selection bias, we find that shorter onset-to-door times correlate with longer door-to-needle times, and vice versa, confirming the medically oriented deadline effect. As a result, care time may vary considerably based on how much of the TPA window remains. Under Target : Stroke , a goal-driven national initiative in the United States to improve stroke care quality, stroke teams face an additional 60-min in-hospital deadline. Our findings show that the initiative prompts stroke teams to prioritize the tighter goal and maintain a more consistent care pace, regardless of patients' arrival times. Our mechanism analyses reveal two boundary conditions for the main findings: (i) when the downstream time segment ends with a mid-point patient care milestone rather than the strict TPA administration deadline or (ii) when the system congestion level is high, the main findings do not hold, advancing the deadline effect literature from an operational standpoint. Furthermore, our major findings are robust to other confounding factors and model assumptions, ruling out alternative explanations. Notably, post hoc analyses confirm that Target : Stroke fosters consistent time performance without adversely affecting other health outcomes, advocating its efficacy. In sum, we highlight the operational implications of multiple deadlines in stroke care, extending the broader deadline effect literature. For hospital clinicians, properly set goals can stabilize care processes and strengthen overall performance, emphasizing the strategic value of well-designed deadlines in time-critical healthcare settings.},

Viewing back-end fulfillment operations in omni-channel grocery retail as a complex adaptive system, we present an eight-year multi-method case study of the UK operations of a leading global grocery retailer. Over this period the share of online sales significantly grew as proportion of overall sales. We observe four evolutions in the back-end fulfillment complex adaptive system to respond to the operational demands associated with increasing online sales. Complex adaptive systems theory suggests that such evolutions should eventually lead to a state of equilibrium, where the system is reconfigured to effectively and efficiently respond to the market. However, we observe that this equilibrium was never achieved and propose this results from two opposing and irreconcilable environmental energies preventing optimal adaptation. Drawing on both in-depth interviews and a proprietary fulfillment dataset from the organization, we expose the implications of conflicting energies being imported from the environment, and propose three strategies, drawn from paradox theory, for reconciling these energies within a complex adaptive system.},

Our experimental observations show deviations from normative optimality, and we find a contrast in the ordering behavior in NBR and BR settings. Compared to the respective normative optimal quantities, in the NBR setting, retailers overorder in the low-profit margin and underorder in the high-profit margin conditions, whereas, in the BR setting, consistent underordering is observed in both the low and high-profit margin conditions. Next, we employ a dynamic panel regression model driven by the demand-chasing heuristic to capture the ordering pattern. Finally, we develop a prospect theoretic model to describe the underordering behavior observed in the BR setting and find that the reference point plays a key role.

Drawing upon signaling theory, this paper examines how a social characteristic of a coupon (i.e., group consumption) influences coupon acquisition and subsequent coupon redemption, along with how such relationships are further influenced by offline agglomeration (i.e., density and product agglomeration). Specifically, we argue that group consumption increases coupon acquisition, which in turn increases coupon redemption, with coupon acquisition serving as a mediator in the relationship. These relationships, however, are contingent upon offline agglomeration signals. Using a large panel data set from a prominent group buying platform, we collect 121,909 observations to test our theoretical model. The findings reveal a positive relationship between group consumption and coupon acquisition and a positive relationship between coupon acquisition and redemption, while the relationship between group consumption and coupon redemption is fully mediated by coupon acquisition. Furthermore, we find that the effect of group consumption on coupon acquisition is strengthened by density agglomeration but attenuated by product agglomeration. The effect of coupon acquisition on redemption is reinforced by density agglomeration. These findings offer valuable implications for local merchants who are seeking to optimize their coupon promotions.},

  abstract     = {An abiding preoccupation for firms is understanding how customers value their products versus competitors' products. This is difficult to quantify and estimate from data as, even if competitor prices are public information, their sales are typically unobservable. However, in some industries, most prominently the hotel industry, third-party information brokers collect and supply aggregate competitor sales information. In the hotel industry, these reports from Smith Travel Research, popularly known as STR reports, are widely subscribed to. Hotels participate by reporting their sales information and, in turn, obtain access to marginal competitor sales data, in the form of daily occupancy percentage, albeit aggregated across groups and lengths-of-stay. Despite its availability, this data is not widely incorporated into revenue management estimation, likely due to the lack of robust models and methodologies. In this paper, focusing mainly on the hotel industry, we develop a constrained maximum likelihood method (constrained by moment conditions) to overcome the following significant challenges in estimation of a market share model with a competitor attractiveness factor: (i) competitor data is aggregated across multiple lengths-of-stay with varying demand characteristics; (ii) no-purchase data is unobservable, preventing tracking of customers who choose neither the focal firm's (we refer to as our) product nor the competitor's product; (iii) private (unobserved) group sales of competitors prior to retail sales reduce competitor capacity and influence their subsequent prices; and finally, (iv) maximizing the partial-information likelihood function is intractable. We first evaluate our method through Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data generated under a generalized Nash competition model. In these simulations, our method accurately recovers the true parameters to a close degree in almost all cases, exploiting the marginal competitor data. Next, we apply the method to real-world hotel booking data and benchmark its performance against alternative approaches from the network tomography and revenue management literature.},

Our empirically grounding analytics motivate a firm-level proxy for downscale operating flexibility (FLEX), which effectively captures the adjustment frictions across different contexts of firms' operations. Using U.S. data between 1961 and 2020, we show that operating flexibility mitigates the risk of stock price crashes, especially during periods of economic recession. Consistent with the loss-curtailment mechanism, the operating flexibility effect is more pronounced for firms with lower productivity/profitability or higher operating leverage and is further amplified during longer and more severe recessions. Managers may avail themselves of our well-tested empirical measure of operating flexibility to guide their efforts in building a more resilient operations structure.},

This study uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model these decisions, revealing the importance of the final weeks in profit management. The MDP's intractability due to the curse of dimensionality leads us to employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for optimization. Using real-world and synthetic data, our DRL model outperforms existing practices. However, it lacks interpretability, hindering trust and legal compliance in the food industry. To address this, we introduce “managerial learning,” extracting actionable insights from DRL outputs using classification trees that would have been difficult to obtain otherwise. We leverage these insights to devise a smart heuristic that significantly beats the heuristic currently used in practice. This study has broader implications for operations management, where DRL can solve complex dynamic optimization problems that are often intractable due to dimensionality. By applying methods, such as classification trees and DRL, one can scrutinize solutions for actionable managerial insights that can enhance existing practices with straightforward planning guidelines.},

To this end, we examined a supply network in Mato Grosso, Brazil, that faced power asymmetries through 49 semi-structured interviews, field observations, and archival data. The analysis unveiled three forms of power use—excessive, strategic, and balanced—and associated tactics, impacting justice and sustainability outcomes in various ways. We illustrate, for example, how excessive power manifested in traders' abusive tactics, who compelled farmers to accept quality discounts due to external factors, such as heavy rain or poor road conditions. In response to these injustices, farmers cascaded the pressure through the supply network, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged actors, for instance, by withholding rural workers' wages for low productivity or eradicating wildlife deemed detrimental to profitability. Based on these findings, we provide a set of six propositions and a theoretical model that elucidate how power can be leveraged to foster fairer and more sustainable agricultural commodity supply networks.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the implementation and transfer of sustainable agricultural practices (SUSAPs) across a multitier agrifood supply chain (SC) using Brazilian poultry farming as the empirical context. We conduct an interpretive case study of buyer–supplier–subsupplier triads, including those certified under Global Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and noncertified counterparts, using interviews, observations, and secondary data. Adopting a sociomaterial perspective, we investigate how SUSAPs' components—meanings, materials, and competencies—are embedded within specific SC tiers and transferred across the triad. A zoom-in analysis reveals that only animal welfare is a fully adopted practice, whereas waste management, working conditions, and biosecurity remain in development as protopractices. A zoom-out analysis of SUSAPs' components shows limited buyer influence across the triad, while first-tier suppliers facilitate SUSAP transfer. We advance theory by demonstrating how a sociomaterial perspective explains the degree of SUSAPs' implementation and transfer, and introducing the boomerang effect , illustrating how first-tier suppliers enable SUSAP implementation among certified and noncertified subsuppliers to ensure safer and more sustainable products. These insights help managers transfer SUSAPs into their SCs by leveraging first-tier suppliers as boundary spanners.},

Therefore, it is important to personalize chronic care treatment to improve chronic care outcomes. We propose a decision framework for the predictive management of diabetes that can help reduce the population-level risk of diabetes. We use machine learning on clinical measures, demographics, and socioeconomic status of a large patient population from a chain of clinics in the Midwestern United States to predict the future health conditions of individual diabetes patients. Furthermore, we use the predictive analytic model outcome to build a decision analytic framework to optimally allocate encounters to individual patients. Also, we propose a heuristic solution to the optimal resource allocation model for implementation purposes. We make theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying and combining clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors to predict future diabetes risk for patients and demonstrate the use of the predicted risks for optimal resource utilization. Another significant contribution is demonstrating that a data-driven predictive encounter allocation, considering the socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing health risks across patient populations, can promote more equitable healthcare delivery. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and actions.},

This study investigates the impact of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, which provide synthesized evidence and pharmacogenetics-based drug dosing recommendations, on the delivery of psychiatric care enabled by precision medicine. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of CPIC guidelines on serious drug-related adverse events and explore how drug characteristics related to therapeutic uncertainty, namely drug age and drug label warning, moderate this effect. Our findings suggest that the availability of CPIC guidelines is associated with almost a 25% decrease in serious drug-related adverse events in the context of psychiatric care delivery enabled by precision medicine. Furthermore, we find that the presence of drug label warning, as FDA-endorsed negative news on pharmacogenetics-related drug use, enhances the effect of CPIC guidelines and is associated with a further decrease in serious drug-related adverse events. Post hoc analysis reveals that CPIC guidelines with high strength of evidence are associated with a significant decrease in serious drug-related adverse events, while no such effect is observed for guidelines with low strength of evidence. These findings contribute to the nascent literature on integrating precision medicine into routine clinical practice, highlighting the consequential role of clinical guidelines in improving the effectiveness of psychiatric care delivery for individual patients enabled by precision medicine. In addition, by demonstrating how the development and implementation of robust clinical guidelines are central to minimizing serious drug-related adverse events, the findings have policy implications for minimizing the downside risks of psychiatric care delivery.},

We examine diversion risk in the context of prescription opioid sales in the United States. We ask how supply base attributes and nonprofit ownership influence the creation of opioid diversion risk. We use performance-outcome expectancy theory to hypothesize that pharmacies organize supply bases to help them avoid negative evaluations and that nonprofit ownership alters expectancy concerning legal but questionable behavior. We develop and test multilevel hypotheses explaining how supply base complexity, chain size, and nonprofit ownership influence diversion risk. Our analysis of DEA data from 2006 to 2019 finds that after accounting for other attributes, supply base complexity is positively related to diversion risk, within and between firms. Retail chain size is negatively related to diversion risk in the within-firm model, but positively in the between firm model. Testing our nonprofit hypothesis reveals that nonprofit pharmacies also use size and supply base complexity to manage diversion risk. This research sheds light on the dynamics of diversion risk in pharmaceutical supply chains. It has practical implications for the industry, potentially informing future policy and practice addressing this critical issue.},

While previous research has investigated the causes and effects of drug shortages, there is a dearth of research exploring potential solutions to mitigate this problem. Using a system dynamics model of the US generic drug market, we evaluate the long-term effectiveness of two existing policy interventions (expediting drug approvals and nudging manufacturers to ramp up their production) and the “quality reward” initiative that is being actively explored by the FDA and industry. Our results indicate that while the existing interventions can be helpful in addressing shortages, their long-term effect seems limited. In contrast, quality reward can mitigate drug shortages in a sustainable way. However, a caveat of quality reward is the potential emergence of a monopolistic supply market with negative consequences. We suggest that a carefully designed quality disclosure mechanism can address this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively and comparatively evaluate the long-term effectiveness of quality reward and other interventions on drug shortages and provide structural explanations for their performance.},

A unique aspect of the R&D consortia is that they integrate knowledge across product, production, and supply chain domains. This paper uses network ethnography as the methodology—in combining social network analysis with ethnographic methods—while drawing on a 10-year dataset on the evolution of pre-competitive collaboration networks in pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing deploying digital technologies. Our analysis reveals mechanisms through which design rules for products and processes are developed and converged across product, production, and supply chain domains. Specifically, we show that design rules, which are both “set-based” and “trans-specialized”, are the key mechanisms that enable heterogeneous specialist stakeholders to exchange knowledge and facilitate the convergence of development efforts. Second, we highlight the roles of boundary spanners and institutional actors (i.e., academia and regulatory bodies) in steering dialogues towards the convergence of design rules in early-stage R&D settings. The theoretical implications of these findings are not only germane to pharmaceutical drug development networks but also to early-stage product and technology development networks at large.},

In response, this study aims to address these two challenges by examining the effects of real-time demands and restaurant density on delivery reliability, as well as how the type of driver (i.e., in-house versus crowdsourced drivers) moderates these effects. We evaluated our model with a unique dataset obtained from one of the top three on-demand meal delivery platforms in China, and our research sheds light on several key findings. Specifically, our study finds inverted U-shaped relationships between real-time demands and delivery reliability and a positive relationship between restaurant density and delivery reliability. In addition, it reveals that crowdsourced drivers perform better than in-house drivers under high real-time demands. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying how delivery reliability can be influenced by real-time demands and restaurant density.

While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation-based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end-to-end framework for creating data-driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention.},

We perform a quasi-experiment using consumer spending data from retailer, target, and delivery platform, Shipt. We find that PDA provides positive impacts to the delivery platform through increased sales. IDA, on the other hand, increases the retailer's online channel sales but does not impact the delivery platform's sales. Moreover, we find that the positive effects of PDA on the delivery platform's sales are stronger in markets where online grocery penetration is lower, indicating that the effects were likely driven by increased purchases for groceries. Finally, the positive effect of IDA on the retailer's online channel sales is stronger in markets where the retailer has a greater loyal customer base and online grocery penetration is lower.},

This research examines how warehouses use last-minute coordination, an unstructured mechanism, to ensure sufficient inventory at the order penetration points. Previous research has focused on structured mechanisms like contracts and inventory management systems to enhance warehouse performance. However, these mechanisms can be ineffective when faced with unforeseen local contingencies. To adjust inventory and adapt to changes in supply and/or demand, warehouses need to engage in unstructured, last-minute coordination with other warehouses. Using coordination and loose coupling theories, we find that coordinating with many warehouses (i.e., large coordination scope) reduces the operational efficiency of individual warehouses. At the network level, we find that a centralized coordination structure improves the operational efficiency of the entire network. We also show that demand uncertainty reinforces the existing last-minute coordination patterns, using the Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM). This research highlights the importance of last-minute coordination and reveals its effects on both individual warehouses and the overall network.},

  abstract     = {The innovation literature has been marked by contrarian views regarding the roles of firms' knowledge accumulation with regards to outsourced core components. To reconcile these views, we draw on the behavioral theory of the firm and the technological evolution literature in hypothesizing firms' local search as a mechanism by which firms' accumulated knowledge affects their product performance. Firms' in-house knowledge can expose them to an accumulated knowledge trap , as firms' accumulated knowledge tends to escalate their local search for a solution to a new technological challenge, but the impact of the local search on performance is unlikely to be materialized. We maintain that firms' accumulated knowledge can make them more prone to the accumulated knowledge trap before rather than after the dominant technology has emerged. We further hypothesize that prior exploratory experiences and suppliers' outsourced component knowledge can reduce firms' susceptibility to such a knowledge trap before the dominant technology emergence, but their moderating roles fade away after the dominant technology emergence. Data from the U.S. Hybrid Electric Vehicle drivetrain market support our hypotheses. Our findings enrich the current literatures on the behavioral theory of the firm and technological evolution while reconciling the contrarian views in the innovation literature.},

  abstract     = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have experienced sustained impacts from unprecedented complex disruptions in different combinations and at different times. From an efficiency perspective, do these complex supply chain disruptions call for more complex risk management strategies? To answer this, we built an empirically grounded discrete event simulation model, the results of which were analyzed using data envelopment analysis. Results show that with unprecedented complex disruption patterns, a multi-strategy portfolio approach is usually less efficient than a single-strategy or a do-nothing approach unless the strategy portfolio has certain characteristics. The most efficient strategy portfolios typically consist of a moderate number of diverse strategies. Too many strategies in a portfolio can be problematic, leading to increased costs that outpace improvement in revenue and service level. Results illustrate that even a strategy that generally performs poorly can be part of a very good strategy portfolio and vice versa. This study provides nuanced and novel findings that contribute to the resolution of the literature debate about the value of multi-strategy portfolios in addressing complex disruption patterns. Highlighting the value of a strategy portfolio view, these insights help firms better prepare for the next complex and sustained global supply chain disruptions.},

  abstract     = {Retailers face a challenging trade-off in maintaining versus restricting long-established lenient return policies. On the one hand, lenient return policies have become an important part of retailers' value propositions and play a significant role in stimulating consumer purchases. On the other hand, lenient return policies increase the volume of product returns, which hurts profitability. Motivated by observing an increase in restrictive changes to long-established lenient return policies, we investigate consumer reactions to such changes and their managerial implications. Through a series of experiments with diverse consumer samples, we find that restrictive changes, such as shortening return time windows or introducing restocking fees, decrease consumer trust in retailers and lead to lowered purchase, positive word-of-mouth, and loyalty intentions. We also find that providing managerial transparency, in the form of communicating the rationale for restrictive changes, can attenuate the negative consumer reactions to such changes. Moreover, rationales that emphasize the cost of handling returns versus blaming opportunistic and abusive returners are similarly effective. Our findings contribute to the growing academic literature on consumer return policy design and provide actionable insights to retail managers.},

  abstract     = {We investigate how innovation intermediaries address shortfalls in the capabilities that buyers and suppliers must have to access each other's knowledge for innovation purposes, also referred to as indirect capabilities. Prior research on supplier-enabled innovation has identified various capabilities that buyers need in order to collaborate with innovative suppliers. It recognizes that suppliers also require capabilities to access buyer knowledge. However, we still know little about the role of innovation intermediaries—actors who are neither buyers nor suppliers, but still influence innovation processes and outcomes in supply networks. Our case-based research shows that intermediaries create workspaces for R&D and experimentation, help to refine definitions of requirements and de-risk novel solutions, support contracting, and facilitate solution implementation. We contribute to research on supplier innovation by developing a model of intermediaries' activities and underlying capabilities, and their impact on innovation sourcing outcomes. We elaborate the indirect capabilities theoretical perspective by introducing additional types of indirect capabilities for collaborative innovation in supply chains, and showing how these capabilities interrelate. We furthermore extend the literature on innovation intermediaries by elucidating hitherto unexplored capabilities for intermediation and adding insights regarding the contribution of intermediaries to open innovation processes.},

  abstract     = {Research in healthcare suggests that repeated interaction between a provider and a patient can support better decision-making, resulting in improved efficiencies. To date, these repeated interactions enabling continuity of care have not been studied in hospital inpatient settings. During a hospital stay, decisions related to patient treatment are usually made by two key decision-makers: the attending physician (AP) and the operating physician (OP). Under the single decision-making approach (S-DMA), the AP and OP are the same; in contrast, under the dual decision-making approach (D-DMA), the AP and OP are different. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend toward the use of D-DMA over S-DMA across U.S. hospitals owing to scheduling conflicts. Although research outside healthcare operations management has argued for benefits from both approaches, their impacts on a patient's hospital stay are unclear. In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effects of S-DMA and D-DMA on patient care outcomes in terms of patient length of stay (LOS), treatment cost, and mortality. Data for our study come from the state of Florida and involve 520,554 cardiology patients treated by 9483 APs and 18,398 OPs at 241 hospitals between 2014 and 2016. We account for both patient and physician selection issues when choosing a particular decision-making strategy. Our results suggest that, on average, using S-DMA is associated with reduced patient LOS and treatment cost but has no effect on mortality. We also find that S-DMA is more beneficial for patients with low comorbidity and low process uncertainty, whereas D-DMA is more beneficial for patients with high comorbidity and high process uncertainty. Our results are robust to alternative explanations. We demonstrate that a single decision-maker offers benefits in the context of healthcare delivery, but dual decision-makers may yield benefits when caring for patients with high comorbidity and high process complexity. We discuss the implications of these findings for appropriately deploying S-DMA and D-DMA in inpatient services.},
