  abstract     = {The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes over a thousand new vulnerabilities monthly, with a projected 25 percent increase in 2024, highlighting the crucial need for rapid vulnerability identification to mitigate cybersecurity attacks and save costs and resources. In this work, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to learn vulnerability evaluation from historical assessments of medical device vulnerabilities in a single manufacturer's portfolio. We highlight the effectiveness and challenges of using LLMs for automatic vulnerability evaluation and introduce a method to enrich historical data with cybersecurity ontologies, enabling the system to understand new vulnerabilities without retraining the LLM. Our LLM system integrates with the in-house application—Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)—to help Siemens Healthineers (SHS) product cybersecurity experts efficiently assess the vulnerabilities in our products. Also, we present a comprehensive set of experiments that helps showcase the properties of the LLM and dataset, the various guardrails we have implemented to safeguard the system in production, and the guidelines for efficient integration of LLMs into the cybersecurity tool.},

  abstract     = {This paper extends our previously published work on the virtual AI teacher (VATE) system, presented at IAAI-25. VATE is designed to autonomously analyze and correct student errors in mathematical problem-solving using advanced large language models (LLMs). By incorporating student draft images as a primary input for reasoning, the system provides fine-grained error cause analysis and supports real-time, multi-round AI—student dialogues. In this extended version, we introduce a new snap-to-solve module for handling low-reasoning tasks using edge-deployed LLMs, enabling faster and partially offline interaction. We also include expanded benchmarking experiments, including human expert evaluations and ablation studies, to assess model performance and learning outcomes. Deployed on the Squirrel AI platform, VATE demonstrates high accuracy (78.3%) in error analysis and improves student learning efficiency, with strong user satisfaction. These results suggest that VATE is a scalable, cost-effective solution with the potential to transform educational practices.},

  abstract     = {According to an industry survey, many people miss opportunities to apply for government subsidy programs because they do not know how to apply. People also need to search manually and check whether these programs are suitable for them. To address this issue, our study developed a new generative recommender system with both users' information and government subsidy documents. Within our recommender system framework, we modify the existing Residual Quantization Variational Auto-Encoder (RQ-VAE) model to capture deep and abstract information from subsidy documents. Using semantic IDs generated for approximately 185,610 user click-stream histories and 240,000 documents, we train our recommender system to predict the semantic IDs of the next subsidy policy documents in which a user might be interested. In 2024, we successfully deployed our generative recommender system in Wello, a Korean Gov-Tech startup. In collaboration with the Korean government, our generative recommender system helped enhance program effectiveness by saving $7.8 million in unused funds and achieved $27.4 million in advertising efficiency gains. Also, Wello observed a 68% improvement in Click-Through-Ratio (CTR), increasing from 41.4% in the third quarter of 2024 to 69.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. We thus anticipate that our generative recommender system will have a significant impact on both individuals and the government.},

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for monitoring, benchmarking, and continuously improving such complex, multi-component systems under active development by multiple teams. Our approach encompasses three key elements: (1) a hierarchical “severity” framework for incident detection that identifies and categorizes errors while attributing component-specific error rates, facilitating targeted improvements; (2) a scalable and principled methodology for benchmark construction, evaluation, and deployment, designed to accommodate multiple development teams, mitigate overfitting risks, and assess the downstream impact of system modifications; and (3) a continual improvement strategy leveraging multidimensional evaluation, enabling the identification and implementation of diverse enhancement opportunities. By adopting this holistic framework, organizations can systematically enhance the reliability and performance of their AI Assistants, ensuring their efficacy in critical enterprise environments. We conclude by discussing how this multifaceted approach opens avenues for various classes of enhancements, including human-AI collaborative evaluation, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy AI systems.},

My research seeks to directly address this challenge by enabling AI systems to interact with humans to learn aligned and robust behaviors. The way robots and other AI systems behave is often the result of optimizing a reward function. However, manually designing good reward functions is highly challenging and error-prone, even for domain experts. Although reward functions are often difficult to manually specify, human feedback in the form of demonstrations or preferences is often much easier to obtain but can be difficult to interpret due to ambiguity and noise. Thus, it is critical that AI systems take into account epistemic uncertainty over the human's true intent. As part of the AAAI New Faculty Highlight Program, I will give an overview of my research progress along the following fundamental research areas: (1) efficiently quantifying uncertainty over human intent, (2) directly optimizing behavior to be robust to uncertainty over human intent, and (3) actively querying for additional human input to reduce uncertainty over human intent.},

The selection of any one of multiple underway watercraft for patient exchange is complicated by participating aircraft utilization histories and participating watercraft positions and velocities. The selection problem is modeled as a semi-Markov decision process with an action space, including both fixed land and moving watercraft exchange points. Monte Carlo tree search with root parallelization is used to select optimal exchange points and determine aircraft dispatch times. Model parameters are varied in simulation to identify representative scenarios where watercraft exchange points reduce incident response times. We find that an optimal policy with watercraft exchange points outperforms an optimal policy without watercraft exchange points and a greedy policy by 35% and 40%, respectively. In partnership with the United States Army, we deploy for the first time the watercraft exchange point by executing a mock patient transfer with a manikin between two HH-60M medical evacuation helicopters and an underway Army Logistic Support Vessel south of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Both helicopters were dispatched in accordance with our optimized decision strategy.},

Far from a gradual evolution, its sudden emergence has jolted educational institutions, leaving many academics grappling with a perceived encroachment upon their intellectual domain. This upheaval has sparked intense debates, with concerns ranging from the erosion of academic integrity to the devaluation of scholarly labor. This essay contends that such apprehensions, while understandable, may overlook the transformative potential of AI as a collaborative tool. Drawing parallels to historical disruptions—such as the advent of photography challenging traditional art forms—we explore how AI can augment human creativity rather than supplant it. By examining the dynamics of authorship, originality, and accountability, we argue for a redefinition of these concepts in the context of AI-assisted work. Emphasizing the importance of human oversight in guiding AI outputs, we advocate for a framework that recognizes the symbiotic relationship between human intellect and machine efficiency. Such a perspective not only preserves the essence of academic rigor but also embraces the democratization of knowledge production. Ultimately, this essay calls for a balanced approach that mitigates risks while harnessing the innovative capacities of generative AI in academia.},

Building upon this, this article transcends the traditional binary judgment model and constructs a tiered copyright determination model. Based on the level of human control and contribution in the AI generation process, it introduces dimensions such as technological controllability and density of human intent, classifying generative AI into three tiers: strong protection, weak protection, and non-protection. Regarding the copyrightability of content generated by generative AI, this article argues that the issue should be addressed within the framework of copyright law itself.

Existing methods for simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer often rely on high-fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real-world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim-to-real gap—such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization—TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real-world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)-fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim-to-real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid real-world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real-world performance.},

We believe that the future need for AI talent is tremendous and that we should take extreme efforts to attract students to our field. We present a sample of the expected opportunities and needs. Some of these opportunities may be attractive to students who in the past may not have considered AI as a career option. We argue that even with the anticipated automation of AI work, there nevertheless will be a prodigious need for talent to develop good AI. We summarize work that argues that AI is going to be a fundamental skill and as such should be introduced to learners across many age groups and many backgrounds. We suggest that a well-reasoned statement of the anticipated needs be developed by experts in our field and communicated to future talent.

Now in its fourth year, our “AI for Georgia” project (AI4GA) has provided PD to 20 teachers and AI education to over 1600 students. The AI4GA curriculum does more than foster AI literacy: It empowers students to view themselves as creators of AI-powered technology and to think about future career options that involve the use of AI.

This paper adopts a design science research (DSR) approach to develop the equity-aware design thinking for AI (EquiThink4AI) framework, a dual-component model that systematically embeds equity principles into AI education. EquiThink4AI's first component extends design thinking (DT) by incorporating principles from EquityXDesign (EXD) and liberatory design (LD), ensuring that equity concerns are proactively addressed throughout AI system development. The second component enhances the framework with pedagogical strategies, including problem-based learning (PBL), experiential learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering student engagement, real-world problem-solving, and ethical reasoning. EquityThink4AI provides educators and students with a structured methodology for teaching and applying equity-centered AI development.

These courses, however, should not replicate the technical focus typically found in introductory computer science (CS) courses like CS1 and CS2. In this paper, we use an adjustable, interdisciplinary socio-technical AI literacy framework to design and present an introductory AI literacy course. We present a refined version of this framework informed by the teaching of a 1-credit general education AI literacy course (primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors), a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels, and a summer camp for high school students. Drawing from these teaching experiences and the evolving research landscape, we propose an introductory AI literacy course design framework structured around four cross-cutting pillars. These pillars encompass (1) understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI technologies, (2) learning how to interact with (generative) AI technologies, (3) applying principles of critical, ethical, and responsible AI usage, and (4) analyzing implications of AI on society. We posit that achieving AI literacy is essential for all students, those pursuing AI-related careers, and those following other educational or professional paths. This introductory course, positioned at the beginning of a program, creates a foundation for ongoing and advanced AI education. The course design approach is presented as a series of modules and subtopics under each pillar. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful instructional design, including pedagogy, expected learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. This approach not only integrates social and technical learning but also democratizes AI education across diverse student populations and equips all learners with the socio-technical, multidisciplinary perspectives necessary to navigate and shape the ethical future of AI.},

Some label it a “crisis,” and research employing or building machine learning (ML) models is no exception. Issues including lack of transparency, data or code, poor adherence to standards, and the sensitivity of ML training conditions mean that many papers are not even reproducible in principle. Where they are, though, reproducibility experiments have found worryingly low degrees of similarity with original results. Despite previous appeals from ML researchers on this topic and various initiatives from conference reproducibility tracks to the ACM's new Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability, we contend that the general community continues to take this issue too lightly. Poor reproducibility threatens trust in and integrity of research results. Therefore, in this article, we lay out a new perspective on the key barriers and drivers (both procedural and technical) to increased reproducibility at various levels (methods, code, data, and experiments). We then map the drivers to the barriers to give concrete advice for strategies for researchers to mitigate reproducibility issues in their own work, to lay out key areas where further research is needed in specific areas, and to further ignite discussion on the threat presented by these urgent issues.},

  abstract     = {Despite an extensive body of literature on trust in technology, designing trustworthy AI systems for high-stakes decision domains remains a significant challenge. Widely used system design guidelines and tools are rarely attuned to domain-specific trustworthiness principles. In this study, we introduce a design framework to address this gap within intelligence analytic tasks, called the Principles-based Approach for Designing Trustworthy, Human-centered AI using the MAST Methodology (PADTHAI-MM). PADTHAI-MM builds on the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST), an AI decision support system evaluation tool designed in accordance to the U.S. Intelligence Community's standards for system trustworthiness. We demonstrate PADTHAI-MM in our development of the Reporting Assistant for Defense and Intelligence Tasks (READIT), a research platform that leverages data visualizations and natural language processing-based text analysis to emulate AI-enabled intelligence reporting aids. To empirically assess the efficacy of PADTHAI-MM, we developed two versions of READIT for comparison: a “High-MAST” version, which incorporates AI contextual information and explanations, and a “Low-MAST” version, designed to be akin to inscrutable “black box” AI systems. Through an iterative design process guided by stakeholder feedback, our multidisciplinary design team developed prototypes that were evaluated by experienced intelligence analysts. Results substantially supported the viability of PADTHAI-MM in designing for system trustworthiness in this task domain. We also explored the relationship between analysts' MAST ratings and three theoretical categories of information known to impact trust: process , purpose , and performance . Overall, our study supports the practical and theoretical viability of PADTHAI-MM as an approach to designing trustable AI systems.},

  abstract     = {Today's robots do not yet learn the general skills that are necessary to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, to interact with people, or do household chores nearly as well as people do. Addressing the aspirational goal of creating service robots requires improving how they are created. Today's mainstream AIs are not created by agents learning from experiences doing tasks in real-world contexts and interacting with people. Today's robots do not learn by sensing, acting, doing experiments, and collaborating. Future robots will need to learn from such experiences in order to be ready for robust deployment in human service applications. This paper investigates what aspirational future autonomous human-compatible service robots will need to know. It recommends developing experiential (robotic) foundation models (FMs) for bootstrapping them.},

  abstract     = {The growing importance of understanding and addressing algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a surge in research on AI fairness, which often assumes that the underlying data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, real-world data frequently exist in non-IID graph structures that capture connections among individual units. To effectively mitigate bias in AI systems, it is essential to bridge the gap between traditional fairness literature, designed for IID data, and the prevalence of non-IID graph data. This survey reviews recent advancements in fairness amidst non-IID graph data, including the newly introduced fair graph generation and the commonly studied fair graph classification. In addition, available datasets and evaluation metrics for future research are identified, the limitations of existing work are highlighted, and promising future directions are proposed.},

  abstract     = {The brute-force scaleup of training datasets, learnable parameters and computation power, has become a prevalent strategy for developing more robust learning models. However, due to bottlenecks in data, computation, and trust, the sustainability of this strategy is a serious concern. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain-specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of purely relying on scaleup. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as “building blocks” to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug-drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.},

  abstract     = {Machine unlearning is a cutting-edge technology that embodies the privacy legal principle of the right to be forgotten within the realm of machine learning (ML). It aims to remove specific data or knowledge from trained models without retraining from scratch and has gained significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. However, the development of machine unlearning research is associated with inherent vulnerabilities and threats, posing significant challenges for researchers and practitioners. In this article, we provide the first comprehensive survey of security and privacy issues associated with machine unlearning by providing a systematic classification across different levels and criteria. Specifically, we begin by investigating unlearning-based security attacks, where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the unlearning process to compromise the security of machine learning (ML) models. We then conduct a thorough examination of privacy risks associated with the adoption of machine unlearning. Additionally, we explore existing countermeasures and mitigation strategies designed to protect models from malicious unlearning-based attacks targeting both security and privacy. Further, we provide a detailed comparison between machine unlearning-based security and privacy attacks and traditional malicious attacks. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions for security and privacy issues posed by machine unlearning, offering insights into potential solutions and advancements in this evolving field.},

  abstract     = {We investigate and observe the behavior and performance of Large Language Model (LLM)-backed chatbots in addressing misinformed prompts and questions with demographic information within the domains of Climate Change and Mental Health. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we assess the chatbots' ability to discern the veracity of statements, their adherence to facts, and the presence of bias or misinformation in their responses. Our quantitative analysis using True/False questions reveals that these chatbots can be relied on to give the right answers to these close-ended questions. However, the qualitative insights, gathered from domain experts, shows that there are still concerns regarding privacy, ethical implications, and the necessity for chatbots to direct users to professional services. We conclude that while these chatbots hold significant promise, their deployment in sensitive areas necessitates careful consideration, ethical oversight, and rigorous refinement to ensure they serve as a beneficial augmentation to human expertise rather than an autonomous solution.
