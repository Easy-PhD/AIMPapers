  abstract     = {The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. From a pathological point of view, several complex hypotheses, such as impaired neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and aggregation of amyloid- (A ), are considered crucial contributors to the pathophysiology of AD. Recent studies have primarily focused on AD treatment strategies targeting drugs that intervene in cerebral deposition of aggregated amyloid- (A ) polymers, often found in the form of amyloid plaques. In this paper, we present intuitive mathematical models that clarify the treatment of AD in the presence of inhibitory drugs. These models elucidate the intricate kinetics involved in A formation and the interaction of drugs with these processes. We discuss two categories of drugs: first, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act as monomer inhibitors of A aggregation, and second, drugs that directly interact with A aggregated polymers. We initially analyze each drug independently and then assess their combined effects. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the first type of drug reduces the equilibrium state value of aggregated filaments, whereas the second model of drug exhibits even greater efficacy in reducing the equilibrium state value of aggregated filaments. Furthermore, we conduct simulations of the simultaneous application of both drugs. The results are compared with the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a vector-borne disease caused by Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by infected female blackflies. It affects millions of people globally, with the greatest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we develop a deterministic mathematical model that integrates multiple control measures, including sterile insect technique (SIT), mechanical control, chemical control, public health education, and ivermectin treatment, to manage the transmission of onchocerciasis. We employ the next-generation matrix method to calculate the blackfly offspring reproduction number and the basic reproduction number . Sensitivity analysis, conducted using the normalized forward sensitivity index, highlights the biting rate as the most positive influence on driving onchocerciasis dynamics, while the mortality rate of female blackflies has a significant negative impact on disease containment. To identify the optimal control strategy for onchocerciasis infections, we apply optimal control theory, considering five time-dependent controls which are public health education, treatment, mechanical control, SIT, and chemical control. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we derive the optimality system for controlling onchocerciasis. By implementing forward-backward Runge–Kutta method in Matlab, we identify the most optimal strategy for controlling, preventing, and treating onchocerciasis in both human and blackfly populations. The results suggest that a combined strategy focusing on public health education, treatment, and chemical control offers the most effective approach for combating onchocerciasis.},

The study examines equilibrium points, with a specific focus on the tumor-free and high-tumor state, to evaluate local stability. The fixed-point theorem is applied to confirm the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and global stability is established through the Hyers–Ulam–Rassias method. Numerical simulations, carried out using the zwo-step Adams-Bashforth method across various fractional orders, unveil the system's complex behaviors.

In order to prevent and mitigate this degradation, a better understanding of its causes is urgently needed. In this endeavor, mathematical models of ecosystem structure and function are useful tools. An ecological model is presented here that is both global and applicable to terrestrial and marine environments. An interaction between plant–herbivore–carnivore–omnivore is examined in this study. To determine sensitive parameters, a global sensitivity analysis was performed. The equilibria and stability of the system have been analyzed analytically as well as numerically. Additionally, different kinds of bifurcation are discussed (transcritical, saddle-node, and Hopf). A bistable behavior was observed in the system. A very low herbivore consumption rate will cause carnivores and herbivores to become extinct, while a slightly high value will cause all populations to survive. In population models, stochasticity enhances accuracy, realism, and utility. Consequently, we extend the proposed model from its deterministic version to its stochastic version. An important feature of the noise-induced perturbed system is the occurrence of noise-induced transitions.},

  abstract     = {Discrete orthogonal moments, such as the dual-Hahn moments, often exhibit limitations in accurately reconstructing signals, which reduces their effectiveness in applications that require precise recovery, particularly for 1D signals and color images. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel transform called the quaternionic integer reversible dual-Hahn transform (QIRDHT). This innovative approach enables simultaneous and lossless processing of 1D signals and color images, while being particularly well suited for resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, chaotic systems play a crucial role in cryptography, especially for secure key generation. However, the classical Hénon system has several drawbacks, including a restricted range of control parameters, limited sensitivity to initial conditions, and a tendency to generate periodic sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose an enhanced hyperchaotic system that combines the dynamics of the Hénon system and logistic maps. This new hyperchaotic system exhibits richer dynamic behavior and a broader range of control parameters, significantly improving the security of encryption schemes. By integrating QIRDHT with this hyperchaotic map, we develop an efficient scheme for generating and extracting multiple zero-watermarks. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated against various geometric and common signal processing attacks using different medical images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of PSNR, BER, and NC, ensuring enhanced protection of medical images.},

First, we establish by exploiting the semigroup theory that the system is well-posed. Through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional, we establish the exponential stability result for the solutions of the system. The exponential stability of the system's solutions is established under a pertinent assumption regarding the weight of the delay. This assumption posits that the damping effect through heat conduction is sufficiently potent to stabilize the system, even when a time delay is introduced. Importantly, the robustness of our result is noteworthy, as it does not hinge on any specific relationships among system parameters.},

The proposed methodologies center on a subgradient extragradient approach that combines an inertial technique, a self-adaptive procedure, and a viscosity approximation scheme. These algorithms use variable step sizes that are dynamically updated in accordance with previous iteration outcomes. A key advantage of the proposed methods is their ability to function eliminating the need for prior knowledge of Lipschitz constants or line search techniques. Instead, the step sizes are determined through simple calculations at each iteration. The convergence analysis is established under relaxed assumptions.

The nonlocal term is introduced in the intraspecific competition among the predator species. A density-dependent cross-diffusion is considered to model the movement behavior of species. First, the temporal system is examined, where the existence, boundedness, and stability of the equilibrium points are ascertained. Bifurcation analysis also reveals the presence of saddle-node, transcritical, Hopf bifurcations, and codimension-2 bifurcation such as the Bogdano–Takens bifurcation. The behavior of the system is inspected both in the presence and absence of nonlocal interaction. It is observed that the nonlocal interaction tends to destabilize the coexisting equilibrium. For lower values of diffusion coefficient, spatially nonhomogeneous solutions are detected. For higher values of diffusion coefficient, domain-induced Turing instability switching is observed. Moreover, when the domain size is small, the coexisting equilibrium is stable irrespective of the value of the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect of harvesting effort is also seen. The formulated system is numerically solved using the operator splitting method. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate all the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript provides a comprehensive investigation of the Zabolotskaya–Khokhlov (Z-K) equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation essential for modeling wave propagation in acoustics. The main goal is to formulate and assess a hybrid numerical approach that combines finite difference and differential quadrature techniques, utilizing both Fourier and Lagrange basis functions to improve accuracy and efficiency. The problem formulation commences with defining the parameters and physical meaning of the Z-K equation, succeeded by its discretization in both temporal and spatial domains utilizing the proposed hybrid methodology. We systematically investigate the application of the differential quadrature method for approximating spatial derivatives while utilizing the finite difference method for temporal discretization. The paper introduces a quasi-linearization technique based on Taylor expansion of the nonlinear temporal terms. This dual methodology facilitates a versatile and resilient handling of the nonlinear features of the Z-K equation. A comprehensive error analysis is performed, establishing limits on both temporal and spatial errors related to the numerical solutions. The results indicate that the hybrid approach markedly enhances accuracy relative to conventional methods, with error barriers determined through meticulous mathematical derivation and corroborated by numerical simulations. The proposed scheme provides an error estimate of orders for both Lagrange and Fourier bases, respectively. The results indicate the method's effectiveness in capturing the complex behavior of wave propagation, rendering it a viable instrument for applications in acoustics and related domains. This study enhances the numerical solutions of the Z-K equation and offers insights into the wider use of hybrid approaches for solving nonlinear wave equations.},

We begin by establishing the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions with non-Lipschitz coefficients. Subsequently, we explore the tightness of the slow component concerning the time scale parameter . We then examine the properties of the frozen equation associated with the fast component. Finally, we demonstrate that the slow component converges to the averaged equation in probability and mean-square under different conditions, as goes to zero, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the stochastic nonlinear Kodama (SNLK) equation influenced by multiplicative noise interpreted in the Stratonovich sense. The equation is significant for modeling complex physical systems in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. We employ both the Kumar–Malik method and the polynomial expansion technique to construct exact soliton solutions in various functional forms, including Jacobi elliptic, hyperbolic, exponential, and trigonometric types. The combination of these two analytical methods provides a novel framework for investigating nonlinear wave structures in stochastic environments. To complement the analytical results, numerical simulations are conducted using Maple (or Mathematica) software, which confirm the accuracy and dynamic consistency of the solutions. These simulations also offer deeper insight into the behavior and evolution of the solutions under random influences. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the applied methods, making them suitable for a wider class of nonlinear partial differential equations. This work contributes to a better theoretical and computational understanding of stochastic wave phenomena and lays the groundwork for further exploration in related physical contexts.},

  abstract     = {Superquadrics are one of the most suitable geometric tools for modeling many complex shapes in nature. It is possible to model many objects, human figures, and living creatures in nature in a suitable way by means of superquadrics. On the other hand, quaternions are useful in mathematics, especially for computations involving three-dimensional rotations, such as in robotics, computer vision, magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional computer graphics, and texture analysis in crystallography. In addition, considering that nature is built according to a rotation principle, a structure combining superquadrics and quaternion algebra can be a very useful and usable structure in the mentioned areas and many others. For this purpose, in this study, a new kinematic structure is defined, called a superquadric motion in Lorentz 3-space. For this purpose, first, an inner product and a vector product compatible with superquadrics and superquadric space are defined via the Gielis superformula. Then, the new algebraic structure, called superquadric quaternions, and their properties are given. In this study, the defined superquadric motion and the hyperbolic split quaternion perform a superquadric rotation motion on the superquadric hyperboloids in 3D Lorentz space. Finally, some examples are visualized by mathematical programs to show the applicability of these constructions.},

The proposed model is studied in the presence of a fear effect induced by the predator's presence, which can lead to significant reductions in the prey's reproduction rate. The system is assumed to exist in a patchy environment consisting of two distinct patches (patch ). The prey migrates between these patches in search of food, while the predator moves between patches in pursuit of prey. The movement of both prey and predator is assumed to be fast compared to their growth and interactions. To capture the system's dynamics, slow and fast time scales are introduced. An aggregated model for the prey and predator populations is derived. The positive invariance and boundedness of all feasible solutions in the aggregated system are established. The necessary conditions for the feasibility and stability of various fixed points in the aggregated model are determined. Furthermore, the existence of periodic solutions is numerically verified through Hopf bifurcation and Hopf-Hopf (double-Hopf) bifurcation around coexistence points. The existence of a branch point (transcritical bifurcation) is also analyzed by satisfying all the conditions of Sotomayor's theorem. Additionally, a two-parameter bifurcation analysis is conducted, including generalized Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Several numerical simulations, performed using MATLAB and MATCONT, illustrate and validate the analytical results.},

The prey's reproduction rate is modeled as a decreasing function of predator density and fear intensity, while predator dynamics follow a modified Holling type II functional response. Analytical investigations establish conditions for the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as persistence and bifurcations, including transcritical and Hopf types. Numerical simulations reveal that higher fear intensity or intraspecific competition stabilizes dynamics by suppressing oscillations, whereas their reduction leads to limit cycles via supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcations. Two-parameter bifurcation analysis uncovers generalized Hopf bifurcations and bistability. Stochastic simulations with Gaussian white noise indicate that low-intensity fluctuations preserve coexistence, while stronger noise destabilizes the system. Global sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters affecting population dynamics. A brief comparative discussion shows that excluding mechanisms such as noise simplifies the system and reduces its dynamical complexity.},

The stability analysis results indicate that when the , the corruption-free equilibrium points are asymptotically stable both locally and globally, whereas the endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable locally when the .

One of the equations, describing the evolution of a biomass density, exhibits degenerate and singular diffusion. The other equations are either of advection-reaction-diffusion type or ODEs. Under very general assumptions, the existence of weak solutions is proven by considering regularized systems, deriving uniform bounds, and using fixed point arguments. Assuming additional structural assumptions we also prove the uniqueness of solutions. Global-in-time well-posedness is established for Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, whereas, only local well-posedness can be shown for homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Using a suitable barrier function and comparison theorems, we formulate sufficient conditions for finite-time blow-up or uniform boundedness of solutions. Finally, we show that solutions of the degenerate parabolic equation inherit additional global spatial regularity if the diffusion coefficient has a power-law growth.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of dual quaternion across various fields has propelled the study of its matrix theory into recent focus. We develop a structure-preserving algorithm for dual quaternion matrix LU decomposition (DQLUD). Theoretically, we rely on the dual matrix representation of dual quaternion matrices to transform the operations in the DQLUD and reduce the computational complexity based on the special structure of the dual matrices. Furthermore, we not only design a structure-preserving algorithm for the partial pivoting DQLUD by utilizing the order relation of dual numbers but also present a structure-preserving algorithm for the Cholesky decomposition of dual quaternion Hermitian positive definite matrices. Numerically, comparisons with other available algorithms are carried out, which demonstrate that our proposed structure-preserving algorithm incurs less computational cost. Finally, we translate the idea of designing structure-preserving algorithms to the LU decomposition of dual complex matrices and successfully apply it to designing a strict authentication scheme for color images and the process of color image watermarking.},

These conditions lead to distinct four-dimensional partial differential equations for both option holders and writers, derived from a dynamic hedging strategy. The equations are solved numerically using an explicit finite-difference approach due to their high nonlinearity. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of transaction costs and conducts a sensitivity analysis on key parameters. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to price other option types in a multifactor stochastic volatility or stochastic interest rate setting with transaction costs.},

Among them, how to estimate learning rates for various learning problems remains a fundamental theoretical problem. By far, most of the existing research only focuses on single-output learning. To strengthen the theoretical support of multioutput learning, we study the learning rates of multioutput regression with kernel methods and -regularization. We obtain an explicit learning rate, which reveals the quantitative dependency on both the output dimensions and the sample size. Our results cover a broader scope than previous works and improve upon them in certain special cases.

  abstract     = {The growing trend of automation in engineering significantly increases the complexity of engineering systems and necessitates a deeper understanding of the coupling of physical and cyber components interacting within the systems. A typical example of such a highly coupled system is an autonomous construction site, where robotic systems aim to enhance the efficiency of the construction process. To adequately address, define, and model the structure of such engineering systems, it is essential to use the tools of abstract mathematics, which provide a sufficient level of abstraction to describe entire systems as well as interactions between their components. Moreover, the use of abstract mathematics enables conceptual modelling at different levels of details and abstraction, and, thus, providing possibilities to work not only on a meta-level, but also on the meta-meta-level. In this context, a meta-metamodelling approach to the formal description of engineering systems via the coupling of categorical ontology logs and abstract definitions for individual components has been proposed in recent years. The goal of this paper is to further develop the meta-metamodelling approach, emphasizing its practical applicability for engineering systems by considering practical problems on autonomous construction sites. In particular, a connection between the meta-meta-level and the meta-level is discussed as well as the advantages of using the tools of abstract mathematics are underlined.},

The Qdenga vaccine was introduced in 2022 to prevent dengue infection. Building on this, we develop a threshold-based dynamical model of the dengue fever epidemic that incorporates vaccination, vaccine inefficacy, and asymptomatic carriers. We first formulate the arithmetic expression for the control reproduction number and then use properties of complex modulus and proof by contradiction to establish the local asymptotic stability of both dengue-free equilibrium and dengue-infected equilibrium of the model. Furthermore, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions and applying the generalized Lyapunov-LaSalle theorem, we obtain the global dynamic properties of the two equilibria. In particular, we confirm weak persistence for to achieve the global attractivity of the dengue-infected equilibrium. Notably, we conduct numerical simulations and analyze the transmission dynamics of the disease in conjunction with official data from Brazil and the results of parameter estimation. These numerical findings are consistent with our theoretical results. Additionally, sensitivity analysis using MATLAB is carried out to identify parameters with significant impact on our model. Our numerical simulation results suggest that taking into account vaccination and potential vaccine inefficacy can lead to more accurate simulations of real-world scenarios. This consideration also plays a significant role in devising feasible epidemic control strategies and enhancing targeted vaccine development. Specifically, Qdenga received approval for use in Brazil in March 2023. Relevant authorities in Brazil are encouraged to actively promote vaccination campaigns in order to reduce the infection rate.},

In the proposed control problem, we deal with a system that is under the noninstantaneous impulsive effects and infinite delay. The sufficient condition for the existence of a mild solution for the proposed nonlinear control system has been established by using Dhage's fixed-point theorem. Further, the approximate controllability results are established using piecewise defined control function and under the consideration that the corresponding linear system is approximate controllable. The main findings have been established by using the facts concerning the semigroup theory of operators, fixed-point technique, fractional calculus, and the theory of multivalued maps. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the abstract results.},

  abstract     = {We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the Zakharov-Shabat system. Representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in the unit disk. The coefficients of the series are computed following a simple recurrent integration procedure. This essentially reduces the solution of the direct scattering problem to the computation of the coefficients and location of zeros of an analytic function inside of the unit disk. The solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficient. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Predator-prey models, such as the Leslie-Gower model, are essential for understanding population dynamics and stability within ecosystems. These models help explain the balance between species under natural conditions, but the inclusion of factors like the Allee effect and intraspecific competition adds complexity and realism to these interactions, enhancing our ability to predict system behavior under stress. To detect early indicators of population collapse, this study investigates the intricate dynamics of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with both Allee effect and intraspecific competition. We analyze the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as bifurcation phenomena, including saddle-node bifurcations of codimension 2, Hopf bifurcations of codimension 2, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension at least 4. Detailed transitions between bifurcation curves–specifically saddle-node, Hopf, homoclinic, and limit cycle bifurcations–are also examined. We observe a novel transition phenomenon, where a system jumps from saddle-node bifurcation to homoclinic and limit cycle bifurcations. This suggests that burst oscillations may serve as an early warning of system collapse rather than simply a tipping point. Our findings indicate that moderate levels of intraspecific competition or Allee effect support coexistence of both populations, while excessive levels may destabilize the entire biological system, leading to collapse. These insights offer valuable implications for ecological management and the early detection of risks in population dynamics.},

In detail, nonlinear multisource disturbance encompasses the disturbances brought about by exogenous systems and norm-bounded disturbances. In this relation, two kinds of PDE-type disturbance observers are put forward for the purpose of estimating the disturbances produced by the exogenous systems. Subsequently, an output feedback-based secured control law is devised through the assistance of estimation information gathered from the constructed observer. In addition, hybrid cyber attacks are undertaken in the control channel with the goal of enhancing the security of the system. In this context, a Bernoulli distributed white sequence is utilized for the purpose of managing the randomness of cyber attacks. Also, the gain fluctuations in the control framework are considered within a structure of linear fractional form to improve the control design robustness. Apart from this, with the intent of addressing the norm-bounded disturbances, an extended dissipative technique is implemented. At the end, a numerical example accompanied by the simulation findings is provided to showcase the efficacy of the developed theoretical results and control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The equivalence problem in differential geometry investigates whether two geometric structures can be transformed into one another through an appropriate change of variables. This issue is central to understanding the invariants associated with dynamical systems, which remain unchanged under such transformations. The Cartan equivalence method provides a powerful and systematic framework for addressing these problems by reducing complex equivalence questions to more tractable ones involving coframes and structure equations. In this study, we apply Cartan's method to second-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offering insights into the intrinsic geometric structure of these systems under coordinate transformations. Specifically, we examine a class of second-order ODEs that model nonlinear dynamical behavior, employing the pseudogroup of web transformations to identify differential invariants and symmetry classes. The study introduces a step-by-step construction of an invariant coframe, elucidates the structure equations governing the system, and provides a classification of the equations based on their differential invariants. Two representative physical systems are investigated in detail: the motion of a damped spring-mass system and the van der Pol oscillator. In addition to these applications, the paper explores the interplay between equivalence, symmetry reduction, and integrability. By leveraging Cartan's method, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the equivalence problem in the context of higher order differential equations, highlighting both the theoretical elegance and practical utility of the approach in uncovering hidden geometric features, symmetries, and conserved quantities.},

The stability criteria for disease-free and endemic equilibria are theoretically validated using the basic reproduction number ( ) and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Our system exhibits a transcritical bifurcation at , indicating changes in the stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. We have also investigated the effects of a dual-drug regimen (Azithromycin and ) by introducing two surrogate control parameters into our model, utilizing optimal control theory. The derived optimal drug dosage pair offers a cost-effective and efficient treatment strategy. For model calibration via numerical simulations, we have collected some parameter values from certain published mouse model studies and also performed sensitivity analysis for to assess the relative importance of these parameters for our mathematical system. To evaluate the robustness of model predictions against parameter variations, we have computed sensitivity indices and model sustainability across different parameter regions. Numerical results substantiate the outcomes of the control-induced system, and we have compared the results under various maximum control efforts.

We also estimate the difference of these operators with generalized sampling operators. Moreover, we examine the order of approximation in the weighted space of continuity. Illustrative examples of kernels that meet the necessary assumptions are provided. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed operators through graphical examples and numerical tables. Finally, we explore their potential applications in digital image processing.},

  abstract     = {The current manuscript introduces a single-strain dengue model developed from stochastic processes incorporating fractional-order transmission and recovery. The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ( T F $$ TF $$ ) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's T F $$ TF $$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined the stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional-order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to assess the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reducing the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vectors, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that policymakers should place importance on the fractional-order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underlying mechanisms of disease, along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of adult vector control.},

Steady-state and Hopf bifurcations are carried out in detail, especially under the degenerate conditions such as invalid simple eigenvalue condition or crossing condition. It is shown that the steady-state solutions under the violated simple eigenvalue are characterized by a coupling of two eigenfunctions, and the bifurcation direction from simple eigenvalue is supercritical or subcritical. Meanwhile, there is no nonconstant steady-state solution under the degenerate case of violated crossing condition. In addition, whether the transversality condition in Hopf bifurcation is true or not, instead of the center manifold theory, we apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and the singularity theory to illustrate the existence and stability of periodic solutions as well as the bifurcation diagrams. But it is proved that the usual pitchfork Hopf bifurcation is changed to the transcritical bifurcation through the invalid transversality condition. Finally, some numerical simulations allow us to identify the influence of external current on the predicted dynamics.

The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ , stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for ℛ 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . For the situation of ℛ 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at ℛ 0 = 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior.

  abstract     = {Software has been increasingly important in many critical systems. To measure the growth of software reliability during testing phases, several software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been investigated. Different from hardwares, softwares' failure mechanisms follow the basic rules of logic, behavior, and psychology rather than physical laws. Consequently, software testing phase embodies lots of epistemic uncertainties, which are not suitable to be modeled by probability theory-based SRGMs. In addition, fuzzy theory-based SRGMs may give counterintuitive results. Confronted with these, we proposed a software belief reliability growth model (SBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory which is a new mathematics system to deal with epistemic uncertainties. However, testing coverage, a key factor in software testing, has not been considered in SBRGM. Therefore, a novel SBRGM considering testing coverage, named SBRGM with testing coverage (TCSBRGM), is proposed in this paper. Based on belief reliability theory, several essential belief reliability indexes for software such as belief reliability and belief reliable time are considered. Unknown parameters in the proposed TCSBRGM are estimated. Finally, real data analysis using two real-world software testing data is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed model with some representative SRGMs. The results exhibit that the proposed model gives a better fitting and predictive performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies some deterministic mathematical models that seek to explain the expansion of Zika virus, as a viral epidemic, using published data for Brazil. Three SIR type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6, and 10 unknown parameters, respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The models are validated using the epidemic data found. Finally, it was confirmed that the basic reproductive ratio is consistent with those previously reported in the literature. We conclude that the proposed optimization method improves computation time with respect to a genetic algorithm or an exhaustive search in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {In nature, there is no ideal impulse response system. When the input is switched, the output cannot respond to this input instantaneously, which needs some time. This causes a transient oscillation process, which will inevitably affect the control accuracy, produce noise, and even cause fatigue damage. The usually adopted integer mathematical model is an ideal impulse response model and has no memory property. The fractional model has memory property, but the historical information before the switching time is usually lost. The transient oscillation process caused by intermittent control has rarely been reported in the obtained achievements with both the integer model and the fractional model. In this paper, based on the input-output property of a system, we have studied this transient oscillation. First, the impulsive response is approximated as a short memory model according to its decaying property. Second, the intermittent signal is treated as a piece-wise continuous signal to study. The study indicates that the transient oscillation is inevitable. This transient process is affected by the historical information within the memory length, and its duration is equal to the memory length. Different systems have different memory lengths. To optimize the transient oscillation process, we have to study the intermittent control approaches for different systems case by case. These do well with the engineering applications of intermittent control. Some numerical examples verify our theoretical analysis.},

Unlike the traditional approach, which replaces the Fourier kernel with the LCT kernel, this method employs convolution to capture the linear canonical spectrum over limited temporal intervals, constrained by a window function. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also holds significant potential for applications in various scientific and engineering fields. We begin our investigation by examining fundamental properties of the proposed transform, such as the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, and characterization of the range, using tools from LCT and convolution theory. Further, we explore the time-frequency resolution and the uncertainty principles associated with the proposed transform. Additionally, we present several potential applications, including the Poisson summation formula, Paley-Wiener criterion, and a sampling formula. To support our theoretical findings, clear examples are provided throughout the paper.},

Given the mapping between traversal trees and cuts in a graph, we propose to deal with the problem from a new perspective, namely, cut enumeration. The algorithm enumerates the cuts using the depth-first traversal tree, locates the optimal tree per node with the smallest local cut, and compacts them for acceleration. Any node pair can be separated by compacted trees containing only one of them.

Currently, it poses a significant health challenge in various regions, and there is concern that it may evolve into a more severe global threat. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach to modeling an influenza outbreak. The study begins by formulating a mathematical representation that incorporates random fluctuations influencing the disease's progression. We demonstrate that the proposed model guarantees a positive global solution. By utilizing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate specific parametric conditions under which the disease may be eliminated from the population. Additionally, an ergodic stationary distribution is used to demonstrate conditions under which the infection may persist. A threshold quantity is identified, offering insight into key parameters that influence other dynamic aspects of the model. The stochastic model of influenza is further examined through graphical representation for better understanding.},

This work assumes that all of the plants or units have the same capital cost, operating costs, and revenue and that the company reinvests all net profit into purchasing more units. Furthermore, this model ignores depreciation, inflation, fluctuating market prices, and market saturation. With these assumptions, the question of when the company can afford to scale and purchase the next unit is directly related to the payback period and the harmonic number. This work describes a novel growth function called the harmonic growth function based on harmonic numbers. This function is related to the standard ROI. The harmonic growth function is explained and applied to a micro combined heat and power (mCHP) station, a biomass company expanding the number of biorefineries, and biochar retort kilns for biochar production.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major public health concern worldwide, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing co-infection between HIV and HBV presents additional challenges in clinical treatment and patient outcomes. In this article, we developed a comprehensive co-infection model to explore the complex transmission dynamics between HIV and HBV in the United States. Our model incorporates crucial factors such as infection through birth or migration, HBV vaccination, and the possibility of reinfection following HBV recovery. Our mathematical analysis started with the analysis of the two non-co-infection submodels, that is, for HIV-only and HBV-only models. We derived the basic reproduction number for each submodel and appliedthe Routh-Hurwitz criterion to assess the local stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium points. Our investigation revealed that the HIV-only submodel is globally asymptotically stable when its basic reproduction number remains below one. Conversely, the HBV-only submodel exhibits a backward bifurcation, meaning that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states can coexist even when the reproduction number falls below one. This phenomenon complicates HBV control strategies under such conditions. However, in the absence of reinfection, the HBV-only model reaches global stability at the disease-free equilibrium whenever its reproduction number is below one. Using center manifold theory, we further demonstrated that the full HIV-HBV co-infection model also undergoes backward bifurcation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and HBV to identify critical parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of both infections. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the spread of one infection and the prevalence of the other. Additionally, we validated the model by fitting it to annual cumulative data on new HIV cases and reported acute HBV infections in the United States. Numerical simulations suggest that increasing condom use adherence, enhancing treatment coverage for both infections, and boosting HBV vaccination rates can substantially reduce the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and their co-infection.},

(ii) Since asymptotic behaviors of the principal eigenvalue are derived as the habitat size goes to zero or infinity, there exists a critical length such that the principal eigenvalue changes sign. (iii) The partial derivative of the eigenfunction with respect to spatial variable is always negative.

The fs-PINN approach overcomes the computational difficulties encountered by traditional methods and standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving fractional PDEs on unbounded domains. We transform the nonlocal fractional PDEs into local equations in a higher dimensional space through extension, addressing numerical difficulties associated with nonlocal fractional operators. This local form is then combined with spectrally adapted PINNs (s-PINNs) to develop the fs-PINN approach, which effectively handles unbounded domains. Our numerical experiments show that the fs-PINN algorithm achieves comparable performance to the fPINN algorithm in bounded domains. In contrast to fPINN, the advantage of fs-PINN is its capability for the case of unbounded domains.},

These equations are extensively used across various disciplines, including chemical engineering, fluid mechanics, physics, and astrophysics, to model a wide range of real-world problems. The proposed method uses three intermediate points and a set of formulas specifically designed to avoid the singularity at the origin. In order to ensure optimal performance, the proposed PVSHM is implemented in variable step-size mode using a suitable error estimation strategy that keeps the specified tolerances of the truncation errors under control. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed variable step-size implementation, emphasizing the versatility of PVSHM in providing accurate and reliable results for applied third-order IVP models in the form of LETE across diverse fields of study.},

Delay differential equations are used to capture the dynamics of immune system cells involved in allergies, as well as the evolution of HIV viruses, infected and uninfected CD4 cells, and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, under specific antiretroviral therapy. The model extends prior work by incorporating time delays to reflect the latency in immune response and drug effects, as well as interactions between the immune system and viral dynamics. Essential qualitative properties of the solutions, such as nonnegativity and global existence, are proved, ensuring the biological feasibility of the model. A partial stability analysis is conducted for some steady states of the system using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Biological interpretation of partial stability results are given and the interplay between infected cells and immune responses during HIV treatment is further explored, with a particular focus on mitigating allergic reactions induced by medication. Numerical simulations are employed to illustrate the impact of these interactions and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment strategies.},

Recently, Lone et al. extended the notion of quadratic-phase Fourier transform to octonion domains and showed its efficacy in precisely representing the nontransient octonion-valued signals. However, the octonion quadratic-phase Fourier transform exhibits limitations in effectively localizing the frequency characteristics of nontransient octonion-valued signals. As such, it is imperative to introduce a novel, distinct, and localized integral transform coined as the octonion short-time quadratic-phase Fourier transform. In the present study, we explore the core properties of the octonion short-time quadratic-phase Fourier transform, such as the energy preserving relation and the inversion formula. Subsequently, we proceed to formulate the Heisenberg's uncertainty principles associated with the novel integral transform. This comprehensive investigation aims to deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between the octonion algebra and the short-time quadratic-phase Fourier transform.},

This hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations is the simplest model of non-Fourier heat conduction. Boundary conditions include various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case, the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. These problems cannot be solved by the Fourier method and the Laplace transform. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method.

The formation of dead zones where the reactant concentration vanishes is characterized by the critical Thiele modulus. Its approximations and exact value are derived as functions of the reaction exponent and the model parameter. The comparison principle theorem is formulated and proven to establish upper and lower bounds for the exact critical Thiele modulus. The effects of the reaction exponent and model parameter on the analytic approximations of the critical Thiele modulus, and dead-zone formation in catalyst slabs are analyzed. The critical Thiele modulus for problems with the generalized Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics and zero reaction exponent is derived explicitly, and profiles of critical solutions to the models with the generalized Langmuir-Hinshelwood and power-law kinetics are compared. Furthermore, a simple method to compute the dead-zone length and dead-core solutions is presented for problems with general reaction kinetics that admits dead-zone formation. Analytical results are illustrated numerically. The proposed analytical approach yields closed-form solutions for the critical Thiele modulus, offering valuable insights into the effects of process and model parameters on the formation of dead zones within catalyst slabs.},

  abstract     = {This paper presented a novel nonlinear theoretical model for the dual flexible manipulator. First, the dual flexible manipulator was simplified as a combination of a rigid joint and an Euler–Bernoulli beam with single-sided elastic constraints. Considering the axial stretching effect, the nonlinear governing equations of motion for the dual flexible manipulator were established Hamilton's principle. Based on this, the free vibration equation and nonlinear vibration equation for the dual flexible manipulator were established, and the amplitude–frequency relationship was derived using the method of multiple scales. Furthermore, model effectiveness verification was conducted, and the influence of key parameters on the modal characteristics and amplitude–frequency response curves was investigated. The research results show that as the dimensionless load mass and stiffness ratio increase, the modal frequencies of the flexible manipulator system decrease gradually, whereas the dimensionless moment of inertia only affects the low-order modal frequencies. Changing the value of the dimensionless payload mass causes the flexible manipulator to exhibit either softening or hardening effects, whereas changing the values of the dimensionless moment of inertia and stiffness ratio results in the system exhibiting only a softening effect. The findings provide important guidance for the dynamic design of manipulators with flexible joints.},

  abstract     = {This study produces the solitary wave solutions to the modified equal-width (MEW) model utilizing the He's semi-inverse approach. This model is a generalization of the equal-width (EW) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation (NPDE) that describes wave propagation, particularly in shallow water waves. This model is also associated with the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation and the modified regularized long-wave equation. Due to its simplicity, dependability, and efficiency, the suggested approach has the potential to be used to a variety of PDEs in practical research. The numerical solution for MEW equation is demonstrated through an innovative finite difference approach. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated through a comparison with the analytical solution that we derived. Specifically, the results presented through this work demonstrate that our numerical scheme remains stable and accurate under variations in time stepping, wave speed, and spatial discretization. The chosen solutions are illustrated through various 2D and 3D graphs, which are simulated using the appropriate parameter values. The approaches presented here can be used to many nonlinear systems in natural science.},

Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of each line soliton in the -function can be visually represented and illustrated graphically. We further demonstrate that such solutions have asymptotic line solitons as , which are represented by index pair , while in the opposite direction there are asymptotic line solitons, represented by index pair . We conducted an exhaustive and in-depth analysis of the asymptotic line solitons within the web-structured soliton solutions through several examples.

Through a series of transformations, the (4+2)-dimensional equation can be reduced to two three-spatial-dimensions equations. The integrability of these equations is guaranteed, as their Lax pairs are provided. By conducting a spectral analysis of the -independent part of the Lax pair, the nonlinear Fourier transform pair comprising both direct and inverse transforms is worked out. With the help of the nonlocal formalism, the solution to the Cauchy problem for the three-spatial-dimensions combined KdV-mKdV equation with two temporal variables is formulated and presented in the final section.

According to the similar properties of nodes, such as state dimensions and network latency, the node dynamics of each cluster in the network is first modeled. Based on the large-scale system theory, we then propose a novel model of CDNs composed of the three interconnected dynamics: the node dynamics, the intracluster link dynamics and intercluster link dynamics. The CS happens in each cluster, which means that the state errors converge to zero. However, the link dynamics of both intracluster and intercluster are ignored in the existing literature about the CS. In view of this, by using the coupling mechanisms in the link dynamics of intracluster and intercluster and synthesizing the control scheme, the CS of the novel delayed CDNs is asymptotically achieved. The results in this paper show that the CS happens when the two link dynamics can track, respectively, the synthesized auxiliary dynamic tracking targets. Finally, a CDN consisting of various interconnected systems is applied to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

In this work, we focus on the difference between female and male Mpox patients and develop a two-group SEIR model to explore the dynamic of Mpox virus in those countries without animal hosts. In analysis of our model, we calculate the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and prove its stability: globally asymptotically stable if and unstable if . Then, we prove the existence of endemic equilibrium (EE) and numerically discuss the complex dynamics of System (2), which illustrates that for , EE is locally asymptotically stable when , while for relatively close to , there occurs two Hopf bifurcations when . The data we use for the numerical simulation is from the United States, and it provides with a suggestion that the government should pay more attention on the male.},

Firstly, based on the traditional one-dimensional fractional-order Kelvin–Voigt constitutive model, three elements are connected in parallel, and then, the constructed three-parallel fractional-order Kelvin–Voigt stress–strain constitutive model is used to establish the fractional-order dynamic equation of elastic deformation of Euler–Bernoulli beams. Secondly, based on the definition of the shifted Chebyshev polynomial and the constructed vector basis function, the unknown solution function of the elastic beam dynamic equation is approximated. Then, the fractional differential operator matrices and the integer differential operator matrices of the shifted Chebyshev polynomial function are introduced to transform the original equation into a series of vector products. Finally, the unknown variables are discretized using the collocation method, and the equation system is decoupled to obtain the numerical solution of the fractional-order dynamic equation of the Euler–Bernoulli elastic beam. In addition, this article also establishes a convergence analysis theory for the proposed algorithm and provides error limits. In the numerical simulation section, the effectiveness of the algorithm was verified by comparing numerical examples with known analytical solutions and numerical solutions obtained by using the algorithm. Subsequently, four different sets of actual operating parameters were validated for the established Euler–Bernoulli beam dynamics model, and the algorithm was validated for practical problems with unknown analytical solutions by comparing the errors of numerical solutions under different expansion terms.},

This work extends prior research conducted in two dimensions and builds on established results for three-dimensional conductive rod inclusions. The solution to the perturbed problem is formulated using layer potential techniques, and a dedicated asymptotic analysis is employed to characterize the behavior of the associated density functions. We then apply the derived quantitative results to achieve the unique reconstruction of the rod-shaped inclusion using a single boundary measurement. Our asymptotic findings reveal how the geometry of the inclusions influences the perturbed electric field and emphasize the method's efficiency in enabling this reconstruction.},

The deterministic model is formulated considering ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, and the stochastic model is formulated using stochastic differential equation (SDE). The deterministic system has at most three CTLs-containing endemic equilibrium points along with the disease-free equilibrium and the CTLs-free endemic equilibrium points. We have studied local and global stability criteria of the different equilibrium points in terms of the basic reproduction number as well as some of the model parameters. The ODE system experiences transcrical and saddle-node bifurcation with respect to some of the model parameters. On the other hand, the stochasticity is introduced in the model through parameter perturbation. The existence of global positive solution along with stationary distribution of the SDE-model is also established here. Using numerical simulation, we have studied the nature of the solutions in one- and two-parametric planes. It is clear from the simulation results that with the increment of infection rate and proliferation rate, controlling the disease becomes more difficult. Another important result is that there arises stochastic transition when the strength of fluctuation crosses a critical value, which possibly result in increase of infection load in most cases.},

This system is coupled to an age-structured protection equation that takes into account a proportion of susceptible individuals who protect themselves from the disease through medical treatment or vaccination with temporary immunity, for example. The model includes a compartment of exposed individuals to represent diseases with an incubation period. In addition, the model contains a nonlinear saturated incidence rate to describe the interaction between susceptible and infected individuals. By solving the equation associated with the exposed compartment, we obtain a nonlocal integral representation of the exposed population as a function of the nonlinear incidence rate. This reformulation reduces the model to an hybrid system of reaction-diffusion equations coupled to a continuous difference equation that includes a delay and a nonlocal term, reflecting the movement of individuals during the protection and exposure phases. For wave speeds above a certain threshold, we construct lower and upper solutions for the resulting hybrid system. Finally, we apply Schauder's fixed point theorem in an appropriate function space to establish the existence of progressive wave solutions.},

Concurrently, we correlate findings with the behaviors of oceanic waves, yielding some valuable insights. By taking the arbitrary functions as exponential functions, polynomial functions, hyperbolic cosine functions, trigonometric functions, and mixed function, numerous solutions to the equation are obtained as follows: the rogue wave solution, the multikink wave solution, the periodic wave solution, and interaction solutions. Through asymptotic analysis, the superposition of exponential functions leads to the increase in the kink wave numbers. For the rogue wave as the rational function solution, reformulating parameter relations using vectors facilitates the precise determination of its emergence time. Additionally, the impacts of parameters and the order of the rational function on the rogue-wave shape are independently analyzed. Finally, we examine amplitude variations in rogue and periodic waves under the gradual superposition of kink waves. All types of wave profiles are visually displayed in the form of graphics by selecting appropriate parameters.},

Next, for deeper understanding the complex dynamics of the discrete hepatitis C virus model, we first identified the bifurcation sets and then detail bifurcation analysis at equilibria is explored by the bifurcation theory.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a system of partial differential equations designed to model fluid and nutrient transport within the growing tumor microenvironment. The fluid phase, representing both cells and extracellular fluids flowing within the interstitial space, is assumed to be intrinsically incompressible, so that growth can be modeled as a source, generally defined by volumetric growth terms and nonconvective mass fluxes. Specifically, we consider the volumetric growth term proportional to the nutrient concentration and the nonconvective mass flux driven by the nutrient gradient. By exploiting the scale separation between the microscopic vascular structures and the larger tumor tissue, we employ asymptotic homogenization to derive effective macroscopic equations that integrate detailed microscale characteristics. The resulting model operates as a double porous medium framework, where fluid dynamics are driven by both pressure and concentration gradient, which reduces to a more standard Darcy's law when microscale variations of the convective mass flux are neglected. Nutrient transport is captured through a coupled advection–diffusion–reaction system. Permeability and diffusivity tensors, which encapsulate the influence of microvascular geometry, are computed via cell-problem analysis to accurately reflect the microscale structure within the macroscopic model. Given that the tissue model includes a fluid phase that continually exchanges with the surrounding vasculature, along with nutrients, the Kedem–Katchalsky formulation is employed to represent fluid and nutrient transport across the capillary walls. This approach provides valuable insights into the interactions between vascular architecture and tumor growth. Although certain limitations remain, such as the static tumor domain and assumptions regarding cell proliferation, the framework offers a foundation for further development. It is adaptable for numerical simulations based on real tumor geometries, with promising potential to inform and improve anticancer treatment strategies through the integration of patient-specific clinical data.},

  abstract     = {This paper challenges the trade off between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy within the framework of Gaussian space-time processes. Under such a framework, the space-time dependence is completely specified through the space-time covariance function. We compare different classes of space-time covariance functions depending on their supports: when the support is full, information is complete but estimation and prediction are costly. When the support is compact, we only have partial information, but computations are way more efficient. We take a special approach to preserving smoothness at the origin of the covariance when inducing parsimony. This is particularly important because, for Gaussian processes, smoothness is directly linked to the geometric properties of the Gaussian fields, in concert with optimal prediction under certain asymptotic regimes. The instrument used for such comparisons is compatibility , which is in turn a function of equivalence of Gaussian measures under fixed domain asymptotics. We find the parametric restrictions on some classes of covariance functions with compact support to be compatible with those having full support. Such a result has precise consequences in terms of estimation and prediction of Gaussian processes.},

Based on this distinction, the SHEIR model was constructed to adjust the infection rate by incorporating the impact of rumor transmission. First, we examined the SHEIR model's basic reproduction number, confirmed the existence of equilibria, determined the local and global stability of these equilibria simulations, and confirmed the theoretical results. Additionally, sensitivity analysis highlighted the influence of various parameters on epidemic dynamics, particularly under the impact of rumors. Use complex networks to simulate the propagation of SHEIR model, and the validity of the SHEIR model was verified by comparison with actual epidemic data from Jiangsu Province.},

  abstract     = {Exponential decay estimates of a general linear weakly damped wave equation are studied with decay rate lying in a range. Based on the -conforming finite element method to discretize spatial variables while keeping temporal variable continuous, a semidiscrete system is analyzed, and uniform decay estimates are derived with precisely the same decay rate as in the continuous case. Optimal error estimates with minimal smoothness assumptions on the initial data are established, which preserve the exponential decay rate, and for a 2D problem, the maximum error bound is also proved. The present analysis is then generalized to include the problems with nonhomogeneous forcing function, space-dependent damping, and problems with compensator. It is observed that decay rates are improved with large viscous damping and compensator. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to confirm our theoretical findings.},

Using the forward Euler discretization, we analyze the local stability of fixed points and explore the occurrence of flip and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. Additionally, we employ state feedback control to regulate chaotic behavior. Numerical simulations illustrate the impact of parameter variations on system dynamics, complementing the theoretical analysis.

Firstly, the approximate solution and the expression of the amplitude–frequency relationship of the fractional-order nonlinear system are obtained by using the L-P perturbation method and the average method, respectively, and the stability analysis of the system, which is based on Lyapunov's first method, is carried out. Secondly, the effects of fractional-order, internal excitation amplitude, and cubic term coefficients on the amplitude–frequency characteristic curves are investigated separately. Then, the Poincaré section and the global dynamic bifurcation behavior of the system are studied, along with the effect of different types of damping, cubic terms, and internal excitation amplitudes on the dynamic bifurcation of the system. In addition, the homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of the system are investigated, and the necessary condition for the heteroclinic orbit cross-section intersection of the system and chaos in the sense of Smale horseshoe is given by the Melnikov method. Finally, a preliminary investigation of the three-dimensional chaotic jerky dynamical system is carried out, and the computation of the chaotic, hyperchaotic, and equilibrium attractors of the system as well as the Lyapunov exponent is investigated.},

It is worth pointing out that there is no restriction on the viscoelastic damping term in the system, and there are no other types of damping terms. Although it is only a one-dimensional system, this kind of local damping problem has not been studied in the previous literature. In previous studies, most of them discussed the global damping or local viscoelastic damping which must contain an end point. Under such geometric constraints, the previous multiplier method which used to estimate energy cannot be directly applied, as detailed in the paper. For the problem, we make some elaborate techniques, and we obtain the decay rate estimate of the system energy under the assumption of a weaker relaxation function. Thus, we generalize and improve the previous results under the weaker condition.},

  abstract     = {Marriage and divorce are pivotal aspects of societal dynamics, influencing family structures and individual well-being. This research introduces an advanced mathematical model to comprehend the intricate dynamics of marital relationships. Unlike conventional models, which often overlook the unpredictability inherent in human interactions, our model integrates stochastic elements and real-world factors such as mental distress and family issues. Mathematical modeling unveils the dynamics of marriage and divorce, guiding interventions to foster relationship stability and societal cohesion amidst multifaceted influences. However, the deterministic approach is limited due to the randomness of virus behavior. To address this issue, a more realistic stochastic model for computer viruses is considered, which can better capture the unpredictability of virus spread and establish effective preventive measures. The positivity and uniqueness of the model are checked, and the extinction and persistence theorems are proved using Ito's method. Graphical results reveal that an increase in the values of is associated with a rise in the divorce rate within the population. Conversely, an increase in the value facilitates reconciliation among individuals, enabling them to resolve conflicts and reintegrate into a married lifestyle. Numerical simulation shows that when the value of increases, the divorce increases in the population while by increasing the value of , the broken individuals recovered from their conflict and came back to its married lifestyle.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the Stokes flow through a thin porous layer composed of a rigid, thin, periodic, and closely packed array of parallel long rods with a noncircular, anisotropic cross-section in the shape of a slot. This shape allows for the construction of a thicker permeable filter than what is known as the Brinkman critical size. The analysis is restricted to regions far from the top and bottom boundaries, where the flow becomes effectively two-dimensional due to the invariance of the structure in the third dimension. We explore the critical scaling of the filter permeability and various regimes based on the relationships between the obstacle distance, length, and thickness. In addition, the paper presents three new tools: (1) estimates for small periodic obstacles with normal nonpenetration and tangential slip on all rigid boundaries, (2) a rescaled version of the Nečas inequality for thin domains, analogous to Korn's inequalities, and (3) a demonstration of the invariance of estimates under local diffeomorphisms.},

Many two-dimensional stochastic integral equations present significant challenges for analytical solutions. Consequently, possessing an efficient method to get very precise numerical solutions for these stochastic integral equations is of paramount importance. In this article, two novel numerical techniques based on two-dimensional wavelets have been successfully introduced to acquire the numerical solutions of the two-dimensional stochastic Itô–Volterra Fredholm integral equations. This efficient and noteworthy method transforms the stochastic integral equation into a system of algebraic equations, which is then solved using an appropriate numerical technique. Moreover, convergence analysis and the error analysis have also been well established successfully. At the end, some test problems have been presented to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, simplicity, and plausibility of the proposed techniques.},

The local existence of weak solutions is proven using the classical Faedo-Galerkin method in conjunction with the contraction mapping principle. Within the framework of potential wells, the global existence of solutions and energy decay are established when the solution resides in a subset that is smaller than the stable set. Also, it is shown that solutions exhibit exponential growth either when they belong to the unstable set or when the initial energy is negative. Furthermore, the blow-up of solutions is proven by combining the potential well framework with concavity arguments. For solutions with sufficiently positive initial energy, an upper bound for the blow-up time is derived, while a suitable functional is employed to establish a lower bound for the blow-up time.},

Importantly, we use Gauge–Uzawa method to decouple velocity and pressure. The proposed scheme have two distinct features: It does not need to give an initial value of the pressure; it does not require artificial boundary conditions on pressure, thus saving additional computational cost. Second, the unconditional stability of the second-order scheme is proved. Then, through rigorous error analysis, we provide suboptimal convergence orders. Finally, some numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It is also proved that the proposed scheme is superior to other classical second-order scheme.},

We first develop the GLPs and then use them as a new set of basis functions to approximate the unknown parameters of control and state. The Lagrange multipliers method is employed, utilizing the quadrature rule of 2D Gauss–Legendre and operational matrices of fractal–fractional derivatives to solve a system of algebraic equations rather than the original problem. It is also demonstrated that the obtained solution converges to the optimal solution of the problem under investigation. Finally, through a series of numerical experiments, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and compare it to existing approaches. Our findings reveal significant improvements in solution precision and computational efficiency. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the broader field of fractional calculus by establishing new methodologies and identifying potential applications of GLPs in various scientific domains.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a predator–prey system in an advective patchy environment, where the advection rate of each species is proportional to its respective diffusion rate. We utilize the monotonicity property of the principal eigenvalue of the associated linearized operator to derive insights into the dynamical behaviors affected by the spontaneous death rate of predators and the diffusion rates and . Subsequently, we present comprehensive results on the persistence or extinction of both species by analyzing the plane and the plane, employing the theory of uniform persistence and the comparison principle. The successful invasion of predators is significantly influenced by both diffusion and advection rates as well as the death rate. Furthermore, we establish the global stability of a unique positive equilibrium by constructing a spatial Lyapunov functional. We further investigate the impact of diffusion and advection on global dynamics by using numerical simulations and provide deeper insights into the spatial-temporal behavior of the predator–prey system.},

For smooth solutions, classical scaled Laguerre polynomials (SLPs) are employed. For nonsmooth solutions, a new set of generalized Laguerre functions (GLFs) is introduced. To efficiently approximate weakly singular integrals, the interval is transformed into a half-line using a suitable mapping. The Gauss points of the GLFs are then used as the collocation points to approximate the resulting integral. Also, the convergence of the proposed method is analyzed in the weighted -norm.

The pseudodifferential algebra considered in the present work, comprises degenerate partial differential operators on stretched cones which can be locally described as Fuchs type differential operators in appropriate polar coordinates. We present a general approach for the explicit construction of their parametrices, which is based on the concept of an asymptotic parametrix. For some selected partial differential operators, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by an explicit calculation of fundamental solutions and Green's functions from the corresponding parametrices. In our approach, Green's functions are given in separable form, which generalizes the Laplace expansion of Green's function of the Laplace operator in three dimensions. As a concrete application in quantum scattering theory, we construct a fundamental solution of a single-particle Hamilton operator with singular Coulomb potential.},

By employing the extended hyperbolic function method (EHFM), precise results for the derived equation are obtained in the form of bright, dark, singular, and periodic singular solitons for different choices of parameters. By using the Maple and Mathematica, the solutions are graphically depicted as 3D and 2D plots. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of the considered model is investigated by employing the bifurcation theory of planer dynamical system. The novelty of our work lies in the introduction of the square root Kerr law in the dual-mode framework and the first-time application of EHFM and bifurcation analysis to study dual waves in the resonant nonlinear Schrödinger equation (RNLSE).

  abstract     = {The authors propose a new predator–prey game model by integrating two optional strategies into prey species: cooperative and isolation strategies. An investigation of the evolutionary impact on predator–prey system dynamics is given. The model utilizes a replicator equation to track changes in the frequency of cooperative strategy among preys, along with two population growth equations detailing variations in prey and predator biomass. Interestingly, both cooperative and isolated prey strategies can coexist within the prey species. As the predation rate increases, preys are more inclined to adopt cooperative strategies, thereby boosting predator biomass. Abundant resources then encourage preys to opt for cooperative strategies to secure resources and defend against predators. Under specific conditions, the system exhibits intricate dynamics involving bistability, transcritical, and Hopf bifurcations. A novel fractional-order predator–prey game model is then derived using a continuous-time random walk based on a potential physical stochastic process, which is different than the traditional fractional-order models. The influence of fractal dimension on system dynamics is analyzed, showing that it can either diminish or eliminate cooperative strategies within prey species and potentially lead to predator extinction. Interestingly, dimension affects the convergence speed of the system without altering its final steady state: As the fractal dimension and time change, the frequency of cooperative strategies adopted by preys, the biomasses of prey, and predator species ultimately stabilize toward the same steady state, but their rates of approaching to the steady state are different. In this case, only preys survive and cooperative and isolated strategies coexist in prey species. These models can have multiple applications in different settings, aiding with management of animal populations, pest control, tumor immune interactions, and infectious diseases.},

So, this inequality has become an influential concept in a wide range of scientific fields. Besides, interval analysis provides methods for managing uncertainty in data, making it possible to build mathematical and computer models of various deterministic real-world phenomena. In this paper, taking into account all of these, we first present several refinements of the Jensen inequality for the left and right convex interval-valued functions. We also provide examples with corresponding graphs to demonstrate these refinements more clearly. Next, we adopt a novel approach to derive several bounds for the Jensen gap in integral form using the gH-differentiable interval valued functions as well as various related notions. Moreover, we obtain the proposed bounds by utilizing the renowned Ostrowski inequality.

The criterion for presence of equilibria stability is specified as the threshold value basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ . Moreover, a Lyapunov function is constructed for the global stability of the virus-free state, and it is shown that this state is globally asymptotically stable under appropriate conditions. Using the center manifold theory, we proved that there is a backward bifurcation, signifying that the infection cannot be eradicated regardless of whether is less than unity. Further, when the basic production number less than unity, the framework is consistently persistent. This implies that the ratio of an infected population is bounded away from zero, and the bound does not rely upon the initial data after an adequately lengthy timespan if the basic reproduction proportion is more than one. Using Li and Muldowney's principle, the global stability of the model has been discussed. Further, the global sensitivity is carried out to research the best technique to keep the population disease free.

This approach enhances ecosystem sustainability while minimizing overfishing risks and costs. We analyze the Filippov model's dynamics, focusing on sliding mode dynamics using Filippov's convex method. The existence and stability of regular equilibria, tangent points, boundary equilibria, and pseudo-equilibria are investigated, along with conditions for the visibility or invisibility of tangent points. The model can stabilize at different regular equilibria or a pseudo-equilibrium, depending on the parameters and initial conditions, demonstrating bistability. Local and global discontinuity-induced bifurcations, such as boundary node, saddle node, pseudo–saddle–node, sliding–crossing, and adding–sliding bifurcations, are examined numerically.

  abstract     = {The emergence of rumors indisputably poses significant harm to society and individuals. So as to deeply study the mechanism of rumor propagation, this article comprehensively considers various factors such as individual self-awareness, saturation spread rate, and time delay to meticulously formulate a dynamic system of rumor dissemination in online social networks. Initially, the basic reproduction number is derived utilizing the next-generation matrix method, thereby validating the existence of rumor equilibrium points. Secondly, leveraging the Jacobian matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, we rigorously prove the local stability and global asymptotic stability of both the rumor-free equilibrium and the rumor equilibrium. Subsequently, we also delve into the existence conditions of Hopf bifurcation. In addition, a new event-triggered intermittent control strategy is proposed to suppress the spread of rumors. Finally, numerical simulations are proved to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The security of the network is destroyed when a computer virus enters the network as the worm propagates and infects the nodes in the same way an epidemic spreads. It is obvious that in epidemiology, using a constant-order derivative can only describe the classical models, but models using fractional-order derivatives are intrinsically nonfixed. When a derivative has no fixed order, it is more useful in modeling real-world situations. In recent years, several novel approaches linked to fractional operators, such as exponential decay and the Mittag-Leffler kernel, have been suggested, which have overcome the limits of standard fractional-order derivatives. These newly developed operators play an important role in modeling scientific and technical real systems. The fractal–fractional operator is a relatively recent addition to the operators in the realm of fractional calculus. Despite of its nice features, the fractal–fractional operator has not been frequently used in studying the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. This research investigates the dynamics of worms within wireless sensor networks using a special fractal–fractional operator. The fixed-point theorem is used to prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the model under the Atangana–Baleanu (Mittag-Leffler kernel) fractal–fractional operator. A numerical scheme is presented for analyzing disease dynamics in wireless sensor networks under different scenarios. The Newton polynomials serve as the foundation for the newly developed numerical approach. The dynamic of the fractal–fractional system reveals how changes in the geometric aspects might influence disease propagation in these networks.},

For every combination of elementary waves, we provide a solution strategy and derive the two nonlinear algebraic equations of two unknowns. Further, the existence-uniqueness of the Riemann solution is established locally for arbitrary initial data. Moreover, we apply the Newton–Raphson method for the nonlinear algebraic equations to obtain densities across the middle characteristic field.

Several numerical experiments are provided to validate the proposed scheme, with applications to two reaction–diffusion models: the Brusselator and glycolysis systems. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves the expected optimal convergence rate for both the approximate solutions and their first derivatives. To exhibit relevant physical concepts, we demonstrate the convergence behavior of approximate solutions at the stable equilibrium points of the selected reaction–diffusion system with small diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, the nonconvergence behavior is given at unstable equilibrium points.},

To address this issue, we propose a time-fractional equation with a gray level indicator for SAR image denoising. By introducing the time-fractional derivative, the model effectively interpolates between the heat and wave equations, preserving valuable information in highly oscillatory regions. Moreover, the fractional-order derivative operator possesses nonlocal properties, allowing for the inclusion of information from nonlocal domains. In order to achieve better control over the diffusion process, we incorporate a gray level indicator into the diffusion coefficients of our model, which allows us to fully take into account the gray level information of the image. We also investigate the well-posedness of the proposed model. Experiments on natural and real SAR images demonstrate the superiority of our method in removing multiplicative noise, particularly in highly oscillatory regions and texture-rich images.},

Furthermore, by treating the diffusion coefficients of both populations as bifurcation parameters, we derive an algorithm to calculate the normal form of the Turing–Hopf bifurcation for this system, which allows for the analytical determination of the dynamical classifications near the Turing–Hopf bifurcation point.

This paper aims to numerically solve Fredholm integral equations of the second kind in two-dimensional complex domains using a combination of spectral methods and mapping techniques. First, we map the computational domain onto a rectangular domain through coordinate transformation. Then, within this rectangular domain, we employ the classical spectral method for numerical simulation. Our analysis focuses on discussing the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of numerical solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high-order accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, on the basis of the theories and methods of ecology, a deterministic phytoplankton–zooplankton (PZ) model as well as its stochastic differential equation version, which takes into account the synergistic effect of salinity and pH, is established. A key advantage of considering salinity and pH effects is that it can make the dynamic behaviors of the PZ models more realistic, which is fundamentally different from current related researches. The main purpose of this paper is to explore how the synergistic effects of salinity and pH affect the growth dynamics of phytoplankton in deterministic and stochastic disturbance environments. For the deterministic PZ model, we explore the existence of possible equilibrium points, local and global stability, as well as the existence of Hopf bifurcation. For the stochastic PZ model, we study the properties of persistence in the mean, stochastic extinction, and the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution. In addition, we explore the dynamics of critical point extinction, which is often overlooked in most current PZ model studies. Ecologically, via numerical simulations, we find that salinity and pH have a great influence on the dynamics of phytoplankton growth in the deterministic and stochastic environments. It is worth emphasizing that the increase of downstream salinity can destabilize the phytoplankton–zooplankton dynamics, while the decrease of downstream salinity is able to stabilize the phytoplankton–zooplankton dynamics. Additionally, it is revealed that an increase in downstream salinity or a decrease in upstream salinity is not conducive to the growth of zooplankton, but it can trigger the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms when the pH value is in the middle range. These results provide new insights into understanding the complexity of phytoplankton–zooplankton models.},

We begin with a stability analysis of the FHN model, identifying the conditions for Turing and Hopf bifurcations. Our findings reveal that the critical time delay is determined by the largest positive eigenvalue, indicating that the Laplacian network does not affect the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation. Employing the multiple time scales (MTS) method, we derive the amplitude equation to investigate desynchronization and bifurcation in network-organized systems, providing new insights into the mechanism of Turing instability. Our results show that as the largest eigenvalue decreases, the bifurcation points become more densely distributed. Moreover, the bifurcation process consistently involves six transitions, leading to the generation of Hopf bifurcations across all nodes, this serves as the dynamic mechanism for desynchronization. Finally, numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions, providing deeper insights into the associated dynamical and biological mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Epidemics caused by infectious agents, including viruses, are a major threat to humanity, and understanding the underlying dynamics is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate their impact. Elucidating viral behavior, like the absence of detectable infectious viruses during the eclipse phase at the early stages of infection, highlights a key aspect of viral replication that is crucial for preventing and managing infectious diseases. This paper introduces a mathematical model of the immune response incorporating a delay distribution that accounts for the eclipse phase, the period between viral entry into a host cell, and the activation of immune cells for viral production. We perform a qualitative analysis of the model dynamics under a general delay distribution kernel with respect to the basic reproduction number. Specifically, we investigate the existence of a positive infection equilibrium, the global stability of the virus-free equilibrium, the global attractivity of the infection equilibrium, and the persistence of infection. To understand the influence of time delay, we calibrate the model to CD8 T cell (immune cells) clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients from the literature using a variety of delay distributions: Dirac delta, uniform, and gamma. The uniform distribution seems to be the most appropriate model based on different statistical methods, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Then, we conduct a global sensitivity analysis considering the three distributions to identify potential strategies for reducing the viral load when the infection cannot be eradicated. We find that the considered parameters affect the steady state of the viral load to varying extents, depending on the delay distribution. Finally, we modify the model into a treatment model that integrates two treatment strategies: antiviral and immune-modulating treatments, to target viral replication and modulate the immune response. Using computational analysis, we study the impact of these interventions on viral load and immune cell density.},

The input nonlinearity, exhibiting stochastic behavior, is modeled using a probabilistic framework with uncertain probabilities. To effectively characterize scaling attacks, a comprehensive model is introduced. The primary objective of this study is to establish tractable stability conditions with reduced conservatism. Using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii approach, a robust observer-based control strategy is developed, ensuring stability of the system. To further refine the stability conditions, delay fractionizing and matrix inequality techniques are employed, making the results dependent on the delay fraction size. By integrating these techniques, the proposed approach offers a systematic solution to the challenges associated with time-delay systems featuring variable delays and random input nonlinearity. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, demonstrating its ability to achieve the desired system performance under the given conditions.},

Since we only need to solve several linear subsystems at each time step, the numerical solutions can be obtained efficiently. In the spatial discretization, -conforming finite element pair is used to approximate the current density and electric potential, ensuring that the discrete current density is exactly divergence-free. Therefore, the designed numerical scheme maintains the features of linearization, decoupling, unconditional energy stability, charge conservation, and improved mass conservation. The unconditional energy stability and convergence of the algorithm are rigorously analyzed and proven. Numerical results are presented to verify the robustness of the algorithm with respect to the stabilization parameters and to demonstrate the performance of the scheme, particularly in terms of its stability and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In bio-social models, cooperative behavior has evolved as an adaptive strategy, playing multi-functional roles. One of such roles in populations is to increase the success of the survival and reproduction of individuals and their families or social groups. Moreover, collective decision-making in cooperative behavior is an aspect that is used to study the dynamic behavior of individuals within a social group. In this paper, we have focused on population dynamics by considering a predator–prey model as our main exemplification, where the generalist predator has adopted a cooperative hunting strategy while consuming their prey. In particular, we have analyzed the dynamic nature of the system when a nonlocal term is introduced in cooperation. First, the Turing instability condition has been studied for the local model around the coexisting steady-state, followed by the Turing and non-Turing patterns in the presence of the nonlocal interaction term. This work is also concerned with the existence of travelling wave solutions for predator–prey interaction with the nonlocal cooperative hunting strategy. Such solutions are reported for local as well as for nonlocal models. We have characterized the invading speed of the predator with the help of the minimal wave speed of travelling wave solutions connecting the predator-free state to the co-existence state. The travelling waves are found to be non-monotonic in this system. The formation of wave trains has been demonstrated for an extended range of nonlocal interactions. Finally, the importance of psychological effects in shaping the dynamics of nonlocal collective behavior is demonstrated with several representative examples.},

The basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ for dengue is derived, and it is shown that the disease will tend to extinction if R 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ and will remain endemic for R 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ . The model system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation phenomenon with respect to the fractional order ( α $$ \alpha $$ ) and measures taken for source reduction. The model closely fits the data of dengue patients in India collected from 1990 to 2021. The parameters estimated through actual data are used to validate analytical results and predict future dynamics of the disease. The study demonstrates that the disease would be endemic in the country and could be controlled, mitigated, or wiped out by destroying the eggs and larvae of mosquitoes, which are the sources of the growth of the mosquito population. The study also suggests different control measures for the spread and control of the disease},

The mosquito population is demonstrated to either go extinct if R 0 < 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ or achieve stability at a positive periodic solution if R 0 > 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ . In particular, for the critical case of R 0 = 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , the global stability of the mosquito-free state is obtained. Numerically, we conduct our study on the mosquito population in Kadiogo, Burkina Faso.},

Furthermore, in both cases, we have considered some Hamiltonians depending on a positive parameter approximating the Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential and proved the convergence of the Birman–Schwinger operators of such approximations to the corresponding one of the Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential as the parameter goes to zero. The latter result implies the norm resolvent convergence of the approximating Hamiltonians to that of the Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential.},

Six examples have been examined of regularized long-wave equations, widely used in various applied sciences and engineering fields, including space-charge waves, ion-acoustic swells, ocean engineering, tsunami modeling, and plasma. The existence, uniqueness, and stability analysis of the solution demonstrated the efficiency and authenticity of the method, showing that the solutions derived from the alternative variational iteration Elzaki transform method are both convergent and unique. This method generates reliable solutions to a wider class of nonlinear partial differential equations in a simple manner, without the need for discretization, linearization, or computation of Adomian polynomials.

The traditional state feedback control approach is then introduced to the system, and sufficient criteria are derived to ensure the resulting closed-loop system achieves finite-region stability. Considering that the state may be unmeasurable, an observer-based control scheme is implemented, accompanied by explicit controller design schemes for both types of controllers.

In the reference, it has been shown that the model is well-posed, and its long-time behavior is governed by a spreading–vanishing dichotomy. However, the asymptotic spreading speed was not determined. The main purpose of this paper is to study it when spreading happens. Because the positive stationary solutions to the model play a crucial role in analyses, we first verify that such solutions exist by using the squeezing argument to overcome the analytical difficulties brought by the resource-dependent motility. Furthermore, the estimate of asymptotic spreading speed is obtained by the upper–lower solutions method and the associated semiwave problem. Compared to the free boundary problem with random dispersal models, the asymptotic spreading speed not only depends on the resource-dependent motility but also increases in it.},

Based on the similarity transformation and the Hirota bilinear technique, we report both multiple wave kink and single wave kink solutions for two different models of fractional mKdV with time-dependent variable coefficients. We use the fractional Hirota bilinear technique to compute analytical solutions for modified coupled space–time–fractional KdV systems. We construct many kink waves for the proposed fractional differential models under study. For the treatment of nonlinear differential models of integer and fractional orders, the Hirota bilinear technique provides a straightforward and promising method. Recently, researchers have been using symbolic computation—like Maple—to perform these calculations. We investigated whether the results demonstrate the simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of computation of the approach for a range of engineering and physics models. The flexible and random selection of the fractional orders allows us to build deeper structures. Soliton modifications based on fractional order changes enable further applications in applied science.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the complex dynamics of dengue transmission by incorporating time delay into a comprehensive model. The model is designed to capture several essential components, including steady-state events, immune waning, recuperation from infection, and partial shielding in human populations. To further refine our understanding, we introduce a fractional framework that provides a more precise perspective on the finer dynamics of the model. Through the framework of the stability theory of delayed differential equations, this study closely analyzes the stability of local and disease-free equilibria. As the fundamental reproducibility number ( ) exceeds unity, the experiment exhibits instability. This provides the basis for delay-parameterized Hopf bifurcation analysis. The stability conditions for local equilibrium are explained, and reliable numerical simulations confirm the mathematical framework and provide strong support for our conclusions. Additionally, the study uses fixed-point theory to verify that the model has a unique solution. In addressing the subtleties of fractional-order differential equations, we use the Laplace–Adomian decomposition method, assigning a unique fractional order ( ) to each segment. The resulting approximate solutions are visualized through graphical depictions, providing valuable insights into the influence of fractional parameters ( ) on the complex dynamics underlying dengue transmission. This research, with its holistic overview and innovative methodology, makes a significant contribution to our understanding of dengue dynamics. The implications of these findings extend to the area of public health strategies, improving our ability to plan interventions and reduce the impact of dengue on vulnerable populations.},

Specifically, we focus on MAX (and MIN) multistate networks, whose dynamics are governed by global arbitrary -maxterm (or -minterm) functions, which extend the well-known maxterm (or minterm) Boolean functions. More specifically, we tackle the problem of analyzing the combinatorial dynamics of these networks. As a result, we determine the types of periodic orbits that can exist and coexist jointly, when all vertices are self-loop and the graph is undirected. In particular, we show that only fixed points and 2-periodic orbits can appear in these systems by employing tools coming from algebra and graph theory. That is, regardless of the (finite or infinite) number of elements, the types of periodic orbits remain the same as those of MAX and MIN Boolean networks. However, we demonstrate that the coexistence of fixed points and 2-periodic orbits is possible in these networks, which contrasts with the known results for the Boolean case. Moreover, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions to characterize the existence of fixed points and 2-periodic orbits, as well as their coexistence.},

We first provide a general framework to model this situation by means of constrained Riemann problems and provide some theoretical results. A key issue for both the validity of a coupling model and the robustness of numerical schemes to find solutions is whether the coupling Riemann solver is coherent. This property implies that applying the coupling Riemann solver to the traces at the junction of a coupling solution results in finding the same solution locally. We also give theoretical results for coherence. Then, we consider several couplings; we discuss the uniqueness of the corresponding solvers and, in particular, their coherence. Surprisingly, some solvers of wide use are proven not to be uniquely defined, and others are not coherent. We present numerical examples to illustrate this property.},

In other words, the viscosity for the magnetic field equation can be zero and the system may still be dissipative. To understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we will focus on 3D quantum magnetohydrodynamic model for quantum plasmas without magnetic dissipation in the periodic box and examine the stability near a background magnetic field. Due to the lack of dissipation for density and magnetic field, this stability problem is not trivial. By exploiting the cancellation structure of the system and introducing several new unknown quantities, we prove the global well-posedness of strong solutions in the framework of Soboles spaces. In addition, the time decay rates of the solutions are also obtained. To our knowledge, this is the first global well-posedness result for the quantum magnetohydrodynamic model without magnetic dissipation.},

  abstract     = {A widely applied technology of gravity-driven solid–liquid separation in mineral processing is the use of lamella settlers. These units are continuously operated tanks equipped with a number of parallel inclined plates immersed in the mixture to be separated. The inclination of the plates exploits the well-known Boycott effect that describes the enhancement of settling rates beneath inclined surfaces. This effect is usually attributed to a rapidly upward-streaming layer of clear liquid. The essence of this effect can be studied by examining gravity settling in an inclined tube or rectangular channel. The lower and upper surfaces of the channel represent the plate onto which the particles start to settle and below which the clarified liquid streams upward, respectively. In addition, an increase of temperature in some part of the fluid causes a local change in the density of the fluid and circulation of the fluid within the vessel. It has been proposed to exploit this behavior to accelerate the settling process by additional heating. To examine this hypothesis, a model and corresponding numerical method to describe inclined settling enhanced by natural convection are formulated. The model consists of a two-dimensional scalar conservation law for the solids concentration coupled with a version of the Stokes system that accounts for density fluctuations in the mixture enhanced by a Boussinesq approximation of the effect of temperature. In addition, a convection–diffusion equation describes heat transport and diffusion. The main outcome is a numerical method that allows one to simulate the effect of controllable parameters such as the initial concentration, difference of temperature, and angle of inclination on the progress of the solid–liquid separation. Numerical examples are presented. Results reconfirm that the enhancement of settling rates depends critically on the dimensions of the settling vessel, intensity of heating, and particle size and is marginal for settling of relatively large particles and channels with a moderate length to width aspect ratio.},

These inequalities provide an innovative approach to integral approximation, refining existing results for specific parameter choices, including the Midpoint, Trapezoidal, Simpson's, Newton's, Maclaurin's, and Weddle's formulas. This development is particularly significant in numerical analysis, where precise integral approximations are critical, such as solving differential equations and implementing methods like the finite volume method. The paper highlights that multiplicative calculus delivers more accurate absolute error bounds than classical calculus, especially for higher-degree polynomials. Notably, the proposed inequalities streamline computations by eliminating the need to derive each inequality individually. By adjusting parameters, these results allow for efficient determination of error bounds for various quadrature formulas. Applications to numerical integration and special means for real numbers are explored, demonstrating the practical utility and accuracy of the proposed inequalities. A detailed mathematical example, supported by 2D and 3D visualizations, further validates the performance of these results. This work advances numerical methods and provides valuable insights into applying the Newton–Cotes-type inequalities in mathematical research, computation, and integration techniques.},

Results indicate that the model's predictions align closely with actual values for an appropriate parameter set range. Critical parameters that significantly influence disease transmission have been identified. These key parameters are further validated using an artificial neural network approach.

Due to the sharp length scale separation that exists between the scale where we can visibly and distinctly identify the connected fluid compartment and the poroelastic matrix, and the scale of the overall material body, we apply the asymptotic homogenization technique to derive the new model. The latter consists of a macroscale system of PDEs involving the zeroth order contribution of pressures, velocities, solute concentration, and elastic displacements. It effectively accounts for the fluid and solute transport between the poroelastic matrix and a fluid network compartment. The model coefficients are to be computed by solving the periodic cell differential problems arising from application of the asymptotic homogenization technique.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a numerical scheme for approximating the solution of a variable coefficient multiterm Caputo time-fractional convection–reaction–diffusion (MTCTFCRD) model, which generally exhibits a weak singularity at . The L1 technique is used to discretize the time-fractional derivative (TFD) on a nonuniform mesh, while the space derivative is discretized on a uniform mesh using a fourth-order compact finite difference (CFD) technique. The stability analysis of the method is introduced. The convergence analysis of the method is also rigorously investigated. Numerical examples are presented to corroborate in practice the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed technique and to validate the theoretical results as well. To justify the advantage of the suggested scheme, we compare the outcomes with those obtained by the uniform mesh technique. It is shown that the nonuniform mesh method attains an optimal-order convergence in the temporal direction, whereas the uniform grid method fails to deliver an optimal order of convergence. The method is of fourth-order accuracy in space. The computational times for the proposed numerical scheme have been provided.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Turing instability in coupled reaction–diffusion systems has garnered extensive attention from numerous researchers. Nevertheless, the majority of extant studies primarily concentrate on the Turing instability of constant steady states, with comparatively few delving into the Turing instability of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions. The main purpose of the present paper is to analyze Turing instability of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions to a bimolecular chemical reaction model with saturation law and linear spatial diffusion. By means of the perturbation theory of reaction–diffusion systems, a sufficient condition to Turing instability of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions in a general higher dimensional reaction–diffusion system with linear diffusion is provided. We generalize the associated result to the scenario of a general spatial domain featuring a smooth boundary, which is neither the entirety of space nor a star-type spatial domain. In the case of two-dimensional reaction–diffusion system, formulas for the first Lyapunov coefficient of Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions of the associated ODE system and the first-order derivative of period of Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions at the critical parameter value of the needed perturbed ODE system are given. Then Turing instability of spatially homogeneous periodic solutions of the bimolecular reaction–diffusion model is analyzed. Numerical simulations are also carried out in order to verify the main theoretical predictions.},

The mathematical analysis of the model shows several regimes of inflammation progression, namely, the setup of a chronic inflammation, low-grade inflammation, hyperinflammation, and a noninflammatory state. We also examine the existence of traveling wave solutions and focus on describing the wave speed of inflammation propagation by analytical and numerical methods.

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission and the impact of vaccination, employing fractional-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model incorporates both direct and indirect transmission pathways. Direct transmission refers to person-to-person spread through droplets, while indirect transmission arises from contact with contaminated objects. The indirect pathway is explicitly modeled by introducing compartments for infectious and clean objects, along with interaction terms reflecting contamination and exposure dynamics. The advantages of fractional-order approaches, including improved prediction accuracy and flexibility in analyzing complex dynamics, are highlighted. The role of vaccination in reducing susceptibility, transmission rates, and symptom severity is explicitly addressed. Reliable data sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer , and regional health authorities across diverse regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia, are utilized. Using generalized Tikhonov regularization, the model estimates unknown parameters through robust parameter estimation based on daily COVID-19 case data. Stability and equilibrium analyses provide insights into public health implications, demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions such as widespread vaccination and social distancing. The model's robustness in handling noisy data and addressing epidemiological challenges is underscored through comparisons with conventional parameter estimation methods.},

Second, the Melnikov method was used to obtain the conditions for the system to enter chaos in the sense of Smale horseshoe. Then, by combining bifurcation diagrams, time series diagrams, phase diagrams, and Poincar é cross-sections, the system was analyzed to explore the occurrence of nonsingular chaotic attractors when the system enters chaos. This approach is not limited to qualitative analysis but rather detects the existence of SNAs through three-dimensional Poincaré cross-sections and quantitative methods. Finally, the influence of initial values on system safety, as well as the erosion phenomenon of amplitude and excitation parameters on the boundary of the system safety basin, was obtained. The evolution law of the system safety basin was analyzed, and the erosion and bifurcation mechanism of the safety basin was studied.},

To effectively address current and potential future infectious disease emergencies, global academia has actively engaged, utilizing highly specialized epidemic dynamic models to analyze the spread and inherent patterns of diseases. This paper delves into the construction and examination of an innovative semi-Markov switching diffusion model, which comprehensively considers the dual effects of hospital bed capacity constraints and vaccination strategies on disease transmission. Specifically, we first theoretically ensure the positivity of solutions in our stochastic epidemic model, a fundamental prerequisite for its validity. Subsequently, we ingeniously construct a triplet Markov process that meets specific conditions and rigorously proving its Feller property. These derivations not only deepen our understanding of the model's internal mechanisms but also provide a solid theoretical foundation for establishing the basic reproduction number as the pivotal threshold parameter that determines the future trajectory of the disease (i.e., eradication or persistence). Specifically, an below 1 signifies effective disease control and eventual eradication, whereas an above 1 indicates sustained transmission within the population, accompanied by the existence of a stationary distribution in the stochastic model, posing a severe challenge for public health.},

Their study has become essential across science, engineering, and mathematics due to their unique ability to describe systems with nonlocal interactions. In this paper, we study the uniqueness, existence, and stability for a new nonlinear FDE with functional boundary condition (which describes nonlocal properties) based on several well-known fixed-point theorems, the two-parameter Mittag–Leffler function, and an implicit integral equation obtained from inverse operators. Several examples are presented to demonstrate applications of our key theorems. Furthermore, we also indicate that the method used can deal with PDEs, with various initial or boundary conditions.},

To study this complex climate system, in this paper, we propose a deterministic and two stochastic mathematical models to describe the climate system of vegetation- CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ -temperature and investigate the dynamical behavior of their solutions. Initially, a deterministic model (ODE) is developed by taking into account the relationship among temperature, CO 2 $$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ , and vegetation. The existence and linearized stability of vegetation-free and vegetation-cover equilibria for this model are discussed by applying Lyapunov functions method. Based on this, through introducing stochastic disturbances, we further establish two (periodic) stochastic models, and the asymptotic behavior of their solutions is studied as well, including existence of (periodic) positive solutions, linearized stability, and global attractiveness of the vegetation-free steady point. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are illustrated and discussed through numerical simulations.},

We regularize by a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) determined by the data and the underlying linear operator. This RKHS arises naturally in a variational approach, and its closure is the function space in which we can identify the true solution. Also, we introduce a small noise analysis to compare regularization norms by sharp convergence rates in the small noise limit. Our analysis shows that the RKHS- and -regularizers yield the same convergence rate when their optimal hyperparameters are selected using the true solution, and the RKHS-regularizer has a smaller multiplicative constant. However, in computational practice, the RKHS regularizer significantly outperforms the commonly used - and -regularizers in producing consistently converging estimators when the noise level decays or the observation mesh refines.},

Initially, the rationalized form of Haar functions is introduced, alongside their properties and their relationship with the Heaviside step function. Subsequently, the operational matrix of Haar functions product and the generalized operational matrix of fractional-order integration are derived. These matrices, along with collocation techniques, facilitate the transformation of the continuous system into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, which can be solved efficiently by using Newton's iterative method. The error bound and convergence analysis are given. The method is computationally attractive, and some numerical examples demonstrate its accuracy and applicability in solving the system of fractional-order FVIDEs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the authors investigate the global and exponential dissipativity of quaternion-valued inertial neural networks (QVINNs) with mixed time-varying delays, without utilizing order reduction of inertial neural networks (INNs) and quaternion separation methods. Using innovative Lyapunov functional and inequality techniques, several fruitful sufficient criteria with multi-parameters are derived for QVINNs to ensure global dissipativity (GD), which generalizes and refines existing results. This article estimates the attractive sets and exponentially attractive sets globally. Unlike previous studies in which quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) are separated into real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) and INNs are reduced into first-order systems, the foundation of this article rests upon approaches that diverge from the traditional methods of separation and order reduction. Unlike existing results on the GD of traditional neural networks (NNs) with bounded discrete time delays, this article focuses on INNs with unbounded discrete time-varying delays, which is more realistic because neurons consider their entire past rather than partial history within bounded time delays. In general, in exponential stability, synchronization, and dissipativity results, researchers typically impose an upper bound on the rate of convergence , but in the present article, the authors investigate dissipativity criteria without such a restriction on the convergence rate in global exponential dissipativity (GED). Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of our theoretical work, three consecutive examples are proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. The first two examples verify the proposed results, and the third one, related to QVNNs, redemonstrates the efficiency of storing true color image patterns.},

Second, utilization of DGJIM yields the approximate solutions to the problem in series form, which leads to the analytical solution. The novelty of this research is the analytic solution to time fractional RHP with the help of pattern relation among the approximate solutions by proposed method. To the best knowledge of authors, the analytical solution to time fractional RHP has not been established by any research.

By varying the parameters, the local and global behavior of the system is illustrated through the phase portraits. Second, we explore the system's chaotic behavior under different initial conditions through phase portraits in 2D and 3D, time series, Poincaré diagrams, and multistability analysis. We also derive exact traveling wave solutions for the modified RLW-Burger model using the modified simple equation method. For specific values of the free parameters, we provide a detailed analysis of these solutions, supported by unique diagrams. Furthermore, the modulation instability of the proposed model is investigated in detail. Understanding the dynamic properties of such systems is essential for predicting outcomes and developing new technologies.

But as the interpolation points or frequency increase, the interpolation matrix becomes dense and highly ill-conditioned. To ensure a stable and efficient computation of Bessel and Airy integrals, we implement the Levin method with compactly supported radial basis functions. Although the accuracy of the new algorithm has not significantly improved compared to the counterpart methods. Alternatively, the method exhibits faster and well-conditioned behavior, even for large numbers of data points and large frequency parameters.

The uniquely solvable and positivity-preserving properties of the numerical solution are established at a theoretical level.

Specifically, we define the associated Nehari manifold by considering the first derivative of the fibering mapping. Subsequently, we partition the Nehari manifold into three disjoint subsets based on the second derivative of the fibering function.

The variational principle of the internal energy functional and the virtual work for the external forces are used to derive the field equations and boundary conditions. Additionally, we show that the derived nonlinear partial differential equation can be considered a Boussinesq-type equation, which includes only one nonlinear term, whereas the new equation contains three nonlinear terms. Therefore, this equation can be used to study the dispersive behavior of wave propagation in various fields where both higher order spatial derivatives and nonlinear terms influence partial differential equations. Analyzing such an equation often requires advanced mathematical techniques or numerical methods, depending on the specific initial and boundary conditions. Furthermore, kink and soliton solutions for the new nonlinear partial differential equation were introduced using d'Alembert's solution, and the results are plotted and analyzed.},

Based on some principles of convexity, Hölder inequality, and power-mean inequality, novel inequalities are derived. The acquired inequalities are supported by illustrative examples, which are calculated via their proofs. Additionally, graphical representations are to verify the examples visually. Furthermore, this investigation unveils fresh findings within the realm of inequalities.},

Thus, understanding the tail behavior is crucial in decision making and risk assessment. Statistical analysis and predictions of extreme events often require the estimation of the extreme value index, a key parameter that describes the tail heaviness. We present a new class of estimators of a positive extreme value index, based on probability weighted moment method, a flexible framework for tail inference. The asymptotic normality of the introduced class of estimators is established, and a comparison with the Hill estimator is also provided. The effectiveness of the proposed class of estimators is demonstrated through both simulation studies and a real data application, highlighting their potential in extreme value analysis.},

We prove that if the boundedness condition is satisfied for both the norms of reset products and the inverses of reset matrices, then the stability of a switched system with state reset under arbitrary switching is equivalent to the stability of the corresponding time-varying system obtained through dynamic reduction without reset. In cases where only the reset matrices satisfy the boundedness condition, we establish stability criteria using quadratic Lyapunov functions related to these reset matrices.},

  abstract     = {The dry friction coupled vibration system represents a typical nonsmooth system, and the investigation of the dynamic characteristics of nonsmooth systems is of great significance for mechanical control, safe operation, and the formulation of engineering standards. In this paper, the theory of periodic orbits and bifurcations in a class of high-dimensional piecewise smooth discontinuous systems is explored in response to the need for mathematical theory and practical applications and is applied to study the dynamic characteristics of a two-degree-of-freedom dry friction coupled vibration system. A global Poincaré map is constructed, and the center manifold method for smooth systems is extended to derive sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of an invariant cone. Based on Floquet theory, the stability of the invariant cone composed of periodic orbits is demonstrated. Additionally, the bifurcation phenomena and the persistence problem of the invariant cone are investigated. The parameter conditions for the periodic orbits generated by Hopf-like bifurcation induced by nonlinear disturbances are further considered, and the stability of periodic orbit is determined. The distribution configurations of the trajectories are obtained through numerical simulations to validate the accuracy of the theoretical findings. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for parameter optimization and vibration control in high-dimensional dry friction coupled vibration systems within engineering practice.},

Under certain appropriate conditions, the global convergence of the method is established. Furthermore, two types of numerical experiments are presented: (i) tests of nonlinear equations involving monotone mappings and (ii) image restoration problems. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving constrained nonlinear equations and in restoring blurred and noisy images, outperforming the compared methods.},

Convergence analysis and numerical experiments in Simulink will show the efficiency and the accelerated convergence ability of the proposed dynamical system.

  abstract     = {Models of infectious disease dynamics suggest that treatment, vaccination, and isolation are required for the control of infectious diseases. Considering that vaccination is one of the most effective methods to control infectious diseases, it is often not possible to rapidly vaccinate all susceptible populations in the early stages of the spread of infectious diseases due to the limitation of the number of vaccines, insufficient medical personnel, or the slow progress of vaccination efforts. Our simulation analysis by building a susceptible-vaccinated-infected-waned-removed-death (SVIWRD) model found that the degree of negative impact of infectious diseases shown when young and old people were divided into two populations and vaccinated at different rates was different. Therefore, for the current problem of continued spread of COVID-19, we consider the infectious disease dynamics model to achieve the goal of making the risk of COVID-19 infection lower by controlling the proportion of vaccination of elderly and young people. In this paper, we divided young and old people into two groups, established an SVIWRD model, performed single-objective optimization using Pontryagin's maximum principle, and used the Runge–Kutta method for numerical calculation and simulation, so as to arrive at a certain vaccination ratio that plays the effect of reduced negative impact of COVID-19.},

Previous approaches introduced new spectral parameters and addressed such problems using a modified secant condition and quasi-Newton directions. We modify the search direction and integrates an inertial technique to improve numerical efficiency. The proposed method consistently ensures that the search direction satisfies the sufficient descent property independent of the method's line-search. We establish global convergence and a linear convergence rate under some standard assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's strong performance, especially for large-scale problems. We also showcase its practical applications in logistic regression, a key model in data analysis, and sparse signal recovery, a prominent area in signal processing. The results emphasize the method's superior efficiency and effectiveness in these fields.},

Then we utilize the Liouville–Green transformation technique to derive a recurrence relation comprising three terms, which can be solved by using the Thomas algorithm. A look into the method's stability and convergence has been done. The MATLAB R2022a mathematical software has been used to obtain the computational results and plots. Almost second-order accuracy is achieved with the scheme derived. The numerical findings have been compiled into tables and graphs have been provided to visualize the impact of delay on the solution boundary layer and oscillatory behavior. The convergence rate of the present method has been determined theoretically and numerically, and both are shown to agree. In brief, the present method enhances the results of certain previously published numerical approaches.},

We firstly solve the incompressible MHD equations by the Newton iterations on a coarse mesh with the mesh size , stability and convergence results of numerical solutions are provided. Secondly, the combination of the two-level method with the Newton iteration is used to approximate the considered problem, a coupled nonlinear problem is solved on the coarse mesh , then the Stokes and Maxwell equations are considered on a fine mesh with the mesh size , the uniform stability and optimal error estimates of two-level Newton iterative method are provided. Theoretical findings show that the two-level method has the same order as the one-level method in -norm as long as the mesh sizes satisfy . However, the two-level method involves much less work than the one-level method. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the considered numerical schemes.},

We initiate our investigation by studying the QPFT of 2D quaternionic signals, and later on, we introduce the Q-QPFT of 2D quaternionic signals. Using the fundamental relationship between the Q-QPFT and quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), we derive the inversion, Parseval's, and Plancherel's formulae associated with the Q-QPFT. Some other properties including linearity, shift, and modulation of the Q-QPFT are also studied. Finally, we formulate several classes of uncertainty principles (UPs) for the Q-QPFT like Heisenberg-type UP, logarithmic UP, Hardy's UP, Beurling's UP, and Donoho–Stark's UP. This study can be regarded as the first step in the applications of the Q-QPFT in the real world.},

We apply WG-FEM on a Bakhvalov mesh for spatial discretization, coupled with the Crank–Nicolson scheme for time discretization on a uniform mesh. The standard Lagrange interpolation is commonly used in error analysis for the finite element method when solving convection-dominated problems. However, when applied to Bakhvalov-type meshes, this interpolation can lead to instability, particularly within specific section of the mesh known as problematic region. To address this issue and accurately capture the solution's behavior in this region, a special interpolation, represented as , is introduced. The primary outcome of this study demonstrates that the weak Galerkin solution on the Bakhvalov mesh achieves a parameter-free error bound of order in the spatial direction, along with second-order convergence in the temporal direction.

  abstract     = {Bacteriophages, or phages (viruses of bacteria), play significant roles in shaping the diversity of bacterial communities within the human gut. A phage-infected bacterial cell can either immediately undergo lysis (virulent/lytic infection) or enter a stable state within the host as a prophage (lysogeny) until a trigger event, called prophage induction, initiates the lysis process. We develop an approach based on a model structured in terms of time since bacterial infection. We derive important threshold parameters for the asymptotic dynamics of the system and demonstrate that the model's qualitative behavior can range from the extinction of all bacterial types to the persistence of a single type (either lysogenic or nonlysogenic bacteria) or the coexistence of all populations at a positive steady state. We highlight the existence of critical time delay values that lead to the coexistence of all states through periodic oscillations. We also conduct a global sensitivity analysis for an effective bacterial clearance. In scenarios where antibiotics are not sufficiently effective, we identify four key phage parameter traits: (i) the phage induction probability, describing the capacity of prophages to be induced, (ii) the probability of absorption, describing the phages' ability to invade susceptible bacteria, (iii) the reproduction number of susceptible bacteria in the absence of antibiotics, and (iv) the latent period, describing the time since absorption. The obtained results emphasize the effective therapeutic potential of selected phages.},

  abstract     = {The persistent rise in unemployment rates poses a significant threat to global economic stability. Addressing this challenge effectively requires a deeper understanding of workforce dynamics, particularly through the integration of an individual's employment history into analytical models. This research introduces a fractional mathematical model, leveraging the Caputo fractional derivative and three key variables: the number of skilled unemployed individuals, the number of employed individuals, and the number of available job vacancies. The model's well-posedness and global stability are rigorously established using fixed-point theory. Additionally, the basic reproduction number is analyzed to identify critical factors that facilitate the creation of new job opportunities. Real-world data from India are employed for MATLAB simulations, offering predictions of unemployment trends in the coming years. A graphical analysis highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates. The model's predictive accuracy is demonstrated through error analysis, showing that fractional-order forecasts achieve less than 5% error, outperforming integer-order models in capturing the nuances of unemployment dynamics. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the employment rate is the most influential parameter; a 40% increase in this rate could lead to 192,200 additional employed individuals. The fractional-order model further exhibits superior performance metrics, including lower root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values, alongside a higher correlation coefficient ( ). These findings underscore the model's potential to enhance the understanding and mitigation of unemployment challenges.},

  abstract     = {Integro-differential equations (IDE) have been applied in a variety of areas of research, including epidemiology. Recently, IDE systems were applied to study dengue fever transmission dynamics at the population level. In this study, we extend the approach presented in a previous study for describing the epidemiological model of dengue fever. In this paper, we find the exact solutions of the corresponding linearized system model by constructing the Cauchy and Green's matrices. Furthermore, we extend our investigation towards estimating the solutions of a closely related nonlinear system. Given that the coefficients of the model are only known approximately, we address the problem of the stability of a system with uncertain coefficients. Furthermore, we estimate the influence of errors in the coefficient determination on solution behavior.},

Furthermore, we examine the stability of the solutions using Ulam–Hyers theorems. Two well-detailed examples and one explicit solution are provided to illustrate the practical applicability and validity of our theoretical results. The solution's parameter conditions detail the amplitude, energy, wavelength, frequency, and propagation characteristics of waves. These parameters capture the intricate balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects that shape the wave phenomena modeled by the Korteweg–de Vries equation. The solution indicates that as the amplitude parameter increases, wave height also rises due to a higher wave number (shorter wavelength) and nonlinear amplification, resulting in more waves within a given interval. The amplitude further increases with the wave number due to higher energy levels associated with shorter wavelengths.},

For single-stage scenarios, the saddle-point equilibrium is derived with relative ease. In the case of multistage scenarios, we derive equilibrium equations governing the saddle-point equilibrium solutions, and these equations are used to obtain the equilibrium of bang-bang and linear quadratic zero-sum games. The study is further extended to multistage time-delayed zero-sum games, where an equivalent transformation approach is proposed to determine equilibrium solutions under noncausal and causal system constraints. Finally, the effectiveness of the results is demonstrated through numerical examples.},

Then, using very broader assumptions regarding the relaxation function and the behavior of the nonlinear dissipative term near the origin, we establish an explicit and optimal formula for the energy decay rate of this system irrespective of the wave speeds of propagation. For, we utilize a multiplier method in conjunction with properties of some convex functions. As the interaction between the considered dampings has never been studied and the hypotheses are more general than the ones in recent papers, our research work makes a novel contribution and it improves several previous results.},

This strategy works well for heat equations under general boundary conditions. However, it leads to hyperbolic problems including damping terms of the form ∇ u t $$ \nabla {u}_t $$ for wave equations, which we are able to solve with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Our innovative approach provides a strong foundation in the mathematical principles behind SFM and enables direct application to stochastic symmetric and cross-product matrices. That allows us to introduce a more robust inference structure based on F tests. In addition, the assumptions of homoscedasticity between the vectors of homologous components were validated using ANOVA, which increases the use of factor design analyses in families of models. Empirical validation is provided through a case study on durum wheat cultivars ( Triticum turgidum L., Durum Group), revealing significant effects of year and location on cultivar behavior.

The essential properties like positivity, boundedness, existence, uniqueness, equilibria (hepatitis-free equilibrium [HFE] and hepatitis-existing equilibrium [HEE]), reproduction number, sensitivity analysis, and stability result in the sense of local and second-order stability result in the sense of global are studied rigorously before an extension of the model. The nonparametric perturbation and transition probabilities ways used to extend analysis. Also, the positivity, boundedness, extinction, and persistence of disease are studied rigorously. Due to the high complexity of nonlinear stochastic delay differential equations, computational methods are used to visualize the results with data from the model. Unfortunately, the existing methods (Euler–Maruyama, stochastic Euler, and stochastic Runge–Kutta) in the literature fail to restore the dynamical properties of the model and make a comparison with the newly proposed construction of nonstandard finite difference method in the sense of stochastic. In the proposed method, all dynamic properties of the model are restored with a free choice of time steps, and it is efficient. For convenience, a computational code of the nonstandard discrete model may be provided to the readers at their request.},

In particular, we exploit the difference in the orders of magnitude of physical parameters arising in the model equations and present a new mathematical method that adapts to the mathematical model in question to benefit convergence. The proposed method serves not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a means to construct rapidly convergent dynamic iterations. In developing the method, we, for the first time, formulate and prove principles to identify classes of mathematical models for which such dynamic iterations converge rapidly for systems of arbitrary dimensions. To do so, we investigate the propagation of the errors of the iterations applied to -dimensional systems of differential equations arising from the linearization of mathematical models involving a separation of scale, both in closed form and in the form of error bounds. We devise a set of new principles, which offer two key benefits: First, they serve as guidelines for constructing rapidly convergent methods, and second, they aid in identifying classes of problems for which such schemes are advantageous. Our theoretical findings and illustrative examples reveal that convergence is model-dependent, while offering insight into how to design dynamic iterations to benefit convergence, depending on the order of magnitude of parameters inherent to the linearization of a given mathematical model.},

The innovation of this scheme lies in introducing a suitable stabilization term aimed at optimizing the structure and stability performance of the solution. By conducting meticulous mathematical derivations, we conclusively show that the proposed scheme possesses almost-unconditional stability, provided that the time step ( Δ t ) $$ \left(\Delta t\right) $$ remains confined within a specified constant range. In addition, employing the Stokes and Ritz projections, we present error estimates for essential physical quantities including velocity ( u ) $$ (u) $$ , pressure ( p ) $$ (p) $$ , and the conformation tensor ( θ ) $$ \left(\theta \right) $$ , which maintain second-order convergence accuracy in appropriate norms. To validate the practicality and effectiveness of this scheme, in the numerical test section, we initially present the linear CNLF numerical scheme. Two analysis numerical examples are provided: one for calculating the spatial convergence order and the other for determining the temporal convergence order. Additionally, we validate the stability of the scheme using driven cavity flow simulations, and compute the kinetic energy, entropy, and free energy.},

Firstly, with the Lyapunov functions, the existence of global unique positive solution is proved. Then, the sufficient criteria that control the disease's extinction and persistence of the disease are identified through the Khasminskii theory and stochastic comparison theorem. Epidemiologically, it is found that the larger proportions of the intensity of volatility and the speed of reversion can suppress the outbreak of diseases.

The augmented variables, which are unknowns, are incorporated into a Schur complement system that is solved using the generalized minimal residual iterative method. Once the augmented variables have been determined, an existing cyclic reduction algorithm is employed to rapidly solve the discretized system. This approach not only enhances computational efficiency for solving axisymmetric Helmholtz equations with complex interfaces or boundaries but also effectively addresses high wave number problems and obstacle problems.

For age-dependent predation interactions, the existing results mainly take the impact of delay into consideration. In this article, we revisit a predation interactions with the fear effect. Our objective is to take the influence of distributed delay into account and develop the basic theory of an ODE–PDE system of age-dependent predation interactions with fear effect and distributed delay. Concretely, firstly, we establish an ODE–PDE system of age-dependent predation interactions with fear effect and distributed delay. Secondly, the system is formulated into an abstract nondensely defined Cauchy problem. Thirdly, by employing the operator semigroups theory and spectral analysis under some conditions, we obtain the local stability, instability, and asynchronous exponential growth of system.},

The viscoelastic behavior of the beam is described using a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model, which implements a parallel combination of spring and spring-pot elements. A hybrid approach based on the piecewise Chebyshev cardinal functions (PCCFs) and Chebyshev cardinal functions (CCFs) is utilized for solving this equation. In this way, some operational matrices of these basis functions are obtained. By considering a hybrid expansion of the problem's solution via the PCCFs for the temporal variable and CCFs for the spatial variable and employing the interpolation property of these basis functions, together with the collocation scheme, the solution of the problem is obtained via solving a related algebraic system of equations. In addition, we provide an analytical solution for the problem in classical mode. The results indicate that the proposed numerical approach exhibits excellent capability in solving the fractional differential equation. Furthermore, the study investigates the effects of different parameters such as the thickness-to-length ratio, type of applied loading, and fractional derivative order on the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {The growth of tumor cells involves complex interactions with the immune response. We propose a simple two-stage model that describes the interaction between tumor cells and lymphocytes, where it is assumed that lymphocytes undergo two stages of development (immature and mature) and that only mature lymphocytes can kill tumor cells. The model incorporates a linear function to represent the effect of tumor antigen stimulation and a logistic model to describe the tumor growth in the absence of immune response. We analyze the oscillatory behavior of tumor levels from three perspectives: the intrinsic growth rate of tumor, the killing rate of lymphocytes against tumor cells, and the stimulation effect of tumor antigens on the immune system. Supported by theoretical analysis of Hopf bifurcation, we observe distinct differences among these factors. The oscillation occurs between two critical values for the intrinsic growth rate and the killing rate of lymphocytes, while for the stimulation effect of tumor antigens, there is a single critical value that triggers the oscillation. Numerical simulations show that strong tumor antigen stimulation can induce long-term dormancy in tumor growth. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between the local and global stability of the tumor-free equilibrium using the fluctuation lemma and derive a sufficient condition on the global attractivity of the tumor-present equilibrium by constructing auxiliary convergent sequences.},

Hence, we obtain a system of nonlinear differential equations, which describes the approximate dynamics of ethanol elimination in the human body. Furthermore, we show that our time-continuous model possesses a unique nonnegative solution globally in time and has exactly one stable fixed point whose stability is shown. Afterward, we suggest a nonstandard finite-difference method based on Mickens' methodology for its numerical solution and examine all properties of our time-continuous model, which are preserved in the time-discrete case. Additionally, we show that the proposed scheme converges linearly towards the solution of the time-continuous model. Conclusively, we underline our theoretical findings by numerical examples.},

In this paper, the separation method of semi-fixed variables is extended. Based on the original separation method, two kinds of new structures of the solutions in a hypothetical way are proposed. With the extended separation method of semi-fixed variables and the mapping method of Riccati equation combined, a new approach for searching exact solutions on time-fractional PDEs is introduced. To demonstrate the effect of the extended method, the time-fractional porous medium equation, time-fractional Hunter-Saxton equation, and time-fractional Fornberg-Whitham equation are solved under the Riemann-Liouville fractional differential operator. Different kinds of new exact solutions of the above three equations are obtained. In order to intuitively show the dynamic property of these exact solutions, the 3D-graphs of some solutions are illustrated as examples. Compared to the previous method, more abundant results can be obtained on solving some complex nonlinear time-fractional PDEs by use of this extended method.},

Applying the traveling wave transformation and semi-inverse method (SIM), the variational principle (VP) is developed. Based on the VP, we extract the system's Hamiltonian. The planar dynamical system is then derived using the Galilean transformation, followed by phase portrait plotting and bifurcation analysis to explore the existence of different types of wave solutions. Meanwhile, the chaotic behaviors of the system are also analyzed by taking the external perturbation terms. Eventually, two robust approaches—the variational method that stemmed from the variational principle and Ritz method—along with the Hamiltonian-based method are employed to seek some wave solutions of the equation. Different kinds of the wave solutions like bell shape solitary, anti-bell shape solitary, and periodic wave solutions are obtained. The findings of this exploration are all novel and help us gain a deeper understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of the equation being studied.},

By using traveling wave transformation and time scale transformation, the FitzHugh–Nagumo system is transformed into a singularly perturbed differential system. We construct a locally invariant manifold for the associated traveling wave equation and obtain the existence of traveling wave solution by employing geometric singular perturbation theory and Fredholm orthogonality. Furthermore, we also discuss the asymptotic behaviors of the traveling wave solution by applying the asymptotic theory.},

A new method called the alternative variational iteration Elzaki transform method (AVIETM) has been used to achieve the results. We employed the proposed method to obtain a solution for the time-fractional generalized Burgers-Fisher equation. The convergence and uniqueness of the solutions for the proposed method have been analyzed and discussed. The validity of the AVIETM is shown by numerical simulation and graphs. The method's accuracy have been shown by comparing the results to exact for various values of the fractional order. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed AVIETM method is straightforward, highly accurate, and efficient.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a 3-D stage-structured model, in which predator population is classified into immature and mature groups. The effect of mature predator's fear and the prey's antipredator behavior toward the juvenile predators are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of prey's collective defense in lowering the threat of predators is also examined. The investigation includes local stability analysis for existing steady-state solutions, revealing a number of global and local bifurcations such as homoclinic, transcritical, Hopf, and saddle-node bifurcations, as well as a codimension two Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation. We noticed that the tendency of prey to form groups causes the solutions to behave oscillatorily and that the level of fear eliminates these fluctuations and brings the system to a stable coexistence. The predator experiences a catastrophic fall when antipredator nature intensifies beyond a certain degree. The model also demonstrates bubbling phenomena in the maturation rate and the paradox of enrichment. To elucidate these bifurcations, we conduct biparametric analyses for various parameters, emphasizing their critical roles in predator survival and extinction. Numerical simulations and graphical illustrations validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating how fear, group defense, maturation rate, and counter attack behavior enrich the system dynamics.},

This exchange is accomplished by the absorption, scattering, and emission of photons. In the nonequilibrium frame, the scattering process is the dominated. Through the asymptotic expansion of the radiation intensity, an diffusion approximate model with small parameters is obtained from the gray one, which consists of compressible Euler equations and radiation diffusion equation. In this paper, we will discuss the scattering limit problem of the diffusion approximation model. We will show that when the scattering process tends to stop (i.e., the small parameter tends to zero), the smooth solution of the diffusion approximation model converges to the smooth solution of the so-called nonequilibrium model in radiation hydrodynamics. Both of these models are widely used in the study of radiation hydrodynamics.},

To overcome the shortcomings of this traditional model caused by the assumptions and simplification of the original model itself, we use the fractional -Caputo derivative to describe the real movement of the market more accurately. The function adds extra freedom to our model so that the resulting model can better describe the market price. We prove the existence and specificity of the solution for the SDE linked to this model. Further, we propose a numerical scheme using the modified Euler's method to solve the SDE and to consider the fractional derivative.

After that, we derive the system of 10 first-order differential equations for functions . This system reduces to one independent equation for a separate function and to the system of two linked equations for two remaining primary functions. This system after diagonalization of the mixing matrix gives two separated equations for new variables. All three equations for basic functions are solved in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions.

This article explores the integration of deep learning segmentation to enhance the efficiency of image inpainting and exemplar-based inpainting methods using a two-stage structure tensor and image sparse representation to fill in missing areas. By leveraging advanced segmentation models, we can precisely delineate the areas requiring inpainting, allowing for more seamless and realistic restorations. Together, the exemplar-based inpainting method involves selecting filling order, maintaining structure, and blending candidate patches for natural results in object removal. Because we are using actual photographs, we do not compare between images after fill and solution. Therefore, we use the Mann–Whitney test to compare efficiency approaches.},

Our analysis establishes the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution. Moreover, we derive sufficient conditions for the extinction and persistence of the two species by employing novel threshold parameters. Notably, these outcomes are derived and substantiated using a Lévy-type perturbation by not requiring that the Lévy noise be bounded; that is, we do not assume .},

However, traditional LMMs assume constant random effects over time, a limitation when dealing with data where variances and structures change. On the other hand, time series models like ARIMA and GARCH are great at capturing time-related patterns and volatility but cannot handle random effects. In this study, we propose a time-varying linear mixed model (TVLMM) that integrates the strengths of ARIMA, GARCH, and LMMs, allowing for dynamic random effects over time. This novel framework offers a more flexible and realistic approach to modeling data, particularly in contexts where underlying processes evolve, such as in finance, economics, and social sciences. We demonstrate the efficacy of TVLMM through a simulated dataset, highlighting its potential for more accurate and reliable forecasting.},

Typically, the level of information is restricted to sample data, and no additional knowledge about the parameters' space is assumed. However, integrating additional information such as sparsity and multicollinearity has been used to improve penalized estimators. Expert suggestions, previous experiments, and studies can further refine these estimates through subspace restrictions. This paper introduces the restricted Elastic net (rEnet) estimator, a novel approach that combines multiple sources of information to improve estimation performance. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate its finite-sample behavior. The method is then applied to two real-world medical datasets, illustrating its practical utility in biomedical research. Our findings show that the restricted Enet estimator consistently outperforms the Enet estimator by producing more accurate and stable estimates of regression parameters, particularly in the presence of multicollinearity and sparsity—challenges common in medical data analysis.},

For the fixed moment impulse, the results show that if the continuous dynamics is -ISS, then the system is -ISS with respect to a lower bound of the average impulsive interval. For the random moment impulse, the sufficient conditions are given to make the system -ISS when continuous dynamics is -ISS, and the intensity and density of random impulses are constrained at the same time. Furthermore, they qualitatively reveal the impact of delay, regime switching and random impulses on the system is -ISS. Finally, examples and numerical simulations are adopted to verify the validity of theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Some creatures interact with not only the same species but also different species by competing resources and even develop intraguild predation (IGP) to improve their survival. Individuals also react for survival according to spatial heterogeneity and seasonal variation of the environment. However, all these creatures' behaviors may change in their different life stages because of varied physiological structures. Considering these concerns, we propose a two-patch model with environmental seasonality and individuals' two life stages and incorporate intraspecific and interspecific competitions and IGP between two species. We begin by analyzing single-species models to establish threshold dynamics. This analysis shows that a species will eventually go extinct or exhibit oscillatory population dynamics across both patches, attracting all nonnegative solutions. Next, we explore two-species models, without and with IGP, and formulate the invasion indices for both species in each scenario. In both cases, we demonstrate that the population tends to die out if the invasion indices are less than one while remaining persistent if the invasion indices exceed one. Finally, we conduct numerical examples to verify the criterion for threshold dynamics and observe some interesting results, including IGP can reverse the competition outcome, IGP can induce ecological diversity, seasonality can facilitate species survival, and prey species can adapt their maturation time against IGP.},

We get sufficient criteria for the existence and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution of positive solutions to the system by establishing a series of suitable Lyapunov functions. In a biological viewpoint, the existence of a stationary distribution indicates that both the police and gang members will be persistent and coexistent in the long term. What is more, we give the specific expression of the probability density function of the stochastic model around the unique endemic quasi-equilibrium by solving the Fokker-Planck equation.

The conformable fractional differential operator no longer have memory function as Riemann–Liouville fractional differential operator. The further investigation shows that the conformable fractional derivative is essentially a kind of cognate derivative of the integer-order derivative. It is found that the solutions between the conformable fractional differential equations and the integer-order differential equations can be transformed directly through the variable replacements. Several theorems for solution replacements between the conformable fractional differential equation and the integer-order differential equation are given and proved. It is found that there are some differences on dynamical properties of solutions between the conformable fractional differential equations and the classical integer-order differential equations.

Secondly, in order to meet human needs, rationally develop fishery resources, and maximize economic benefits, a weighted threshold feedback fishing strategy is adopted, and the complex dynamic behaviors induced by the weighted fishing strategies are discussed, including the existence and stability of the boundary periodic solution and the interior order- periodic solutions.

Then we consider the change of two perturbation parameters; the system produces an oscillation phenomenon similar to relaxation oscillation, and with the change of perturbation parameters, the system trajectory appears single cycle, double cycles, and chaos.

Thirdly, we showed that we can use a classical Newton-based optimization approach that converges quadratically under mild assumptions for finding the unique equilibrium state of the dynamical system. Fourthly, we proposed a nonstandard finite-difference-method based on nonlocal approximations for numerical discretization of our reformulation. Fifthly, we showed that our time-discrete model possesses the same properties as the time-continuous model, that is, that namely boundedness and nonnegativity are conserved for arbitrary time-step sizes. Then we proved convergence towards the time-continuous solution in the asymptotic sense of letting the time-step size tend to zero.

Chemostat model can be used to evaluate the stability and resilience of the food chain, as well as the response capacity of the system in the face of different disturbances and environmental changes. In this paper, we construct a prey–predator food chain chemostat model with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes and consider the dynamics of this stochastic model. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the global solution. Secondly, we deduce the extinction in two cases: One is the extinction of prey and predator, and the other is the extinction of predator and the survival of prey. In addition, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, we obtain the sufficient condition for the existence of stationary distribution, which means that prey and predator can coexist over a long period of time. Then, on this basis, we give the concrete expression of the density function of the distribution around the positive equilibrium point of corresponding deterministic system. Finally, numerical simulations prove the correctness of the theoretical results and show how the speed of reversion and intensity of volatility affect the food chain behavior.},

The study focuses on modeling enzyme reactions using reaction–diffusion equations that capture the irreversible Michaelis–Menten kinetics, emphasizing the nonlinear nature of the process. A distinctive feature of this work is the incorporation of fractional derivatives to enhance the understanding of enzymatic reaction kinetics. To achieve this, a novel computational framework utilizing Laguerre wavelets is developed to compute substrate concentrations and effectiveness factors over a broad range of parameter values. The proposed Laguerre wavelet method (LAWM) is rigorously compared against established analytical and numerical approaches, including the Hermite wavelet method (HWM), Taylor series method (TSM), Adomian decomposition method (ADM), and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RKM). The findings reveal a high degree of accuracy and consistency across all methods, underscoring the reliability and efficiency of the LAWM. This study offers new insights into enzyme kinetics within porous catalysts and highlights the potential of fractional-order models for advancing biocatalytic applications. The outcomes provide a robust theoretical foundation for optimizing the design and performance of immobilized enzyme reactors in industrial and biotechnological settings.},

Firstly, we conjugate the associated linearized operator to a time-dependent variable coefficient operator up to a bounded remainder. The major difficulties come from five space derivatives and the coupling of the coefficient of the highest order term with the coefficients of other terms. The strategy adopted is to look for appropriate transformations, which are reversible and satisfy the sharp bounds for the reducibility. Then, from the observability and controllability of the corresponding linear control problem, the existence of the right inverse for the linearized operator is verified. Finally, the application of the Nash–Moser–Hörmander theorem implies the exact controllability for the Kawahara equation with the quasilinear perturbations.},

The fractional governing equations with the time and space fractional derivatives have been established. Numerical solutions are obtained by the finite difference method with the L1 algorithm and L2 algorithm to discrete the fractional derivatives. The numerical solution is verified by comparing with the exact solution constructed by introducing a source term. The effects of the involved parameters on the velocity and temperature distributions are analyzed and discussed in detail. It is noteworthy that the velocity profiles decrease significantly with the increasing while the temperature profiles increase with the increasing .},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of eradicating an alien predator population in a seasonal environment. It is expressed as a zero-stabilizability problem with state constraints. The dynamics of the predators is described by a prey–predator system with nonlocal reaction terms and time-periodic rates. First, we are concerned with a control that acts on the predators, in a subset of the relevant habitat. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the eradicability (zero-stabilizability) of predators is given in terms of the sign of the principal eigenvalue of an appropriate operator that is not self-adjoint. Next, we investigate the eradicability of predators via controllers of harvesting type which act either on the predator population or on the prey population. Concerning this last approach, the idea is to diminish the prey population to a level at which it cannot sustain the predator population. Some principal eigenvalues will be involved in this investigation as well.},

The proposed methods are distinguished by their exceptional convergence orders, achieving up to p + 2 $$ p&#x0002B;2 $$ for polynomial equations and 2 ⁢ p $$ 2p $$ for nonlinear equations, where p $$ p $$ is the order of the base iterative scheme. In contrast to existing techniques, these methods incorporate advanced correction mechanisms, such as an arithmetic mean blending Newton's and Ehrlich-Aberth methods, to enhance stability and convergence performance. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate the robustness and efficiency of our approaches, with clear advantages in terms of convergence speed, computational cost, and error minimization. Moreover, we present a detailed analysis of convergence behavior, supported by graphical illustrations of residual errors, shedding new light on the dynamics of iterative methods. These findings not only establish the superiority of the proposed schemes but also open new avenues for applying iterative techniques to complex mathematical and engineering problems.},

This measure is taken to reinforce computational stability in the solution path of the relevant optimization model. Then, using the ellipsoid vector norm in the Barzilai–Borwein least-squares model, we gain scaling parameters for the memoryless BFGS updating formula. Therefore, two augmented versions of the Oren–Spedicato self-scaling parameter are proposed when the BFGS and DFP formulas for the Hessian are employed as the matrix index of the ellipsoid norm. A similar analysis is conducted to obtain two augmented versions of the Oren–Luenberger self-scaling parameter using the mentioned quasi-Newton formulas for the inverse Hessian. We address the global convergence of the method under a modified version of a nonmonotone backtracking line search. Then, we discuss accelerating the method using a local memoryless quadratic model considering the given scaling parameters as scalar approximations of the Hessian. Finally, the computational merits of the given augmented nonnegative matrix factorization model as well as the effectiveness of the proposed scaling parameters are assessed on some standard and randomly generated test problems, and also, a classic database of facial images. The outputs generally support our analytical spectrum.},

Two distinct categories of ellipsoidal parameter uncertainty models are considered: one corresponding to FOSs with uncertain zero positions and the other to FOSs with uncertain pole and zero positions. First, sufficient conditions for the performance analysis of FOSs with ellipsoidal parametric uncertainty are established by extending the bounded real lemma for FOSs. Next, the problems of controller synthesis are analyzed, and the state feedback controllers are designed, along with the establishment of sufficient conditions for stabilization. These conditions are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Lastly, several numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

The limiting equation is the nonlinear hyperbolic Burgers equation, for which there is non-uniqueness backward in time. In both cases, solutions are sought by formulating the identification problem as the minimization of a least squares functional, and gradient descent methods are used for computation. Following this approach, we construct the first and second variations of the functional by the adjoint state approach. We prove that the second variation is continuous with respect to viscosity.

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to a nonlocal reaction–diffusion–advection model that describes the spatial dynamics of freshwater organisms in a river with a directional motion. Our goal is to investigate how the advection rate affects the dynamics of the species. We first establish the well-posedness of global solutions, where the regularized problem containing a viscosity term and the re-established maximum principle play key roles. We then demonstrate the existence, nonexistence, uniqueness, and stability of nontrivial stationary solutions by analyzing the principal eigenvalue of the integro-differential operator, particularly focusing on its monotonicity with respect to the advection rate. This analysis helps us understand the long-term dynamics of solutions and derive sharp criteria for persistence or extinction. Furthermore, we study the limiting behavior of solutions with respect to the advection rate and find that a sufficiently large advection rate leads to species extinction. Lastly, numerical simulations support our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A piecewise fractional differential equation (deterministic–stochastic differential equation or vice versa) has appeared in recent literature. Piecewise operators are used to study crossover real data effectively. By using stochastic–deterministic piecewise hybrid fractional derivatives, with hybrid fractional-order and variable-order fractional operators, this paper extends the deterministic model of immuno-chemotherapy with gene therapy and time delay. The immuno-chemotherapy with gene therapy combines traditional chemotherapy and immunotherapy with genetic engineering techniques to enhance the immune system's ability to target and destroy cancer cells. This offers a multifaceted approach to cancer treatment, potentially enhancing effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Two approximation techniques are used to solve the proposed model numerically. In the hybrid fractional deterministic models, we use the nonstandard Caputo proportional constant finite difference method, and in the stochastic models, we use the nonstandard Milstein technique. We examine the stability analysis of these methods to ensure their efficiency. Both the theoretical results and the efficiency of the methods are confirmed by numerical tests. New piecewise operators are illustrated by the curves presented. Studying the introduced piecewise fractional differential immuno-chemotherapy model with gene therapy and time delay along with a stochastic case greatly explained the dynamics of immuno-chemotherapy interaction.},

First, the traveling wave transformation is employed to reduce the dimension of the (3 + 1)-dimensional KSe. Then the Hirota bilinear method is adopted to develop the rogue wave solutions via introducing the different polynomial functions. By optimizing the parameters, the bright and dark rogue waves solutions of the first-order and second-order are extracted. In addition, the three-wave method is employed to seek the generalized breathers wave, W -shape (double well or breather wave), bright and dark solitary wave solutions. Besides, the other special wave solutions like the compacton and singular wave solutions are also reported. Meanwhile, the dynamic attributes of some solutions are unfolded by Maple. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the findings of this research are all new and have not explored in other literature.},

A disturbance factor is present into both linear and nonlinear delayed RL-fractional-order multiple agent systems (FMASs) with distributed time delays. This disturbance term effect the agents by introducing the uncertainty into the behavior of agents. In this article, Lyapunov technique, fractional calculus properties, and analytical methods are used to approach resilient base CC. The major benefit of this approach is that the first-order derivative of Lyapunov function may be used to keep away from complex calculations, which effectively reduce troubles and difficulties resulting from time delays and fractional derivatives. At the end of our study, three illustration are provided to show the effectiveness and validity of our approach.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we develop the n -fold Darboux transformation (DT) for the Kraenkel–Manna–Merle (KMM) integrable system designed to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of ultra-short wave pulses, especially within the saturated ferromagnetic materials. A short-wave can only propagate in the direction perpendicular to the external saturating magnetic field in some saturated ferromagnetic materials, which is called as KMM system. We achieve this by employing the gauge transformation technique between Lax pairs and derive multiple soliton solutions expressed through a determinant representation. generates novel solutions and , characterized by the ratios of two respective determinants. Furthermore, we provide the explicit forms for the nth-order smooth positons for the KMM system by employing the degenerate DT in relation to the eigenvalues. The non-singular solutions for the KMM system with -positons are derived under the specific condition where for . The dynamic characteristics of the smooth positon in the KMM system are discussed in detail, as well as the derivation of the corresponding trajectory, an approximation of the trajectory, and the concept of a “phase shift.” As an example, we report new kink-type fronts in some types of saturated ferromagnetic materials. Finally, we find that the “phase shift” for the smooth positons is dependent on the spatial space and temporal time, while it is constant for a typical two-soliton solution. The stronger localized shape and propagation of magnetic smooth positons implies that the novel form of microwaves is admitted and controlled in ferrites, which has important potential applications for ferrite-loaded waveguides at microwave frequencies, rapid storage and processing of information in spintronics.},

Firstly, by adding a compensation term into the traditional dynamic surface control framework, the filtering error ignored generally is eliminated. Secondly, a nonlinear disturbance observer is constructed to observe the compound interference united by external disturbances and approximation errors based on the approximation ability of neural network. Thirdly, an auxiliary variable is combined with a smooth function used to deal with the saturated input function to offset the influence of input saturation constraints. In addition, for ensuring that all states of the system are constrained by preset time-varying ranges, the adaptive control method and dynamic event-triggered condition are posed with the help of barrier Lyapunov function. Then, the tracking performance and the boundness of all signals in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed by employing the presented adaptive control approach with dynamic event-triggered mechanism, as well as the Zeno behavior does not appear.

It explores the influence of multiple slip conditions and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on Jeffrey fluid flow and heat transfer across irregular surfaces. Additionally, the impact of thermal radiation and internal heat sources on heat transfer is examined, essential for a comprehensive understanding of the system's thermal dynamics. Using the Buongiorno model, the diffusion and thermophoresis of nanoparticles within the flow are analyzed. Nonlinear coupled governing equations covering flow dynamics, heat transfer, and nanoparticle transport are transformed into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through similarity transformations and solved numerically using the Runge–Kutta fourth-order (RK4) method combined with shooting techniques. Results indicate significant effects of physical parameters on temperature, velocity, and mass profiles: a 20% decrease in temperature profiles with an increase in the dimensionless thermal slip coefficient from 0.1 to 0.5 and a 15% reduction in velocity profiles from a 0.1 unit increase in the magnetic parameter . The study also quantifies mass and heat transfer rates to elucidate their impacts. These findings have profound implications for engineering applications involving non-Newtonian and nanofluids in complex geometrical configurations.},

  abstract     = {We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The latter is achieved by requiring subsystems with the same entropy, regardless of whether the state of the entire system is pure or mixed. The geometric framework is provided by a convex set that forms a right-triangle, whose points are linked to the absolute value of just two of the coherences of the system under study. As a result, we find that optimized states of two qubits host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved, so they are X-shaped. A geometric -measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points in that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. It is shown that reproduces the results of the Hill-Wootters concurrence , so that can be interpreted as a distance-like entanglement measure. However, unlike , the measure also distinguishes the rank of states. The universality of the two-qubit X-states ensures the utility of our geometric model for studying entanglement of two-qubit states in any configuration. To show the applicability of our approach far beyond time-independent cases, we construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.},

  abstract     = {Employing multiscale expansion, a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NSE) of interfacial gravity waves for broad bandwidth in a two-layer fluid of infinite depths with uniform velocity of the upper fluid has been developed. This NSE is widened by slackening the narrow bandwidth constraint with the purpose that it will be more appropriate for utilization to a realistic sea-wave spectrum. The main results of this work are (a) to find the effect of wind velocity on the wave profiles and the modulational instability regions and (b) to discuss how the broad wave bandwidth affects on the stability results. On the basis of broad and narrow bandwidth equations, the instability regions in the wave numbers plane and the growth rate of instability curves against wave number for Stokes waves are drawn for several values of the dimensionless speed of the upper layer and the wave steepness. The key feature of this problem is that the new equation due to broad bandwidth is observed to predict the instability region in an excellent agreement with the exact results and due to sufficient bandwidth, this broad-banded equation is expected to be more appropriate for realistic ocean wave problems.},

The model was constructed by dividing the population into seven compartments, namely, susceptible ; susceptible in Clusters 1–3 ( , and ); infected ; quarantined ; and recovered sub-populations. To confirm the biological validity of the model, the existence, uniqueness, non-negativity, and boundedness of the solution are investigated. The dynamical behaviors are studied analytically by applying linearization for local stability and the Lyapunov function along with the LaSalle's invariant principle for global stability.

The organization and study of mathematical models are critical in predicting disease behavior of the disease. In this paper, a new stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death (SIRD) model for spreading epidemic disease is investigated. First, the deterministic SIRD model is considered, and then, by allowing randomness in the recovery and death rates that are not deterministic, the system of nonlinear stochastic differential equations is derived. For the suggested model, the existence and uniqueness of a positive global solution are demonstrated. The parameter estimation is done with the conditional least square estimator for deterministic models and the maximum likelihood estimator for stochastic ones. After that, we investigate a nonadditive state-space model for spreading epidemic disease by considering infected as the hidden process variable. The problem of the hidden process variable from noisy observations is filtered, predicted, and smoothed using a recursive Bayesian technique. For estimating the hidden number of infected variables, closed-form solutions are obtained. Finally, numerical simulations with both simulated and real data are performed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the current work.},

As a result of such inspired applications, the goal of the current study is to describe the entropy-generating phenomena in channel flow with dual diffusion of nanofluid. Within a converging and diverging channel, the Jeffrey-Hamel flow of Reiner-Rivlin nanofluid with heat-mass attributes is scrutinized. The inertial dependent flow of incompressible Reiner-Rivlin nanofluid is formulated using the components of the stress tensor in the Navier–Stokes equation. The Buongiorno model is deployed in order to enhance energy efficiency and optimize the cooling mechanism of the channel. System irreversibilities in the view of the second law are scrutinized the energy loss due to energy transfer, frictional heating, and double diffusion of nanoparticles. The formulated equations are modified into ordinary differential equations using scaling variables. An efficient and effective Keller-Box approach is used to tickle the non-linear equation. The outcomes for velocity against inertial forces and the Reiner-Rivlin parameter in a converging conduit are significant. A reverse flow phenomenon is seen in diverging conduit. Enhancement in temperature is perceived against double diffusion parameters. A decrease in concentration is achieved with the Brownian motion parameter. Effect of Reiner-Rivlin fluid attributes is dominant as compared to traditional fluid. The enhancement of nanoparticle diffusion can regulate channel cooling and control anomalous overheating. System entropy can be controlled by adjusting the opening of the channel and temperature difference by taking the lubricating walls.},

The nonlocal boundary conditions are more informative than local boundary conditions (initial conditions and two-point boundary conditions) to evaluate some mathematical models. This article presents a collocation approach-based matrix technique to approximate the solution of the fusion of a class of singular differential equations subject to nonlocal three-point boundary conditions. The proposed strategy utilizes the truncation of the series expansion of a function belonging to in terms of Bernoulli polynomials. It transforms the singular boundary value problems into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, which can be dealt with by any mathematical software. The Lipschitz condition on an equivalent completely continuous nonlinear operator has been used to prove the convergence analysis of the scheme. Some extremely nonlinear test examples are solved and provided in contrast with the exact solution. These numerical results are also examined against some existing numerical techniques to verify the applicability and significance of the proposed methodology. There are a few numerical examples that are application based but do not have exact solutions. In such cases, residual error norm is employed to measure the accuracy of the numerical strategies. The computational data demonstrate the superiority and validity of the proposed technique over existing numerical approaches.},

  abstract     = {Degree reduction of ball Said-Ball (BSB) surface is a complex and unsolved problem in computer-aided design (CAD) and computer graphics (CG), which has potential application prospects in many engineering fields of geometric modeling. In this paper, the degree reduction of BSB surface is transformed into the optimization problems of center surface and radius function, and the improved coot optimization algorithm is used to solve it. An effective method to solve the degree reduction of BSB surface by intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the degree reduction of BSB surface is decomposed into center surface reduction and radius function reduction, and the objective function and constraint conditions are determined according to the optimization idea, then the degree reduction optimization model of center surface and radius function is established. Secondly, an enhanced coot (ECOOT for short) algorithm is proposed, which combines chain strategy, dispersed foraging strategy, and quadratic interpolation strategy. Compared with the original algorithm, ECOOT algorithm has better convergence performance and higher calculation accuracy. Finally, the proposed ECOOT algorithm is used to solve the degree reduction optimization model, and the optimal center surface and minimum distance radius function of the BSB surface after degree reduction are obtained. The experimental results show that the ECOOT algorithm can effectively solve the problem of degree reduction for BSB surface, the degree reduction error is reduced by about 20% compared to the original COOT algorithm, and is superior to other intelligent optimization algorithms in accuracy, robustness, and convergence.},

  abstract     = {By using the basic principle of continuous damage mechanics as a reference, together with the statistical strength theory based on the Weibull distribution, a new constitutive model of fractured rock masses for deep underground engineering is proposed. In this model, a new definition of the fracture degree F t has been proposed for the first time, which can quantitatively describe the fracturing process of a fractured rock mass. Based on the results of laboratory tests and numerical simulations for fractured rock mass specimens, the constitutive model with different fracture degrees is verified. Moreover, the applicability of two yield criteria (the Mohr–Coulomb [M-C] and Drucker–Prager [D-P] criteria) for describing the mesoscopic strength of rocks is analyzed. Finally, the effects of the random distribution parameters on the constitutive model are discussed in detail. The results show that the theoretical results agree well with the experimental and numerical results, and the constitutive model with the D-P criterion is better than the model with the M-C criterion.},

  abstract     = {Rehabilitation of water distribution systems is a complex task that water companies have to tackle continually to keep high-quality service. The larger and more complex the network, the harder to make decisions about the network maintenance strategy to be implemented. Considering pipe replacement as a strategy for water network rehabilitation, this work presents a combination of water distribution system analysis and multi-criteria analysis to rank alternatives for pipe replacement. A set of eight performance criteria is used to evaluate the rehabilitation alternatives. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is herein adopted to rank the solutions, coupled with a final sensitivity analysis on criteria weights. The obtained results point out as pipe replacement is an essential strategy for rehabilitation since the eight evaluation criteria are improved. The sensitivity analysis shows the best solutions' robustness, with just a few variations in their position in the ranking. The most frequent best solution is then hydraulically evaluated, showing the real benefits of pipe replacement in terms of pressure deficit reduction.},

This equation, based on a compartmental epidemic model, describes a continuous vaccination strategy with environmental noise effects. By means of an appropriate invertible continuous transformation, we link the solution to the stochastic SVIR model to the solution of an auxiliary random differential equation (RDE) that has an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as the only input parameter of the system. In this way, based on this explicit conjugacy between both equations, new pathwise numerical schemes are constructed for the SVIR model. In particular, we propose an exponential method that outperforms other integrators in the literature and is able to approximate, with high stability, meaningful probabilistic features of the continuous system, including its stationary distribution and ergodicity. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the practical performance of the introduced methods, and a comparative analysis with other integrators commonly used for the simulation of epidemiological models is performed.},

The underlying two-phase flow model consists of a mass-preserving Cahn–Hilliard (CH) equation coupled with the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (NSEs) through surface tension. Due to the higher order nonlinearity and stiff nature of the CH equation, its numerical solution is very challenging. We have used the decoupled pressure projection method for the numerical simulation of the governing equations. The spatial variables are discretized using the finite difference scheme on the staggered grids, while the explicit Euler method is used for time discretization. Four examples include the coalescence of inline rising bubbles, the obliques coalescence of two rising bubbles, and the deformation of single and two different-sized bubbles in a shear flow field is numerically simulated. It is observed that the scheme is capable of tracking the interface accurately and respecting mass conservation and energy dissipation. Moreover, the scheme is efficient, easily implementable, energy stable, and fully decoupled.},

  abstract     = {The worldwide dissemination of the coronavirus, as well as its dependencies, is being aided by detrimental urbanization. The impact of the viral infection upon an infected person is also thought to be influenced by any pre-existing medical issues. Recent investigations have demonstrated that COVID-19 patients have a higher degree of blood viscosity as a result of alterations in morphology in blood cells. Examining the importance of hyper-viscosity in patients with COVID is crucial in determining the diseases of the arteries since viscosity is a key flow characteristic that affects the flow across a stenosis as well as an aneurysm. In the current study, a patient-specific instance with an aneurysm across the abdominal aortal walls was taken into consideration. Given that abdominal aneurysms occur frequently in people, the high viscosity values are taken into account while examining the hyper-viscous impact of fluid on its passage through the affected aorta. The current study is the initial endeavor to use the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) Technique to study the impact of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) on the movement of fluid across an aneurysmal aortal section in conjunction with hyper-viscous anomalous blood characteristics. The investigation backs up the different medical results that described the negative consequences of blood hyper-viscosity. The computational findings from employing a finite element method (FEM) solver to resolve the fluid mechanical computations complemented alongside the solid mechanical principles indicate a possibility that the increased stress imposed by the hyper-viscous propagates on the interior walls of the aneurysmal aorta may prompt the aneurysmal pouch to grow or breakdown. Also, the hyper-viscous blood in COVID patients destroys the smooth muscle cells of the media layer endangering its normal structure and functions and leading to the development of new aneurysms.},

We frame a differential equation to evaluate the impact of mean blood pressure on the aortic wall and prove the existence and uniqueness of its solution for homeostatic recoil and relaxation for infinitesimal aortic tissue. We model and analyze a generalized (3 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation for aortic wave dynamics. We use the Lie group of transformations on this nonlinear evolution equation to obtain invariant solutions, traveling wave solutions including solitons. We find that abnormalities in the dynamic pathology of aortic dissection act as triggers for the progression of disease in the early stage through the formation of soliton-like pulses and their interaction. We address the role of unstable wavefields in waveform dynamics when waves are unidirectional. Moreover, the notion of dynamic pathology within the domain of vascular geometry may explain the evolution of aneurysms in cerebral arteries and cardiomyopathies even in the absence of anatomical and physiological abnormalities.},

The analysis of pattern formation in chaotic and nonlinear dynamical systems can benefit greatly from the use of this thermal convection model. The primary goal of this study is to find analytical solutions for some recent advances that have been made for Rayleigh–Bénard convection by applying the -DCC-QCGLEs model for slowly varying spatio-temporal amplitudes of the wave motion. In addition, novel traveling solitary wave solutions for the model equation are derived using a very useful method to investigate how complex physical coefficients affect the profiles of propagating waves. Furthermore, we introduce the WTC-Kruskal algorithm of the Painlevé methodology to examine the integrability of the -DCC-QCGLEs and the truncated Painlevé expansion is used to extract the Bäcklund transform, from which new solitary solutions can be acquired. The results also demonstrated a good agreement with previous works and were more significant and accurate in two and three dimensions of the proposed model. Finally, the computational results indicate that the effects of the physical parameters of the considered equations can be demonstrated by utilizing 2D and 3D graphics for different values of these parameters.},

In either case, the convergence order has been established by employing Taylor series expansions. Moreover, the presence of derivatives of higher order is assumed not on such compositions. But, these compositions may converge even if these high-order derivatives do not exist. That is why a process is developed that shows the convergence of these compositions by relying only on the operator and the first derivatives, which are actually involved on these compositions. Hence, the applicability of iterative compositions is extended. The process is applied to a certain -step composition. We can also adopt our approach on other existing compositions with the help of inverse linear operators in a similar fashion. Numerical experiments further illuminate the results.},

This is validated based on the estimation of evaluated accuracy by means of stability and convergence analysis, which infer that the proposed nCB-DQT-RK scheme is capable of producing stable results with spatial convergence of order four, and the use of nCB in DQT is capable to improve performance (in terms of accuracy and spatial rate of convergence as well) as compared to existing techniques (collocation/quadrature) with traditional cubic B-splines and its existing modifications, and so, nCB is capable to surpass cubic B-splines and its existing modification.},

A detailed study of epidemic effects is carried out according to an operational management-based perspective. We proceed by analyzing connections among effects and risks potentially leading to significant supply chain disturbances through a multicriteria approach. Risks and effects are weighted by applying the Analytic Network Process (ANP). Weighted risks are then assumed as criteria for selecting the most suitable contingency strategy. To this aim, the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) is able to rank a set of strategies by addressing and quantifying uncertainty. A case study on the sector of the automotive industry is implemented to validate the proposed methodological approach.},

Then, the same techniques are employed to analyze the performance of several multipoint schemes with memory, whose first step is Traub's method, but their construction was made using different procedures. Therefore, their stability is analyzed, showing which is the best in terms of wideness of basins of convergence or the existence of free critical points that would yield to convergence toward different elements from the desired zeros of the nonlinear function. Therefore, the best stability properties are linked with the best estimations made in the iterative expressions, rather than in their simplicity.

We investigate the influence of fear and the supply of additional food to predators in a delayed tri-trophic food chain model, where interference among the species is determined by Holling type-II functional response. The proposed model incorporates the fact that the growth rates of prey and middle predators are decreased due to the fear of middle and special predators, respectively. The additional food is supplied to both predators by either nature or external agencies. Furthermore, the poisoned prey in the predator's environment is taken into account. In the proposed model, we use two time delays: one for the growth term of the middle predator and another for the gestation delay of the special predator. We determine the conditions for the existence of ecologically feasible equilibrium points and their local and global stability. In addition, we establish the conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcation around interior equilibrium to seek periodic behavior in nondelayed and delayed models. Numerical investigations are performed to justify the proposed theoretical findings through phase portraits, time series of solutions, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe that the chaotic dynamics of a tri-trophic food chain model can be controlled by the proper choice of the fear effect and by supplying additional food parameters. As a result, our findings provide more ecological insights into the dynamics of the delayed tri-trophic food chain model with the fear effect and additional food supply.},

Furthermore, it is particularly important to develop new vaccines with higher protection rates.},

The original singular system of BVPs is transformed into an equivalent system of integral equations to overcome the singular behavior at , and then, the recursive series for the solution is established. The mathematical formulation is further supported by conducting the convergence analysis of the recursive schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested by comparing against the current variational iteration method using many standard examples. It is shown that the proposed method is more accurate and efficient than the existing method such as Chebyshev operational matrix method and variational iteration method.},

The ZK-BBME represents a long-wave model with large wavelength that explains the water wave phenomena in nonlinear dispersive system. The solution of the ZK-BBME is discretized by using hybridization of the finite difference and localized radial basis function based on partition of unity method. The association of this hybridization leads to a meshless method and it does not requires any linearization. In the initial step, the PDE is converted into a nonlinear ODE system by making use of radial kernels. In the next step, the obtained nonlinear ODE system is solved based on an ODE solver of high order. The global collocation technique imposes a large computational cost because a dense algebraic system must be calculated. This proposed strategy is based on decomposing the initial domain into a number of sub-domains using kernel approximation on each sub-domain. Three numerical examples are illustrated to clarify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed strategy.},

The finite volume approach is employed for solving the governing equations of the laminar fluid flow in steady state condition. The outcomes of the numerical simulation show a very good agreement compared to experimental data. It can be found that the employing protrusions on the bottom wall impresses the thermal criteria in microchannels. The influence of protrusions on the heat transfer coefficient and the ratio of Nusselt number changes compared to the smooth channel are evaluated at various velocity of the fluid. An important result is that the microchannel with higher radius of protrusions has a better heat transfer rate.},

A suitable machine learning (ML) technique for the measurement of glucose levels in an artificial pancreas may play a crucial role in the management of diabetes. Therefore in the present work, a comparison has been made among a few ML techniques for the measurement of glucose levels in the artificial pancreas because ML is an astounding technology of artificial intelligence and widely applicable in various fields such as medical science, robotics, and environmental science. The models, namely, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), based on supervised learning, are proposed for the dataset of Pima Indian to predict and classify diabetes mellitus. Ensuring the predictions and accuracy up to the level of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2), the comparative behavior of all four models has been discussed. The ML models developed here stratify and predict whether an individual is diabetic or not based on the features available in the dataset. The dataset passes through pre-processing, and ML algorithms are fitted to train the dataset, and then the performance of the test results is discussed. An error matrix (EM) has been generated to measure the accuracy score of the models. The accuracies in the prediction and classification of DMT2 models are 71%, 77%, 78%, and 80% for DT, SVM, RF, and KNN algorithms, respectively. The KNN model has shown a more precise result in comparison to other models.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the theoretical modeling and coupled free vibration behaviors of a rotating double-bladed shaft assembly resting on elastic supports in a spacecraft system. According to the Kirchhoff plate theory and the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the theoretical model is established. The presented rotor is considered to be made of porous foam metal matrix and graphene nanoplatelet (GPL) reinforcement. Nonuniform distributions of porosity and GPLs are taken into account, which leads to the functionally graded (FG) structure. The effective material properties of the double-bladed shaft assembly are varying along the radius and thickness directions of the shaft and blade, respectively. Moreover, the rule of mixture, the Halpin–Tsai model, and the open-cell scheme are employed to determine its material properties. Considering the gyroscopic effect, the Lagrange equation is utilized to derive the coupled equations of motion. Then the traveling wave frequencies of the double-bladed shaft assembly are obtained by applying the assumed modes method and substructure modal synthesis method. A detailed parametric analysis is conducted to examine the effects of the rotating speed, GPL weight fraction, GPL distribution pattern, GPL length-to-thickness ratio, GPL length-to-width ratio, porosity coefficient, porosity distribution pattern, shaft length-to-radius ratio, blade length-to-thickness ratio, support stiffness and support location on the free vibration behaviors of the double-bladed shaft assembly.},

  abstract     = {This paper developed a new hybrid residual power series (RPS) method in the space of Laplace transform (in brief, 𝕃 ⁢ T ) for the study of the nonlinear space-time fractional model of partial differential equations with proportional delayed arguments (STF-PDEDAs). The main objective of this technique is to convert the target nonlinear STF-PDEDAs into the algebraic equation in the space. The newly transformed equation is solved by utilizing the revised RPS method to achieve series approximations, and refer to this technique as RPSM. Different kinds of attractive applications of STF-PDEDAs are discussed utilizing proposed RPSM to reveal its efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability for constructing series solutions to the referred STF-PDEDAs. The numerical experiments and graphical findings have been computed for different fractional parameter values to analyze the behavior of RPSM solutions and to test the authenticity and applicability of the present method in comparison to other existing results obtained by some rigorous techniques. The outcomes conclude that proposed RPSM is easy to understand and straightforward to provide results converging to its exact solution.},

  abstract     = {The dilution of undesired and vandalize noise to a sustainable level is the subject of continuing research in the fields of applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. Therefore, the present study investigates the mechanism of an acoustic wave scattering, which includes the force propagation due to the incidence through region of elastic boundary condition. Both planar and nonplanar surfaces are allowed in this waveguide configuration. In this structure, the scattered fields in the regions of the inner surfaces are acoustically rigid and satisfy the standard orthogonality relation, while the fields on the upper outer surfaces are flexural nature that can be tackled using modified orthogonality relation. Thus, we intend to simultaneously take into account the behavior of the scattered field in both planar and nonplanar zones. Solving nonorthogonal eigenfunctions required the development of a modified orthogonality relation. Modified orthogonal relation and the mode-matching (MM) technique have combined to get the solution of proposed model. The last section graphically discusses the solution for various frequencies and heights to observe the scattering behavior in all regions of the duct. In accordance with different characteristics of the waveguide material, expressions for the distribution of powers in different parts of the channel are developed and schematically depicted. A variety of mathematical and physical justifications provide strong support to results.},

However, there is some empirical evidence that shows that this fact is unrealistic. In this paper, we consider some stochastic models with delay for pricing commodity futures. The functions of the commodity price stochastic process under the risk-neutral measure are necessary for pricing derivatives. However, the observations in the market have risk. Then, we use a technique that allows us to estimate the functions of the risk-neutral commodity spot price stochastic process, directly from futures prices traded in the market, and show how to price the commodity futures. Finally, we make an empirical application of this methodology with gold futures traded in the COMEX. Furthermore, we make clear the supremacy of the delay models in pricing gold futures.},

Individuals transit between the three segments, assuming that having more contact with criminally active people increases one's risk of learning and acquiring the same traits; essentially, crime is regarded as a social epidemic. In the literature, there are several models of this type, based on spatial homogeneity and ordinary differential equations. However, these ideas have not been extended to account for spatial variability. Here, we achieve this target with discrete and continuous forms of space: patch and reaction–diffusion compartmental systems, respectively. We build the models and focus on the effect of the basic reproduction number on the long-term dynamics of crime (persistence or disappearance).

For this, we use a family of Newton-secant-type iterative methods that arises from Newton's method and from a well-known family of secant-type iterative methods. We study the accessibility of the new methods in two different ways: From the convergence balls of the methods, obtained from a local study of the convergence, and from a dynamic study of the methods.

Through this technique, we get corrector formula with high accuracy, which is implicit, as well as predictor formula, which is explicit and has the same precision order as the corrective formula. On the other hand, the so-called memory term is computed only once for both prediction and correction phases, which indicates the low cost of the proposed method. Also, the error bound of the proposed numerical scheme is offered. Furthermore, numerical experiments are presented in order to assess the accuracy of the new method on two differential equations.

  abstract     = {In this study, fractional order is applied to the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and IS interaction models. The monoclonal brain tumor GBM gives rise to other tumors with varying growth rates and treatment susceptibilities once it reaches a certain density. The two populations of macrophages and activated macrophages make up the IS cells as well. Because of this, this model depicts two conversions: the transformation of a sensitive tumor cell into a resistant tumor cell and the transformation of passive macrophages into active macrophages, as well as an interaction among the tumor cell and the macrophages. The memory and nonlocalization properties of fractional derivatives make them an excellent tool for simulating the spread of epidemics. Numerous characteristics exist in the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivative kernel, including nonsingularity, nonlocality, and an exponential establish. For simulating disease spreading systems, it is preferred. We suggest defining the Caputo–Fabrizio fractional derivation procedure as the paradigm for the GBM disease in this work. The hypothesized fractional-order GBM disease paradigm's stability is investigated. The hypothesized fractional-order GBM disease paradigm's existence and originality are established. A suggested novel signal flow graph introduces the system. We have established the existence of GBM and its uniqueness. Additionally, the numerical integrations necessary for the fractional-order glioma immune model are carried out using the predictor–corrector Adams–Bashforth–Moulton (ABM) approach for fractional-order differential equations. These simulations demonstrate that the behavior of the model can be affected by changing the parameters for the fractional order, contact evaluation, or quarantine evaluation. The findings demonstrate how epidemiologically sound the proposed fractional model is.},

  abstract     = {The spectrum of network is an important tool to study the function and dynamic properties of network, and graph operation and product are an effective mechanism to construct a specific local and global topological structure. In this study, a class of weighted -clique annex operation controlled by scale factor and weight factor is defined, through which an iterative weighted network model with small-world and scale-free properties is constructed. In particular, when the number of iterations tends to infinity, the network has transfinite fractal property. Then, through the iterative features of the network structure, the iterative relationship of the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix corresponding to the network is studied. Accordingly, some applications of the spectrum of the network, including the Kenemy constant , Multiplicative Degree-Kirchhoff index , and the number of weighted spanning trees , are further given. In addition, we also study the effect of the two factors controlling network operation on the structure and function of the iterative weighted network , so that the network operation can better simulate the real network and have more application potential in the field of artificial network.},

The main aim of this paper is to design fuzzy controllers with less conservative results. Novel weighted integral inequalities (WIIs) are proposed based on Wirtinger's integral inequalities. The T–S fuzzy approach expresses nonlinear systems as linear submodels with IF–THEN rules for deriving the stability conditions. Then, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and applying new WIIs, improved exponential stability and stabilization criteria are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Three examples are provided to demonstrate the advantages and usefulness of the proposed novel method. Two are application-oriented examples, such as the variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) system and nonlinear mass-spring (NMS) system.},

The associated diffusion term comes from the general kinetic theory of liquids and permits to account for a wider diffusivity, which is applicable for qualitatively low to higher shear stresses. The goal of the present article is to introduce a generalization of an Eyring–Powell fluid by the introduction of a porous reaction term (of Darcy–Forchheimer type) and a perturbation with a higher order operator. In particular, we consider that our model is an extension of a classical Eyring–Powell fluid in the same manner as introduced for other equations (see the extended Fisher–Kolmogorov model). The obtained equation is novel and requires analysis about existence, regularity and uniqueness of solutions. Stationary solutions are explored under the definition of a Hamiltonian. In addition, profiles of solutions are obtained with an exponential scaling that ends in a Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Eventually, some numerical assessments are introduced to validate the hypothesis done, and to discuss about the accuracy of the analytical approach followed.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyses a class of discrete-time delayed predator–prey models where time delay is incorporated into the prey's density-dependent growth term. We explore how time delay, carrying capacity, and harvesting can generate or suppress chaotic motion. Analytical conditions for local stability of the fixed point are derived by using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion. Increasing the time delay has the great potential to change the coexisting stable fixed point to unstable via a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. Thus, the systems may experience quasi-periodic and chaotic motion when the coexisting fixed point is unstable. The existence of a quasi-periodic loop, which generates a 2-quasi-periodic loop, and then 4, 8, and 16 quasi-periodic loops are successively detected as the carrying capacity increases. Further increase of carrying capacity induces chaos. Thus, a torus doubling route to chaos is explored in our article, which has been relatively less reported in the existing literature. Nevertheless, we show that harvesting either prey or predator is more likely to suppress chaos and stabilize the coexisting steady state. We draw all the bifurcation diagrams when delay, carrying capacity, and harvesting strength are varied. The qualitative nature of the phase portraits is determined by computing all the Lyapunov exponents. The analysis of these delayed models in a discrete-time framework might attract a wide range of researchers to work in this direction. In the conclusion section, we also disclose some remaining questions and future perspectives.},

In this paper we extend this concept by introducing the weighted subdirect sum: a sum of matrices with overlapping blocks allowing to give a different weight to the overlapped blocks. This concept naturally arises in applications with overlapping regions such as overlapping graphs in multilayer networks or in iterative methods to solve linear systems of equations based on overlapping blocks. We analyze the same positivity classes of matrices that were studied for the usual subdirect sum in the seminal paper of 1999. We extend those previous results on positivity classes to the new weighted subdirect sum, and we also introduce a methodology that can be useful to extend these results to other classes of matrices. We illustrate the theoretical results with some small examples and we show the potential applicability of the new concept in two lines of future research.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we introduce a higher-order optimal family of Chebyshev–Halley type methods to solve a univariate nonlinear equation having multiple roots. The proposed scheme considers weight functions that are selected adequately to optimize the convergence order and demands only four functional evaluations at each iteration. An extensive convergence analysis is also provided that demonstrates the establishment of eighth-order convergence of the developed scheme. As a result, the efficiency index of our scheme is optimal according to the Kung–Traub conjecture. Numerical experiments are performed on some real-life as well as nonlinear academic problems. In addition, the dynamical study of iterative schemes reflects the good overview of their stability, convergence properties, and graphical aspects by drawing attraction basins in the complex plane. Numerical findings indicate that the proposed methods outperform the existing ones with similar characteristics.},

  abstract     = {The onset of magnetoconvection in an inclined porous layer is investigated. The effects of physical parameters, such as the Rayleigh number, the inclination angle, and the Hartmann number, are examined. The system becomes more stable by increasing the inclination angle and Hartmann number. It is noted that the transverse rolls are more stable than the longitudinal rolls. A comparison between the linear and nonlinear instability analysis is discussed in more detail. The threshold values for the longitudinal and transverse rolls provide the subcritical instability region. It is noted that the subcritical instability region increases as the inclination angle also increases, whereas it remains unchanged as the Hartmann number increases. Besides, an artificial neural network (ANN) model using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm is employed to predict the distribution of critical Rayleigh numbers for both linear and nonlinear stability analyses. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer is selected on the basis of coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and root mean relative error. The simulated critical Rayleigh numbers obtained by the numerical study and the predicted critical Rayleigh numbers by the ANN coincides.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the issue of non-fragile control for a networked control systems (NCSs) with randomly occurring nonlinearities, where an advanced dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is introduced. First, an improved DETM transmission strategy for NCSs is proposed. Based on the dynamic error of the system, the improved DETM can adaptively adjust the threshold to control the transmission of signals. The balance of the network bandwidth and control performance is excellently regulated by the adaptive threshold rather than a predetermined constant. Second, by taking the networked-induced delay, DETM, randomly occurring nonlinearities and controller gain perturbation into consideration, a nonlinear system model is established. Next, sufficient stability conditions that can guarantee the mean-square asymptotical stability are obtained based on the novel two-side Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and second-order generalized free-matrix-based integral inequality (GFMBII), which contains more system information and can provide less conservative results. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to verify the advantages of the proposed method.},

The looped-functional approach is adopted to obtain sufficient conditions for the uncertain offshore platform system to resolve the stabilization of OSJP and achieve a reliable SDC design with a disturbance attenuation level γ $$ \gamma $$ . Furthermore, free-matrix-based (FMB) integral inequality and linear matrix inequality techniques are used to facilitate the derivation of key results.

Due to the problems, we calculate the operational matrix of derivatives, the operational matrix of the piecewise fractional derivative, and the pantograph operational matrix. By employing the proposed numerical algorithm, we transform the problems into a system of algebraic equations. Moreover, we discuss the error estimation of the approximate solution and residual error. Finally, we provide details on the implementation of this technique through several numerical examples to demonstrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new algorithmic framework for solving pseudomonotone equilibrium problems and demicontractive fixed-point problems. Unlike conventional methods that incorporate a single inertial step, our approach employs dual inertia to accelerate convergence while preserving stability. The proposed method combines the viscosity approximation technique with the extragradient method to guarantee strong convergence. Initially, the extragradient method is applied under a Lipschitz continuity assumption on the equilibrium bifunction. Subsequently, this condition is relaxed by adopting a self-adaptive step size strategy, allowing variable step sizes to be updated iteratively based on the current iterates information. Notably, the algorithm operates without requiring prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constants or any line search procedures. Strong convergence is established under mild condition, and its applicability to variational inequality problems is demonstrated. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its capability to handle large-scale and complex problems efficiently while outperforming traditional single-inertia methods.},

  abstract     = {Computer viruses have caused great harm and nasty effects on people's lives. Therefore, analyzing and establishing the corresponding mathematical model can help explore and study the propagation law of computer viruses. On this basis, we apply the theory of computer virus propagation dynamics by combining computer viruses and the variability of their removal rates of different states in the network. The study presents a new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIQRS) computer virus propagation model with two delays. In addition, we introduce impulse control, an optimal control method, to explore the effect of the impulse period on the model. We first derive the basic reproduction number of the model. Then, the characteristic equations and eigenvalues are discussed analytically by controlling the delay parameters variation in order to analyze local stability and Hopf bifurcation for the computer virus model. Next, we add impulse control and find that it could better control the propagation of computer viruses. Firstly, we analyze the dynamical behavior of this model using the relevant theories of time delay differential equations to provide a theoretical basis for the effective elimination and control of virus propagation in computer networks. Secondly, we use Matlab to conduct numerical simulations, which verify the correctness of theoretical results. Finally, we synthesize the theoretical and experimental analysis of the present model to provide some scientific suggestions for better control of the spreading of computer viruses.},

Traditional models often fail to capture such dynamics, making TFBSE particularly important for accurately reflecting market behaviors over time. In this paper, we propose a novel compact difference scheme to solve the mixed-type TFBSE. Discretization in the time direction is accomplished using the L1 scheme. To achieve fourth-order discretization in the spatial direction, a compact difference method based on the reduced-order method is employed. The stability and convergence of the proposed scheme under the norm are established using the discrete energy method. Finally, a series of numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results, demonstrating both the accuracy and efficiency of the method in practical applications.},

The nonlinear operator consists of arbitrary finite products and sums of the unknown function and its derivatives of arbitrary order. The equations allow for a trivial steady-state solution that becomes unstable when a control parameter exceeds a certain threshold. Unlike most of the previous research in this direction that considers specific equations, this general framework is suitable for extension in several directions such as the higher spatial dimensions and different basis vectors. Under a set of assumptions that are often valid in many interesting applications, we derive two numbers called the transition number and the critical index which completely describe the first dynamic transition. We make detailed numerical computations that reveal the properties of the transition numbers. To show the applicability of our theoretical results, we determine the first transitions of several well-known equations including the Cahn–Hilliard, thin film, Harry Dym, Kawamoto, and Rosenau–Hyman equations.},

Both the polynomial decay and its dependency on the parameters of the generalized Caputo derivative are numerically validated. To this end, an energy-conserving finite difference numerical scheme is employed.},

The deterministic model is solved by using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method, and Milstein's method is used for solving the stochastic model. Numerical simulations correlated quite strongly with observed data, while projections for the 2024–2030 period indicate that controlled population growth bodes well for the outlook of the economy for India, supporting economic prosperity alongside reduced inflation and better employment conditions. The findings presented in this work are correlational; therefore, to find the possible cause for this phenomenon, further research is required with detailed datasets. Comparing our model's GDP predictions with that obtained using a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model returned very high values of predictive accuracy, thus reinforcing the strength and reliability of our framework.},

  abstract     = {A Filippov system of crop-pest-natural enemy with a Holling-II type functional response function is developed based on the fear effect and threshold control strategy. The threshold control strategy is mainly a means of controlling pests and natural enemies. When the number of natural enemies is below a threshold, the natural enemies cannot achieve a controlling effect on the pest population and control is needed to suppress the outbreak. In this case, the fear of pests to natural enemies will affect the pest's survival mode, thus affecting the pest's dynamic behavior. However, the number of natural enemy population exceeds the threshold density, and there is no need to control the system. At this point, the pest's fear of natural enemies is almost zero. The dynamic behavior of the two subsystems of the model is discussed, the existence and stability of various equilibria are analyzed, and the existence of sliding and crossing regions is also investigated. In addition, it is possible that the established model has more than one pseudo-equilibrium. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of the pseudo-equilibria is analyzed, and we observe that Hopf bifurcation occurs near the pseudo-equilibria. By numerically simulating the global sliding bifurcation of the system, we discover that as the bifurcation parameters are varied, the system exhibits a series of bifurcations such as grazing bifurcation, buckling bifurcation, crossing bifurcation, and period-halving bifurcation.},

The stability and convergence analysis of the time-discrete outline are investigated by the energy approach. The spatial dimension of the model is discretized by the fourth-order local radial basis function-Hermite finite difference (RBF-HFD) method.

Our objective is twofold. First, we investigate the scenario where each velocity trajectory B $$ \mathfrak{B} $$ originating from Ω ‾ $$ \overline{\Omega} $$ enters the control region in a shorter time at a fixed entry time. By employing Agmon and dissipation inequalities, and Carleman estimate in the case is the gradient of a time-dependent scalar field, we establish that the control cost remains bounded for sufficiently small and large control time. Secondly, we explore the case where at least one trajectory fails to enter the control region and remains in . In this scenario, we prove that the control cost explodes exponentially when the diffusivity approaches zero and the control time is sufficiently small for general velocity.},

We proved the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for our pricing problem based on the two-dimensional finite element method. Due to the flexibility to continue or stop paying installments, installment options pricing can be modeled as an optimal stopping time problem. This problem is formulated as an equivalent free boundary problem and then as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). We wrote the resulted LCP in the form of a variational inequality and used the finite element method for the discretization. Then the resulting time-dependent LCPs are solved by using a projected successive over relaxation iteration method. Finally, we implemented our numerical method.

Due to the degeneracy, we first transfer to study an approximate nondegenerate system. Next, we establish the Carleman estimate for backward stochastic degenerate parabolic equation with convection term. In order to deal with the convection term, the Carleman estimate is established by introducing an auxiliary function to transfer the diffusion and the convection term into a whole complex divergence-like form. By this Carleman estimate, we then obtain an observability inequality for the adjoint system of the approximate system. Based on the observability inequality and an approximate argument, we proved our null controllability result.},

Soliton solutions are essential for analyzing nonlinear wave behaviors in different physical systems, and the Kaup–Newell model is also significant in this context. The model's ability to represent subpicosecond pulses makes it a significant tool for the research of nonlinear optics and plasma physics. Overall, the Kaup–Newell model is an important research domain in these areas, with ongoing efforts focused on understanding its various solutions and potential applications. A new version of the generalized exponential rational function method and -expansion function method are utilized to discover diverse soliton solutions. The generalized exponential rational function method facilitates the generation of multiple solution types, including singular, shock, singular periodic, exponential, combo trigonometric, and hyperbolic solutions in mixed forms. Thanks to -expansion function method, we obtain trigonometric, hyperbolic, and rational solutions. The modulation instability of the proposed model is examined, with numerical simulations complementing the analytical results to provide a better understanding of the solutions' dynamic behavior. These results offer a foundation for future research, making the solutions effective, manageable, and reliable for tackling complex nonlinear problems. The methodologies used in this study are robust, influential, and practicable for diverse nonlinear partial differential equations; to our knowledge, for this equation, these methods of investigation have not been explored before. The accuracy of each solution has been verified using the Maple software program.},

  abstract     = {We present a simplified mathematical and computational model of blood flow through a chamber of a healthy human heart, with a particular description of the left ventricle. We use fixed representations of the domain and mesh, assume blood to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid, and simulate the chamber volume variation by introducing a capacitance function, which is space and time-dependent. The inclusion of this capacitance function gives rise to a model whose differential form resembles the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical methodology is based on stable Galerkin mixed finite element formulations posed on velocity and pressure. Convergence studies for the two-dimensional steady-state Stokes equation with spatially-varying capacitance indicate optimal convergence orders when combining continuous biquadratic velocities with continuous bilinear pressures (Taylor–Hood elements) or discontinuous unmapped linear pressures. On the other hand, we observed loss of optimality with discontinuous linear mapped approximations for this field, as expected for the classical Stokes problem. Additional convergence studies indicate that the optimal convergence properties are preserved in the resolution of the nonlinear model, for the case of smooth solutions. Finally, we present simulations of cardiac cycles in an idealized human left ventricle in two and three dimensions. The results are meaningful given the model simplicity and open the possibility for future extensions of the proposed methodology.},

To demonstrate the results, the concept of bounded integral contractors is combined with the stochastic result and sequencing technique. In contrast to previous publications, we do not need to specify the induced inverse of the controllability operator to prove the stability results, and the relevant nonlinear function does not have to meet the Lipschitz condition. Furthermore, exponential stability results for neutral stochastic differential systems with Poisson jump have been established. Finally, an application to demonstrate the acquired results is discussed. We demonstrate the fractional Zener model for wave equation obeying the viscoelastic materials as a practical application of the system studied, which is a generalization of classical wave equation.},

The basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ is defined, and the existence of principal eigenvalue is studied.

We also prove the uniform persistence of the system. Four steady states were obtained, and it was shown that the existence of each of the steady state depends on 4 threshold quantities and we used a Lyapunov approach to prove the global stability of the steady state under certain assumptions.

  abstract     = {Robust H ∞ $$ {H}_{\infty } $$ performance analysis and robust H ∞ $$ {H}_{\infty } $$ filtering design are considered here for uncertain two-dimensional (2-D) singular continuous state-varying delay systems with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. Based on the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms and the use of the Wirtinger inequality combined with an improved reciprocally convex approach, a new sufficient admissibility condition is obtained, which guarantees that the 2-D singular filtering error is regular, causal, and stable and satisfies the H ∞ $$ {H}_{\infty } $$ performance for all admissible uncertainties. This condition will be used later to design a robust H ∞ $$ {H}_{\infty } $$ filter. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we analyze new properties of auto-wave solutions in fractional reaction-diffusion systems. These new properties arise due to a change in fractional derivative order and do not occur in systems with classical derivatives. It is shown that the stability of steady-state solutions and their evolution are mainly determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of a linearized system and the fractional derivative order. It is also demonstrated that the basic properties of auto-wave solutions in fractional-order systems can essentially differ from those in standard systems. The results of the linear stability analysis are confirmed by computer simulations of the generalized fractional van der Pol–FitzHugh–Nagumo mathematical model. A common picture of possible instabilities and auto-wave solutions in time-fractional two-component activator-inhibitor systems is presented.},

This approach effectively transforms these complex stochastic equations into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved using the Newton method. Balancing polynomials are chosen for their ability to enhance stability and convergence, providing a more reliable and manageable framework for tackling challenging stochastic problems. The paper also includes a convergence analysis and error estimation for the proposed method. Additionally, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through four numerical examples. The results obtained from this method are compared with the exact solution and those from other established techniques, including the block-pulse function method, the shifted Jacobi operational matrix (SJOM) method, and the shifted Jacobi spectral Galerkin (SJSG) method. These comparisons highlight the superior performance and accuracy of the proposed method. All numerical computations were performed using MATLAB.},

In addition, the changes in the pressure of the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid can cause changes to the pressure of the extracellular fluid which saturates the spinal cord. The finite element method can be used to solve the differential equations, which describe both how the cord deforms and changes in the pressure of the extracellular fluid but often this requires a large number of time-steps to obtain an accurate and stable numerical solution. We present an alternative approach that uses a Fourier series method that avoids the need for using a time-stepping scheme and that can model how a pressure pulse affects the spinal cord.},

The G ˜ $$ \tilde{G} $$ -expansion method is a transformation-based method that has been used a lot to solve nonlinear partial differential equations and fractional partial differential equations. This method produces several solitary wave solutions to the current problem by supposing a series-form solution. The generalized -expansion method, on the other hand, builds on the simple -expansion method by adding more parameters to the series-form solution. This makes finding more families of solitary wave solutions possible and better shows how the system changes over time. These techniques identify various traveling waves, such as periodic, kink, -shaped, bell-shaped, shock waves and others physical solutions. Some obtained solutions are graphically discussed to better visualize the wave phenomena connected to various symmetrical solitary wave solutions. The fractional Benney–Lin equation's dynamics and wave characteristics may be better understood through these graphical depictions, which makes it easier to analyze the model's behavior in detail.},

  abstract     = {The study of infectious disease dynamics plays an important role in reflecting the transmission mechanisms of epidemics. Compared with the traditional statistical methods, understanding dynamics of an infectious disease can better make people understand some global characteristics of epidemic and help in designing appropriate strategies to control diseases. Early studies of mumps mainly focused on deterministic models. However, environmental noises are inevitable during the spread of infectious diseases. This paper extends a mumps transmission model from a deterministic to a stochastic framework and explores the dynamical behaviors of the model by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our model is a six-dimensional stochastic model. The construction of suitable Lyapunov functions is very challenging. Firstly, we show that this model has a unique global positive solution for any positive initial values. Secondly, we compute the basic reproduction numbers and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and the extinction of the disease. Finally, we perform numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis for exploring the effect of some parameters and the white noises on the behavior of the model. The theoretical results can provide necessary guidelines to public health administrators for controlling and preventing diseases.},

Based on the initial condition, a key threshold in the model, namely, the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is obtained. Our focus is to investigate the impact of saturated immune delay on viral infection when CTLs are introduced at a constant rate. By constructing Lyapunov functionals, the stability conditions of equilibrium and equilibrium are established. Theoretical analysis indicates that equilibrium no longer remains stable and generates a Hopf bifurcation as immune delay changes. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the main theoretical results, and sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of the parameters on the threshold. Through these simulations, the general patterns of dynamic behavior of the model are revealed. In particular, when and , the dynamics of the endemic equilibrium exhibit complex behavior.},

Our numerical outcomes entail that increased zooplankton growth due to additional food leads to the disappearance of phytoplankton species, while a significant drop in nutrient levels results in zooplankton extinction within the ecosystem. Notably, the refuge by phytoplankton has a tendency to terminate the persistent oscillations and stabilize the system. As seasonal stochasticity significantly influences the dynamics of planktonic system, so we introduce seasonality into environmental noise and certain model parameters. In this case, we analyze both the regularity and the dichotomy between persistence and extinction. The numerical evidences demonstrate periodic solutions, strong/weak persistence, and plankton extinctions resulting from stochasticity and/or seasonality. Furthermore, the seasonally forced noise, intriguingly, has the capacity to exert control over hyperchaos, yielding a distinctive pattern in plankton populations.},

Furthermore, the moving least square (MLS) technique is implemented to interpolate and approximate the derivatives appeared in the equation. The main problem for challenging this combined scheme is nonlinear transient convective–radiative heat transfer in existence of a magnetic field. To study the efficiency of the MLS, the results would be contrasted with those extracted by a finite difference method (FDM) based PSO approach.

In addition, contact heterogeneity among individuals plays a significant role in cholera transmission. In this paper, we construct a multiscale coupled immuno-cholera model considering waning vaccine-induced immunity and hyperinfectious vibrios and utilize a nested approach to bridge within-host vibrio evolution and between-host cholera transmission on complex networks. The basic reproduction numbers and for the within- and between-host models are derived, respectively, and is validated to serve as a sharp threshold between extinction and persistence of cholera. Specifically, the global asymptotic stability of each feasible equilibrium for the between-host system is established by formulating appropriate Lyapunov functionals. Numerical simulations are performed to assess the influences of within-host vibrio dynamics and network topology on between-host cholera transmission dynamics. The results show that the equilibrium level of total infected individuals is a nonmonotonic function of vibrio growth rate, implying that hampering within-host vibrio growth by drug treatment during the outbreak could alter the long-term outcomes of cholera. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of network degree distributions increases the risk of cholera outbreaks, suggesting that isolation and supervision for infected individuals with high degrees are effective measures to prevent and control cholera transmission.},

First, a nonautonomous conformable fractional-order error systems are established, which include stable and unstable subsystems. Second, for the cases where the existing results are invalid to handle switched nonautonomous terms, a new conformable fractional-order Halanay inequality is obtained, which serves as a powerful tool in the analysis of quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs. Then, by virtue of the obtained Halanay inequality, Lyapunov method, and periodically intermittent controller, sufficient conditions of exponential quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs are derived. Our results allow nonautonomous terms to be switched during work time and rest time, which is more relaxing than the previous results. Finally, a simulation example is included to show the feasibility of the derived results.},

  abstract     = {This study is dedicated to the fixed-time (FDT) bipartite synchronization of stochastic multiplex signed networks via quantized generalized intermittent control (QGIC). Firstly, a multiplex network including signed graphs and stochastic disturbances is introduced. Secondly, a new lemma of FDT stability is established by using reduction to absurdity and mathematical induction. Thirdly, based on the proposed FDT stability and the stochastic analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions on FDT bipartite synchronization are derived by designing a novel QGIC strategy. Significantly, the designed controller is a unified form of periodic and aperiodic cases and is only activated in the work interval. At last, two numerical simulations are offered to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {For most systems, the appearance of Turing bifurcation means that it is possible to excite Turing–Turing bifurcation, thus inducing superimposed spatial patterns, multistable spatial patterns co-existing, and others.It is undoubtedly of interest to qualitatively analyze the structures and stability of these spatially heterogeneous solutions generated by Turing–Turing bifurcation. Therefore, in this paper, with the aid of the center manifold theory and the normal form method, for general partial functional differential equations with nonlinear diffusion, the third-order normal form is firstly derived. It is locally topologically equivalent to the primitive partial functional differential equations at the Turing–Turing bifurcation point. And then the explicit formulae for the coefficients in the normal form associated with three different spatial modes are presented. As an application, a predator–prey model with predator–taxis is considered. It is theoretically revealed that the system admits the coexistence of a pair of stable steady states with a single characteristic wavelength and the coexistence of four stable steady states with different single characteristic wavelengths. Further, the parameter regions in which these phenomena will arise are quantitatively given. It is illustrated that the self-diffusion of prey and predator–taxis complement each other to promote the formation for the spatially homogeneous distributions of populations.},

The work in the article is roughly divided into two parts. The first part, due to the change of conditions, we must consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system. In the second part, we show that the original system driven by Lévy noise is reduced into an effective equation. To be more accurate, the fast component equation is averaged out, and there exists an effective process converging to the original stochastic parabolic equation. The main contribution is that the obtained results can extend the existing results from the Lipschitz condition to a weaker condition with a wider application scope, that is, the non-Lipschitz condition, and the driving process is Lévy noise, which seems new in the existing literature.},

First, the effects of system parameters on the supercritical pitchfork bifurcations are discussed in detail by applying the fast-slow separation method. Second, it is rigorously proved by the Melnikov method that chaotic vibration exists when the parameters of the uncontrolled system are selected above the threshold of chaos occurrence. By fine-tuning the system parameters, a criterion for designing the control parameters to make the Melnikov function non-zero is derived. In addition, the routes to chaos in controlled system are explored by bifurcation diagrams, largest Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincaré maps, basins of attraction, frequency spectra, and displacement time series. The results indicate that by properly adjusting the displacement feedback coefficient and the amplitude of parameter excitation, the chaotic motion caused by increasing of the amplitude of external excitation and strength of distributed time delay can be effectively suppressed. This research result can provide theoretical support for exploring the potential chaotic motion of other types of oscillators.},

The same as the existing studies of inverse random source problems, some theoretical results of the corresponding direct and inverse problems have been investigated in this paper. The difference is that the source term is driven by time-fractional Brownian motion, and the spatial function in the source term needs to be determined. It has been found that, for different problems, the properties of the integrand in the corresponding stochastic integrals are distinct, which has a significant impact on the entire theoretical analysis. For the problem considered here, the lack of monotonicity in the integrand of the stochastic integrals makes the analysis more challenging. Additionally, biharmonic operators will cause some difficulties in numerical calculations.},

By separating the variables, the equation in two dimensions is reduced to the product of two time-dependent equations in one dimension that can be solved analytically. Some analysis and graphical plotting with discussion related to the product solution are given. Comparisons with an available analytical solution for a steady-state case and numerical simulations are also addressed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the equivalence canonical forms of two sets of five quaternion matrices are considered. The simultaneous decompositions of these two sets of quaternion matrices are established. Some practical algorithms for computing the decompositions are also presented. Using the equivalence canonical forms, some practical solvability conditions for two systems of generalized Sylvester-type quaternion matrix equations are derived in terms of the ranks of the coefficient matrices. The general solutions to the systems are also provided. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the results. The proposed simultaneous decompositions are applied to construct a new framework of color watermarks embedding. In this framework, five color watermarks can be embedded into one host image simultaneously with high efficiency. Moreover, a counterexample for the existence of the equivalence canonical form of the general matrix quaternity with the same row or column numbers is presented. The results extend the existing findings on the equivalence canonical forms of general matrix arrays.},

Further, we classify the one-dimensional optimal algebra, and using that, we obtain the similarity variables, which consequently reduces the time fractional partial differential equation (FPDE) to fractional-order ordinary differential equation (FODE). Next, under the invariance condition, we construct exact solution for the given model and presented graphically. Furthermore, we derive the two-dimensional optimal systems and nonclassical symmetry for the governing equation. Finally, we study the nature of fluid flow through the foam by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Hyperthermia, also called as thermal ablation, is used to treat some advanced cancers. Numerous clinical trials indicate that hyperthermia, when combined with therapies like radiation and chemotherapy, can reduce tumor size and potentially enhance their ability to eradicate cancerous cells. Hence, it is of utmost importance to study the behavior and transmission dynamics of in vivo malignant tumors subjected to hyperthermia. To this purpose, a mathematical model has been formulated, primarily based on the reaction–diffusion equation, imposed with suitable initial and boundary conditions. As the advanced tumors usually consist of five layers, the domain is discretized into five compartments. The model is then solved analytically using the eigenvalue expansion method to determine the tumor cell volume profiles, in the presence and absence of hyperthermia. The main foci of the developed model are the discretization of the domain, variable nature of various physiological parameters involved, and its analytical solution, thereby aiming at strengthening the novelties of the present work. The model outcome and simulations obtained are compared with the previously published/clinical results to prove the validity and feasibility of the proposed work. This work is expected to provide an optimum mathematical model utilizing best mathematical techniques that can greatly aid researchers and biologists in the field of oncology to streamline the process and reduce costs associated with cancer treatment.},

However, their reliance on a single modifiable parameter limits their adaptability. This paper aims to explore generalized logistic maps with arbitrary powers, which offer greater flexibility compared to the standard logistic map. By introducing additional parameters in the form of arbitrary powers, these maps exhibit increased degrees of freedom, thus expanding their applicability across a wider spectrum of scenarios. Consequently, the conventional logistic map emerges as a specific instance within the proposed framework. The inclusion of arbitrary powers enriches system dynamics, enabling a more nuanced exploration of system behavior in diverse contexts. Through a series of illustrations, this study investigates the influence of arbitrary powers and equation parameters on equilibrium points, their positions, stability conditions, basin of attraction, and bifurcation diagrams, including the emergence of chaotic behavior.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a set of Newton-type inequalities for n -times differentiable convex functions using the Caputo fractional operator, extending classical results into the fractional calculus domain. Our exploration also includes the derivation of Newton-type inequalities for various classes of functions by employing the Caputo fractional operator, thereby broadening the scope of these inequalities beyond convexity. In addition, we establish several fractional Newton-type inequalities by using bounded functions in conjunction with fractional integrals. Furthermore, we develop specific fractional Newton-type inequalities tailored to Lipschitzian functions. Moreover, the paper emphasizes the significance of fractional calculus in refining classical inequalities and demonstrates how the Caputo fractional operator provides a more generalized framework for addressing problems involving non-integer order differentiation. The inclusion of bounded and Lipschitzian functions introduces additional layers of complexity, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of function behaviors under fractional operations.},

A central aspect of the study is the behavior of rotating micropolar fluids within a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium, enhanced by the inclusion of electromagnetic forces. The effects of embedding nanoparticles TiO 2 and CoFe 2 O 4 in a water-based fluid are explored to reveal their influence on fluid motion and heat transfer. The thermal dynamics are scrutinized, with particular emphasis on the roles of heat absorption and viscous dissipation. Moreover, this study incorporates both endothermic and exothermic reactions in radiative flows, alongside the impact of Soret and Dufour diffusion effects. The discharge of wastewater is a critical issue in environmental management and industrial applications, underscoring the need for rigorous regulation to prevent water pollution and ensure adherence to environmental standards. This research addresses the non-Newtonian flow resulting from wastewater discharge, incorporating Arrhenius activation energy in the analysis. Furthermore, the behavior of microorganisms within the flow is studied under velocity slip conditions and a range of convective boundary conditions. Through the application of similarity transformations, the governing differential equations are derived and solved numerically using MATLAB's bvp4c solver, with results depicted through detailed graphical analysis to illustrate the fluid's complex behavior. The heat transfer rate gets reduced by 1.96% with the enhancement in the Eckert number.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an innovative hybrid discrete-continuum model that provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the intricate interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and the effects of immunotherapy. This study distinguishes itself by addressing the limitations of traditional diffusion models, which often fail to capture the irregular and nonlocal movements of cells within the complex tumor microenvironment. To overcome these challenges, we employ fractional time derivatives and the fractional Laplacian operator, offering a more accurate representation of anomalous diffusion processes that are critical in cancer dynamics. Our research begins with a rigorous mathematical analysis, where we establish the global existence of a unique mild solution, laying a solid theoretical foundation for the model. A key innovation of our study is the introduction of the “invasion threshold,” a critical parameter inspired by the next-generation operator used in epidemiological modeling. This threshold provides a powerful tool for determining the existence and stability of equilibrium points, offering deep insights into the conditions that either promote or inhibit tumor growth under immunotherapeutic interventions. By integrating a hybrid discrete-continuum approach, we capture the individual behavior of each cell, allowing for a more detailed exploration of the dynamic interplay within the tumor microenvironment. This model not only advances our understanding of tumor-immune interactions but also holds potential for informing more effective therapeutic strategies, making a significant contribution to the field of mathematical oncology.},

The topological stability of the solutions with respect to the parameters is explored in order to better understand the effect of parameters perturbations on the stability of the model's solutions.

To start with, achieving diverse solitary wave solutions to the generalized power-law model involves using wave transformation, which reduces the model to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. A direct integration approach is adopted to construct solutions in the beginning. This brings the emergence of interesting solutions like non-topological solitons, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, elliptic functions, and Weierstrass functions in general structures. Besides, in a bid to secure more general exact solutions to the model, one adopts the extended Jacobi elliptic function expansion technique (for some specific cases of n $$ n $$ ). Thus, various cnoidal, snoidal, and dnoidal wave solutions to the understudied model are attained. The copolar trio explicated in a tabular form reveals that these solutions can be relapsed to various hyperbolic and trigonometric functions under certain criteria. Additionally, diverse graphical exhibitions of the dynamical attributes of the gained results are presented in a bid to have a sound understanding of the physical phenomena of the underlying model. Later, one gives the conserved vectors of the aforementioned equation by employing the standard multiplier approach.},

  abstract     = {The study focuses on the fractional complex order plant model, which has gained popularity in applied mathematics, physics, and control systems. A significant contribution of this research lies in discussing the physical phenomena associated with complex plant models and their impact on system stability and robustness. The main purpose of the method presented in this paper is to tune the controller parameters to ensure the stability and robustness of the system. There are methods presented in the literature for this purpose. One of these methods is to keep the phase curve in the system frequency response flat within a certain range. However, this process is based on equating the derivative of the phase value to zero at a certain frequency and adds great mathematical complexity to the calculations. In this study, reliable analytical formulas are presented for the same purpose using a graphical approach. Since the fractional complex order plant model represents the most general mathematical form, it enables easy creation of other plant models, including integer order and fractional order plant. The reason why this plant is chosen is that this structure can be named as the universal plant, which all other structures can be built by making little variations. For instance, a transfer function having integer, real and/or complex number coefficients and/or orders can be obtained by proper determination of the parameters of the universal plant. A time delay can also be added towards researcher's desire. The main inspiration comes from studying on an inclusive plant. The method in this paper intends to tune the well-known classical Proportional Integral Derivative controller. Thus, effectiveness of the integer order controller on various plants will be shown. This approach provides analytical calculation equations for the physical modifications of plants with integer, fractional, and/or complex coefficients and/or orders. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated visually with different examples that include these different possible situations. The results observed in the changes of the parameters in the transfer functions were also examined. Thus, pros and cons of the variations of integer, fractional, and complex numbers on system parameters have been shown.},

On the flip side, implementing harvesting is an infection control measure. In the present work, we use the dynamical system theory to discuss the dynamics of the harvested prey–predator system in the presence of infection in prey species. Detailed mathematical and numerical evaluations have been presented to discuss the susceptible-free state, infection-free state, predator-free state, species coexistence, stability, and occurrence of various bifurcations (saddle-node, transcritical, and Hopf bifurcation). The study reveals the impact of harvesting parameters on the dynamics. Interestingly, we observe that an infection-free state could be achieved by varying the harvesting parameter under all three harvesting schemes (linear, quadratic, and nonlinear). Moreover, with the help of reproduction number, we claim that linear harvesting is more effective in controlling the infection than quadratic and nonlinear harvesting provided the half-saturation constant for nonlinear harvesting is greater than a threshold value ( = 1 ) $$ \left(&amp;amp;#x0003D;1\right) $$ ; otherwise, nonlinear harvesting is more effective. Also, the system can support more susceptible prey in the presence of harvesting. The present theoretical study suggests different threshold values of implemented harvesting to control the disease.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this article is to design a more flexible algorithm than the ones used previously for solving constrained generalized equations. It turns out that the new algorithm even if specialized provides a finer error analysis with advantages: larger radius of convergence; tighter upper error bounds on the distances; and a more precise information on the isolation of the solution. Moreover, the same advantages exist even if the generalized equation reduces to a nonlinear equation. These advantages are obtained under the same computational cost, since the new parameters and majorant functions are special cases of the ones used in earlier studies. Applications complement the theoretical results.},

We firstly prove the well-posedness of solution by means of the monotone operator theory. At the same time, we obtain the dissipative property of the dynamical system ( 𝔼 , S ( t ) ) associated with the problem in the space H 0 2 ( Ω ) × L 2 ( Ω ) $$ {H}_0&#x0005E;2\left(\Omega \right)\times {L}&#x0005E;2\left(\Omega \right) $$ and D A 3 4 × H 0 1 ( Ω ) $$ D\left({A}&#x0005E;{\frac{3}{4}}\right)\times {H}_0&#x0005E;1\left(\Omega \right) $$ , respectively. After that, the asymptotic smoothness of the dynamical system ( 𝔼 , S ( t ) ) and the further quasi-stability are demonstrated by the energy reconstruction method. Finally, we show not only the existence of the finite global attractor but also the existence of the generalized exponential attractor.},

The threshold R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ of model and the expressions of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium are calculated, proving the existence of backward bifurcation. Backward bifurcation is caused by the imperfect protection rate of susceptible population due to education. Using China's actual data for parameter fitting, it is found that new HIV infections are on an upward trend. In response to this phenomenon, publicity and education, condoms, screening, and treatment of infected populations are considered as control measures. It is concluded that publicity and education is the primary strategy. This measure can not only effectively reduce the number of infected populations but also effectively increase the awareness rate of HIV-infected populations. It is recommended to use condoms and have fewer sexual partners during sexual contact. Numerical simulation verifies that early stage publicity and education are much more important than post-infection screening and treatment measures.},

  abstract     = {The Boltzmann equation is a typical example of partially dissipative equations, where the linearized collision operator is positive definite with respect to the microscopic part and the dissipation of the hydrodynamic part is discovered from the coupling structure between the transport operator and the linearized collision operator. Guo and Wang (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 37, 2012) developed a general energy method for proving the optimal time decay rates of the solution to such type of equations in the whole space; however, the decay rate of the highest order spatial derivatives of the solution is not optimal. In this paper, by incorporating the high-low frequency decomposition in the energy estimates, both linearly and nonlinearly, we prove the optimal decay rates of any high order spatial derivatives of the low frequency part of the solution to the Boltzmann equation and the almost exponential decay rate of the high frequency part, which imply in particular the optimal decay rate of the highest order spatial derivatives of the solution. Moreover, the velocity-weighted assumption of the initial data required in Guo and Wang (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 37, 2012) is removed by capturing the time-weighted dissipation estimates via the time-weighted energy method. The method can be applied to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and many partially dissipative equations in kinetic theory and fluid dynamics.},

A new dual operator is also introduced by replacing the discrete fractional Caputo operator with the discrete fractional Riemann–Liouville operator. It is shown that it corresponds to a natural discretization of a proportional hybrid operator defined by the Riemann–Liouville operator instead of Caputo hybrid operator. We then analyze the most important properties of these operators, such as their inverse operator and the -transform, among others. As an application, we solve difference equations equipped with these operators and obtain explicit solutions for them in terms of trivariate Mittag-Leffler sequences.},

The system takes into account chemotactic sensitivity in the reaction movement when detecting these chemicals. Under certain assumptions, we demonstrate the existence of a unique global bounded classical solution for the proposed problem.

  abstract     = {Quantum graphs model processes in complex systems represented as spatial networks in various fields of natural science and technology. An example is the oscillations of elastic string networks, the nodes of which, besides the continuity conditions, also obey the Kirchhoff conditions, expressing the balance of tensions. In this paper, we propose a new look at quantum graphs as temporal networks, which means that the variable parametrizing the edges of a graph is interpreted as time, while each internal vertex is a branching point giving several different scenarios for the further trajectory of a process. Then Kirchhoff-type conditions may also arise. Namely, they will be satisfied by such a trajectory of the process that is optimal with account of all the scenarios simultaneously. By employing the recent concept of global delay, we extend the problem of damping a first-order control system with aftereffect, considered earlier only on an interval, to an arbitrary tree graph. The first means that the delay, imposed starting from the initial moment of time, associated with the root of the tree, propagates through all internal vertices. Bringing the system into the equilibrium and minimizing the energy functional with account of the anticipated probability of each scenario, we come to a variational problem. Then, we establish its equivalence to a self-adjoint boundary value problem on the tree for some second-order equations involving both the global delay and the global advance. The unique solvability of both problems is proved. We also illustrate that the interval case when the coefficients of the equation are discrete stochastic processes in discrete time can be viewed as the extension to a tree.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new numerical method to simulate acoustic scattering problems in two-dimensional periodic structures with non-periodic incident fields. Applying the Floquet-Bloch transform to the scattering problem yields a family of quasi-periodic boundary value problems dependent on the Floquet-Bloch parameter. Consequently, the solution of the original scattering problem is written as the inverse Floquet-Bloch transform of the solutions to these boundary value problems. The key step in our method is the numerical approximation of this integral transform by a quadrature rule with a nonuniform choice of quadrature points adapted to the regularity of the family of quasi-periodic solutions. This achieved by a graded subdivision of the full interval for the Floquet-Bloch parameter and applying a Gauss-Legrendre quadrature rule on each subinterval. We prove that the numerical method converges exponentially with respect to both the number of subintervals and the number of Gaussian quadrature points. Some numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the results.},

Firstly, eight different types of bifurcation states of the system under different parameters are calculated by using the undisturbed system. Secondly, the Melnikov method is used to explore the effect of time delay velocity on the threshold of chaos in the Smale horseshoe sense under the double-well potential and three-well potential of the system. Finally, through numerical analysis of the phase diagram, bifurcation diagram, and maximum Lyapunov exponent, the influence of time delay velocity on system chaos is studied. The results indicate that an increase in the delay velocity coefficient will lead to the system transitioning from a chaotic state to a periodic state, while an increase in the delay velocity term will lead to the system transitioning from a periodic state to a chaotic state. In the study of system bifurcation, it is found that the position of the equilibrium points of the system changes during periodic motion. Therefore, cell mapping is used to draw the attractive domain of the system is studying the influence of initial conditions on the equilibrium point of the system and the results show that there is a close relationship between the attraction domain and the process of chaos occurrence.},

  abstract     = {As many countries are hit by the social economic impact of heroin addiction, there is an urgent need to have an effective awareness program that focuses on educating the population on the danger of heroin addiction and helping the heroin-users quit. This paper aims to study the effect of the awareness program on the spread of heroin dependence using a mathematical model with distributed delay. First, we show the existence threshold parameter R 0 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0 $$ , which we call the basic reproduction number of the spread of heroin use. We prove, via the Lyapunov direct method, that the drug-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . If R 0 > 1 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the drug dependence persists, and the drug equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. We give three possible scenarios to find the optimal awareness program strategy that puts the heroin epidemic under control. These scenarios take into consideration the reachability of the population, the immunity against heroin addiction, and the effectiveness of the program to contain the use of heroin in the population and bring R 0 $$ {\mathfrak{R}}_0 $$ below one.},

The same is true when consequences (information) from a data set modeled by logical rules need to be obtained. In this framework, this information is obtained from the immediate consequences operator and ensuring its continuity is fundamental for making sure the computation of this information in a countable number of iterations. Recently, a versatile operator using generalized quantifiers has been introduced. This note will advance in the knowledge introducing necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure the continuity of this new flexible operator.},

From the point of view of the indicator function of the enclosure method, there are two types of heterogeneous parts: “minus group” and “plus group.” For example, cavities with the Dirichlet boundary condition belong to the minus group, while inclusions with smaller propagation velocity belong to the plus group. The heterogeneous part of the minus group gives a negative sign to the indicator function, and the heterogeneous part of the plus group gives a positive sign. In general, the presence of many types of heterogeneous parts causes cancelation of the sign of the indicator function. Such cases are referred to as “mixed cases.” Here, we consider the case that the shortest length obtained from the indicator function is attained only by heterogeneous parts of the same group. This case is called the “mixed but separated case,” and it is shown that the method of elliptic estimates developed by Ikehata works well. We also show that the case of a two-layered background medium with a flat layer can be considered in the same way as the case of a homogeneous background medium.},

  abstract     = {A filtration system comprising a Biot poroelastic solid coupled to an incompressible Stokes free-flow is considered in 3D. Across the flat 2D interface, the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman coupling conditions are taken. In the inertial, linear, and non-degenerate case, the hyperbolic-parabolic coupled problem is posed through a dynamics operator on a chosen energy space, adapted from Stokes-Lamé coupled dynamics. A semigroup approach is utilized to circumvent issues associated to mismatched trace regularities at the interface. The generation of a strongly continuous semigroup for the dynamics operator is obtained via a non-standard maximality argument. The latter employs a mixed-variational formulation in order to invoke the Babuška-Brezzi theorem. The Lumer-Philips theorem then yields semigroup generation, and thereby, strong and generalized solutions are obtained. For the linear dynamics, density obtains the existence of weak solutions; we extend to the case where the Biot compressibility of constituents degenerates. Thus, for the inertial linear Biot-Stokes filtration system, we provide a clear elucidation of strong solutions and a construction of weak solutions, as well as their regularity through associated estimates.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a devastating and rapidly spreading disease. Despite years of scientific research and numerous efforts, it is still a major and resurgent health problem worldwide, with high mortality rates. Added to the concern is that TB persists as a latent infection, an occult face of TB, that becomes a potential reservoir for active tuberculosis. Since latent TB-infected patients may eventually advance to the active form of TB, an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of latent tuberculosis are essential for TB control. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment is a prominent component of TB control in low-prevalence countries like the United States; however, its implication in high-incidence countries like India is still challenging. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing diagnosis and treatment of LTBI in high-incidence countries using a mathematical model-based approach. Through our model, we predicted the incidence rate based on the current treatment regimen in India for the year 2035, which is one of the milestones of WHO for a substantial reduction in TB incidence. We observed demographic variability in the effects of various parameters on the TB incidence rate. Finally, we formulated the putative treatment strategies to reduce the TB burden in high-incidence scenarios. Further, we estimated the impact of these proposed treatment strategies on the drug-resistant population in high-incidence scenarios. The model predictions suggested molding the current treatment strategies and focused implementation of LTBI diagnosis and treatment in high-incidence scenarios.},

After the time discretization, we have used polynomial scaling functions for the discretization of the spatial variable. These two discretizations give us the desired discrete system of equations to obtain numerical solutions. We further derive an error estimate for the proposed method. We have applied the proposed method to Rosenau-KdV, Rosenau-RLW, and Rosenau-KdV-RLW equations and used error norms to examine the accuracy and reliability of the presented method. Also, to enhance accuracy of the results, we utilize Richardson extrapolation.

  abstract     = {Safeguarding important links is a useful way to promote network vulnerability, especially in sparse networks where random link failures can disconnect the network. Sustaining network connectivity is the main goal of safeguarding and can be handled by selectively safeguarding links belonging to certain cuts of a network. However, due to the inherent high complexity of cut enumeration, existing algorithms can only handle small-scale networks with limited nodes. It is important to find practical algorithms that are feasible for large-scale graphs, as a significant portion of real-world graphs under investigation are not as small as dozens of nodes. To address the problem, we propose to use a high-precision approximate approach to accelerate the first step of the two-step safeguard process and thus accelerate the whole process. A Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to exploit efficient random paths for small cuts enumeration, which can help locate important edges with high probability in large-scale sparse networks. These edges will then be utilized to find the approximated minimum cost edge set whose safeguarding can sustain the expected network connectivity. The algorithm is validated using various sizes of graphs of random/Barbasi–Albert scale-free/Clustered scale-free/unit disk/Watts–Strogatz small-world and real-world graphs. The experimental results show that the algorithm can perfectly sustain the network connectivity, and the acceleration ratio of more than 10 5 can be achieved with a little additional overhead. Specifically, in large graphs of one million nodes, approximated safeguard solutions survive at least 99.9% random link failures, and the solution time can be further reduced to dozens of seconds when the algorithm steps are easily implemented in full parallel.},

We provide a detailed analysis of the HPV model and established results for boundedness of the solutions and existence of a positively invariant and attracting set. The basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is characterized, and it is shown that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ and the system is uniformly persistent if R 0 > 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ . Sensitivity analysis of R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ reveals that HPV vaccination can mitigate HPV transmission, and HPV vaccination along with screening can further reduce the spread of HPV infection. Numerical simulations showed that the public awareness of screening after being vaccinated is contributing to reduce the spread of epidemic, and the role of screening awareness in controlling the disease was significantly greater among men than women. Besides, the numerical simulations reveal that increasing vaccination rates for male is effective in controlling HPV transmission. Hence, it is necessary to enhance the screening for men. Moreover, increasing vaccination rates is more effective than increasing screening awareness in eliminating the epidemic.},

Our study focuses on the dimensionless form of the flow equations and examines three key dimensionless parameters: drag, lift, and pressure drop. Upon applying finite element method (FEM) discretization, the system is converted into a set of linear or nonlinear ordinary differential equations or algebraic equations for steady-state scenarios.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a nonlinear epidemiological model called susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic infected, infected, and recovered (SEAIR) with a control input (vaccination), which helps to design a sliding mode vaccination strategy by tracking the prevalence of infectious diseases. First, the effective reproduction number is adjusted to the expected value to control infectious disease outbreaks, even with model parameter changes and systematic perturbations. Meanwhile, based on the sliding mode control theory, two control strategies, namely, first-order sliding mode control and super-twisting control, are proposed to control the spread of COVID-19. Besides, an integral sliding surface associated with the effective reproduction number R 0 ( t ) $$ {R}_0(t) $$ is constructed to eliminate the chattering problem of the system. Moreover, the sliding mode controller is robust to uncertainties and external perturbations. The stability and finite-time convergence of the closed-loop control system are verified by Lyapunov's second method. Also, the effect of the two control strategies on the system performance is evaluated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, this paper presents a practical case simulation based on data from Wuhan. The results indicate that universal vaccination is crucial in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the epidemic progresses, vaccination is still an essential approach for epidemic prevention and control.},

The results show that both the diameter and volume of viscous fluids expand to infinity as time goes to infinity, and the algebraic rate of expansion is not bigger than that of inviscid fluids (Euler equations). In particular, the results contain the spherically symmetric case, in which the free boundary will grow linearly in time, exactly as that in inviscid fluids.

  abstract     = {This paper strives to investigate the time fractional system that characterizes the ion sound wave influenced by the ponderomotive force induced by a high-frequency field, as well as the Langmuir wave in plasma. Initially, based on the qualitative theory for planar integrable systems, four-phase portraits are found in the ( u , y ) $$ \left(u,y\right) $$ phase plane under certain conditions on the physical parameters. These conditions are used to prove analytically the existence of solitary, kink (anti-kink), periodic, super-periodic, and unbounded wave solutions. The correspondence between the energy levels, phase orbits, and consequently the type of the solution is announced. We derived the bounded wave solutions associated with the phase orbits, which are shown to be consistent with the qualitative analysis of the types of solutions. Moreover, we studied the consistency between the obtained solutions by investigating the degeneracy of the solutions through the transmission between the phase orbits, or equivalently, through the dependence on the initial conditions. With the presence of perturbed periodic terms, the quasi-periodic behavior and chaotic patterns are investigated.},

Generally, by contrast, the solution space of half-linear differential equations is homogeneous but not additive. Numerous oscillation and nonoscillation theorems have been devised for half-linear differential equations featuring periodic functions as coefficients. However, in certain cases, such as applying Mathieu-type differential equations to control engineering, which is a typical example of the Hill equation, some oscillation theorems cannot be applied. In this study, we established oscillation and nonoscillation theorems for half-linear Hill-type differential equations with periodic damping. To prove the results, we used the Riccati technique and the composite function method, which focuses on the composite function of the indefinite integral of the coefficients of the target equation and an appropriate multivalued continuously differentiable function. Furthermore, we discuss the special case of the oscillation constant of a damped half-linear Mathieu equation.},

The polymer industry has shown particular interest in studies on more environmentally friendly epoxidation processes that use vegetable oils. Epoxidized vegetable oils are renewable, affordable, and eco-friendly, which makes them a promising green material to partially replace and toughen polymers derived from petrochemicals. Using a kinetic model from the literature, this study develops a system of fractional-order differential equations to investigate the significance of oleic acid epoxidation. With oleic acid serving as the primary raw material, the study focuses on producing epoxidized oleic acid with a high yield and a longer reaction time. We apply both qualitative and quantitative analysis to the model using fixed-point theorems. The model's Ulam–Hyers stability is established. Investigation of the fractional operator's effect is done through computational simulations and the Laplace Adomian decomposition technique. The investigation of the effects of fractional operators on the epoxidation process reveals that temperature, molar ratios, and fractional order are significant determinants of the process.},

Stability results are derived in terms of threshold parameters. Basic reproduction number is calculated for stability analysis. Using the adjoint system, the form of the law enforcement factor is obtained in terms of state space variables.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a singular diffusive predator–prey model with Beddington–DeAngelis functional response, employing geometric singular perturbation theory and Bendixson's criteria. Our investigation revolves around transforming the reaction–diffusion equation into a multi-scale four-dimensional slow–fast system with two different orders of small parameters. Through once singular perturbation analysis, our focus shifts towards exploring the existence of heteroclinic orbits in a three-dimensional system. We analyze these dynamics through the perspective of the Fisher–KPP equation in two limit cases. In the first case, only the normal to the two-dimensional slow manifold is unstable. This allows for the deduction of existence of heteroclinic orbits in the three-dimensional system through investigating the dynamics on the two-dimensional slow manifold. Consequently, we obtain both monotonic traveling fronts and non-monotonic fronts with oscillatory tails. In the second case, the normal to the one-dimensional slow manifold exhibits both stable and unstable directions, then it is impossible to restrict the dynamics of the three-dimensional system entirely to the slow manifold. Instead, we integrate the slow orbits of the reduced system with the fast orbits of the layer system to construct a singular heteroclinic orbit. According to Fenichel's theorem, we discover the existence of exact heteroclinic orbits of three-dimensional system and derive the monotonic traveling fronts under weaker parameter conditions. Additionally, we also discuss the nonexistence of traveling fronts. Finally, we demonstrate our theoretical results with numerical simulations.},

It can be formulated as an initial boundary value problem with a contact discontinuity as a free boundary. The Lagrangian transformation is employed to straighten and fix the contact discontinuity, and the rotating Euler system is reduced to a first-order hyperbolic system for the Riemann invariants. The key ingredient of the analysis is to obtain the estimates of the solution for the associated linearized hyperbolic system via the characteristic method.},

  abstract     = {Congenital Rubella, AIDS , and other human diseases may pass from mother to fetus through the placenta. On the other side, insects and plants often transmit vertically by their eggs/seeds. Here, we study an SEIR epidemic model with vertical transmission in a multi-patch context to explore the spread of disease in a population divided into n $$ n $$ distinct regions. The local and global stability of disease-free equilibrium for the n-patch model system has been determined in terms of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) $$ \left({R}_0\right) $$ . Moreover, we discuss the existence and stability of endemic equilibrium for different cases in two symmetric regions. Our findings indicate that when R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, whereas when R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is greater than one, it is unstable. As a result, for R 0 > 1 $$ {R}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the model system has an unique endemic equilibrium that is always locally asymptotically stable. The dynamics of the proposed model system depending on the distribution of infected individuals across various regions have been studied. The findings suggest that the movements from high disease risk regions to low disease risks may increase the number of the infected population in the community. The value of R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ could be enhanced by increasing the values of any vertical transmission parameter. However, the changes in the values of R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ are relatively minor. Our findings also imply that while migrations of all individuals across symmetric regions do not leave any impact on the equilibrium state of the infected population, they do affect the trajectory of the solution to reach a steady-state. The flow of people between the two symmetrical regions could not alter the endemicity.},

Unlike most articles on this subject, which employ the scalar wave equation when analyzing the asymptotic behavior of structural acoustic models, in this paper, we consider classical equations in terms of flow velocity and pressure to describe the acoustic vibrations of the fluid which fills the cavity. This allows to consider, for example, more realistic boundary conditions to model the coupling on the interface between the acoustic chamber and the wall. The main result of this paper, concerning the exponential stability of the model, is established by means of the frequency domain method and the semigroup theory. This method can be adapted to other first-order hyperbolic dissipative systems as well.},

We first prove that this model has a zero-Hopf equilibrium point, after we show that from this equilibrium bifurcates a small limit cycle, and finally, we provide the explicit expression of the first two terms in the power series of this limit cycle. These differential systems for which the equilibrium point is non hyperbolic are not easy to study, in particular, if the equilibrium is zero-Hopf. As far as we know, this is the first time that the averaging theory has been used to exhibit the first and second terms of the power series expansion of the analytical expression of a limit cycle that bifurcates from a zero-Hopf equilibrium in the food chain models.},

In order to profoundly analyze the physical and mathematical discussions, some illustrative behavioral results are exhibited for various values of physical parameters. Especially for the different values of diffusion coefficients in the model under consideration, their effects on the behavior of the solitary wave are discussed and observationally supported by considering various illustrations. It is also seen that the solutions representing the diffusion seen to be in the form of the behavior of hexagonal Turing patterns in different time periods. The application of this study in mathematical biology is to analyze the relationship between the population density of certain species in any local region and the specific population density with invasion characteristics. In addition, the formation of the extinction vortex of the invading population, depending on the characteristics of the solutions presented, is also descriptively discussed.},

The results show that the hyperbolic equilibria corresponding to the seven standard forms of three-dimensional linear systems are Jacobi unstable. This is completely different from what we got before in two-dimensional systems, where Jacobi stable and Jacobi unstable correspond to focus and node, respectively. All equilibria of classical Lü chaotic system and Yang-Chen chaotic system are Jacobi unstable. Meanwhile, in three-dimensional linear case, the torsion tensors at any point of the trajectory are identically equal to zero, but the two nonlinear systems have nonzero torsion tensors components.},

Firstly, applying the semi-tensor product (STP) method of matrices, a parallel extension system is constructed, based on which a necessary and sufficient condition to detect the observability of the SBNs is given. Secondly, when an SBN is unobservable, the specific steps to obtain the required measurements to make the system observable are given using the set reachable method; however, the measurements given in this part are not necessarily the fewest. Then, a criterion for determining the minimum number of measurements is further proposed through a constructed indicator matrix.

Linear feedback law and local viscosity are considered, as are nonlinear feedback law and internal anti-damping. The hybrid system is first reduced to a first-order port-Hamiltonian system with dynamical boundary conditions, and the resulting system is discretized using the average central-difference scheme. Second, the UES of the discrete system is obtained without prior knowledge of the exponential stability of the continuous system. The frequency domain characterization of UES for a family of contractive semigroups and the discrete multiplier approach are used to validate the main conclusions. Finally, the Trotter–Kato theorem is used to perform a convergence study on the numerical approximation approach. Most notably, the exponential stability of the continuous system is derived by the convergence of energy and UES, which is a novel approach to studying the exponential stability of some complex systems. Numerical simulation is used to validate the effectiveness of the numerical approximating strategy.},

Here, we aimed to assess reaction–diffusion (RD) with dichotomous noise-controlling system parameters in the Brusselator and examine the effect of these fluctuations on the dynamic behavior of chemical reactions. By performing a multiscale perturbation analysis, we demonstrated that the correlated noise can broaden the Turing region even if molecular memory (autocorrelation time) exists. However, for small noise, short-term memory promotes Turing instability. The instability of the Brusselator is determined by the noise strength, which belongs to the optimal region if the diffusion coefficient is fixed. Turing pattern selection and stability are also governed by the dynamic character of the amplitude equation, and the entire Turing instability region shifts to the right in the phase space with noise perturbation. Finally, numerical simulations validate the theoretical derivation that correlated noise can amplify Turing pattern formation to maintain distinct patterns.},

Through mathematical analysis, the conditions for the occurrence of the Turing pattern in the water–vegetation model are obtained. Meanwhile, using the multi-scale analysis method, the amplitude equation near the Turing bifurcation boundary is obtained. By analyzing the stability of the amplitude equation, the conditions for the appearance of Turing patterns such as stripes, hexagons, and mixtures of stripes and hexagons are determined.

  abstract     = {In order to inspect the interior of hollow organs or cavities in the human body, endoscopes are frequently employed in medicine. Over time, they have undergone substantial evolution and are now able to offer invaluable diagnostic data. The non-invasive identification of tissue abnormalities with subcellular resolution or real-time biochemical information is made possible by novel endoscopic optical diagnostic methods. These methods provide benefits in terms of detection, characterization, and confirmation while challenging conventional histology. An investigation is conducted on a magnetized ternary nanofluid to analyze its heat production characteristics in a heated flow scenario between two curved conduits that are peristaltic and experience sinusoidal fluctuations. In this study, the use of a new peristaltic endoscope inside a curved conduit is examined, with a specific focus on evaluating the flowing behavior and heat transference attributes. The use of a versatile and innovative endoscope equipped with peristaltic locomotion proves to be a superior approach for conducting endoscopic procedures on intricate mechanical systems. Furthermore, this advanced endoscope offers enhanced comfort for patients undertaking endoscopy of various human parts. A detailed mathematical model has been constructed to fully assess the flowing and heat transference study of this innovative endoscope using the main unsteady regulating formulas like impetus, Maxwell, and heat in their general form, then transformed to a non-dimensional system with the assumption of a low Reynold's number and wavelength. Mathematica software was used to conduct precise and methodical calculations, enabling the acquisition of both accurate mathematical results and graphical representations. According to certain findings, the conduit is more influenced by the magnetized force, and the pressure rate over the channel width changes from a linear relationship to a sharp curve that ends in a small peak. Additionally, when utilizing different kinds of nanoparticles, there is a noticeable increase in the pressure gradient's magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Recently, certain biological field experiments and research findings have revealed that predators not only reduce prey populations through direct predation (lethal effect) but also indirectly affect the growth rate of prey by inducing fear; these nonlethal effects can be carried over seasons or generations. In this paper, we proposed an autonomous and a nonautonomous Leslie–Gower model incorporating some biological factors such as fear and its carry-over effects, prey refuge, and nonlinear predator harvesting. In the autonomous model, first, we examined the well-posedness, positivity solutions, and their boundedness. Also, it is shown that new equilibrium points emerge and disappear with the change in intrinsic growth rate of predator. Further, we compute and analyzed the local and global stability at the interior equilibrium points. Furthermore, Hopf bifurcation and direction and stability of limit cycle at interior equilibrium points are established. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the biological parameters is carried out numerically with two statistical methods via Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficients. It was found that at the small values of fear factor, carry-over effect, and refuge behavior of prey parameters, the autonomous system exhibits oscillatory behavior, whereas for small values of prey birth rate and harvesting effort, the system remains stable. However, when intrinsic growth rate of predator increases from a low value to a higher value, the system shows transition from stability to instability and back to stability. We also explore the effects of seasonal variations in biological parameters in the nonautonomous model. Additionally, we investigate the theoretical existence of positive periodic solutions using the continuation theorem. The influences of seasonal variations in some parameters such as prey's birth rate, fear, and its carry-over effects; refuge behavior of prey; intrinsic growth rate of predator; and harvesting effort are then numerically investigated. The results reveal the emergence of positive periodic solutions and bursting patterns in the seasonally forced model.},

To establish the inversion theory, we meticulously examine the DDFH equation. We transform it into a system comprising both fractional- and integer-order elliptic equations, extending the conventional definition of the spectral fractional Laplace operator to accommodate non-homogeneous boundary conditions. Subsequently, we establish the well-posedness theory for scenarios involving both small and large wavenumbers. Our proof hinges upon the regularity attributes of select fractional elliptic equations and capitalizes fully on the structural peculiarities of the elliptic system, which distinguish it from classical cases. Thereafter, we focus on the inverse medium scattering problem pertinent to the DDFH equation, framed within the Bayesian statistical framework. We address two scenarios: one devoid of model reduction errors and another characterized by such errors—arising from the implementation of certain absorbing boundary conditions. More precisely, based on the properties of the forward operator, well-posedness of the posterior measures have been proved in both cases, which provide an opportunity to quantify the uncertainties of this problem.},

We study model (1.1) (see below) in several cases with respect to the regularity for the data: First, we assume data ( u 1 , v 1 ) ∈ ( L m 1 × L m 2 ) $$ \left({u}_1,{v}_1\right)\in \left({L}&amp;amp;#x0005E;{m_1}\times {L}&amp;amp;#x0005E;{m_2}\right) $$ . By using L m − L q $$ {L}&amp;amp;#x0005E;m-{L}&amp;amp;#x0005E;q $$ estimates of Sobolev solutions to related linear models with vanishing right-hand side, we explain the admissible range of exponents ( p 1 , p 2 ) $$ \left({p}_1,{p}_2\right) $$ in (1.1) which allow to prove the global (in time) existence of small data Sobolev solutions. Then we suppose that the data ( u 1 , v 1 ) $$ \left({u}_1,{v}_1\right) $$ belong to L m 1 ∩ H q s 1 × L m 2 ∩ H q s 2 $$ \left({L}&amp;amp;#x0005E;{m_1}\cap {H}_q&amp;amp;#x0005E;{s_1}\right)\times \left({L}&amp;amp;#x0005E;{m_2}\cap {H}_q&amp;amp;#x0005E;{s_2}\right) $$ , where now m k ∈ ( 1 , q ) $$ {m}_k\in \left(1,q\right) $$ , q ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) $$ q\in \left(1,\infty \right) $$ .

  abstract     = {In this paper, we have formulated and analyzed a mathematical model with multiple time delays of the genetic regulatory network of the microRNA-17-92 (miR-17-92) cluster. We have focused on the effect of the associated transcriptional and translational time delays of both positive and negative feedback loops on the miR-17-92 regulatory network. To gain better insight, we have explored the role of individual time delay in controlling the transition of the G1/S cell cycle process. We pay particular attention to the concentration of E2F and Myc, which trigger the protein ON and OFF switches. To analyze the situation mathematically, we employ delay-dependent stability analysis and bifurcation analysis using delay differential equations and a biological study of the time-delayed random transitions between the ON and OFF states for protein synthesis. Based on our study, we can conclude that the translational time delay ( τ 2 ) $$ \left({\tau}_2\right) $$ can halt the healthy transition of cells in the G1/S cell cycle phase as the small increase in ( τ 2 ) $$ \left({\tau}_2\right) $$ can destroy bistability of the system. Simulations are carried out to numerically show the solution trajectories under the combined effect of delays. Finally, we summarize the simulation results and the impact of delays on the dual behavior of miR-17-92 as it can act as an oncogene or as a tumor suppressor gene.},

Then we discuss the steady-state bifurcation and the direction to Hopf bifurcation of the PDE model by the local bifurcation theorem and center manifold theory. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to supplement the analytic results in one dimension which indicates that changes in prey refuge and diffusion coefficient can increase the complexity of the system.},

  abstract     = {We introduce models for viscoelastic materials, both solids and fluids, based on logarithmic stresses to capture the elastic contribution to the material response. The matrix logarithm allows to link the measures of strain, that naturally belong to a multiplicative group of linear transformations, to stresses, that are additive elements of a linear space of tensors. As regards the viscous stresses, we simply assume a Newtonian constitutive law, but the presence of elasticity and plastic relaxation makes the materials non-Newtonian. Our aim is to discuss the existence of weak solutions for the corresponding systems of partial differential equations in the nonlinear large-deformation regime. The main difficulties arise in the analysis of the transport equations necessary to describe the evolution of tensorial measures of strain. For the solid model, we only need to consider the equation for the left Cauchy–Green tensor, while for the fluid model, we add an evolution equation for the elastically-relaxed strain. Due to the tensorial nature of the fields, available techniques cannot be applied to the analysis of such transport equations. To cope with this, we introduce the notion of charted weak solution, based on non-standard a priori estimates, that lead to a global-in-time existence of solutions for the viscoelastic models in the natural functional setting associated with the energy inequality.},

The insurer sells insurance contracts, has access to proportional reinsurance business, and invests in a financial market consisting of three assets: one risk-free asset, one bond, and one stock. Here, the nominal interest rate is characterized by the Vasicek model, and the stock price is driven by Heston's stochastic volatility model. Applying the enlargement of filtration techniques, we establish the optimal control problem in which an insurer maximizes the expected power utility of the terminal wealth. By using the dynamic programming principle, the problem can be changed to four-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. In addition, we adopt a deep neural network method by which the partial differential equation is converted to two backward stochastic differential equations and solved by a stochastic gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical results obtained using TensorFlow in Python and the economic behavior of the approximate optimal strategy and the approximate optimal utility of the insurer are analyzed.},

Also, the idea is extended to a class of fractional order Volterra integro-differential equation with a weakly singular kernel. For this purpose, two numerical schemes are established by utilizing the concept of the API method, and L1 and L1-2 formulae. We applied L1 and L1-2 discretization to approximate the Caputo non-integer derivative. At the same time, Taylor's series expansion of an unknown function is taken into consideration when approximating the Volterra part in the considered mathematical model using the API method. Combination of API method with L1 and L1-2 formula provided the order of convergence ( 2 − ν ) $$ \left(2-\nu \right) $$ and ( 3 − ν ) $$ \left(3-\nu \right) $$ for Scheme-I and Scheme-II, respectively. The derived techniques reduced the proposed model to a set of algebraic equations that can be resolved using well-known numerical algorithms. Furthermore, the unconditional stability, convergence, and numerical stability of the formulated schemes have been rigorously investigated. Finally, we conducted some numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings and guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of the recommended schemes. The comparison between the numerical outcomes obtained by proposed schemes and existing numerical techniques has also been provided through tables and graphs.},

Under the assumption that the initial perturbation is small and decays spatially, we establish the global existence and the pointwise behavior of strong solutions to this nonconserved system. To deal with the source terms involving the phase variable, we employ the Green's function and space-time weighted estimates. The analysis shows that the phase variable mainly contains the diffusion wave with exponential decaying amplitude over time, and consequently the density and momentum of the compressible fluid adhere to a generalized Huygens principle.},

  abstract     = {The interference of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) within various steps of the life cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in a high cure rate for chronic HCV infection. To accurately quantify the effect of DAAs on treatment and to achieve an optimal drug combination for treatment, we formulate an age-structured multiscale HCV model. This model incorporates intracellular virus RNA replication process corresponding to the mechanism of drug action, two modes of extracellular virus transmission (virus-to-cell infection and cell-to-cell infection), and antibody immune response. We prove that the threshold dynamics of the pre-treatment model is completely determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ and the antibody immune reproduction number R W $$ {\mathcal{R}}_W $$ . Under reasonable assumptions, we obtain long-term and short-term approximations for post-treatment viral loads and identify which approximation performs better under various scenarios. Numerical simulations show that the infection mode of cells mainly affects the reduction of viral load in the third stage, while the antibody immune response is mainly manifested in the clearance of viral particles in the first stage of viral load decrease. With effective treatments, blocking cell-to-cell infection and enhancing the antibody immune response can effectively reduce the viral load in a short time period achieving the eradication of infection. Our findings suggest that the HCV infection is highly dynamic post-DAAs treatment, and early monitoring of viral load decline contributes to the implementation of subsequent treatment regimens.},

A new continuous necessary condition is investigated for the final state value so that it will convert the final costate value into a non-zero value. The research analyzes the seven-stage royalty piecewise function, which is then approximated to continuous form with the help of the hyperbolic tangent function and solves the problem by using a new modified shooting method. This modified shooting method applies Sufahani–Ahmad–Newton–Brent–Royalty Algorithm and Sufahani-Ahmad-Powell-Brent-Royalty Algorithm. For a validation process, the results are compared with the existing methods such as Euler, Runge–Kutta, Trapezoidal, and Hermite–Simpson approximations, and the results show that the proposed method yields an accurate terminal state value.},

As a second primary unknown for the system, we choose the gas pseudo-pressure, a persistent variable which coincides with the gas pressure in the two-phase regions while it does not have physical meaning in one-phase flow regions, when only the liquid phase is present. This allows us to introduce an another persistent variable that is an artificial variable in one-phase flow regions and a physical variable in two-phase flow regions—the capillary pseudopressure. We rewrite the system's equations in a fully equivalent form in terms of the global pressure and the gas-pseudo pressure. In order to prove the existence of weak solutions of obtained system, we also use the capillary pseudo-pressure. By using it, we can decouple obtained equations on the discrete level.

In the empirical part, we select the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (HIBOR) data from the real financial market to estimate the parameters of the uncertain differential equation that governs floating interest rates and test the hypothesis. It is worth noting that through rigorous hypothesis testing, we verify the applicability of the equation.

Extending Baliga and Maskin, we consider a model of N $$ N $$ homogeneous agents with quasi-linear utilities of the form u j ⁡ ( r j ; r ) = r α − r j $$ {u}_j\left({r}_j;r\right)&amp;amp;#x0003D;{r}&amp;amp;#x0005E;{\alpha }-{r}_j $$ , where r $$ r $$ is the aggregate contribution and the exponent α $$ \alpha $$ is the elasticity of the gross utility. When the value of the elasticity α $$ \alpha $$ increases in its natural range ( 0,1 ) $$ \left(0,1\right) $$ , we prove the following five main results in the formation of stable coalitions: (i) the gap of cooperation, characterized as the ratio of the welfare of the grand coalition to the welfare of the competitive singleton coalition grows to infinity, which we interpret as a measure of the urge or need to save the public good; (ii) the size of stable coalitions increases from 1 up to ; (iii) the ratio of the welfare of stable coalitions to the welfare of the competitive singleton coalition grows to infinity; (iv) the ratio of the welfare of stable coalitions to the welfare of the grand coalition “decreases” (a lot), up to when the number of members of the stable coalition is approximately and after that it “increases” (a lot); and (v) the growth of stable coalitions occurs with a much greater loss of the coalition members when compared with free-riders. Result (v) has two major drawbacks: (a) A priori , it is difficult to “convince” agents to be members of the stable coalition and (b) together with results (i) and (iv), it explains and leads to the “pessimistic” Barrett's paradox of cooperation, even in a case not much considered in the literature: The ratio of the welfare of the stable coalitions against the welfare of the grand coalition is small, even in the extreme case where there are few (or a single) free-riders and the gap of cooperation is large. “Optimistically,” result (iii) shows that stable coalitions do much better than the competitive singleton coalition. Furthermore, result (ii) proves that the paradox of cooperation is resolved for larger values of so that the grand coalition is stabilized.},

The model is a system of two differential equations with weak nonlinearity. A new solving procedure based on D′Alembert's method and the method of time-variable amplitude and phase is developed. The main advantage of the method in comparison to others is that it gives the solution of the system of two coupled weak nonlinear equations in the form that is simple to analyze, as it has the same form as the solution of the corresponding system of linear equations. In the paper two types of systems are considered: one, a two-mass system with two degrees of freedom, and second, the one-mass system with two degrees of freedom. The torsional vibrations of a two-mass system and vibrations of a Jeffcott rotor with two-degrees-of-freedom are analyzed. Analytically obtained results are numerically tested. It is obtained that the difference between analytic and numeric results is small and almost negligible. As the accuracy of the analytic solution is high, it is suitable for application in technics and engineering. Conclusions about steady-state self-sustainable oscillators, orbital, and limit cycle motions are given.},

The endemic equilibrium exists uniquely if , whereas the disease-free equilibrium is observed to be globally stable if . The numerical simulations are demonstrated by extracting the daily reported COVID-19 cases for the second wave in Italy. The age-dependent contact matrix for the Republic of Italy (data sourced from the POLYMOD study) is computed via paper–diary methodology (PDM) grounded on a population-prospective survey in European countries. Our numerical findings imply that (i) for the age group (20–49) years and (50–69) years, the number of infected persons is quite double as compared with the exposed cases; (ii) approximately 50% of positive cases lies in (20–69) years age group; (iii) for the (00–19) years age group, only half of the exposed individuals got infected; and (iv) a consistent graph is detected for the age group of (70–99) years in both cases; it shows that almost all the exposed got infected.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of this study is to develop a new constitutive model by combining a fractional-order Kelvin–Voigt model with an Abel dashpot element in parallel. Subsequently, this new model will be incorporated into the Euler–Bernoulli beam's governing equation, utilizing shifted Legendre polynomials as basis functions, a classical orthogonal polynomial system, to solve the fractional-order partial differential equations. By comparing the numerical solutions with the analytical solutions, we aim to evaluate the applicability of shifted Legendre polynomials in solving such problems and the accuracy of the obtained numerical solutions. Furthermore, we will investigate the performance of viscoelastic HDPE beams under different loading conditions and conduct a comparative analysis of the displacements of HDPE beams under the new constitutive model and the traditional fractional-order Kelvin–Voigt model. Through this research, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of fractional-order phenomena and provide more accurate and efficient numerical simulation and analysis methods for the field of structural mechanics, promoting the development of related engineering applications.},

Conditions are established on the parameters to ensure the global stability of the equilibrium solution in the case of constant stocking, as well as the global stability of the 2-periodic solution in the case of 2-periodic stocking. Our approach extensively relies on the utilization of the embedding technique. Whether constant stocking or periodic stocking, the model has the potential to undergo a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation in both cases. However, the Neimark–Sacker bifurcation in the 2-periodic case results in the emergence of two invariant curves that collectively function as a single attractor. Finally, we pose open questions in the form of conjectures about global stability for certain choices of the parameters.},

  abstract     = {The impact of predator-driven fear on ecosystems is significant and can encompass both trophic (direct) and nontrophic (indirect) effects. Previous studies have shown that nontrophic fear effects have an important role in predator–prey dynamics. This study investigates the nontrophic fear effect on prey caused by generalist predators and explores optimal harvesting. We assume that the reproduction rate of prey is reduced due to the fear effect, and generalist predator follows Holling type II foraging strategy for predation. Additionally, we assume that predators are commercially valuable and harvested proportionately to their density. We demonstrate the existence of equilibrium points, their local and global stability, and bifurcation analysis. We observe that the model system undergoes a sequence of codimension one and codimension two bifurcations. Our results show that in the absence of predator harvesting, increasing levels of fear destabilize the predator–prey system, and controlled harvesting is beneficial for the coexistence of both populations. Also, the harvesting of predators may produce hydra and multiple hydra effects. We identify different types of bistability phenomena, which emphasize the importance of initial population size. Further, an optimal harvesting policy is also explored by formulating an optimal control problem (OCP). The harvesting cost-functional is designed by incorporating the bionomic equilibrium state. We use Pontryagin's maximum principle and solve the OCP numerically. It is observed that implementing optimal harvesting not only contributes to the ecological benefits by maintaining a sustainable balance of predator–prey evolution but also plays a significant role in maximizing the economic benefits.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we obtained optical soliton solutions of the perturbed nonlinear Schrödinger–Hirota equation with generalized anti-cubic law nonlinearity in the presence of spatio-temporal dispersion. This equation models the propagation of optical pulses in fiber optic cables. Due to the anti-cubic nonlinearity, perturbation, and spatio-temporal dispersion present in the model, it provides more accurate results for high-speed and long-distance transmissions. Given the significant developments in the field of optics, studies on complex equations such as this model are of great importance. With the increase in real-life applications, obtaining solutions to optical equations has become crucial. In this study, we used the improved F-expansion method to derive the optical soliton solutions for the relevant model. This technique allows for obtaining various solutions through the Jacobi elliptic auxiliary functions it employs. The obtained solutions consist of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. As a result of the application, 10 solutions were obtained, and 2D and 3D graphics of these solutions are included. These graphs illustrate the motion directions of optical solitons and the effect of the nonlinearity parameter and spatio-temporal dispersion parameter on soliton behavior. No restrictions were encountered during the study. Finally, the originality of the study lies in the first application of this technique to the relevant model and in examining the effect of the parameters and on this model.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of determining the initial value of the distributed-order time-fractional diffusion equation from the final time observation data, which arises in some ultra-slow diffusion phenomena in applied areas. Since the problem is ill-posed, we propose an iterated regularization method based on the Nesterov acceleration strategy to deal with it. Convergence rates for the regularized approximation solution are given under both the a priori and a posteriori regularization parameter choice rules. It is shown that the proposed method can always yield the order optimal convergence rates as long as the iteration parameter which appears in the Nesterov acceleration strategy is chosen large enough. In numerical aspect, the main advantage of the proposed method lies in its simplicity. Specifically, due to the Nesterov acceleration strategy, only a few number of iteration steps are required to obtain the approximation solution, and at each iteration step, we only need to numerically solve the standard initial-boundary value problem for the distributed-order time-fractional diffusion equation. Some numerical examples including one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

There has been limited research on the geometric interpretation of fractional calculus. The present study applied the Caputo fractional calculation method, which has the most suitable structure for geometric computations, to examine the effect of fractional calculus on differential geometry. The Caputo fractional derivative of a constant is zero, enabling the geometric solution and understanding of many fractional physical problems. We examined flux tubes, which are magnetic surfaces that incorporate these lines of magnetic fields as parameter curves. Examples are visualized using mathematical programs for various values of Caputo fractional analysis, employing theory-related examples. Fractional derivatives and integrals are widely utilized in various disciplines, including mathematics, physics, engineering, biology, and fluid dynamics, as they yield more numerical results than classical solutions. Also, many problems outside the scope of classical analysis methods can be solved using the Caputo fractional calculation approach. In this context, applying the Caputo fractional analytic calculation method in differential geometry yields physically and mathematically relevant findings, particularly in the theory of curves and surfaces.},

Secondly, a new distributed switching control protocol, which can inhibit the external unbounded disturbances, is piecewise designed to drive the states of agents to the sliding mode surface via the predefined-time set by users. Subsequently, under the designed event-triggered controller (ETC), the states of agents achieve consensus in predefined time on the sliding mode surface. Meanwhile, with the help of log barrier function, the consensus states of agents reach the feasible region and converge to the optimal solution in predefined time.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the existence of multiplicity of positive solutions to a new generalized Riemann–Liouville type fractional Fisher-like equation on a semi-infinite interval equipped with nonlocal multipoint boundary conditions involving Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative and integral operators. The existence of at least two positive solutions for the given problem is established by using the concept of complete continuity and iterative positive solutions. We show the existence of at least three positive solutions to the problem at hand by applying the generalized Leggett–Williams fixed-point theorem due to Bai and Ge [Z. Bai, B. Ge, Existence of three positive solutions for some second-order boundary value problems, Comput. Math. Appl. 48 (2014) 699-70]. Illustrative examples are constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the main results. It has also been indicated in Section 5 that some new results appear as special cases by choosing the parameters involved in the given problem appropriately.},

The global convergence is established under standard Wolfe line search and common assumptions. Then, combining the hyperplane projection technique and a new self-adaptive line search, we extend the proposed conjugate gradient method and obtain an improved Dai-Liao-style hybrid conjugate gradient projection method to solve constrained nonlinear monotone equations. Under mild conditions, we obtain its global convergence without Lipschitz continuity. In addition, the convergence rates for the two proposed methods are analyzed, respectively.

We offer a unique coupled system of fractional delay differential equations with proper respect for the role that multi-term operators play in the research of fractional differential equations, taking into account the newly established solution for fractional integral and derivative. We also made the assumptions that connected integral boundary conditions would be added on top of -fractional differential derivatives. The requirements for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are also developed using fixed-point theorems. While analyzing various sorts of Ulam's stability results, the qualitative elements of the underlying model will also be examined.

To effectively manage endpoint singularities, we propose an advanced space-time Galerkin technique and a collocation spectral method, both employing generalized Bernstein-like basis functions (GBFs). The properties and behaviors of these functions are examined, highlighting their practical applications. The space-time spectral methods incorporate GBFs in the temporal domain and classical Bernstein polynomials in the spatial domain. Fractional equations frequently produce irregular solutions despite smooth input data due to their singular kernel. To address this, GBFs are applied to the time derivative and classical Bernstein polynomials to the spatial derivative. A thorough error analysis confirms the technique's accuracy and convergence, offering a robust theoretical basis. Numerical experiments validate the method, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving both linear and nonlinear time-fractional advection–diffusion equations.},

Through a formula for the basic reproduction number, we explore the local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE), showing that the existence of the EE relies on the basic reproduction number. Furthermore, we establish the global stability of the DFE by constructing a Lyapunov function.

We deal with the dilemma of statistical accuracy versus computational scalability, which are in a notorious trade-off. Apparently, models with full support ensure maximal information but are computationally expensive, while compactly supported models achieve computational scalability at the expense of loss of information. Hence, an inspection of whether these models might be compatible is necessary. The criterion we use for such an inspection is based on equivalence of Gaussian measures. We provide sufficient conditions for space-time compatibility. As a corollary, we deduce implications in terms of maximum likelihood estimation and misspecified kriging prediction under fixed domain asymptotics. Some results of independent interest relate about the space-time spectrum associated with the classes of kernels proposed in the paper.},

This is a covariance structure which has an outer block compound symmetric structure, where the diagonal blocks are themselves block circular matrices, while the off-diagonal blocks are formed by all equal matrices. The NBCCS null hypothesis is decomposed into sub-hypotheses, allowing this way for a simpler way to obtain a likelihood ratio test and its associated statistic. The exact moments of this statistic are derived, and its distribution is carefully examined. Given the complicated nature of this distribution, highly precise near-exact distributions were developed. Numerical studies are conducted to assess the proximity between these near-exact distributions and the exact distribution, highlighting the performance of these approximations, even in the case of very small sample sizes. Furthermore, three datasets, on bone mineral content, metabolic rates of glucose, and soil moisture are used to exemplify the practical application of the methodology derived in this study.},

We proved that the positive constant equilibrium solution is globally asymptotically stable for the system without time delays. By virtue of the sum of time delays as the bifurcation parameter, spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation at the positive constant equilibrium solution are proved to occur when the delay varied through a sequence of critical values. In addition, we consider the effect of cross-diffusion on the system in the case that without time delays. By taking cross diffusion coefficients as the bifurcation parameter, our model undergoes inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation around a positive constant equilibrium solution when the bifurcation parameter is varied through a sequence of critical values. A common feature in the most existing research work is that the bifurcation factor that induces Hopf bifurcation appears in the reaction terms (such as time delay) rather than diffusion terms. Our results demonstrate that the inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation can be triggered by the effect of cross diffusion factors.},

In particular, a special kind of soliton solution, the Gaussian soliton, is constructed, which is rarely identified in non-logarithmic equation. Next, the solitons stability and modulation instability (MI) of PC-NLSE with two types of nonlinearity are discussed. Finally, by adding perturbed terms to the dynamic systems, we obtain the largest Lyapunov exponents and the phase diagrams of the equation, which proves there are the chaotic behaviors in PC-NLSE.

Second, the Melnikov method is used to obtain the conditions for the system to enter chaos in the Smale horseshoe sense, and the Melnikov curve is drawn for further verification. Then, bifurcation diagrams are drawn for the changes in various parameters in the system, with a focus on analyzing the influence of friction factors on chaotic bifurcation. By applying the definition and calculation principle of the maximum Lyapunov exponent, and drawing and utilizing the maximum Lyapunov exponent graph, the chaotic state that the system enters under different parameters is more clearly defined. Finally, the evolution law of the safety basin under various parameter changes, especially dry friction changes, is analyzed, and the erosion and bifurcation mechanism of the safety basin is studied. Comparing with the bifurcation diagram, it reveals that chaos primarily contributes to the erosion of the safety basin.},

It introduces a novel extension of the Hermite-Hadamard inequality and derives numerous fractal inequalities through a novel multiparameterized identity. The primary aim is to generalize existing inequalities, highlighting that previously established results can be obtained by setting specific parameters within the main inequalities. The validity of the derived results is demonstrated through an illustrative example, accompanied by 2D and 3D graphical representations. Lastly, the paper discusses potential practical applications of these findings.},

  abstract     = {We employ the theory of asymptotic homogenization (AH) to study the elasto-plastic behavior of a composite medium comprising two solid phases, separated by a sharp interface and characterized by mechanical properties, such as elastic coefficients and “initial yield stresses” (i.e., a threshold stress above which remodeling is triggered), that may differ up to several orders of magnitude. We speak of “plastic” behavior because we have in mind a material behavior that, to a certain extent, resembles plasticity, although, for biological systems, it embraces a much wider class of inelastic phenomena. In particular, we are interested in studying the influence of gradient effects in the remodeling variable on the homogenized mechanical properties of the composite. The jump of the mechanical properties from one phase to the other makes the composite highly heterogeneous and calls for the determination of effective properties , that is, properties that are associated with a homogenized “version” of the original composite, and that are obtained through a suitable averaging procedure. The determination of the effective properties results convenient, in particular, when it comes to the multiscale description of inelastic processes, such as remodeling in soft or hard tissues, like bones. To accomplish this task with the aid of AH, we assume that the length scale over which the heterogeneities manifest themselves is several orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic length scale of the composite as a whole. We identify both a fine-scale problem and a coarse-scale problem, each of which characterizes the elasto-plastic dynamics of the composite at the corresponding scale, and we discuss how they are reciprocally coupled through a transfer of information from one scale to the other. In particular, we highlight how the coarse-scale plastic distortions influence the fine-scale problem. Moreover, in the limit of negligible hysteresis effects, we individuate two viscoplastic effective coefficients that encode the information of the two-scale nature of the composite medium in the upscaled equations. Finally, to deal with a case study tractable semi-analytically, we consider a multilayered composite material with an initial yield stress that is constant in each phase. Such investigation is meant to contribute to the constitution of a robust framework for devising the effective properties of hierarchical biological media.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on an efficient and highly accurate approximate solver for a class of generalized singular boundary value problems (SBVPs) having nonlinearity and with two-term fractional derivatives. The involved fractional derivative operators are given in the form of Liouville–Caputo. The developed algorithm for solving the generalized SBVPs consists of two main stages. The first stage is devoted to an iterative quasilinearization method (QLM) to conquer the (strong) nonlinearity of the governing SBVPs. Secondly, we employ the generalized Genocchi polynomials (GGPs) to treat the resulting sequence of linearized SBVPs numerically. An upper error estimate for the Genocchi series solution in the norm is obtained via a rigorous error analysis. The main benefit of the presented QLM-GGPs procedure is that the required number of iteration in the first stage is within a few steps, and an accurate polynomial solution is obtained through computer implementations in the second stage. Three widely applicable test cases are investigated to observe the efficacy as well as the high-order accuracy of the QLM-GGPs algorithm. The comparable accuracy and robustness of the presented algorithm are validated by doing comparisons with the results of some well-established available computational methods. It is apparently shown that the QLM-GGPs algorithm provides a promising tool to solve strongly nonlinear SBVPs with two-term fractional derivatives accurately and efficiently.},

Since the proposed model is equivalent to a Filippov system, its mathematical analysis leads to a local study of the equilibria in each vector field corresponding to the proposed model, in addition to the study of the stability of its pseudo-equilibria located on the curve separating the two vector fields. In particular, the model could have between one and three pseudo-equilibria and at least one limit cycle surrounding one or two inner equilibria, locally unstable points.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a model of chemostat with two cross-feeding species and involving two inhibitions. The excess of hydrogen inhibits the growth of acetogenic bacteria which, in turn, inhibit the growth of methanogenic hydrogenotrophic bacteria. The model is described by a system of four ordinary differential equations. We established the conditions of existence and stability of equilibria with respect to the operating parameters which are the dilution rate and the input substrate concentrations of the species of the model, then we illustrate the operating and bifurcation diagrams. This technique makes it easy to interpret different regions of operating diagrams. Inhibitions let some regions of stability rise and others vanish.},

  abstract     = {Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global health problem and may be controlled via appropriate treatment. We use fractional models to understand infectious diseases because fractional models help us understand treatments' effects on hepatitis B better than integer-order models. In this article, we introduce a new mathematical model for HBV based on the fractal–fractional derivative with a generalized Mittag–Leffler kernel. Firstly, we discuss the fundamental properties, like the equilibria of the model and the primary reproduction number. Then, we investigate the existence of a unique solution to our model. We use an iterative method to solve the proposed model. Further, we discuss the stability of the model through stability theory. Finally, we offer some graphical illustrations for various values of the parameters.},

Guided by this idea, in order to achieve the goal of each node following asymptotically its own reference target in a CDN, this paper investigates the model following adaptive control (MFAC) problem of NS via the dynamics of links, which implies that the LS plays the important dynamic auxiliary role in the MFAC realization of nodes. Meanwhile, we focus on the condition that the links state information is unavailable, due to sensor practical application and measurement cost constraints. To obviate this restriction, we construct the asymptotical state observer for the LS. Next, to achieve the control goal of this paper, an appropriate Lyapunov candidate function is selected, by which the MFAC scheme for NS is synthesized based on the state observer of LS. Finally, the simulation example is performed to demonstrate the theoretical results in this paper.},

The choice of an appropriate basis function plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of the solution. In this study, our aim is to develop algorithms that can identify an optimal basis function for any given differential equation. To achieve this, we explore fractional rational Jacobi functions as a versatile basis, incorporating hyperparameters related to rational mappings, Jacobi polynomial parameters, and fractional components. Our research develops hyperparameter optimization algorithms, including parallel grid search, parallel random search, Bayesian optimization, and parallel genetic algorithms. To evaluate the impact of each hyperparameter on the accuracy of the solution, we analyze two benchmark problems on a semi-infinite domain: Volterra's population model and Kidder's equation. We achieve improved convergence and accuracy by judiciously constraining the ranges of the hyperparameters through a combination of random search and genetic algorithms. Notably, our findings demonstrate that the genetic algorithm consistently outperforms other approaches, yielding superior hyperparameter values that significantly enhance the quality of the solution, surpassing state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {The paper aims to apply the trigintaduonion spaces to explore the physical properties of four interactions simultaneously, including the electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, weak nuclear fields, and strong nuclear fields. J. C. Maxwell first applied the algebra of quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. It inspired some subsequent scholars to introduce the quaternions, octonions, sedenions, and trigintaduonions to research the electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, weak nuclear fields, strong nuclear fields, quantum mechanics, gauge fields, and curved spaces and so forth. The algebra of trigintaduonions is able to discuss the physical quantities of four interactions, including the field potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque, and force. In the field theories described with the algebra of trigintaduonions, the weak nuclear field is composed of three types of fundamental fields. These three fundamental fields, related to weak nuclear fields, can describe the physical properties of weak nuclear fields collectively. This is consistent with the conclusion of the electroweak theory. Meanwhile the strong nuclear field consists of three types of fundamental fields. These three fundamental fields relevant to strong nuclear fields may investigate the physical properties of strong nuclear fields mutually. It is coincident with the deduction of quark theory. According to the properties of trigintaduonions, one can deduce the Yang-Mills equation related to the gauge fields. It means that the electromagnetic field occupies a quaternion space. The gravitational field owns one different quaternion space. The weak nuclear fields occupy three mutually independent quaternion spaces. The properties of weak nuclear fields are different from those of electromagnetic fields or gravitational fields. According to the multiplication table of trigintaduonion spaces, the strong nuclear fields own three conjugate quaternion spaces independent of each other. These explorations further deepen the understanding of the physical properties of weak and strong nuclear fields.},

Three main features of the problem bring essential difficulties when proving the existence of weak solutions. The first one is the nonlocal term which makes the structure of the corresponding energy functional more complicated, the second one is that the problem is critical in the sense that the energy functional lacks compactness, and the third one is the appearance of the logarithmic term which satisfies neither the standard monotonicity condition nor the Ambrosetti–Rabinowitz condition. Moreover, the boundedness of the sequence is hard to obtain for Kirchhoff problems in dimension 4. By combining a result by Jeanjean (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 1999, 129: 787–809) and a recent estimate by Deng et al. (Adv. Nonlinear Stud., 2023, 23: No. 20220049) with the mountain pass lemma and Brézis-Lieb's lemma, it is proved that either the norm of the sequence of approximation solution goes to infinity or the problem admits a nontrivial weak solution, under appropriate assumptions on the parameters.},

It is proved by using the argument principle that the characteristic equation has a pair of conjugated simple complex roots with a negative real part on the principal Riemann surface under the assumption that α $$ \alpha $$ and β $$ \beta $$ are not both integers. Then three fundamental solutions, the unit impulse response, the unit initial displacement response, and the unit initial rate response, are derived analytically. Each of these solutions is expressed into a superposition of a classical damped oscillation decaying exponentially and a real Laplace integration decaying in a negative power law. Finally, the asymptotic behaviors of these analytical solutions for sufficiently large are determined as monotonous decays in a power of negative exponent.},

A new method based on the system solutions was proposed to analyze passivity. It is important to note that this paper focuses solely on introducing the proposed method and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of NTCGNNs. This method does not require for the construction of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) or model transformation, thus reducing computational effort and complexity. By using this new way and the inequality technique, a passivity criterion for NTCGNNs with multiple time-varying delays is derived. The applicability of the derived criterion was demonstrated through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {The impact of Hall current on the multiphase thermal transfer of an incompressible electrically conductive Jeffrey flow over an infinitely vertical plate when heat absorption and chemical reaction are present has been examined. Partial differential equations have been used to describe the process, accounting for heat and mass transfer effects. This study uses extended Fourier's and Fick's laws together with the recently announced constant proportional Caputo (CPC) fractional operator. The fractional model is converted into a nondimensional form by applying some appropriate quantities. The nondimensional produced fractional model for momentum, heat, and diffusion equations based on the CPC fractional operator has been calculated semi-analytically by applying the Laplace method. The Mathcad 15 software to sketch the graphs for several factors, like the Grashof number, mass Grashof number, Schmidt number, Prandtl number, Hall, and magnetic field parameters, is used to describe the velocity profile. Additionally, a graphical explanation is provided for the influence of the appeared parameters, particularly the effect of the fractional parameters. It is concluded that the result of the fluid model developed by the generalized constitutive relations is more accurate and generalized than the results of the artificially contracted fractional model. A fractional derivative is therefore the ideal option to achieve controlled concentration, temperature, and velocity. The current study is immediately relevant to geophysical, cosmically fluid dynamics, medical, biological, and any other processes that are significantly enhanced by a low gas density and a high magnetic field.},

The simulation results are in consistent with theoretical predictions, indicating that the randomness effect decreases with increasing k and N and is small when k ( k = 8) and N ( N = 200) are relatively large; the randomness effect is more significant in the scale free (SF) network than in the small world (SW) network, and the disease spread faster in the SF network; shared nodes can weakly increase the disease spread, but when the shared nodes are involved in an infected and an uninfected network, it can induce the disease outbreak in the uninfected network.},

  abstract     = {The construction of (hierarchical) curl-conforming basis functions has been a hot topic in the last decades in the finite element community. Especially, functions applied to simplices have been quite popular after the work by Nédélec in 1980. Many mixed-order and full-order families have been provided in the last years, but sometimes, it is difficult to assess if they belong to the original space proposed by Nédélec (especially when orthogonalization procedures are applied). Here, a tool to determine if a family of basis functions belongs to the Nédélec space is provided. Since affine coordinates are the most frequent choice for simplices, particularities about its use with this kind of coordinates are detailed. A detailed survey of existing families is provided, and the practical application of the tool to a representative set of these families is discussed. The tool is also available for the community in a public repository.},

A previous L ie symmetry analysis revealed a particular case which was conjectured to be integrable. Namely, a Lie –Bäcklund symmetry exists, thus highlighting another associated dynamical system. Here, we investigate these two equations using the gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Moreover, we construct their infinite hierarchy of conservation laws analytically, using three compatible P oisson structures to prove the complete integrability of both dynamical systems. We investigate these two equations using the so-called gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Based on this scheme, applied to the equation under consideration, we have analytically constructed its infinite hierarchy of conservation laws, derived two compatible P oisson structures, and proved its complete integrability.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to explore a Schrödinger equation that incorporates a higher-order operator. Traditional models for electron dynamics have utilized a second-order diffusion Schrödinger equation, where oscillatory behavior is achieved through complex domain formulations. Incorporating a higher-order operator enables the induction of oscillatory spatial patterns in solutions. Our analysis initiates with a variational formulation within generalized spaces, facilitating the examination of solution boundedness. Subsequently, we delve into the oscillatory characteristics of solutions, drawing upon a series of lemmas originally applied to the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, the Cahn–Hilliard equation, and other equations that employ higher-order operators. Specific solution types, such as standing waves, are numerically investigated to illustrate the oscillatory spatial patterns. The discussion then extends to the theory of traveling waves to establish general conditions for positive solutions. A contribution of this work is the precise evaluation of a critical traveling wave speed, denoted as , above which the first minimum remains positive. For values of the traveling wave speed significantly greater than , the solutions can be entirely positive.},

This study proposes a new approach to counter-terrorism through compartmental mathematical modeling on underlying principles of terrorism, such as recruiting new terrorists, military interventions, limitations in military interventions, desertion from the group, and influence time. We introduce the influence time in the present terrorism model to include the time it takes for a person to become a member of a terrorist group when effectively attracted. A system of delay differential equations is proposed to model terrorism dynamics. The model results are analyzed and investigated through qualitative analysis for two obtained equilibria, namely, a terrorism-free equilibrium and terrorism-persistent equilibrium. Finally, some numerical results support our analytical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed counter-terrorism mathematical modeling approach. This study enhances the theoretical understanding of policymakers on terrorism mitigation and offers valuable insights into developing effective counter-terrorism strategies.},

  abstract     = {Monkeypox infection is a serious illness to human health, and its outbreak has been reported in many non-endemic regions. Various approaches have been implemented to explore the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and effective control of monkeypox. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of a mathematical modeling approach to study the dynamics of monkeypox infection with a case study of the United States, the most impacted country in 2022. The proposed mathematical model is initially constructed using a nonlinear system of differential equations with constant control measures. The human population is divided into four subgroups while the animal (non-human) population is divided into three subclasses. An extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed monkeypox model is presented including the stability of equilibria. Further, to make the present study more visible to the literature, a real data set of the cumulative confirmed cases of monkeypox in the United States from May to October 2022 is used to estimate the proposed model parameters. Some of the demographic parameters are estimated from the population of the United States. The most important biological parameter of the problem is investigated theoretically as well as numerically based on the reported cases. The impact of various model parameters on the dynamics of state variables and is shown graphically. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of various model parameters on the basic reproduction number to explore the most influential intervention strategy to curb the infection. The most crucial components of the proposed system are identified and health officials are advised. Finally, using optimization theory, the most effective optimized preventive strategies are suggested to curtail the infection in a community. We believe that the present investigation will be helpful in understanding the dynamics and prevention of monkeypox infection.},
