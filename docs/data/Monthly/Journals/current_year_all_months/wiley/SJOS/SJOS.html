  abstract     = {We are interested in the relationship between the large values of a real random variable and its associated multidimensional covariate, in the context where the conditional distribution is heavy-tailed. Estimating the positive conditional tail index of a heavy-tailed conditional distribution is a crucial step for statistical inference, but the task becomes increasingly challenging as the covariate dimension increases. In this work, we assume the existence of a lower-dimensional linear subspace such that the conditional tail index depends on the covariate only through its projection onto this subspace. We propose a method to estimate this dimension reduction subspace and establish its consistency. Additionally, we introduce an estimator of the conditional tail index that leverages this dimension reduction and prove its consistency. We illustrate the benefits of this dimension reduction approach for estimating the conditional tail index through simulations and an application to real-world data.},

However, existing Fréchet regression literature focuses on the classical setting where the predictor dimension is fixed, and the sample size goes to infinity. This paper proposes sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction with graphical structure among high-dimensional Euclidean predictors. In particular, we propose a convex optimization problem that leverages the graphical information among predictors and avoids inverting the high-dimensional covariance matrix. We also provide the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Theoretically, the proposed method achieves subspace estimation and variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis are carried out to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Equality-constrained models naturally arise in problems in which the measurements are taken at different levels of resolution. The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampler does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, for example, to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.},

The adjustment minimizes the Wasserstein distance to a null-approximating continuous distribution, tackling some fundamental challenges inherent in combining statistical significances derived from discrete distributions. The related theory justifies Lancaster's mid-p and mean-value chi-squared statistics for Fisher's combination as special cases. To counter the conservative nature of Lancaster's testing procedures, we propose an updated null-approximating distribution. It is achieved by further minimizing the Wasserstein distance to the adjusted statistics within an appropriate distribution family. Specifically, in the context of Fisher's combination, we propose an optimal gamma distribution as a substitute for the traditionally used chi-squared distribution. This new approach yields an asymptotically consistent test that significantly improves Type I error control and enhances statistical power.},

These designs exhibit attractive low-dimensional stratification properties and perform well in terms of column correlation. Additionally, the size of each design can be flexibly chosen based on the trade-off between the experimental budget and estimation accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design method exhibits significant superiority in terms of design metrics and estimation accuracy.

  abstract     = {Factor models are indispensable tools in economics and finance, providing valuable insights into the latent structures underlying complex datasets. Nevertheless, the prevalence of heavy-tailed macroeconomic and financial data, often characterized by extreme values and greater skewness than that found in a normal distribution, presents significant analytical challenges. This article introduces mode-adaptive factor models (MAFM) for robust factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data, inspired by the equivalence between conventional principal component analysis and the constrained least squares method in factor models. Unlike traditional factor models that concentrate on mean estimation, MAFM leverage the mode to capture central tendencies more effectively, particularly in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions. To facilitate MAFM for factor analysis, we develop an iterative mode regression algorithm that integrates the expectation-maximization procedure, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. We establish the theoretical properties of the MAFM estimators without imposing moment constraints on idiosyncratic errors and propose a mode information criterion for consistent factor number selection. We also suggest a data-dependent bandwidth selection procedure to enhance the flexibility of MAFM. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFM across diverse distributional settings. An empirical application to macroeconomic forecasting further highlights the practical advantages of MAFM, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in real-world analyses.},

Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR( p ) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH( p ) to the INGARCH( p , q ) model. For inference, we consider maximum likelihood, Gaussian quasi-likelihood, and moment-based approaches, along with likelihood ratio tests to distinguish between selected instances of our class. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments.

If differences of this nature are to be detected, specific tests for scale or omnibus tests need to be employed. However, the latter often suffer from low power, and they do not yield interpretable effect measures. In this article, we extend by additionally incorporating the recently introduced distribution overlap index (nonparametric dispersion measure) that can be expressed in terms of the quantile process. We derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the respective estimators of and and construct confidence regions. Extending the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, we introduce a new test based on the joint use of these functionals. It results in much larger consistency regions while maintaining competitive power to the rank sum test for situations in which alone would suffice. Compared with classical omnibus tests, the simulated power is much improved.

Key to the accuracy of this estimate is the choice of bandwidth. Too large or small a bandwidth can lead to features in the intensity being lost or to the introduction of artefacts. There are many available methods of bandwidth selection for spatial point patterns, but no consensus on the best option. Popular methods and software default options lead to very different intensity estimates and contrasting conclusions about the data that can be difficult to reconcile. In response, we propose new bandwidth selectors with more stable and consistent performance. These are adapted from popular plug-in and cross-validation techniques developed for general multivariate density estimation. The theoretical and practical performance of these proposed methods is explored and compared with other available methods in both simulated and real-data scenarios. We find that our proposed methods perform consistently well across a range of different intensity patterns.

However, fundamental tools for non-Euclidean statistics are still lacking or under development. In this paper, we propose a generalized probability density estimation method for metric spaces, based on the metric distribution function. We extend the conventional kernel density estimation method to metric spaces and introduce local and global versions of metric kernel density estimation. We establish their large sample properties under regularity conditions. Furthermore, we develop a mean integrated squared error-based bandwidth selection criterion for these new estimators. Extensive simulations under various settings are conducted to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of our proposed estimators. We exemplify the efficacy of our methods using hippocampal data, specifically capturing hippocampal surface changes of representative samples at different levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and exploring factors affecting hippocampus shape and AD severity.},

Existing robust methods against outliers or model misspecification are generally inefficient when the assumed distribution is plausible. This article proposes a simple modification of the standard EB methods with adaptively balancing robustness and efficiency. The proposed method uses -divergence instead of the marginal log-likelihood and optimizes a tuning parameter controlling robustness by pursuing the efficiency of EB confidence intervals for areal parameters. We provide an asymptotic theory of the proposed method under both the correct specification of the assumed distribution and the existence of outlying areas. We investigate the numerical performance of the proposed method through simulations and two applications to small area estimation of average crime numbers.},

In recent years, imputation through machine learning procedures has attracted a lot of attention in national statistical offices. However, little is known about the theoretical properties of the resulting point estimators in a survey setting. In this article, we study regression trees and random forests that provide flexible tools for obtaining imputed values. In a high-dimensional framework allowing the number of predictors to diverge, we lay out a set of conditions for establishing the mean square consistency of regression trees and random forests imputed estimators of a finite population mean. We propose a novel variance estimator based on a -fold cross-validation procedure. The proposed point and variance estimation are assessed through a simulation study in terms of bias, efficiency, and coverage rate of normal-based confidence intervals. Finally, the choice of hyperparameters involved in random forest algorithms is investigated through theoretical and empirical work.},

So far, the existing literature on predictive models for survey data has predominantly concentrated on scenarios with low-dimensional data, wherein the number of variables is small compared with the sample size. In this article, assuming a linear regression model, we show that customary variance estimators based on a first Taylor expansion or jackknife may suffer from substantial bias in a high-dimensional setting. We explain why this is so through a mix of theoretical and empirical investigations. We propose some bias-adjusted variance estimators and show, theoretically and empirically, that the proposed variance estimators perform well in terms of bias, even in a high-dimensional setting.},

However, there remains a lack of a broadly applicable methodology that permits information borrowing, for efficiency gains, when jointly estimating multiple monotonic regression functions. We fill this gap in the literature and introduce a methodology which can be applied to both fixed and random designs and any number of explanatory variables (regressors). Our framework penalizes pairwise differences in the values of the monotonic function estimates, with the weight of penalty being determined, for instance, based on a statistical test for equivalence of functions at a point. Function estimates are subsequently derived using an iterative optimization routine which updates the individual function estimates in turn until convergence. Simulation studies for normally and binomially distributed response data illustrate that function estimates are improved when similarities between functions exist, and are not oversmoothed otherwise. We further apply our methodology to analyze two public health data sets: neonatal mortality data for Porto Alegre, Brazil, and stroke patient data for North West England.},

For the resulting estimator, we show sign-consistency and optimal rates of convergence in the norm as in the homoscedastic, light-tailed setting.

Firstly, we show that, unlike Chi-squared, the distance covariance functional is B-robust for any number of categories (fixed or diverging). Second, we establish the strong consistency of distance covariance screening under mild conditions, and simulations confirm its advantage over Chi-squared screening, especially for large sparse tables. We illustrate this novel screening method using the General Social Survey data.

To this end, we establish the asymptotic normality of a stabilized one-step estimator that takes the selection of the mediator into account. Simulation studies show that our proposed method has good empirical performance.

Our approach generally does not require instrumental variables or shadow variables, leading to improved identifiability in most scenarios. In the identifiable case, we use the density-ratio-model-based empirical likelihood to catch the covariate distribution information and estimate the target parameter. The proposed estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal and semiparametric efficient. In the exception case, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by making full use of the marginal covariate information.

However, many existing priors, such as the Dirichlet process, have limitations if data require nested clustering structures. Thus, we introduce a discrete non-parametric prior, termed the enriched Pitman–Yor process, which offers higher flexibility in modeling such elaborate partition structures. We investigate the theoretical properties of this novel prior and establish its formal connection with the enriched Dirichlet process and normalized random measures. Additionally, we present a square-breaking representation and derive closed-form expressions for the posterior law and associated urn schemes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that several established models, including Dirichlet processes with a spike-and-slab base measure and mixture of mixtures models, emerge as special instances of the enriched Pitman–Yor process, which therefore serves as a unified probabilistic framework for various Bayesian non-parametric priors. To illustrate its practical utility, we employ the enriched Pitman–Yor process for a species-sampling ecological problem.},

  abstract     = {Cointegration analysis was developed for nonstationary linear processes that exhibit stationary relationships between coordinates. Estimation of the cointegration relationships in a multidimensional cointegrated process typically proceeds in two steps. First, the rank is estimated, then the auto-regression matrix is estimated, conditionally on the estimated rank (reduced rank regression). The asymptotics of the estimator is usually derived under the assumption of knowing the true rank. In this paper, we quantify the asymptotic bias and find the asymptotic distributions of the cointegration estimator in case of misspecified rank. Furthermore, we suggest a new class of weighted reduced rank estimators that allow for more flexibility in settings where rank selection is hard. We show empirically that a proper choice of weights can lead to increased predictive performance when there is rank uncertainty. Finally, we illustrate the estimators on empirical EEG data from a psychological experiment on visual processing.},

  abstract     = {Localization of faults in a large power system is one of the most important and difficult tasks of power systems monitoring. A fault, typically a shorted line, can be seen almost instantaneously by all measurement devices throughout the system, but determining its location in a geographically vast and topologically complex system is difficult. The task becomes even more difficult if measurements devices are placed only at some network nodes. We show that regression graph neural networks we construct, combined with a suitable statistical methodology, can solve this task very well. A chief advance of our methods is that we construct networks that produce localization without having being trained on data that contain fault localization information. We show that a synergy of statistics and deep learning can produce results that none of these approaches applied separately can achieve.},

Test statistics are obtained as functionals of the difference between the identity and the Lorenz P–P plot, defined as the composition between the inverse unscaled Lorenz curve of one distribution and the unscaled Lorenz curve of the other. We determine upper bounds for such test statistics under the null hypothesis and derive their limit distribution, to be approximated via bootstrap procedures. We then establish the asymptotic validity of the tests under relatively mild conditions and investigate finite-sample properties through simulations. The results show that our testing approach can be a valid alternative to classic methods based on the difference in the integrals of the cumulative distribution functions, which require bounded support and struggle to detect departures from the null in some cases. The same approach can be extended to a family of fractional-degree stochastic orders, including the first order as a limiting case.},

The mathematical properties of the crude, null-effects, and adjusted sequence ratios (SR) are analyzed in the presence of prescription time-trends and unmeasured time-invariant confounding. The theoretical results are illustrated in a simulation study. The crude SR can be interpreted as an estimator of the hazard ratio (HR) of treatment when the allowed time between initiation of the treatment and the outcome drug is small. The HR can easily be estimated flexibly as a function of covariates, such as age and sex, using logistic regression. The crude SR implicitly adjusts for unmeasured time-invariant confounding, whereas the null-effects SR, and thereby the adjusted SR, make little sense unless treatment and outcome are strictly independent. The use of the adjusted SR should be abandoned. Another design should be used if it is infeasible to require treatment and outcome sufficiently close. The crude SR can be modeled flexibly with logistic regression to estimate covariate-dependent HRs or at least to test whether the HR depends on covariates.},

One major challenge is to determine the number of threshold effects. We first show the selection consistency of a modified Bayesian information criterion under mild conditions. It is useful sometimes but heavily depends on the penalization magnitude, which usually varies from the model configuration and data distribution. To address this issue, we leverage a cross-validation criterion alongside an order-preserved sample-splitting scheme to yield a consistent estimation. The new criterion is completely data driven without additional parameters and thus robust to model setting and data distributions. The asymptotic properties for the parameter estimates are also carefully established. Additionally, we propose an efficient score-type test to examine the existence of threshold effects. The new statistic is free of estimating any potential threshold effects and is thus suitable for multithreshold scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the reliable finite-sample performance of our methodologies, which corroborates the theoretical results.},

To address this gap, we describe a class of estimands that explicitly acknowledge the multilevel data structure in SW-CREs and highlight three typical members of the estimand class that are interpretable. We then introduce four analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) working models to achieve estimand-aligned analyses with covariate adjustment. Each ANCOVA estimator is model-assisted, as its point estimator is consistent even when the working model is misspecified. Under the stepped wedge randomization scheme, we establish the finite population Central Limit Theorem for each estimator. We study the finite-sample operating characteristics of the ANCOVA estimators in simulations and illustrate their application by analyzing the Washington State Expedited Partner Therapy study.},

Both INARMA and INGARCH models exhibit an ARMA-like autocorrelation function (ACF). To achieve negative ACF values within the class of INGARCH models, log and softplus link functions are suggested in the literature, where the softplus approach leads to conditional linearity in good approximation. However, the softplus approach is limited to the INGARCH family for unbounded counts, that is, it can neither be used for bounded counts, nor for count processes from the INARMA family. In this paper, we present an alternative solution, named the Tobit approach, for achieving approximate linearity together with negative ACF values, which is more generally applicable than the softplus approach. A Skellam–Tobit INGARCH model for unbounded counts is studied in detail, including stationarity, approximate computation of moments, maximum likelihood and censored least absolute deviations estimation for unknown parameters and corresponding simulations. Extensions of the Tobit approach to other situations are also discussed, including underlying discrete distributions, INAR models, and bounded counts. Three real-data examples are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.},

To check its adequacy, we propose a novel class of goodness-of-fit tests for homogeneous Erdös–Rényi models against heterogeneous alternatives that permit nonconstant edge probabilities. We allow for both asymptotically dense and sparse networks. The tests are based on graph functionals that cover a broad class of network statistics for which we derive limiting distributions in a unified manner. The resulting class of asymptotic tests includes several existing tests as special cases. Further, we propose a parametric bootstrap and prove its consistency, which avoids the often tedious variance estimation for asymptotic tests and enables performance improvements for small network sizes. Moreover, under certain fixed and local alternatives, we provide a power analysis for some popular choices of subgraph counts as goodness-of-fit test statistics.

We develop a classical hypothesis test for completed epidemics which assesses whether or not there is significant within-group transmission during an outbreak. The test is based on time-ordered group labels of individuals. The null hypothesis is that of homogeneity of disease transmission among individuals, a hypothesis under which the discrete random vector of groups labels has a known sampling distribution that is independent of any model parameters. The test exhibits excellent performance when applied to various scenarios of simulated data and is also illustrated using two real-life epidemic data sets. We develop some asymptotic theory including a central limit theorem. The test is practically very appealing, being computationally cheap and straightforward to implement, as well as being applicable to a wide range of real-life outbreak settings and to related problems in other fields.},

Recently, the first inference methods for the MCV were proposed for general factorial designs. However, the inference methods are primarily derived for one special MCV variant while there are several reasonable proposals. Moreover, when rejecting a global null hypothesis, a more in-depth analysis is of interest to find the significant contrasts of MCV. This paper concerns extending the nonparametric permutation procedure to the other MCV variants and a max-type test for post hoc analysis. To improve the small sample performance of the latter, we suggest a novel bootstrap strategy and prove its asymptotic validity. The actual performance of all proposed tests is compared in an extensive simulation study and illustrated by real data analysis. All methods are implemented in the R package GFDmcv, available on CRAN.},

We also demonstrate that kernel-based estimators achieve the optimal minimax rate. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive procedure for both L 2 $$ {L}^2 $$ integrated and pointwise risk. In the two-dimensional case, we show that kernel density estimators achieve the rate log T T $$ \frac{\log T}{T} $$ , which is optimal in the minimax sense. Finally we illustrate the validity of our theoretical findings by proposing numerical results.},

  abstract     = {The win ratio has in the recent decade gained popularity for analyzing prioritized multiple event data in clinical cohort studies, in particular within cardiovascular research. The literature on estimation of the win ratio using censored event data is however sparse. The methods that have been suggested have either an insufficient adjustment of the censoring or by assuming the the win and loss probabilities are proportional over time. The assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities will often in practice not be satisfied. In this paper, we present estimates for the win ratio, and win and loss probabilities, under independent right-censoring and derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimates. The proposed win ratio estimate does not require the assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities. The small sample properties of the proposed method are studied in a simulation study showing that the variance formula is accurate even for small samples. The method is applied on two data sets.},

  abstract     = {We suggest novel correlation coefficients which equal the maximum correlation for a class of bivariate Lancaster distributions while being only slightly smaller than maximum correlation for a variety of further bivariate distributions. In contrast to maximum correlation, however, our correlation coefficients allow for rank and moment-based estimators which are simple to compute and have tractable asymptotic distributions. Confidence intervals resulting from these asymptotic approximations and the covariance bootstrap show good finite-sample coverage. In a simulation, the power of asymptotic as well as permutation tests for independence based on our correlation measures compares favorably with competing methods based on distance correlation or rank coefficients for functional dependence, among others. Moreover, for the bivariate normal distribution, our correlation coefficients equal the absolute value of the Pearson correlation, an attractive feature for practitioners which is not shared by various competitors. We illustrate the practical usefulness of our methods in applications to two real data sets.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models are used when apart from the main treatments, some covariates also affect the response variable. In this article, the problem of testing the homogeneity of treatment effects against ordered alternatives is addressed in a fixed effects one-way ANCOVA model when error variances are heterogeneous. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and two approximate tests based on the asymptotic distributions of some union-intersection type test statistics are proposed. A parametric bootstrap technique has been used to implement the LRT and its asymptotic validity is proved. A method to construct simultaneous confidence intervals is proposed. All the test procedures are further extended to the case of more than one covariate. The robustness of tests is also studied under departure from normality. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed test procedures perform well in terms of achieving the nominal size value and good power values.},

  abstract     = {General geostatistical models are powerful tools for analyzing spatial datasets. A two-step estimation based on the likelihood function is widely used by researchers, but several theoretical and computational challenges remain to be addressed. First, it is unclear whether there is a unique global maximizer of the log-likelihood function, a seemingly simple but theoretically challenging question. The second challenge is the convexity of the log-likelihood function. Besides these two challenges in maximizing the likelihood function, we also study the theoretical property of the two-step estimation. Unlike many previous works, our results can apply to the non-twice differentiable covariance functions. In the simulation studies, three optimization algorithms are evaluated in terms of maximizing the log-likelihood functions.},

  abstract     = {Functional Principal Component Analysis is a reference method for dimension reduction of curve data. Its theoretical properties are now well understood in the simplified case where the sample curves are fully observed without noise. However, functional data are noisy and necessarily observed on a finite discretization grid. Common practice consists in smoothing the data and then to compute the functional estimates, but the impact of this denoising step on the procedure's statistical performance are rarely considered. Here we prove new convergence rates for functional principal component estimators. We introduce a double asymptotic framework: one corresponding to the sampling size and a second to the size of the grid. We prove that estimates based on projection onto histograms show optimal rates in a minimax sense. Theoretical results are illustrated on simulated data and the method is applied to the visualization of genomic data.},
