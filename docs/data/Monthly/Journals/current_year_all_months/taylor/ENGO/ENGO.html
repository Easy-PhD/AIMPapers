  abstract     = {Owing to substantial growth in global waterborne trade volumes and changes in climate, shipping companies must enhance operational and energy efficiency. A multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed to optimize service schedules, fleet, vessel speed, and cargo flow, including transhipment operations. Innovative features of this research reside in the multi-objective model formulation that integrates these complex and crucial operational decisions of the maritime industry. This MINLP model presents a trade-off between economic and environmental aspects considering shipping time and shipping cost as the two conflicting objectives. Two evolutionary algorithms, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Online Clustering-based Evolutionary Algorithm (OCEA), are applied to attain the near-optimal solution. The results indicate that the proposed model can contribute to saving fuel costs, reducing emissions and finding trade-offs between shipping cost and time. Furthermore, the study reflects how shipping companies can use this model to make data-driven decisions in their operations.},

  abstract     = {Structural resolution in topology optimization represents the refinement degree of its outcomes, thereby directly influencing the optimization quality. A deep learning approach is developed to predict high-resolution optimal structures by leveraging mappings from low-resolution structures at low cost. By incorporating conditional convolution-based modules into the model for different mapping scale factors, it acquires the capability of dynamic scale adaptation, enabling a single model to predict high-resolution structures across arbitrary scale. The datasets are established using the traditional topology optimization method, with downsampling employed to expand the datasets at arbitrary scale. In order to achieve efficient prediction of three-dimensional structures, two-dimensional methodologies are further extended to three dimensions. Through extensive simulations comparing with traditional interpolations and other single-scale high-resolution structural optimization methods, the article has demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method for varying geometric sizes and boundary conditions. Furthermore, the excellent performance of the model at arbitrary scale is rigorously validated by numerous numerical examples.},

MHCO divides the subsystem-level optimization process of design variables into various layers based on the shared design variables between disciplines. At the overall system level, the consistency constraint condition is constructed to obtain optimal values according to the optimized subsystem-level results. Four optimization indicators [translational motion of the pantograph head, pantograph lightweighting, pantograph–catenary contact force (PCCF) and active control] are established to conduct he design optimization of a high-speed pantograph. Compared with the initial value,  the four indicators have improved by 78.7076%, 16.6516%, 38.1037% and 15.5542%. MHCO provides a new method for designing complex mechanical systems.},

To address such problems, this study aims to refine the scheduling of PC production by considering batch production on mold tables, within their capacity limitations. First, a prefabricated production scheduling model considering the mold table capacity and batch production is established, and a batching method based on integer programming is proposed to assist components batching. Secondly, a whale algorithm based optimization strategy is developed to find the potentially optimal scheduling solutions. Lastly, detailed experiments and comparisons are conducted. Experimental results show that the established production scheduling model and the presented optimization method in this study can effectively assist factories in carrying out rational scheduling, shorten the production cycle and reduce the amortization cost.},

The results indicate that the simplified variable-camber continuous trailing-edge flap system has the smallest and limited benefit, with only a 0.70% weighted aerodynamic efficiency improvement, which may not be sufficient to cover the extra burden of the increased complexity and weight.

  abstract     = {In long transmission lines, transmission line tower (TLT) configurations are often repeated, unlike most unique structures. To reduce their global mass, several optimization methods have been developed. Traditionally, metaheuristic algorithms are used to find the optimum, but recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been integrated with metaheuristics to accelerate the process. However, the application of ML has been limited to small-scale TLTs or academic research. This article introduces a novel approach combining a metaheuristic called the backtracking search algorithm (BSA) with Kriging-based efficient global optimization (EGO). This method optimizes the size and shape of a full-scale self-supported TLT family, addressing some of the main industrial aspects. Results show that EGO can decrease the TLT family's mass by up to 8.37% with just a few additional objective function evaluations (OFEs), while BSA alone would need over 100,000 OFEs for comparable outcomes. This efficiency highlights the proposed approach's effectiveness in complex engineering design optimization.},

Remarkably, the Con-Cat kernel represents a generalization of standard kernels, achieving equivalence in scenarios solely involving continuous variables. The subspace activation scheme enhances surrogate modelling performance without introducing extra model parameters, which is particularly beneficial for sparse datasets. Numerical evaluations, including three mathematical functions, a supported beam problem, and turbine blade cooling structure design optimization, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Bayesian optimization strategy, exhibiting up to an 85% improvement over five alternative approaches, especially in scenarios with sparse data.},

  abstract     = {Based on a given set of uncertain scenarios, robust optimization aims to determine the best possible choices. The best solution in robust optimization is usually found by identifying the best out of the worst-case analysis or by using the min–max counterpart. The min–max approach is a pessimistic approach and commonly discards the effect of some uncertain scenarios in the process of finding an optimum solution. Thus, in this article, a new robust counterpart is introduced with the help of the generalized ordered weighted aggregation (GOWA) operator to solve uncertain multi-objective optimization problems with an uncertainty set of finite cardinality. After introducing GOWA robustness, the elementary properties of the GOWA robust objective function, such as continuity and local Lipschitz continuity, are analysed. Then, the relationship is discussed between the concept of GOWA robustness and (the pessimistic) min–max and (the optimistic) min–min robustness. It is shown that min–min and min–max robustness are particular cases of GOWA robustness. The GOWA robust counterpart is found to be an optimization problem with a set-valued objective mapping. Two approaches are provided to find robust solutions for GOWA: weighted-sum and epsilon-constraint. Finally, an objective-wise GOWA robust counterpart is provided to solve uncertain multi-objective optimization problems and relate it to min–max robustness. Several geometrical and numerical illustrations support the entire article.},

  abstract     = {The research focuses on optimizing battery pack systems (BPSs) for crashworthiness and lightweight design in electric vehicles. Traditional methods have high computing costs and do not account for the battery cell's failure criterion. This study uses a submodel and hybrid weighting for multi-objective design. It starts with the finite element model of a single cell, validates it and then builds a BPS model with a submodel for key areas. The optimal Latin hypercube sampling technique is used to sample the design space, and a kriging surrogate model and multi-objective particle swarm algorithm are used to find the Pareto solution. The compromise solution is selected using the analytic hierarchy process–Entropy–VIKOR method, considering the maximum principal strain of the cell. This approach cuts the computation time by 56.2% and offers a practical solution for BPS design by utilizing the load-bearing ability of the BPS.},

IMCTS with multiple root nodes includes the update process, best reward, accelerating technique and terminal condition. The update process means that once a final solution is found, it is used as the initial solution for the next search tree. The best reward is used in the backpropagation step. The accelerating technique is introduced by decreasing the width of the search tree and reducing the maximum number of iterations. The agent is trained to minimize the total structural weight under various constraints until the terminal condition is satisfied. The optimal solution is the minimum value of all solutions found by the search trees. Numerical examples show that the agent can find the optimal solution with low computational cost, stably produces an optimal design, and is suitable for multi-objective structural optimization and large-scale structures.},

When performing parts-cutting operations for various orders, factors such as priority, the material attribute of the steel plate and part specifications need to be considered. Notably, it is beneficial to ensure continuous cutting to minimize steel waste when these parts need the same steel plates. A mixed integer programming model and a two-stage heuristic are proposed to determine the cutting sequence of the parts. The two-stage heuristic involves preprocessing and local search. Finally, the performance of the proposed approaches is assessed using real-world cutting production data. This includes scenarios with more than 10,000 parts, allowing for a thorough evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed two-stage heuristic exhibits significant efficiency and quality advantages compared to the Gurobi tm solver and local search.},

However, the widespread application of RL in this field is limited owing to the excessive number of iterations required to converge and the expensive computational cost it brings. To address these challenges, this article presents a novel RL framework for structural optimization, combining Monte Carlo tree search with the proximal policy optimization method, called LMPOM. The key contributions of LMPOM encompass: (1) an enhanced Monte Carlo tree search strategy for partitioning the hybrid design space; (2) a strategy for adaptively updating surrogate models to reduce simulation costs; and (3) the introduction of a novel termination condition for the RL algorithms. Through tests on three benchmark problems, compared with previous RL algorithms, LMPOM consistently shows fewer iterations and better optimization results.},

The focus of this article is on improving the efficiency of the box algorithm. The basic principle behind this algorithm is to transform the linear system into a series of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, which are then solved on annealing machines. The computational efficiency of the box algorithm is entirely determined by the number of iterations, which, in turn, depends on the box contraction ratio, typically set to 0.5. Here, it is shown through theoretical analysis that a contraction ratio of 0.5 is sub-optimal and that a computational speed-up can be achieved with a contraction ratio of 0.2. This is confirmed through numerical experiments where a computational speed-up between 20 % to 60 % is observed when the optimal contraction ratio is used.},

Using a validated optimization methodology, this study aims to reduce the bogie volume in selected domains while ensuring structural integrity and potentially extending service life.

Then, a modified genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize discrete variables. To enhance convergence stationarity, the concept of ‘adjacent individuals’ is proposed to control the degree of difference in topology configuration between initial population members and the current optimal. Additionally, adjustments to the sequence-based crossover process ensure compliance with damper quantity constraints. Examples demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent individuals is beneficial to convergence stationarity, and the shape change of the truss increases the mode damping ratio by more than 20%.

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is a widely adopted structural optimization approach that aims to maximize desired performance based on mathematical and physical principles. Gradient-based methods are common for obtaining optimal configurations; however, they struggle with problems involving numerous local optima and non-differentiable problems, which prevent the derivation of design sensitivity. To address these issues, this study explores the application of the Success History-Based Differential Evolution with Linear Population Size Reduction and Semi-Parameter Adaptation, which is regarded as LSHADE-SPA algorithm, known for its strong search capabilities. Nevertheless, its computational cost makes it impractical for topology optimization, especially as the number of design variables increases. To overcome this challenge, a novel structure representation method utilizing the Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion is constructed. Applying truncated KL expansion instead of conventional density methods to represent structural configurations reduces the number of design variables. This article introduces a differential evolution-based topology optimization method utilizing truncated KL expansion and validates its effectiveness through applications in various structural and fluid problems. The method is particularly suited to highly nonlinear problems, such as negative Poisson's ratio structures and micro-mixer designs. The findings here indicate that differential evolution with truncated KL expansion can serve as an efficient and robust topology optimization method, proving particularly effective for solving optimization problems that are challenging for conventional gradient-based approaches. Notably, the proposed methodology not only delivers superior results but also alleviates computational burdens, thereby advancing the prospects of topology optimization in various engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) suffer from a major problem with the energy drainage of network nodes, as the mobile nodes rely on batteries and do not have a permanent power supply. Therefore, a new multipath routing technique, using a novel hybrid heuristic algorithm, is designed to solve the diverse metrics of a multi-objective function, including energy consumption, distance, routing overhead ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio. This approach implements a new hybrid algorithm termed the modified aquila–firefly heuristic strategy (MA-FHS), which integrates the aquila optimizer and the firefly algorithm. This derived fitness function is applied to achieve optimal paths in multipath routing with minimization of the multi-objective function. The simulation demonstrates that the developed routing protocols outperformed traditional protocols under several network constraints.},

The widely adopted set-induced robust optimization approach is employed to address correlated uncertainty in environments with limited data. This approach focuses on deriving a deterministic reformulation of the original uncertain optimization problem, ensuring that the constructed solution remains feasible for all potential realizations of input parameters within a predefined uncertainty set. However, this approach often yields overly conservative solutions. In this study, an innovative uncertainty set is developed to mitigate the over-conservatism associated with the set-induced robust optimization approach under correlated uncertainty. Moreover, from the proposed description of data uncertainty, a robust linear reformulation of the original uncertain optimization problem is established to strike a balance between conservativeness and optimality.

In this study, a directed evolution-based non-gradient topology optimization method is proposed to reduce the high computational cost. A directed generation strategy of load path components is presented, based on the idea of fixed-point enumeration. This strategy determines the position and direction of components by locating the region with the maximum stress and enumerating samples with different orientations at each iteration step. Then, an element removal criterion is developed to gradually eliminate the redundant elements from the components. Consequently, an adaptive adjustment technique of component size is presented to overcome the numerical instability. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated through numerical examples. The results show that the proposed method can reasonably generate structural load paths with exceptional efficiency compared to existing non-gradient algorithms.},

The feasibility of the model is verified and the effects of the quantities of material types and design subdomains, the Poisson's ratio factor and the multi-material off-angle on topological configuration and compliance are studied. The results indicate that the quantity of material types affects the mechanical properties of the periodic structure, and different microstructure configurations can be obtained under different numbers of design subdomains. The increase in the Poisson's ratio factor and decrease in the off-angle can enhance the effective elastic properties of the microstructure and reduce the compliance.

Under the conditions of meeting the constraints of time, cost and quality, the project’s parameters are improved by adjusting the resource inputs. The study found that when project resources are insufficient, intertask messaging should be avoided as much as possible. If messaging is initiated, early messaging can be effective in reducing resource consumption, and decision makers can make trade-offs based on their preferences for resources.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization faces challenges concerning grey transition regions, manufacturability and computational efficiency. This article introduces an approach called the volume-preserving binary (VPB) filter. This novel sensitivity/density filter, based on a determinant-based matrix approach, efficiently detects grey elements and produces completely binary designs. The VPB filter addresses volume preservation by accurately expressing the volume-preserving condition, i.e. the volume before filtering equals the volume of solid materials after filtering. Comparison with other filtering methods, including the volume-preserving Heaviside filter and the Heaviside projection, illustrates the superior clarity and speed of the VPB filter. It reduces the number of iterations required for topology optimization, from hundreds or thousands to only tens of iterations, making it a promising solution for practical applications where manufacturability and computational efficiency are principal. Examples on compliance optimization, compliant mechanisms and heat conduction demonstrate the VPB filter's effectiveness in providing satisfactory solutions while perfectly preserving the length scale.},

The FRILP model was applied to two cases to verify its effectiveness in booster optimization under uncertainty. The optimal upper and lower approximation intervals of the injection mass and booster cost in the fuzzy rough set were obtained and the effects of booster number and location were analysed. The results indicated that with an increase in booster number, the injection mass generally decreased, and booster cost decreased or increased. The nodal chlorine concentration also decreased and was distributed uniformly under a scenario with more boosters. Locating the booster far from the source resulted in more uniform chlorine distribution. The results could help managers design booster schemes with consideration of technical and economic factors comprehensively under uncertainty.},

This article presents an innovative approach that combines topology optimization, a homogenization method based on the unit cell concept and finite-volume theory to design highly efficient periodic cellular materials with optimized macroscopic elastic properties. To determine the optimal microstructural topology, specific linear combinations of components of the homogenized elastic matrix are considered to obtain optimized elastic properties, such as maximum shear/bulk moduli, considering a prescribed volume fraction constraint of solid material. Numerical examples are analysed, and the results demonstrate the exceptional performance of this approach in achieving optimal designs of cellular materials characterized by chequerboard-free patterns without filtering techniques.},

Comparison shows that OPSOA and its incomplete algorithms are better than SOA, indicating that each improvement is effective. By testing the benchmark functions of CEC 2017 and CEC 2022, it is shown that OPSOA has a strong ability to find the optimal solution and is superior to other algorithms in terms of convergence accuracy and search speed.

Ants’ foraging habits motivate the development of wind turbines with high dependability, high efficiency and low energy storage costs. A study is conducted to confirm the practicality of the proposed method, using real data from a wind power plant to calculate the contrast between wind energy production and load consumption features, to influence the appropriate quantity for energy storage organization.

  abstract     = {The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP), as a realistic extension of the classical flow shop scheduling problem, widely exists in real-world industrial production systems. In practice, the fact that machines are unrelated is important and cannot be neglected. This study focuses on the HFSP with unrelated parallel machines (HFSP-UPM) to minimize the makespan. To address this problem, a hybrid representation that combines single-sequence coding and full-sequence coding is developed to search for solution space that is not covered by common encoding methods. An initialization block integrating random heuristic strategies is proposed for improving the quality of the initial sparrow swarm. To improve the diversity of a sparrow swarm further, a perturbation block embedded with a set of historical best positions and an enhancement strategy are developed. A critical set based local search block is designed for high-intensity local exploitation of promising regions when necessary. Several benchmark cases from the literature as well as some randomly generated instances characterized by the distribution of real data from factory studies are employed to participate in the test. The test results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed perturbation block and local search block. Compared to state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, the enhanced sparrow search algorithm (ESSA) demonstrates higher convergence accuracy when handling instances. The value of the gap between a solution found by the ESSA and a feasible solution found by the mixed-integer programming (MIP) model can reach 0.6%.},

This article proposes a new design methodology. First, the functional behaviour of the assembly is predicted through finite element analysis, and the deformed geometry is expressed as a geometric tolerance zone constraint. Then, the functional assembly requirement is mathematically defined as a fit constraint. Simultaneously, rotational and planar machining constraints are developed. Finally, a combinatorial optimization problem is formulated to minimize the manufacturing cost. For optimal trade-offs, the bacterial foraging algorithm is applied to solve the combinatorial optimization problem; when it is applied to a mounted disc brake assembly, promising results are obtained.},

  abstract     = {To achieve more efficient resolution of reliability analysis problems in engineering, it is essential to enhance the line sampling (LS) method, which is typically effective for rare events. This article proposes an enhanced method for rare events by combining LS with kriging. In this method, the updating of kriging is conducted from a one-dimensional perspective along the important direction. The samples used to assess the failure probability are obtained through importance sampling (IS) from multiple IS centres rather than Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). During each iteration, both upper and lower bounds of the failure probability are simultaneously evaluated to determine whether to halt the iteration process. Finally, global sensitivity analysis is conducted by filtering the samples generated at multiple IS centres, rather than generating MCS samples. By comparison with existing methods, this article demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method through three numerical examples and an engineering problem.},

  abstract     = {Prefabricated building is an advanced building mode that is actively promoted in China owing to its high-efficiency, energy-saving and labour-saving characteristics. However, because of the limited production capacity and production resources of the final assembly parts production plant, it is usually impossible for a factory to accept all orders. Therefore, the factory will consider outsourcing part of the orders to reduce delay penalties. In addition, the allocation of workers in the production process will significantly affect the processing time of orders. Regarding those two issues, a production scheduling integrated optimization model, considering worker allocation and order outsourcing, is established to maximize net profit. To address the complexity of problem solving caused by the NP-hard nature of this problem, a hybrid improved genetic–accelerated iterative greedy search algorithm is developed. Finally, a numerical example is delivered to verify that the proposed algorithm has improved solution quality and convergence.},

The algorithm is able to plan smooth and collisionless paths for robots combining cubic spline interpolation and multi-robot coordination. A quantum behavioural mechanism is used to coordinate the evolution of the whale population during the variable phase to increase the population quality and balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the WOA. Simultaneously, refracted opposition-based learning is introduced to improve the algorithm's optimization accuracy and convergence speed. The RQWOA was compared with seven efficient algorithms in experiments on classical test functions and multi-robot path planning cases. The results of these methods were tested statistically. The experimental results indicate that the RQWOA has superior solution accuracy. The RQWOA is highly competitive in terms of pathlength and stability in solving multi-robot path planning problems.},

  abstract     = {The present study introduces a revised version of the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm called Dynamic-GWO, which integrates a dynamic parameter adaptation mechanism for population diversity enhancement. This mechanism implements the real-time adjustment of control parameters throughout the optimization procedure. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated by its consistent performance across a variety of intricate benchmark functions. Further, the suggested approach is employed to determine the eminent filter tap coefficients of the Quadrature-Mirror-Filter (QMF) bank that enables the configuration with filter orders of 120 and 150, which have yet to be achieved using existing methods. The uniqueness of the proposed approach lies in its capability to overcome the inherent difficulties associated with higher-order filter design, including increased filter length and computational complexity. The primary objective function is to minimize the algebraic sum of three types of distortion: pass-band error, excess power of stop-band, and squared error of the overall transfer function at the quadrature frequency ω q = π / 2 , which generally occur in the procedure of Near-Perfect-Reconstruction (NPR) QMF bank design. In addition, the measured maximum reconstruction errors are 1.303 × 10 − 15 , 2.93 × 10 − 16 and 2.18 × 10 − 06 dB, and aliasing distortions are A L = 85.80 , 128.49 and 153.52 dB for filter orders N = 100, 120 and 150, correspondingly. The proposed algorithm yields significant improvements with an 86.68% reduction in the ripple factor and a 10.45% increase in attenuation compared to the baseline GWO for filter order 120, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing filter performance. The observed outcomes indicate that the Dynamic-GWO algorithm consistently surpasses the baseline GWO and other Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIAs) regarding computational ease and convergence speed.},

As the preselected orientations cannot change, better MMTO solutions may be overlooked. To address this issue, a novel MMTO algorithm incorporating the anisotropic material fibre orientation as a design variable is proposed, eliminating the need to preselect fibre orientations and leading to better MMTO solutions. A numerical approximation method named the carry-through method is also proposed. This allows the compliance sensitivity over anisotropic material fibre orientation to be calculated without the need for the strain–displacement matrix information, simplifying the MMTO method implementation. Comparative studies on three models demonstrate that the proposed MMTO method outperforms the existing MMTO method, achieving improvements of 7%, 10% and 14% on the objectives in these models.},

This is achieved by creating a sensitivity analysis based on variations in cumulative plastic strain energy resulting from element deletions. The final optimized topologies exhibit bar structures with exceptional capacity for energy dissipation.

With superior search speed and convergence rates to the traditional genetic algorithm, μGA uses a neural network-based reduced-order model to predict hardness. Additional correlation equations are used to determine the corresponding tensile strength and elongation. Microstructural analysis was performed using neurocomputing techniques to further validate the accuracy of the algorithm. The entire computational framework was validated using data from the literature, establishing its utility in steel design.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a stochastic model updating approach using an improved multi-population migrant genetic algorithm (MMGA) with the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm based on the Bayesian inference approach. To enhance the search capacity of the genetic algorithm (GA), the MMGA introduces heuristic: the promotion and elimination mechanisms of urban population migration. The stochastic model updating approach includes two stages. The optimal values identified by the MMGA without considering the parameter uncertainties in the first stage are used as the initial values for the MH algorithm to accelerate Bayesian inference for uncertain parameters in the second stage. A practical application, the Yellow River Bridge with a heavy-haul railway line, demonstrates that the proposed approach offers an increased probability of gaining the global optimum, and predictions of displacements and frequencies provided by the updated finite element model are comparable to those obtained from the field tests.},

A mixed-integer programming method is proposed to maximize customer satisfaction by minimizing the total number of in-vehicle passengers during trips. A heuristic algorithm is proposed for a given number of service trips, in which the error bound of the heuristic is restricted by the number of stations. When the given number of service trips is sufficient to provide express services for all origin–destination pairs, the heuristic provides an optimal solution. However, the error bound of the heuristic approaches infinity as the number of stations increases. A fully polynomial time-approximation algorithm is proposed, where the number of service trips is a decision variable.

This article proposes a structural optimization method for thin-walled parts to achieve both mass centre control and lightweight design. First, mass centre and volume are taken as the constraints for structural optimization, and a mathematical model for multi-constrained topology optimization is developed. Secondly, a dimensionality reduction method based on a 3D spatial filter is introduced for the optimization of thin-walled parts. The maximum error between the mass centre of the optimized structure and the target mass centre is only 1.03%, which indicates that the method has high accuracy in mass centre control. Numerical analysis shows that adjusting the mass centre can achieve regulation of the moment of inertia and can also suppress flutter.},

With the objective of minimizing the RCS at the specified incident angles and the constraint of the material usage, the strategy is implemented based on a gradient-based algorithm and the so-called three-field density method. Additionally, the phenomenon of the RCS increasing in certain regions when RACs are applied is explained in detail.

The importance of this task becomes more evident in further iterations since the optimal (or nearly optimal) structure topology is identified, and improper elimination of any member can result in infeasible mechanisms and lead to a waste of several iterations. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary module, it is integrated with different optimization algorithms to solve distinct size and topology problems.

The pseudo excitation and hybrid expansion methods are adopted to compute the random responses at the specified frequency intervals as the objective functions. The sensitivity analysis is performed through the adjoint vector method. The similarity index is defined to distinguish the various optimal layouts quantitatively. Several numerical examples clearly demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting a remarkable improvement of over 60% in computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is proved that, when subjected to broadband random excitation, the damping materials' temperature- and frequency-dependent properties are critical factors in obtaining accurate vibration responses and desirable optimal layouts.

This study presents a novel approach to representation learning that uses a contrastive loss with dynamic margin loss function. The approach is specifically designed to capture semantic similarities in rubber material quantities and physical-property recipes. In addition, a novel neural network architecture is proposed that uses latent vectors for assigning initial weights.

  abstract     = {The parameters in structural–acoustic coupling models are often coupled with each other, and the independence of the uncertain parameters is a necessary condition for using the traditional interval perturbation method. This article proposes a relevant interval perturbation method for the uncertainty analysis of a structural–acoustic coupling model with uncertain-but-bounded parameters. Aiming at the linear inequality constraint relationship in the uncertain parameters, this method introduces a sensitivity ranking mechanism for the uncertainty parameters, which overcomes the limitation of uncertain parameter independence in the traditional interval model, and effectively restrains the interval expansion phenomenon of the system response in the uncertainty analysis. Through numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the relevant interval perturbation analysis method can effectively solve a constrained problem when there are uncertain parameters, and the obtained response interval radius is smaller than that of the traditional method under constraint conditions.},

A novel bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is formulated, then an efficient optimization approach is proposed for the problem. Experimental studies on a case study and 210 random testing instances were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and approach. For the case study, 10 Pareto-optimal solutions were obtained within 1.9 s. For the random testing instances, the average number of Pareto-optimal solutions and computational time were 10.19 and 18.85 s, respectively. The overall results show that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms the adapted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II on test instances. Computational results indicate that this approach could assist decision makers in making good decisions, with considerable SC cost saving and carbon emission reductions in different situations.},

This article proposes an efficient method to address the problem of robust topology optimization of multi-material structures. Employing the property that the material-field series-expansion method can significantly reduce the number of design variables, the proposed method improves the computational efficiency of the robust optimization problem. Meanwhile, the modification of the original multi-material interpolation model improves the quality of the optimized designs. Monte Carlo simulation is used to treat the load uncertainty, but it is decoupled from the optimization process based on linear elasticity theory to reduce computation cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical examples, which show that robust design results can be efficiently generated by this method.},

According to the roulette wheel selection method, a peer learning strategy is designed to achieve information exchange between individuals. Then, a control parameter is introduced to control the combination of the peer learning strategy and original position updating equations, and this parameter can be adaptively adjusted by means of the individual evolution. To estimate the search capability of PLSCA, it is compared with six representative SCA methods and several other metaheuristic algorithms on two different kinds of benchmark function.

Optimum solutions are obtained with different objectives considering renewable uncertainties.

In recent years, meshless methods have been used in several engineering fields, showing some advantages compared to mesh-based methods. DMLPG is a truly meshless method, which achieves results with good accuracy and computational efficiency, avoiding the numerical integration of complicated shape functions by adopting low-degree polynomials. In the proposed algorithm, DMLPG is used to obtain smooth nodal displacements, strains and stresses, and gBESO updates the structural geometry based on design sensitivity values of the compliance while it gradually increases the Young's modulus of the material. The optimization problem minimizes the compliance objective function subject to volume constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and validity of the technique.},

  abstract     = {This article examines an alliance of heterogeneous factories operating as a production network, in which jobs can be divided into several sub-jobs and independently processed in distributed factories. This problem is considered as a distributed unrelated parallel machine scheduling with splitting jobs (DUPMSP/S). A mathematical model and an effective multi-stage evolutionary algorithm (EMSEA) are proposed, aiming to minimize the total tardiness and total cost of production and transportation. In the EMSEA, the optimization process is divided into three stages according to the population in each generation, and four problem-based initial methods and three knowledge-based local exploitation strategies are embedded to improve its performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the EMSEA with four other algorithms and to compare the scheduling model with no splitting jobs. The results demonstrate that EMSEA is the most promising method in solving the DUPMSP/S, and the job splitting mode is effective.},

  abstract     = {With the development of globalized production, customer satisfaction has become a critical concern for companies. Multi-agent models have gained attention, aiming to meet customer demands while reducing costs. The bi-agent flow-shop scheduling problem (BAFSP) in the manufacturing industry is the main focus of this article, where agents represent different customers. The objective of BAFSP is to minimize the total weighted makespan for agents. The BAFSP introduces various position-dependent learning effects. Furthermore, each task has an independent release date, aligned with real production scenarios. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the transformer architecture is proposed to address the BAFSP with learning effects (BAFSP-LE). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other commonly used heuristics. To explore the feasibility of combining DRL with metaheuristics, the proposed DRL method is used as an initial solution generator. The method improves the performance of these metaheuristics within the same computation time.},

However, certain formulations of CG methods that switch between two or more CG parameters often overlook specific values that could have been integrated. Moreover, the demonstration of the sufficient descent property in these methods usually relies on a strategy that assumes the possible exclusion of certain function values. To alleviate this assumption, this article introduces a structured Liu–Storey spectral CG method. This method extends the formulation of the spectral Fletcher conjugate descent method, enabling it to maintain fast convergence and inherit a good restart property. Therefore, the method ensures that the sufficient descent property holds without additional requirements and converges globally via some standard assumptions. Additionally, the method proves useful in solving robotic and image reconstruction models. Finally, it demonstrates robustness when compared to some standard algorithms.},

When the function exhibits multimodality, it is difficult to identify the global optimum. This article proposes a novel batch selection strategy for parallel global optimization called Sampling–Optimizing–Selecting (SOS) to address this problem. SOS, utilizing minimum energy design, gradient optimization and hypersphere clustering, can adaptively explore multiple local optimal regions of the objective function simultaneously and make full use of parallel resources to obtain the global optimum efficiently. Additionally, the SOS algorithm maintains the sparsity between sample points to a certain extent, which enhances the accuracy of the surrogate model and thus improves the robustness of the optimization effect.

A constructive heuristic with a group strategy is employed to obtain an initial solution.

Most importantly, the subspace variables are updated in each iteration, according to the variable interaction analyses in the sub- and full-spaces. The perturbation method and the analysis of variance are used to detect variable interactions. After being validated on 21 benchmark functions ranging from 30 to 90 dimensions, the DA-EGO is used for the optimization of a transonic compressor rotor with 28 variables and a multi-stage compressor optimization with 60 variables.

In the competitive strategy, krill individuals with poor fitness are replaced with robust ‘competitive krill’ to accelerate global convergence. Then, the experimental results from CEC2017 benchmark functions demonstrate that, compared with other algorithms, CCKH shows superiority in most cases. Finally, six structural optimizations are used to evaluate the robustness of CCKH compared with other techniques.

Gradient descent optimization, however, tends to get stuck in local minima if the optimization problem is non-convex. In this article, an improved approach to shape optimization is proposed that is capable of overcoming local minima. It is motivated by gradient based training methods in machine learning, which involve momentum. Here, the momentum method is derived from the formalism of dissipative Hamiltonian flows, which generalize gradient flows. While gradient descent can be seen as an Euler scheme discretization of the gradient flow, a symplectic Euler scheme is proposed in this article to discretize the Hamiltonian dynamics for the momentum method. To show the efficiency of the method, it is applied to a shape optimization problem involving ceramic components, with reliability, volume and avoidance of construction space constraints as target functions. Construction space constraints lead to manifestly non-convex shape optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves these non-convex problems more efficiently than the traditional gradient descent approach.},

  abstract     = {Group technology is a managerial strategy used to optimize production by reducing setup times, lead times, and work-in-process inventories. Research on flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problems (FSDGSPs) has primarily focused on minimizing makespan and total flow time to improve efficiency. However, the need for energy-efficient scheduling in FSDGSPs remains underexplored despite increasing sustainability concerns. To address this, the energy-efficient flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problem (EEFSDGSP) is introduced. A novel multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique, the artificial neural network-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (ANN-MOGA), is proposed to minimize makespan and energy consumption in EEFSDGSP. ANN-MOGA advances MOO by using a neural network to evaluate fitness and guide selection, reducing computational complexity versus traditional methods like NSGA-II and SPEA2. A post-processing step (PPANNS) further enhances solution diversity and distribution. Results show ANN-MOGA, especially with PPANNS, outperforms NSGA-II and competes effectively with SPEA2 in larger problem instances.},

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of mobile communications, remarkably the fifth generation (5G) and research-stage sixth (6G), highlights the need for numerous heterogeneous base stations to meet high demands. However, the deployment of many base stations entails a high energy cost, which contradicts the concept of green networks promoted by next-generation networks. The Cell Switch-Off (CSO) problem addresses this by aiming to reduce energy consumption in ultra-dense networks without compromising service quality. This article explores the CSO problem from a multi-objective optimization perspective, focusing on how spatial network demand heterogeneity affects the multi-objective landscape of the problem. In addition to deep landscape understanding, it introduces a local search operator designed to exploit these landscape characteristics, improving the multi-objective efficiency of metaheuristics. The results indicate that increasing heterogeneity simplifies the exploration of the problem space, with the operator achieving closer approximations to the Pareto front, particularly in minimizing network power consumption.},

This article introduces a diagnostic benchmarking framework to evaluate MOEAs, comprising (1) flexible MOEA construction software, (2) performance evaluation metrics and (3) real-world applications for benchmarking, reflecting diverse mathematical challenges. Utilizing this framework, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, RVEA, MOEA/D and Borg MOEA were evaluated across four applications with three to ten objectives. Collectively, the four applications capture challenges such as stochastic objectives, severe constraints, nonlinearity and complex Pareto frontiers. The study demonstrates how MOEAs that have shown strong performance on standard test problems can struggle on real-world applications. The benchmarking framework and results have value for enhancing the design and use of MOEAs in real-world applications. Further, the results highlight the need to improve the adaptability and ease-of-use of MOEAs given the often ill-defined nature of real-world problem-solving.},

All of these methods, however, are based on certain regularity assumptions that imply that the solution set of the given MOP forms, at least locally, objects of below a certain dimension. While this is indeed the case for most problems, there exist examples where the Pareto set/front is lower-dimensional, which are called degenerated cases. This article presents and discusses a new predictor step designed for use within multi-objective continuation methods that automatically detects (numerical) degeneration and performs movements in essential directions. Furthermore, this predictor is integrated into the multi-objective continuation method ‘Pareto Tracer’. The effectiveness of this new continuation method is demonstrated on selected benchmark problems, illustrating its capability to handle both degenerated and non-degenerated MOPs efficiently.},

  abstract     = {A multi-objective optimization task is not complete without a decision-making activity before, during, or after Pareto-optimal (PO) solutions are found. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms, proposed in early nineties, are able to find multiple well-diversified near-PO solutions. Recent evolutionary many-objective optimization (EMaO) studies solve problems having more than three conflicting objectives using ideal-point-based reference vectors (RVs) on the objective space to guide the search and find diverse PO solutions for two- to 20-objective problems. In certain nonlinear problems, PO points guided by ideal-point-based RVs are not uniform on the PO front. This has caused EMaO researchers to develop other RVs suitable for finding a better distribution. We further argue that decision-makers (DMs) may want to visualize a well-distributed set of PO solutions on a different decision-making (identifier) space, other than the objective space, convenient to their decision-making preference. This article presents and compares six different identifier spaces, motivated from a decision-making perspective, based on ideal-point RVs, nadir-point RVs, projection RVs, pseudo-weight vectors, angle vectors, and RadViz coordinates. Advantages and disadvantages of these identifier spaces are laid out for optimization and decision-making purposes by implementing each on a suitable EMaO algorithm and applying them to standard test problems. The use of multiple identifier spaces simultaneously on a single EMO simulation is also executed for DMs to have a compromise distribution of PO solutions. The choice of one or more identifier spaces within EMO algorithms allows a generic, flexible and practical for addressing optimization and decision-making tasks together.},

This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers is specially designed to solve optimization problems.

Beginning with an analysis of the limitations of traditional pixel-based material distribution topology optimization methods under continuous variables, a discussion is presented on discrete-variable approaches, which aim to resolve issues such as grey-scale solutions and ‘physical penalties’ of continuous variables. The theoretical foundations and algorithmic development of SAIP are detailed, highlighting that the key feature of SAIP is the use of classic sequential approximate programming while adhering to discrete variables. A major feature of SAIP, the discrete-variable sensitivity called topological derivative-based sensitivity analysis, is studied in depth. The construction of explicit separable integer programming subproblems and the canonical relaxation algorithm are discussed, emphasizing their scalability for large-scale problems. The trust-region approach for discrete variables that can ensure approximation is proposed. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of SAIP across various applications, topology-invariant control problems and multi-physical problems.},

The optimum design of steel framed structures necessitates the selection of steel profiles from the standard list of discrete steel sections and requires the satisfaction of design code provisions. Both mathematical programming and optimality criteria techniques need more capability to produce solution to this type of optimum design problems. Soft computing techniques emerged recently provide solution directly without needing any approximation.
