  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has garnered considerable acclaim within the realm of structural optimization owing to its excellent exploration mechanism. However, the widespread application of RL in this field is limited owing to the excessive number of iterations required to converge and the expensive computational cost it brings. To address these challenges, this article presents a novel RL framework for structural optimization, combining Monte Carlo tree search with the proximal policy optimization method, called LMPOM. The key contributions of LMPOM encompass: (1) an enhanced Monte Carlo tree search strategy for partitioning the hybrid design space; (2) a strategy for adaptively updating surrogate models to reduce simulation costs; and (3) the introduction of a novel termination condition for the RL algorithms. Through tests on three benchmark problems, compared with previous RL algorithms, LMPOM consistently shows fewer iterations and better optimization results.},

Many quantum algorithms, such as the Harrow–Hassidim–Lloyd algorithm and the box algorithm, have been proposed for solving such systems. The focus of this article is on improving the efficiency of the box algorithm. The basic principle behind this algorithm is to transform the linear system into a series of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, which are then solved on annealing machines. The computational efficiency of the box algorithm is entirely determined by the number of iterations, which, in turn, depends on the box contraction ratio, typically set to 0.5. Here, it is shown through theoretical analysis that a contraction ratio of 0.5 is sub-optimal and that a computational speed-up can be achieved with a contraction ratio of 0.2. This is confirmed through numerical experiments where a computational speed-up between 20 % to 60 % is observed when the optimal contraction ratio is used.},

Tuning for the control algorithm is achieved through the application of Harris's hawks optimization. An objective function is designed by imposing constraints on performance metrics such as integral square error, integral absolute error, integral time absolute error, and closed-loop gain, which are then solved using Harris's hawks optimization. Further, the robust behaviour of the system is exhibited using μ -analysis to assess its stability. Simulation studies confirm the control algorithm's effectiveness, showing superior performance in reducing settling-time and minimizing overshoot.

Emphasizing the importance of fatigue life considerations, the research focuses on key components of roller coasters: the wheel assemblies. By integrating stress–life fatigue constraints, such an approach can lead to longer lasting and more efficiently designed roller coaster components. Multiaxial fatigue topology optimization using the method of moving asymptotes gradient-based optimization is examined to address the complex loading experienced by these bogies given a substantial load-time history in the high-cycle fatigue region. Using a validated optimization methodology, this study aims to reduce the bogie volume in selected domains while ensuring structural integrity and potentially extending service life. The optimization process successfully reduces the number of designable elements, resulting in decreased global volume and mass, and the results quantifiably demonstrate the impact of applying high-cycle fatigue constraints on the bogie’s performance.},

To enhance convergence stationarity, the concept of ‘adjacent individuals’ is proposed to control the degree of difference in topology configuration between initial population members and the current optimal. Additionally, adjustments to the sequence-based crossover process ensure compliance with damper quantity constraints. Examples demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent individuals is beneficial to convergence stationarity, and the shape change of the truss increases the mode damping ratio by more than 20%.

Gradient-based methods are common for obtaining optimal configurations; however, they struggle with problems involving numerous local optima and non-differentiable problems, which prevent the derivation of design sensitivity. To address these issues, this study explores the application of the Success History-Based Differential Evolution with Linear Population Size Reduction and Semi-Parameter Adaptation, which is regarded as LSHADE-SPA algorithm, known for its strong search capabilities. Nevertheless, its computational cost makes it impractical for topology optimization, especially as the number of design variables increases. To overcome this challenge, a novel structure representation method utilizing the Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion is constructed. Applying truncated KL expansion instead of conventional density methods to represent structural configurations reduces the number of design variables. This article introduces a differential evolution-based topology optimization method utilizing truncated KL expansion and validates its effectiveness through applications in various structural and fluid problems. The method is particularly suited to highly nonlinear problems, such as negative Poisson's ratio structures and micro-mixer designs. The findings here indicate that differential evolution with truncated KL expansion can serve as an efficient and robust topology optimization method, proving particularly effective for solving optimization problems that are challenging for conventional gradient-based approaches. Notably, the proposed methodology not only delivers superior results but also alleviates computational burdens, thereby advancing the prospects of topology optimization in various engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on optimizing the prediction of discharge coefficient ( C d ) of triangular side orifices (TSO) using a novel stacked model (SM) incorporating five machine learning models (MLMs): Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed as the SM to enhance C d prediction accuracy. The MLMs were developed using 570 experimental datasets, considering five non-dimensional parameters: TSO’s crest height to height ratio ( W *), main channel width to TSO’s base length ( L* ), width to TSO’s height ( H* ), upstream flow depth to TSO height ( Y* ), and upstream Froude number ( F r ). The SM-ANN achieved the best performance with an R² of 0.998 and a root-mean-square-error of 1.85 × 10 −3 , followed by XGBoost and GEP. Sensitivity analysis showed that W * and F r had the greatest effect on C d . A graphical interface was developed for direct C d prediction.},

  abstract     = {Existing non-gradient optimizers often rely on stochastic search strategies, which require a large number of finite element analyses to evaluate the objective function. In this study, a directed evolution-based non-gradient topology optimization method is proposed to reduce the high computational cost. A directed generation strategy of load path components is presented, based on the idea of fixed-point enumeration. This strategy determines the position and direction of components by locating the region with the maximum stress and enumerating samples with different orientations at each iteration step. Then, an element removal criterion is developed to gradually eliminate the redundant elements from the components. Consequently, an adaptive adjustment technique of component size is presented to overcome the numerical instability. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated through numerical examples. The results show that the proposed method can reasonably generate structural load paths with exceptional efficiency compared to existing non-gradient algorithms.},

The feasibility of the model is verified and the effects of the quantities of material types and design subdomains, the Poisson's ratio factor and the multi-material off-angle on topological configuration and compliance are studied. The results indicate that the quantity of material types affects the mechanical properties of the periodic structure, and different microstructure configurations can be obtained under different numbers of design subdomains. The increase in the Poisson's ratio factor and decrease in the off-angle can enhance the effective elastic properties of the microstructure and reduce the compliance. Reasonable values of the Poisson's ratio factor and multi-material off-angle are suggested to be 2–4 and 0–45°.},

To enhance the potential of ship hull optimization, increasing design variable dimensionality is essential, but can cause a significant increase in hydrodynamic simulations. To reduce simulations required for high-dimensional ship hull optimization, a new surrogate method, pointwise weighting prediction variance–high-dimensional model representation (PWPV-HDMR), which uses pointwise weighting prediction variance (PWPV) to aggregate different a priori assumptions, is developed. Moreover, a differential evolution algorithm is used to identify promising hull design parameters, using the PWPV-HDMR model instead of costly simulation as the fitness function. The proposed approach is tested on the hydrostatic resistance optimization of KRISO Container Ship. The results show that PWPV-HDMR outperforms kriging-HDMR, with a better resistance optimization effect, illustrating the effectiveness of the PWPV-HDMR-based global optimization approach in discovering promising ship hull parameters.},

Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, a genetic algorithm enhanced by an improved harmony search genetic algorithm (IHSGA) is utilized. The model and algorithm are evaluated in N City, China. The results highlight the significance of TTR in optimizing MW collection operations. Sensitivity analysis of key parameters validates the model’s robustness. Furthermore, comparative analysis demonstrates the superiority of IHSGA over traditional methods. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating additional costs associated with travel time variability in decision making, and advocate for strategies to mitigate such uncertainties.},

This article introduces an approach called the volume-preserving binary (VPB) filter. This novel sensitivity/density filter, based on a determinant-based matrix approach, efficiently detects grey elements and produces completely binary designs. The VPB filter addresses volume preservation by accurately expressing the volume-preserving condition, i.e. the volume before filtering equals the volume of solid materials after filtering. Comparison with other filtering methods, including the volume-preserving Heaviside filter and the Heaviside projection, illustrates the superior clarity and speed of the VPB filter. It reduces the number of iterations required for topology optimization, from hundreds or thousands to only tens of iterations, making it a promising solution for practical applications where manufacturability and computational efficiency are principal. Examples on compliance optimization, compliant mechanisms and heat conduction demonstrate the VPB filter's effectiveness in providing satisfactory solutions while perfectly preserving the length scale.},

Comparison shows that OPSOA and its incomplete algorithms are better than SOA, indicating that each improvement is effective. By testing the benchmark functions of CEC 2017 and CEC 2022, it is shown that OPSOA has a strong ability to find the optimal solution and is superior to other algorithms in terms of convergence accuracy and search speed. The application of this algorithm in practical engineering problems proves that it has significant advantages in solving complex problems.},

The objective is to reduce the operational costs of an open-pit mining process that uses mobile surface equipment, by allocating resources to activities, providing one or more skills, and considering constraints related to sequence, precedence, resource capacity and use, and operator allocation. To solve the problem, optimization models are proposed, i.e. single-product models with/without operator assignment, and multiproduct models with/without operator assignment. These models contribute towards the body of knowledge on optimization models for resource-constrained project scheduling problems. They were tested with real historical data from a ceramics company, considering different lot sizes and types of products, among other characteristics. The results validate the performance of the proposed models in terms of the quality of the solutions, savings and computational time for agile decision making.},

Determination of the correct size of energy storage devices for wind power plants is complicated. In this study, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed for the best distribution/sizing of wind-generated hybrid storage capacity. Ants’ foraging habits motivate the development of wind turbines with high dependability, high efficiency and low energy storage costs. A study is conducted to confirm the practicality of the proposed method, using real data from a wind power plant to calculate the contrast between wind energy production and load consumption features, to influence the appropriate quantity for energy storage organization. The study demonstrates that the ACO approach provides precise and efficient solutions for determining the optimal energy distribution in wind power plants.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP), as a realistic extension of the classical flow shop scheduling problem, widely exists in real-world industrial production systems. In practice, the fact that machines are unrelated is important and cannot be neglected. This study focuses on the HFSP with unrelated parallel machines (HFSP-UPM) to minimize the makespan. To address this problem, a hybrid representation that combines single-sequence coding and full-sequence coding is developed to search for solution space that is not covered by common encoding methods. An initialization block integrating random heuristic strategies is proposed for improving the quality of the initial sparrow swarm. To improve the diversity of a sparrow swarm further, a perturbation block embedded with a set of historical best positions and an enhancement strategy are developed. A critical set based local search block is designed for high-intensity local exploitation of promising regions when necessary. Several benchmark cases from the literature as well as some randomly generated instances characterized by the distribution of real data from factory studies are employed to participate in the test. The test results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed perturbation block and local search block. Compared to state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, the enhanced sparrow search algorithm (ESSA) demonstrates higher convergence accuracy when handling instances. The value of the gap between a solution found by the ESSA and a feasible solution found by the mixed-integer programming (MIP) model can reach 0.6%.},

The results demonstrate that the hybrid sampling strategy balances the global and local exploration of the design space and provides reasonable training samples, increasing the accuracy of the adaptive kriging model.

The heuristic works by initiating an upper bound on the number of discs, and then reducing the number by removing redundant discs during updates to the disc centres.

Often, the allocated symbols and values are not realistic and conflict occurs as a result of improper assembly function, difficulty in manufacturing, and increased time and production costs. This article proposes a new design methodology. First, the functional behaviour of the assembly is predicted through finite element analysis, and the deformed geometry is expressed as a geometric tolerance zone constraint. Then, the functional assembly requirement is mathematically defined as a fit constraint. Simultaneously, rotational and planar machining constraints are developed. Finally, a combinatorial optimization problem is formulated to minimize the manufacturing cost. For optimal trade-offs, the bacterial foraging algorithm is applied to solve the combinatorial optimization problem; when it is applied to a mounted disc brake assembly, promising results are obtained.},

Simultaneously, refracted opposition-based learning is introduced to improve the algorithm's optimization accuracy and convergence speed. The RQWOA was compared with seven efficient algorithms in experiments on classical test functions and multi-robot path planning cases. The results of these methods were tested statistically.

  abstract     = {The present study introduces a revised version of the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm called Dynamic-GWO, which integrates a dynamic parameter adaptation mechanism for population diversity enhancement. This mechanism implements the real-time adjustment of control parameters throughout the optimization procedure. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated by its consistent performance across a variety of intricate benchmark functions. Further, the suggested approach is employed to determine the eminent filter tap coefficients of the Quadrature-Mirror-Filter (QMF) bank that enables the configuration with filter orders of 120 and 150, which have yet to be achieved using existing methods. The uniqueness of the proposed approach lies in its capability to overcome the inherent difficulties associated with higher-order filter design, including increased filter length and computational complexity. The primary objective function is to minimize the algebraic sum of three types of distortion: pass-band error, excess power of stop-band, and squared error of the overall transfer function at the quadrature frequency ω q = π / 2 , which generally occur in the procedure of Near-Perfect-Reconstruction (NPR) QMF bank design. In addition, the measured maximum reconstruction errors are 1.303 × 10 − 15 , 2.93 × 10 − 16 and 2.18 × 10 − 06 dB, and aliasing distortions are A L = 85.80 , 128.49 and 153.52 dB for filter orders N = 100, 120 and 150, correspondingly. The proposed algorithm yields significant improvements with an 86.68% reduction in the ripple factor and a 10.45% increase in attenuation compared to the baseline GWO for filter order 120, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing filter performance. The observed outcomes indicate that the Dynamic-GWO algorithm consistently surpasses the baseline GWO and other Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIAs) regarding computational ease and convergence speed.},

This study addresses these gaps by employing a linear scheduling method and a multi-mode resource-constrained project model. The decision variables of the model include the construction mode, construction direction, activity priority and global resource amounts, considering linear, bar and block construction scenarios. A hybrid algorithm combining the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III with differential evolution is proposed for model resolution, featuring hierarchical, multi-strategy, adaptive crossover and mutation operators. Sensitivity analysis and case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the model and algorithm. According to the study, the unit cost of resource transfer significantly influences the optimization result more than the unit time; the optimizing cost has an upper bound; and linear projects scheduling optimization with resource transfer are more realistic and provide a better trade-off between time and cost.},

  abstract     = {Research on multi-material topology optimization (MMTO) considering both isotropic and anisotropic materials as candidate materials is limited. Previous studies required researchers to preselect the anisotropic material fibre orientations, which are not subject to change during the optimization. As the preselected orientations cannot change, better MMTO solutions may be overlooked. To address this issue, a novel MMTO algorithm incorporating the anisotropic material fibre orientation as a design variable is proposed, eliminating the need to preselect fibre orientations and leading to better MMTO solutions. A numerical approximation method named the carry-through method is also proposed. This allows the compliance sensitivity over anisotropic material fibre orientation to be calculated without the need for the strain–displacement matrix information, simplifying the MMTO method implementation. Comparative studies on three models demonstrate that the proposed MMTO method outperforms the existing MMTO method, achieving improvements of 7%, 10% and 14% on the objectives in these models.},

This method improves the generalization capacity of the augmented radial basis function at both local and global scales through the application of an anisotropic technique and orthogonal conditions. By using efficient cross-validation, the methodology facilitates the training of the metamodel, enabling it to provide predictive variance essential for constructing an adaptive sampling learning function. A key aspect of this approach is its capability to address the issue of low failure probabilities through dynamic importance sampling, which involves calculating an optimal importance sampling function derived from the current metamodel.

This approach involves a stepwise elimination of elements from the initial structural configuration, under specified conditions such as reciprocating loads, displacement constraints and volume limitations. The primary objective of this optimization is to maximize the structural capacity for energy dissipation. This is achieved by creating a sensitivity analysis based on variations in cumulative plastic strain energy resulting from element deletions. The final optimized topologies exhibit bar structures with exceptional capacity for energy dissipation. These optimized configurations evolve with changes in height–width ratios and axial compression ratios, shifting from structures with uniform energy dissipation to those with a two-level distribution. Furthermore, the orientation of the main bars changes from folded bars on both sides to inclined straight bars, depending on the specific conditions.},

An inexact line search technique based on the Armijo technique is employed to find an appropriate step length. Furthermore, a modified version of the Davidon–Fletcher–Powell (DFP) update formula is developed for the RC. A modified quasi-Newton algorithm is built using descent direction step length, and DFP Hessian update formula. Furthermore, the convergence of the modified quasi-Newton algorithm is also discussed.

First, mass centre and volume are taken as the constraints for structural optimization, and a mathematical model for multi-constrained topology optimization is developed. Secondly, a dimensionality reduction method based on a 3D spatial filter is introduced for the optimization of thin-walled parts. The maximum error between the mass centre of the optimized structure and the target mass centre is only 1.03%, which indicates that the method has high accuracy in mass centre control.

  abstract     = {This work introduces a novel approach for solving open-loop Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) using multiple time grids, sparse discretization and a time scaling transformation. Control Vector Parameterization (CVP) method parameterizes control variables to create a finite-dimensional problem. The Variable Time Nodes Control Vector Parameterization (VTNCVP) discretization strategy allows each control component an independent time grid, offering enhanced input design flexibility and potentially yielding improved outcomes. A novel time scaling technique for OCPs with multiple time grids is presented that is easier to comprehend than existing methods and can circumvent some numerical difficulties. Additionally, Multiple Grid (MG)–Sparse Variable Time Nodes (MG-SVTN) is presented. This novel discretization strategy employs asynchronous switching with user-specified numbers of subdivisions for input controls, potentially yielding comparable objective function values to VTNCVP while reducing the dimensionality of decision variables. Two example problems with path constraints are solved using the methods.},

Considering the dual influence of heuristic factors and pheromone information, the improved ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed. Combined with 37 examples, the improved ant colony optimization algorithm is used to solve the balancing problem of a two-sided straight line and a two-sided U-type assembly line, respectively.

With the objective of minimizing the RCS at the specified incident angles and the constraint of the material usage, the strategy is implemented based on a gradient-based algorithm and the so-called three-field density method.

The proposed mechanism, by leveraging the Boolean nature of the topological variables, attempts to forecast the behaviour of the search algorithm and emphasizes either topology or size actions to reduce the number of ineffective iterations. The importance of this task becomes more evident in further iterations since the optimal (or nearly optimal) structure topology is identified, and improper elimination of any member can result in infeasible mechanisms and lead to a waste of several iterations. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary module, it is integrated with different optimization algorithms to solve distinct size and topology problems.

The pseudo excitation and hybrid expansion methods are adopted to compute the random responses at the specified frequency intervals as the objective functions. The sensitivity analysis is performed through the adjoint vector method. The similarity index is defined to distinguish the various optimal layouts quantitatively. Several numerical examples clearly demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting a remarkable improvement of over 60% in computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is proved that, when subjected to broadband random excitation, the damping materials' temperature- and frequency-dependent properties are critical factors in obtaining accurate vibration responses and desirable optimal layouts. The effects of the layer thicknesses and volume fractions of composite structures on topology optimization are also discussed. The results indicate that both layer thickness and volume fraction can change the mechanical properties of the composite structure and further affect the distribution characteristics of the damping material.},

In this study, a multi-stage constraint programming approach to tackle the mining cut clustering problem through a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed, as well as a geometric propagation heuristic to refine the solution. Unlike previously published studies, this approach optimizes the assignment of blocks to clusters and corrects their boundaries considering the size of the mining equipment.

To achieve successful training of a neural network with a smaller amount of data, it is crucial to use an appropriate weight initialization approach and carefully construct the network architecture to avoid overfitting. This study presents a novel approach to representation learning that uses a contrastive loss with dynamic margin loss function. The approach is specifically designed to capture semantic similarities in rubber material quantities and physical-property recipes. In addition, a novel neural network architecture is proposed that uses latent vectors for assigning initial weights. The proposed approach, validated using data from a rubber manufacturing company, showed a significant improvement of up to 30% in predictive accuracy for physical properties with a restricted amount of data.},

Therefore, a novel improved version called the sine cosine algorithm with peer learning (PLSCA) is proposed in this study. According to the roulette wheel selection method, a peer learning strategy is designed to achieve information exchange between individuals. Then, a control parameter is introduced to control the combination of the peer learning strategy and original position updating equations, and this parameter can be adaptively adjusted by means of the individual evolution. To estimate the search capability of PLSCA, it is compared with six representative SCA methods and several other metaheuristic algorithms on two different kinds of benchmark function. Two chaotic time series problems are used to further evaluate the effectiveness of PLSCA. The results of simulation experiments reveal that PLSCA is a promising method.},

  abstract     = {The growth of renewable wind and solar energy in modern power systems affects the short-term scheduling of hydrothermal power generation. This article presents the optimum day-ahead scheduling of wind–solar–hydrothermal systems with pumped-storage plants (PSPs). To assess the contribution of PSPs in decreasing the generation costs of a renewable integrated power system, a scheduling model is formulated that considers different security constraints. An improved cheetah optimizer (ICO) is implemented on a renewable integrated test power system to solve the short-term optimum wind–solar–pumped-storage plant–hydrothermal scheduling (OWSPHTS) problem, taking into account all thermal, hydraulic and network constraints. Optimum solutions are obtained with different objectives considering renewable uncertainties. The proposed ICO solution method is compared with the similar algorithms in terms of optimal fuel costs, emissions, convergence success rate and computation time. The comparative solutions show that the introduced optimization technique is efficient for solving the real-world OWSPHTS problem.},

In recent years, meshless methods have been used in several engineering fields, showing some advantages compared to mesh-based methods. DMLPG is a truly meshless method, which achieves results with good accuracy and computational efficiency, avoiding the numerical integration of complicated shape functions by adopting low-degree polynomials. In the proposed algorithm, DMLPG is used to obtain smooth nodal displacements, strains and stresses, and gBESO updates the structural geometry based on design sensitivity values of the compliance while it gradually increases the Young's modulus of the material. The optimization problem minimizes the compliance objective function subject to volume constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and validity of the technique.},

To assist solving the original CMaOP, a knowledge expression and transfer strategy is designed to share useful information in the helper population with the task population.

However, certain formulations of CG methods that switch between two or more CG parameters often overlook specific values that could have been integrated. Moreover, the demonstration of the sufficient descent property in these methods usually relies on a strategy that assumes the possible exclusion of certain function values. To alleviate this assumption, this article introduces a structured Liu–Storey spectral CG method. This method extends the formulation of the spectral Fletcher conjugate descent method, enabling it to maintain fast convergence and inherit a good restart property. Therefore, the method ensures that the sufficient descent property holds without additional requirements and converges globally via some standard assumptions. Additionally, the method proves useful in solving robotic and image reconstruction models. Finally, it demonstrates robustness when compared to some standard algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian-based parallel global optimization methods have become increasingly popular for solving black-box functions using parallel resources. When the function exhibits multimodality, it is difficult to identify the global optimum. This article proposes a novel batch selection strategy for parallel global optimization called Sampling–Optimizing–Selecting (SOS) to address this problem. SOS, utilizing minimum energy design, gradient optimization and hypersphere clustering, can adaptively explore multiple local optimal regions of the objective function simultaneously and make full use of parallel resources to obtain the global optimum efficiently. Additionally, the SOS algorithm maintains the sparsity between sample points to a certain extent, which enhances the accuracy of the surrogate model and thus improves the robustness of the optimization effect. Several numerical simulations and optimization experiments involving array decoy jamming are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},

Mixed-model production and distributed production have become the preferred production methods for enterprises. This article studies a distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with a mixed-model assembly line (DHHFSP-MMAL), which consists of manufacturing and assembly stages. The DHHFSP-MMAL is modelled by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Three constructive heuristics and a parallel deep adaptive large neighbourhood search (PDALNS) problem are presented. A constructive heuristic with a group strategy is employed to obtain an initial solution. Several deep destroy-and-repair operators are proposed where problem-specific greedy local search methods are applied. The PDALNS assigns weights to destroy-and-repair operators to guide the selection of operators. The parallel computing technique is introduced to increase the efficiency of training. The experiments demonstrate that the PDALNS algorithm is an efficient and effective algorithm for solving the DHHFSP-MMAL problem.},

Specifically, the Dynamic Aggregate Efficient Global Optimization (DA-EGO) algorithm decomposes the original high-dimensional design space into low-dimensional subspaces for efficient surrogate-based optimization search, and the optimal solutions of subspaces are combined as an elite-point for the global search. Most importantly, the subspace variables are updated in each iteration, according to the variable interaction analyses in the sub- and full-spaces. The perturbation method and the analysis of variance are used to detect variable interactions. After being validated on 21 benchmark functions ranging from 30 to 90 dimensions, the DA-EGO is used for the optimization of a transonic compressor rotor with 28 variables and a multi-stage compressor optimization with 60 variables. With the above, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is well demonstrated.},

In the cooperative strategy, a crossover operator is established between the ‘best krill’ and ‘food’ to generate ‘cooperative krill’, which facilitates a balance between global exploration and local exploitation. In the competitive strategy, krill individuals with poor fitness are replaced with robust ‘competitive krill’ to accelerate global convergence. Then, the experimental results from CEC2017 benchmark functions demonstrate that, compared with other algorithms, CCKH shows superiority in most cases. Finally, six structural optimizations are used to evaluate the robustness of CCKH compared with other techniques. It is found that as the complexity of the structure increases, the competitiveness of CCKH becomes more pronounced, and the time complexity of the presented method is not affected by the two strategies.},

To address this challenge, a novel method called circulatory system-based optimization (CSBO) is proposed, which minimizes the need for algorithm-specific parameters and achieves optimal designs across WDNs of various scale. The impact of a dynamic penalty function tailored to pressure constraints on the optimal design is also investigated.

It is based on the idea of adaptive surrogate model-based optimization substituting the tolerance analysis subroutine with a surrogate model, which is iteratively re-modelled with intermediate optimization results to improve its accuracy continuously in potential optima regions. On the one hand, a directed intensification of promising solutions and, on the other hand, an accelerated exploration of the search space is achieved.

In the past, gradient based optimization methods using the elegant adjoint formalism dominated the field. Gradient descent optimization, however, tends to get stuck in local minima if the optimization problem is non-convex. In this article, an improved approach to shape optimization is proposed that is capable of overcoming local minima. It is motivated by gradient based training methods in machine learning, which involve momentum. Here, the momentum method is derived from the formalism of dissipative Hamiltonian flows, which generalize gradient flows. While gradient descent can be seen as an Euler scheme discretization of the gradient flow, a symplectic Euler scheme is proposed in this article to discretize the Hamiltonian dynamics for the momentum method. To show the efficiency of the method, it is applied to a shape optimization problem involving ceramic components, with reliability, volume and avoidance of construction space constraints as target functions. Construction space constraints lead to manifestly non-convex shape optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves these non-convex problems more efficiently than the traditional gradient descent approach.},

This article presents and discusses a new predictor step designed for use within multi-objective continuation methods that automatically detects (numerical) degeneration and performs movements in essential directions. Furthermore, this predictor is integrated into the multi-objective continuation method ‘Pareto Tracer’. The effectiveness of this new continuation method is demonstrated on selected benchmark problems, illustrating its capability to handle both degenerated and non-degenerated MOPs efficiently.},

  abstract     = {A multi-objective optimization task is not complete without a decision-making activity before, during, or after Pareto-optimal (PO) solutions are found. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms, proposed in early nineties, are able to find multiple well-diversified near-PO solutions. Recent evolutionary many-objective optimization (EMaO) studies solve problems having more than three conflicting objectives using ideal-point-based reference vectors (RVs) on the objective space to guide the search and find diverse PO solutions for two- to 20-objective problems. In certain nonlinear problems, PO points guided by ideal-point-based RVs are not uniform on the PO front. This has caused EMaO researchers to develop other RVs suitable for finding a better distribution. We further argue that decision-makers (DMs) may want to visualize a well-distributed set of PO solutions on a different decision-making (identifier) space, other than the objective space, convenient to their decision-making preference. This article presents and compares six different identifier spaces, motivated from a decision-making perspective, based on ideal-point RVs, nadir-point RVs, projection RVs, pseudo-weight vectors, angle vectors, and RadViz coordinates. Advantages and disadvantages of these identifier spaces are laid out for optimization and decision-making purposes by implementing each on a suitable EMaO algorithm and applying them to standard test problems. The use of multiple identifier spaces simultaneously on a single EMO simulation is also executed for DMs to have a compromise distribution of PO solutions. The choice of one or more identifier spaces within EMO algorithms allows a generic, flexible and practical for addressing optimization and decision-making tasks together.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to do computation with a potential advantage over classical computers. Though a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, performing computations apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers is specially designed to solve optimization problems. This article provides an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view. It introduces the reader to the use of quantum annealers and quantum gate–based machines to solve optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {This article reviews the development of discrete-variable topology optimization using sequential approximate integer programming (SAIP). Beginning with an analysis of the limitations of traditional pixel-based material distribution topology optimization methods under continuous variables, a discussion is presented on discrete-variable approaches, which aim to resolve issues such as grey-scale solutions and ‘physical penalties’ of continuous variables. The theoretical foundations and algorithmic development of SAIP are detailed, highlighting that the key feature of SAIP is the use of classic sequential approximate programming while adhering to discrete variables. A major feature of SAIP, the discrete-variable sensitivity called topological derivative-based sensitivity analysis, is studied in depth. The construction of explicit separable integer programming subproblems and the canonical relaxation algorithm are discussed, emphasizing their scalability for large-scale problems. The trust-region approach for discrete variables that can ensure approximation is proposed. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of SAIP across various applications, topology-invariant control problems and multi-physical problems.},

The paper initially describes the mathematical formulation of a simple truss structural design problem. The early optimum design algorithms that were based on mathematical programming techniques where the design variables are assumed to be continuous are reviewed. The optimum design of steel framed structures necessitates the selection of steel profiles from the standard list of discrete steel sections and requires the satisfaction of design code provisions. Both mathematical programming and optimality criteria techniques need more capability to produce solution to this type of optimum design problems. Soft computing techniques emerged recently provide solution directly without needing any approximation. These techniques are classified and reviewed and their use in obtaining the optimum solution of actual industrial steel design applications is given.},

Data were collected from the Scopus database, resulting in a total of 465 publications. An integrated method of systematic review was used to review and validate the GSCP optimization techniques. Hence, assessments of multi-objective optimization and uncertainty are pivotal for enhancing GSCP. The challenges posed by GSCP underscore the need to use heuristic algorithms, mixed integer programming, goal programming, stochastic programming and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II in practical applications.
