  abstract     = {The intricacy of the underwater setting makes it difficult for optical lenses to capture clear underwater photos without haze and colour distortion. Some studies use domain adaptation and transfer learning to address this issue, they aim to reduce the latent mismatch between composition and real-world data, making the space of latent data difficult to read and impractical to control. The background light is a crucial component of the decaying paradigm that directly impacts how well images are enhanced. Thus, to improve the quality of the images over the underwater, new deep-learning techniques are being designed in this paper. Here, the Adaptive Trans-ResUnet++ with Attention Mechanism-based model performs the real-time underwater image enhancement process. In addition, a novel Random Enhanced Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer algorithm model is used for optimising the parameters over the given model to further enhance the given model’s performance. A diverse quantitative and qualitative validation is also carried out to learn the enhancement of underwater image quality. The enhanced underwater image may be also useful in the underwater object detection process. Thus, the enhanced images obtained from the developed model are compared with the existing techniques to confirm the efficacy of the suggested underwater image enhancement process.},

  abstract     = {Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) plays a significant role in identifying the similarity of images with large datasets. It is identified based on the size, colour, and texture features of the image. But in such conditions, it is complex to determine the features of query images in large datasets and does not show accurate similarity when compared with every image in the retrieval process. In order to perform an efficient similarity of images, a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach Kernelized Radial Basis Auto-Encoder Function Neural Network (Ker_RadBAEFNN) technique is proposed that performs the individual image classification in the retrieval process. Moreover, the neural networks are optimised based on the reinforcement process and perform the extraction process regarding individual images. Further,reinforcement-based optimisation estimates the images in neural networks for undertaking an automatic feature extraction of query images. The performance of the classification process is validated based on MNIST, METU, and COCO datasets that determined the efficiency of the recognition and classification process of image retrieval. The experimental analysis is carried out based on various measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and MAPE for the proposed and existing GLCM-ABC, PSO-ANN, IRB-CNN, FAGWO, and OCAM methods. The analysis shows that the performance of the proposed attained better effectiveness with attained accuracy by 98% and diminished for state-of-the-art techniques as 92%, 95%, 94%, 96.8%, as well as 96%, respectively. Compared to existing methods, the accuracy rate of the proposed method is maximised by 1.3%.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection plays an essential role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets where the dimensionality of features presents significant challenges. This research presents a novel approach to feature selection, a critical aspect of enhancing machine learning model efficiency, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets. By integrating the Flamingo Search Algorithm (FSA), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), and Regularised Extreme Learning Machine (RELM), the proposed method addresses limitations in existing feature selection and multi-objective optimisation algorithms. Leveraging FSA’s emulation of flamingo behaviours, the approach achieves a balance between global exploration and local exploitation, mitigating issues like premature convergence and local optima. Integration with NSGA-III enhances multi-objective optimisation capabilities, maintaining a delicate equilibrium between convergence and diversity. FSA-RELM is employed for accurate feature assessment, given its rapid learning and suitability for large datasets with multiple labels. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority in feature selection accuracy, classification performance, and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches. This research contributes to advancing feature selection methodologies, offering a comprehensive solution for high-dimensional datasets in machine learning and data mining applications.},

In this paper we analyse both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams in a variation of sociality regimes in the predator-prey game, using a novel normalisation of the weights so that the sum of all rewards is independent of the sociality regime. We find that the selfish regime is advantageous for both predator and prey teams, and for both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. In particular, rewards are about 100% higher for the predator team when switching from the egalitarian to selfish regime and more than 400% higher from the altruistic regime. For the prey, the increase is around 40% and 100% respectively. The results are similar for homogeneous and heterogeneous situations. The takeaway message is that any study of homogeneous and heterogeneous cooperative-competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning teams should also take into account the sociality regimes before making conclusions on the preference of any algorithm.},

It suggests only the short way and doesn’t include any safety information, such as crime awareness, road availability. This paper describes an inventive ideology to discover the safest route with minimal risk score for security of the road travellers. Hence, a new safety route navigation mechanism is developed to solve the challenges in the traditional route discovery approaches using deep learning. In the developed route discovery mechanism, the examination of the safest roads is done by the developed deep learning network, where the network is trained with the inputs obtained from the roads, such as road surface conditions, Road users, weather conditions, traffic conditions, accidental cases, and crime areas. The availability of the safest route will be determined by the ‘Long Short-Term Memory with Attention Mechanism’ (LSTM-AM). The route discovery is done with the help of a developed ‘Fitness-based Golden Tortoise Beetle Optimizer’ (FGTBO) with multi-objective constraints like distance, time, and road availability. The implementation outcome of the developed route discovery scheme will be validated with the traditional route discovery approaches concerning various measures.},

The proposed work contains four phases: IoT phase, data preprocessing phase, context-aware phase and decision-making phase. In internet of things (IoT) phase, the sensor nodes are used for identifying the health status. Then, the amassed data are stored in storage layer. Hence, in the data preprocessing phase, the data redundancy, recurrence/repetition data are deleted. In context-aware phase, the preprocessed information is presented in the cloud and fog layer. As a result, the context-aware phase minimises the search space activities. In decision-making phase, the data are extracted and given to the ANGNN for classifying as normal and critical condition. Then Archimedes optimisation algorithm is utilised to acquire the better solution. The acquired outcomes of the proposed technique are analysed with existing models. Finally, the proposed method attains 2.37%, 2.95% and 1.17% higher accuracy, 1.09%, 1.47% and 1.53% higher sensitivity, 1.17%, 0.73% and 1.22% higher specificity compared with existing methods.},

Efficient performance prediction can significantly improve instructional effectiveness, facilitate personalised learning, and identify at-risk students. While researchers have analysed the complex relationships between students’ daily behaviours and their academic performance, most studies focus solely on individual student models and disregard potential relationships among students. To address these issues, we propose an improved multi-view hypergraph neural network (IMHNN). IMHNN employs hypergraphs to establish high-order relationships between student behaviours and introduces an attentional convolutional network to adaptively obtain weights for different behaviours. Additionally, a residual network is introduced to mitigate transition smoothing and improve the generalisation performance of the model. Using a genuine education dataset, we compare the performance of various approaches, demonstrating that our method outperforms other existing methods.},

Classification and segregation of solid waste prior to reuse, recycle or recover is an important step towards sustainable waste management. Traditional manual sorting of solid waste is a labour-intensive process that may pose health risks to the workers. Currently, automated classification of solid waste using machine learning techniques is widely applied. This study aims to develop an automated waste classification model by testing traditional and deep machine learning models. To achieve that, both open and generated datasets were used in the model training and testing. The study results showed relatively low prediction capability of the traditional machine learning models like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as compared to the deep machine learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The testing of the three models on a combined data set of Trashnet with local garbage data set resulted in accuracy of 62.5% for SVM, 72.0% for RF and 92.7% for CNN. JONET deep learning model has been developed using a combination of pre-trained base model (DenseNet 201) with a new architicture that contains a fully connected layer in the classification stage with 1024 neurons. The model is capable to identify six classes of solid waste items with various accuracies. When tested on the Trashnet dataset, the accuracy was 96.06%, while testing on the local garbage dataset gave an accuracy of 94.40%. JONET has been tested also on multi object images which gave an acceptable prediction accuracy.},

The early rule-based systems using handcrafted expertise gave way to statistical learning techniques and neural networks trained on large datasets. Milestones like AlexNet and AlphaGo established deep learning as a dominant AI approach. Transfer learning enabled models pre-trained on diverse corpora to excel at specialised downstream tasks. The scope of AI expanded from niche applications like playing chess to multifaceted capabilities in computer vision, natural language processing and dialogue agents. However, current AI still needs to catch up to human intelligence in aspects like reasoning, creativity, and empathy. Addressing limitations around real-world knowledge, biases, and transparency remains vital for further progress and aligning AI with human values.

Correlation coefficients are critical tools for evaluating such information, especially in medical areas and clustering analysis, where the relationship between objects in the given data is required. Despite the importance of this subject, there is only one approach in the literature regarding the correlation coefficients of IMSs and existing coefficients have certain disadvantages. In this paper, we propose a parametric generalisation of these correlation coefficients on IMSs and apply them to medical diagnosis, taxonomy, and clustering. To that end, some disadvantages of existing correlation coefficients are listed first. Then, with some theoretical work, we derive a parametric generalisation of these coefficients and their weighted forms. To better illustrate how the parametric generalisation of correlation coefficients improves the results, numerical parametric solutions of existing examples are presented with detailed comparisons. Moreover, a novel algorithm is introduced for clustering using proposed correlation coefficients in IMSs. Finally, three real-life examples are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generalised correlation coefficients and the clustering algorithm in specific applications.},

  abstract     = {This research provides a method that accelerates learning and avoids local minima to improve the policy gradient algorithm’s learning process. Reinforcement learning has the advantage of not requiring a model. Consequently, it can improve control performance, mainly when a model is generally unavailable, such as when an error occurs. The proposed method efficiently and expeditiously investigates the action space. First, it quantifies the resemblance between agents’ and traditional controllers’ actions. Then, the principal reward function is modified to reflect this similarity. This reward-shaping mechanism guides the agent to maximize its return via an attractive force during the gradient ascent. To validate our concept, we establish a satellite attitude control environment with a similarity subsystem. The outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Anaemia is a common disease that affects billions of people worldwide and is caused due to low blood haemoglobin level. According to WHO statistics, anaemia is the most prevalent in developing and underdeveloped countries. Conventional invasive methods are prohibitively expensive and difficult to administer globally, necessitating a non-invasive, low-cost, and user-friendly solution. This study aims to develop a non-invasive anaemia detection system by combining cutting-edge computational approaches with the age-old practice of estimating blood haemoglobin levels by observing pallor in the palm. The proposed system operates on the basis of inducing changes in palm pallor with appropriate pressure application and release, measuring the rate of colour changes, and performing time-domain analysis to correlate with blood haemoglobin concentration. The video of colour changes in the palm caused by a customised device is captured using a smartphone camera and processed and analysed using deep learning models based on tree-structured 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for accurate estimation of haemoglobin levels. The proposed system ensures a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and RMSE of 96.87%, 90.90%, 94.44% and 0.495, respectively, while run on a dataset consisting of palm pallor video samples of 531 individuals.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comparative effectiveness analysis of fuzzy and non-fuzzy association rule mining (ARM). The corresponding motivation is the lack of relevant papers devoted to the effectiveness comparison between fuzzy and non-fuzzy ARM. The current research applies the results of fuzzy/non-fuzzy ARM to associative classification and uses the classification accuracy of the corresponding classifiers as the effectiveness measure. The research demonstrates that basic effectiveness comparison between fuzzy and non-fuzzy ARM does not necessarily speak in favour of fuzzy ARM. However, then the research demonstrates that fuzzy ARM has a distinctive ability to handle data inconsistencies, which results in the ability of corresponding fuzzy classifiers to not only provide class predictions but also indicate their certainty in the provided output. The research reveals some distinct correlation between classification accuracy and the degree of certainty in fuzzy associative classification: the greater certainty nearly always results in the better classification accuracy. This ability of fuzzy associative classifiers to indicate their certainty in the performed classification and the corresponding ability of fuzzy ARM to handle data inconsistencies are not applicable in non-fuzzy associative classifiers and ARM. Therefore, these abilities are used in the paper to substantiate the relevance of applying fuzzy logic in ARM.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, skin cancer has been the most dangerous disease noticed among people worldwide. Skin cancer should be identified earlier to reduce the rate of mortality. Employing dermoscopic images can identify and categorise skin cancer effectively. But, the visual evaluation is a complex procedure to be done in the dermoscopic image. However, Deep learning (DL) is an efficient method for skin cancer detection; however, segmenting the skin lesion and automatic localisation in an earlier stage is complicated. In this paper, a novel Ladybug Beetle Optimization-Double Attention Based Multilevel 1-D CNN (LBO-DAM 1-D CNN) technique is proposed to detect and classify skin cancer. To improve skin lesion type discriminability, the two types of attention modules are introduced. The Ultra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Module (ULSAM) is utilised for classifying the feature maps into different stages to validate the frequency from different image samples. However, the multilayer perceptron attention module (MLPAM) is determined to provide information regarding skin cancer classification and diminish the noise and unwanted data. To minimise data loss, it is then combined with hierarchical complementarity during classification. Second, a modified MLPAM is used to extract significant feature spaces for network learning, select the most important information, and reduce feature space redundancy. The Ladybug Beetle Optimization (LBO) algorithm provides the optimal classification solution by minimising the loss rate of DAM 1-D CNN architecture. The experimentation is conducted on three different datasets such as ISIC2020, HAM10000, and the melanoma detection dataset. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method is compared with different existing methods such as IMFO-KELM, Mask RCNN, M-SVM, DCNN-9, and TL-CNN with different datasets. These methods attained 94.56, 92.65, 90.56, 88.65, and 95.5 for the ISIC2020 dataset but the proposed method enhanced the classification performance by attaining 97.02. Also, the validation is based on metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score of 97.03%, 97.05%, 97.58%, and 97.27% for a total of 500 epochs.},

  abstract     = {An innovative approach is needed for the early identification of GC (Gastric cancer) to improve the prediction of GC patients. This work presents a GC prediction system to identify GC depending on saliva data samples. The diagnosis of GC at an early stage will improve the survival rate. At first, Raman data of saliva samples are collected and pre-processed. Afterwards, efficient Raman spectral features are extracted from the pre-processed data. Then, the feature selection process is performed with a Levy search updated rainfall (LURF) optimisation approach. This optimisation scheme decreases the dimensionality of the features by integrating Levy’s flight and rainfall optimisation. Finally, the hybrid deep dual-stage bidirectional long short-term memory (Hybrid LURF) framework effectively classifies the data as normal or abnormal. This model efficiently addresses the issues of insufficient long-term dependency in GC prediction and also enhances the classification performance. The validation of the proposed approach is examined with various existing schemes and achieved better accuracy (98.5%), specificity (97%), sensitivity (96.5%), F1-score (93%), detection rate (98.4%) and ROC curve. Further, the accuracy is 0.06% better than multi-layer ANN and 10% better than SVM-polynomial and KNN models.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, EEG-based emotion recognition has gained significant attention in affective computing. One of the major challenges in designing an efficient EEG-based emotion-recognition framework lies in handling the high dimensionality of the data recorded from a large number of EEG electrodes. This paper develops a hybrid sequential forward channel selection (HSFCSER) based emotion-recognition method, which aims to identify the most relevant subset of EEG channels and thus reduces the dimensionality of data. In HSFCSER, the Fisher score is used as the filter method, and the wrapper method includes Support Vector Machine (SVM). Wavelet-based features are extracted from the selected optimal EEG channels, followed by the feature selection using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on the DEAP database. The methodology identifies 1) two classes of emotions viz. Low/High Valence with an average accuracy of 91.25 ± 5.48% for subject-dependent and 89.38 ± 4.76% for subject-independent, and Low/High Arousal with an average accuracy of 89.92 ± 5.81% for subject-dependent and 86.32 ± 5.34% for subject-independent, and 2) four classes of emotions viz. High Valence-Low Arousal (HVLA), High Valence-High Arousal, Low Valence-Low Arousal, and Low Valence-High Arousal with 75.94 ± 11.07% for subject-dependent and 73.13 ± 8.17% for subject-independent. The efficient electrode positions for emotion recognition are also depicted. The reported results are better compared to the existing results in the literature.

  abstract     = {Dementia is a degenerative brain disorder that makes diagnosis difficult, largely because of its wide range of symptoms and complexities. Identifying the condition early is vital for effective treatment, but existing diagnostic approaches frequently fail to detect the early signs of the disease. This research proposes a novel hybrid computational model Dual-Swarm Optimisation with Opposition-Based Learning (DSO-OBL) to improve the accuracy and reliability of dementia diagnosis. The DSO-OBL integrates Convolutional Neural Networks for spatial feature extraction from neuroimaging data, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in sequential clinical assessments. The position update mechanism in the DSO-OBL model combines elements from the Grey Wolf Optimiser (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), integrating the leadership-based hierarchy of GWO with the velocity update mechanism of PSO. This approach allows for more precise adjustments in the position of candidate solutions, optimising both the hyperparameters and the weights of the neural networks used in the diagnosis model. Through extensive experimentation of the benchmark neuroimaging dataset, the DSO-OBL model demonstrated a superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98.7% in identifying dementia-related patterns. The DSO-OBL model marks a major advancement in computational neuroscience and medical diagnostics.},

The process of routing is made using the CrowWhale optimisation algorithm that enables to transfer the data packets from IoT nodes to BS. In the sewage water management system, entering sewage water into fresh water is detected by DRN which is trained using an optimisation algorithm.

Unfortunately, this property also poses the problem that data points with measurement errors can be approximated too well and unknown parameter subspaces in the estimation can deviate far from the actual value (so-called overfitting). Various developed methods aim to reduce overfitting through modifications in several areas of the training. In this work, we pursue the question of how an NN behaves in training with respect to overfitting when linear and nonlinear transfer functions (TF) are alternated in different hidden layers (HL). The presented approach is applied to a generated dataset and contrasted to established methods from the literature, both individually and in combination. Comparable results are obtained, whereby the common use of purely nonlinear transfer functions proves to be not recommended generally.},

Firstly, the current application status of social robots is studied. Then, the capability trust problem of social robots is studied according to the existing problems and phenomena. Students from a municipal experimental middle school are selected for a questionnaire survey, and the anthropomorphism of social robots is taken as the independent variable. The role of social robots with different anthropomorphic degrees on students’ initial capability trust and the mediating role of attraction perception are studied. A research model is established, and SPSS 26.0 is used to further analyse the data. The results show that among the students with a low degree of an anthropomorphic social robot, the average score of anthropomorphism is 2.52, the average score of attraction perception is 3.29, and the score of capability trust is 3.64, which is the upper-middle level. There are significant differences in the initial capability trust evaluation of social robots among students of different ages (F = 38.13, P = 0.00). When the degree of anthropomorphism of social robots is at different levels, there are significant differences in students’ initial capability trust evaluation (F = 34.25, P = 0.00). It can be seen that the degree of anthropomorphism of social robots has an impact on students’ initial capability trust.},

  abstract     = {A familiar nervous system disorder characterised by seizures is called as Epilepsy. It is indeed hard to control the suitable type as an outcome of insufficient EEG information. In order to overcome these issues, a Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN)-based classifier is proposed to recognise if the patients are affected by epileptic disease or not. EEG signal is a contribution, and the input signal is preprocessed using antialiasing filter, finite impulse response, and band pass filter to eradicate unwanted noise present in the signal. After preprocessing, the features extracting process is done, and four extraction techniques are proposed in order to calculate the feature coefficient. The feature extraction outcome is fed into the MLNN classifier to predict the disease. MLNN performs with Coot-Optimization to reduce error and increase prediction accuracy. The future ideal applied in Matlab-software carried out numerous act metrics, and these parameters attained better performance such as accuracy of 96.5%, error of 0.03, precision of 98%, specificity is 97%, sensitivity is 95%, and so on. This displays the effectiveness of the future ideal than existing approaches such as ANN, SVM, KNN and NB. Based on this proposed classification, the epileptic disease prediction can be improved on this technique and can provide a living standard for patients.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep neural networks have been adopted in many application domains showing impressive performances that sometimes even exceed those of humans. However, the considerable size of deep learning models and their computational cost limits their use in mobile and embedded systems. Pruning is an important technique that has been used in the literature to compress a trained model by removing some of its elements (weights, neurons, filters, etc.) that do not notably contribute to its performance. In this paper, we propose a new block pruning method for residual networks that removes holes layers of the network based on the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework. The proposed method takes advantage of the existence of multiple trainable paths in residual models to identify and prune the less important residual blocks for inference. To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using three different MAB algorithms, namely ε -greedy, Win Stay Lose Shift (WSLS), and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). The obtained results on different datasets show that our block pruning method can considerably reduce the model size and FLOPs with little to no impact on overall accuracy. We conducted a comparative analysis of our method with three existing techniques to demonstrate that our approach is highly competitive in terms of accuracy, while significantly reducing both model size and FLOPs. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that when our block pruning method is combined with a filter-level pruning technique, it leads to even greater reductions in model size and FLOPs while maintaining a relatively high accuracy.},

To facilitate face anti-spoofing research, this paper introduces a novel method in which a simple model provides enhanced performance on the RGB modality images of the CASIA-SURF dataset. Initially, a simple model based on ResNet-50 architecture is proposed that uses three residual layers of ResNet-50 along with a single neuron at the end for binary classification. Meanwhile, to judge the baseline performance, the proposed Resnet-50-based model is trained on the RGB and Depth images, separately. Later, to increase the performance of the proposed ResNet-50-based model on the RGB modality images, a novel Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) algorithm is applied. The LUPI contains Depth images and helps to train the inferior model with the help of a pre-trained superior model. Detailed simulations on the CASIA-SURF dataset reveal that an intelligent combination of the ResNet50 based model with the LUPI paradigm works exceptionally well and significantly improves the performance on the RGB modality of the images. The proposed model is less complex and can be deployed in resource-constrained environments.},

The main aim of this modification is to provide a new algorithm for tuning the parameters of controllers. Conventionally, invasive weed optimisation algorithms (IWO) have been utilised in the literature to solve optimisation problems. The IWO has merits, namely fast convergence and high extraction capability. However, the IWO suffers from a lack of population diversity and poor exploration. Two novel improvements are proposed here to eliminate these disadvantages, based on utilising chaotic behaviours in the population generation and in the standard deviation update rule. The final proposed mechanism is applied to tune the parameters of a PID controller and solve several benchmark optimisation problems. Simulation analysis compares the performance of the proposed method with a recent similar approach. The simulation results validate the high performance of the proposed novel cascade chaotic scheme.},

Several existing methods on municipal solid waste prediction were suggested previously, but those methods do not accurately predict the solid waste, and also it takes high computation time. To overwhelm these issues, Municipal Solid Waste Prediction using Tree Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Network optimised with Balancing Composite Motion Optimization algorithm (MSWP-THDCNN-BCMOA) is proposed for municipal solid waste prediction. Initially, real-time solid waste prediction data is taken from Quantity of MCC, Landfill, Gardan Garbage and Coconut Shell Report in Tamil Nadu (Chennai), such as Zone-9 (Nungambakkam), Zone 10 (Kodambakkam) and Zone 13 (Adyar). Then the collected solid waste data are pre-processed using morphological filtering and extended empirical wavelet transformation. Then the pre-processed data are given to THDCNN-BCMOA algorithm, which accurately predicts the solid waste as wet waste, dry waste, horticulture waste, and dumping yard for 2025–2035 years. The proposed MSWP-THDCNN-BCMOA method is implemented in Python. Then the proposed MSWP-THDCNN-BCMOA method attains 17.91%, 28.30%, 5.63% and 13.54% higher accuracy, 98.66%, 99.13%, 96.43% and 98.31% lower error rate, 53.003%, 48.44%, 25.69% and 42.42% lower computation time compared with existing methods.},

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a promising method for solving high-dimensional DEs. Due to the universal approximation capability of neural networks, there is no doubt that studies in this field will continue to grow in the near future. However, there is a need to understand the best-performing neural network architectures and algorithms that demonstrated their effectiveness and ability over traditional algorithms for solving various types of high-dimensional DEs. In this survey, we provide a review of deep learning algorithms classified as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) for solutions of DEs, that have been published in the last decade (between 2011 and 2022). The key purpose of this study is to explore the research papers published in the area of numerical solutions of DEs in order to get a deeper understanding of the current situation.},

If the diseases are identified in the earlier stage, then it will be easy to apply pesticides and prevent the disease from further propagation. To recognise these diseases at earlier stages automatically, different researchers have established artificial intelligence-based approaches using machine learning and deep learning approaches which can identify the diseased lesions with high accuracy. In this paper, a novel Hybrid Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm-butterfly optimisation algorithm (HMFO-BOA) based optimal ensemble deep transfer network (OEDTN) classifier for banana leaf disease identification is developed. The OEDTN architecture offers increased predictability for banana leaf disease using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ensemble learning, domain adaptation, and parameter transfer learning. The feature extraction is done by constructing different Deep Transfer Networks (DTN) via diverse kernel MMD. Finally, the DTNs are integrated via ensemble learning to obtain the final classification outcomes. The MFOBOA algorithm assigns optimal voting weights for each DTN to dynamically construct the OEDTN architecture. In the consequent testing process, the input banana leaf disease images are categorised into diverse classes such as BBW (Banana Bacterial Wilt Disease), BBS (Banana Black Sigatoka Disease), Cordana, pestalotiopsis, Sigatoka, and healthy. The experiments conducted on the Banana Leaf and BBW-BBS datasets prove that the proposed model offers improved performance than the state-of-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {Many actual images contain partial body camera shots, in which a significant part of the body is not visible. This issue is especially prevalent in film images, where less than 10% are full-body shots. Most 2D human pose estimation methods return incomplete poses when applied to partial body images. This lack of completeness becomes a problem in some situations, for example, when the 2D pose is converted to a 3D pose by a two-stage 3D human pose estimation method since most of these methods require a complete pose to work. This article proposes a new technique, called CompletePose, consisting of completing the missing keypoints when 2D human pose estimation methods are applied to images with partial body camera shots. A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network is used to obtain a complete and plausible pose, realistic enough to predict a 3D pose with a two-stage 3D human pose estimation method. A complete empirical validation has been carried out with the Human3.6 M dataset and a new dataset, called CHARADE, specially built and made public for reproducibility and benchmarking for this research. Quantitative evaluation employing the Fréchet distance shows that the approach manages to approximate the actual data distribution. The qualitative evaluation shows that the completed poses enable obtaining plausible 3D poses from images previously intractable.},

To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper, we determine a new metric for Pythagorean fuzzy sets using the assistance of the K–L divergence measure. Many mathematical properties of the introduced measure are discussed. Furthermore, geometrical representation is provided. A comparative study of the proposed and existing distance measures is carried out to establish the superiority of the new measure.

  abstract     = {If episodic memory is constructive, experienced time is also a construct. We develop an event-based formalism that replaces the traditional objective, agent-independent notion of time with a constructive, agent-dependent notion of time. We show how to make this agent-dependent time entropic and hence well-defined. We use sheaf-theoretic techniques to render agent-dependent time functorial and to construct episodic memories as sequences of observed and constructed events with well-defined limits that maximise the consistency of categorisations assigned to objects appearing in memories. We then develop a condensed formalism that represents episodic memories as pure constructs from single events. We formulate an empirical hypothesis that human episodic memory implements a particular time-symmetric constructive functor, and discuss possible experimental tests.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, real-time object detection, which is a crucial task, is being performed through image processing and deep learning techniques. As there are several high-performance computing edge devices available, selecting the best-fit device for a particular problem is a tough task and keeping in mind the cost, performance, and weight of the device in mind. One faces several challenges while performing this task in real-time such as a lack of resources in terms of power and mobility. We have provided an insight into the computation power of devices in terms of Frames per Second (FPS) by deploying object detection models on them. This paper will provide insight into selecting the appropriate combination of device and object detection models for real-time applications. Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3), Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4), Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2), and Nvidia Jetson NANO are popular devices with high computation power used for real-time applications. The memory constraints of devices along with the deployment of different You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Single-Shot Detector (SSD) are the two object detection models that have been explained in this paper. A deep learning inference optimiser, TensorRT, has been used in NANO to achieve high throughput in the performance of object detection. The precision, recall, and F1 score achieved on deploying each tested model have been presented. After observing the devices during experimentation, RPi4+NCS2 showed the best execution with the blend of factors i.e. speed, portability, and user-friendliness.},

Hence, in the proposed work, the system offers a novel hybrid optimisation approach for identifying the top influential nodes based on community structure, which improves the diffusion of influence in social networks. In this, the improved wild horse genetic algorithm-based optimisation (IWHGAO) is proposed to detect the community in the social network. The proposed IWHGAO has the balanced intensification and diversification capability that provides the optimal solution for detecting the community, and the fast convergence of the algorithm ensures a minimal execution time. Then, the candidate community and node selection are performed before the seed selection using the proposed hybrid k-shell honey decomposition. Python software is used to implement the suggested model for analysing the performance in terms of influence, execution time, accuracy, spread size, and gNMI value of the proposed method.},

Research has recently shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate extraordinary performance for various HC applications. However, recently different metaheuristic-based optimisation algorithms have been developed to improve AI-based HC techniques’ performance. Therefore, this review discusses different HC models that leverage the benefits of metaheuristic algorithms to achieve better performance. The major goal of this review is to support the researchers seeking a better reference to develop secure and smarter metaheuristic-based HC models. These models are efficient in reducing system complexity by improving efficiency. But in the future, many openings are available to meet such requirements efficient techniques that satisfy all the existing challenges.

First, the BERT pre-trained model is used to obtain the word vectors. Second, position-POS awareness mechanism is designed to focus on words of important POS in the local context. Then, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and a densely connected graph convolutional network are constructed to capture the global information. Finally, the results are obtained by the dynamic feature fusion method. Experiments on three public datasets show that LPP-GDC obtains state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a computer vision task that involves recognizing and tracking individuals across multiple non-overlapping cameras or over time within the same camera view. It is particularly important in surveillance systems, where it can help in identifying potential threats or tracking suspects. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to extract invariant person representation for this challenging task. However, CNNs do not consider global dependencies in their initial layers, causing some vital information to be lost during the convolution process. The development of vision-based transformers has opened up new research avenues for person re-identification. This work proposes a purely transformer-based solution, called TansPose Re-ID, that learns pose-invariant person representations. The proposed system uses a vision transformer baseline and enhances its architecture by introducing multiple streams to learn global and local dependencies as well as pose invariance in person images. The architecture includes a Global Self-Attention Module (GSM) and a Local Self-Attention Module (LSM) that jointly learn global and local patch-based person embeddings. The LSM is further improved by stochastically grouping local patches and aligning them. Additionally, an attention feature learning module (AFLM) is introduced in the LSM to handle pose and viewpoint variations. The proposed method is evaluated on two public Re-ID benchmarks, Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing transformer baselines.},

Computer-aided diagnosis helps specialist physicians to make the most accurate diagnosis. According to research studies, it has been stated that the number of wrong or late diagnosis increases with each passing year and ultimately causes the death of people living in many parts of the world. For this reason, some calculations must be made to determine the most accurate one in the algorithm to be used to make the correct diagnosis. In this study, three different database Monk’ problems were used to determine the most accurate algorithm for medical diagnosis. Monk’ problems are used as one of the several classification problems used to create an important comparative study. Train and test operations were performed using five different Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) (k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree Algorithm (DT), Random Forest Algorithm (RF), Naive Bayes algorithm (NB), Support Vector Cases (SVM)). These machine learning algorithms are compared statistically in terms of performance. Two different databases in the medical field were used to test the results (Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set, Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set). In the test processes in the experimental studies, the highest accuracy rate was obtained from the k-NN, DT, RF, NB, SVM algorithms, respectively; 0.9758, 1, 1, 0.9180, 0.9344. The best performance was obtained from RF MLA for 1. dataset, DT MLA for 2. dataset, highest accuracy rates from k-NN and RF MLAs in 3. dataset.},

Thus, it is required to decrease energy usage and pollution. Many applications are utilised by green computing to save energy. Scheduling of tasks acts as an important process to reach the mentioned goals. It is worth stating that the vital characteristic of task scheduling in green clouds is the load balancing of tasks on virtual machines. Efficient load balancing moves tasks from overloaded to underloaded virtual machines to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS). This issue is an NP-complete problem, so this research suggests a new technique based on the behavioural structure of artificial bee behaviour. This method aims to improve QoS while lowering energy usage in green computing. In addition, the honey bees are considered the removed tasks from overloaded virtual machines and a candidate for migrating selected tasks with the lowest priority. The CloudSim testing findings demonstrate that the technique is successful in QoS, makespan, and energy usage compared to other ways.},

Therefore, an automated model is essential for mining the educational performance of the students. Educational data mining (EDM) is more efficient when compared with statistical approaches utilised for exploring data for predicting the performance of students. This work has four major processes: (i) pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) classification and (iv) evaluating performance. Initially, the data are pre-processed and the necessary features are extracted using Word2Vec and Term Frequency & Inverse Gravity Moment. The major novelty of this work is to utilise deep learning model attention based on bi-directional long short-term memory convolutional neural network with gate mechanism and to find the students’ academic performance. The performance of the proposed model is compared over the metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F -measure, respectively. Results prove that the proposed model highly influences the performance of students.

The LP problem is useful in understanding the evolution mechanism of social networks, as well as in different applications such as recommendation systems, bioinformatics and marketing. In LP algorithms, prior network information is used to predict future connections in social networks. In this paper, we introduce a multi-wave cellular learning automaton (MWCLA) and use it to solve the LP problem in social networks. This model is a new CLA with a connected structure and a module of LAs in each cell where the neighbours of the cell module are its successors. The MWCLA method uses multiple waves at the same time in the network in order to improve convergence speed as well as accuracy. For predicting links in the social network, multiple waves can be used to consider different aspects of the network. Here we show that the model converges upon a stable and compatible configuration. Compared to some state-of-the-art approaches, MWCLA produces significantly better results when applied to the LP problem.},

As majority of the published works on local descriptors are based on the relationship between the centre pixel and neighbourhood pixels at different radial widths, by including the relationship between different neighbourhood pixels of a target pixel with it can facilitate the decoupling of the discriminatory features further. To exploit such relationships and to mitigate the challenges, the proposed study reports a novel local descriptor called Local Directional Octa Pattern (LDOP) that makes use of derivative operation and three well-known metrics, namely, histogram intersection, K-nearest neighbour and Euclidean distance for face identification. Rigorous experiments have been conducted on six benchmark face databases, namely, Extended Yale Face B, Labeled Faces in the Wild, Plastic Surgery, Look-alike, UMDAA-02-FD and ORL, confirming the superiority of the proposed local descriptor over state-of-the-art descriptors with accuracies of 97.37%, 49.09%, 75.47%, 31.2% and 93.31% at Rank–10 and 100% at Rank-5 determined on the databases, respectively.},

A novel algorithm is proposed for the study of ensemble feature selection and it is called as q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy MCDM extended to the Visekriterijumska optimizacija Ikompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) (q-ROHFS VIKOR). This is the first time in the literature an ensemble feature selection problem is modelled as a q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy MCDM extended to VIKOR technique. In the proposed method, every feature is ranked based on different available rankers and a preference matrix is obtained. In the sigmoidal transformation, the tuning parameter a plays a vital role in the fuzzification process. This tuning parameter reduces the computation run-time in the fuzzification process for different high-dimensional datasets that are considered in this paper. By using q-ROHFS VIKOR method, a score is assigned to each feature based on the values of the preference matrix. At last, an output rank vector is produced for all features from which the user can select the desired number of features. To prove the efficiency and optimality of the proposed method, the comparison with basic filter-based feature selections and ensemble feature selection using feature ranking strategy is obtained. The proposed method in this paper is superior and efficient than the ensemble methods based on the accuracy and F-score levels upto 0.96.},

  abstract     = {A method of communication for the deaf and the dumb is sign language (SL). Knowing SL allows speakers and listeners to converse effectively with deaf and dumb people. Yet, while they can acquire sign language (SL) to communicate with the dumb and the deaf, untrained persons are unable to speak with them. For such individuals, an SL to text system is more beneficial in enabling them to communicate more effectively with everyday people. To interact with the deaf and dumb, SL is a tactile gesture that employs the hands and eyes. This proposes a new model for translating SL video to text conversion or generation. Frame Conversion is the initial step, where the given input video is converted into frames. Subsequently, features considered are hierarchy of skeleton and Improved Motion estimation (ME). For generating the text, this work uses an optimised LSTM model, where training of weights is done by hybrid Combined Pelican and BES algorithm (CP-BES). Moreover, the mean value for dataset ISL-CSLTR has achieved the proposed method is 27.3%, 31.6%, 28.7%, 33.4%, 29.8%, 24.5%, 36.2%, and 34.8% greater than the conventional schemes like CNN, FSU-CNN, ASL – CNN, RNN, LSTM +POA, LSTM +ARCHOA, LSTM +HGS, LSTM +PRO and LSTM +BES.},

  abstract     = {The algorithmic detection of disinformation online is currently based on two strategies: on the one hand, research focuses on automated fact-checking; on the other hand, models are being developed to assess the trustworthiness of information sources, including both empirical and theoretical research on credibility and content quality. For debates among experts, in particular, it might be hard to discern (less) reliable information, as all actors by definition are qualified. In these cases, the use of trustworthiness metrics on sources is a useful proxy for establishing the truthfulness of contents. We introduce an algorithmic model for automatically generating a dynamic trustworthiness hierarchy among information sources based on several parameters, including fact-checking. The method is novel and significant, especially in two respects: first, the generated hierarchy represents a helpful tool for laypeople to navigate experts’ debates; second, it also allows to identify and overcome biases generated by intuitive rankings held by agents at the beginning of the debates. We provide an experimental analysis of our algorithmic model applied to the debate on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which took place among Italian medical specialists between 2020 and 2021.},

  abstract     = {Deep drawing involves the use of a punch to plastically deform a workpiece to create sheet metal parts such as cups and channels. Upon release of the punch, the workpiece undergoes elastic recovery and results in a change in geometry known as the springback effect. The process is highly non-linear and involves many parameters, leading to large computation times to fully simulate the process or train a regression model on the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, dimension-reduced neural networks (DR-NNs) for efficient springback prediction in the process of deep drawing a cylindrical cup are presented with consideration for different materials. The DR-NNs are trained on FEM data from a deep drawing simulation performed on ABAQUS/CAE. Features such as the workpiece’s initial coordinates, material properties, and thickness are introduced as inputs for the dimensionality reduction. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods reduce the input to a smaller set of principal components, which are fed as inputs to the neural networks for predicting the springback after punch release. The DR-NNs are compared against a deep neural network (DNN) and show improvements in lower computation time for training, prediction uncertainty, and less storage space required while retaining prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Computational data of a complex problem could be mapped and solved by artificial intelligence (AI) for postprocessing purposes and numerical time-saving. A fuzzy adaptive network as a hybrid AI system has already been used for CFD data machine learning. However, no investigation has been done for the ant colony optimisation (ACO) performance evaluation compared to the adaptive network. As a state-of-the-art method, the ACO and fuzzy system are combined and tuned to estimate the flow in a reactor. The liquid-phase velocity in the y-direction is predicted using a combination of fuzzy system and ACO in a large domain. The findings further indicate that, in addition to the CFD dataset and Navier-Stokes’s equations, employing an ant colony optimisation structure as a training technique may give an accurate approximation of two-phase flow. Furthermore, for numerical methods, a continuous link between input and output datasets may be a significant data source for the AI mechanism to train the physical process, incredibly bubbly flow. The ant colony optimisation shows a more accurate prediction than the adaptive network. As far as authors know, there are no such investigations to develop a new AI algorithm and performance analysis for fluid dynamics problems.},

Therefore, developing a robust system for hand gesture recognition is a challenge. This work proposed a new hybrid approach named hybrid deep recurrent neural network (RNN) incorporated with a chaos game optimisation (CGO) algorithm for efficiently recognising hand gestures. The main objective of a hybrid recurrent neural network with chaos game optimisation (RNN-CGO) is to achieve the recognition of alphabet signs from 2D gesture images. The different stages included in this technique are pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The proposed approach is executed using American Sign Language (ASL) dataset with the help of the PYTHON platform. The precision, accuracy, f1-score, and recall obtained for the proposed approach are 99.28%, 99.96%, 99.25%, and 99.28%, respectively. The inference time required for the proposed approach is 0.121 s. The proposed technique has less computational complexity. The results showed that the proposed approach is better than the existing hand gesture recognition model approaches.},

  abstract     = {The development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies allowed the rapid generation of massive amounts of data by people. Although moving data to a server is a useful solution for storage, the owner of the data loses control, which results in security lapses. An efficient method for cloud-based data models is data integrity. In order to protect data privacy in IoT healthcare, this paper develops a data integrity technique. The Data Owner, IoT server, Key Generator Center, and Auditor are the four entities that make up this model. Here, the ability to verify the accuracy of the outsourced data is present in the auditor, data owner, and IoT server. The setup, storage, and verification phase are the three stages that make up the data integrity model. Here, the proposed Taylor-based Border Collie Cat optimisation is used to generate integrity keys in the best possible way. Here, the Taylor series and Border Collie Cat optimisation (BCCO) are combined to derive the proposed Taylor-based BCCO. Python is used to carry out the proposed strategy’s implementation. The proposed method offered enhanced performance with highest normalised variance of 0.710, highest conditional privacy of 2.880, and smallest computation time of 0.179 sec using heart disease dataset.},

A good feature selection method, in addition to selecting the most relevant features with less redundancy, can also reduce computational costs and increase classification performance. One of the feature selection approaches is using meta-heuristic algorithms. This work provides a summary of some meta-heuristic feature selection methods proposed from 2018 to 2022 that were designed and implemented on a wide range of different data for solving feature selection problem. Evaluation criteria, fitness functions and classifiers used and the time complexity of each method are also depicted. The results of the study showed that some meta-heuristic algorithms alone cannot perfectly solve the feature selection problem on all types of datasets with an acceptable speed. In other words, depending on dataset, a special meta-heuristic algorithm should be used. The results of this study and the identified research gaps can be used by researchers in this field.},
