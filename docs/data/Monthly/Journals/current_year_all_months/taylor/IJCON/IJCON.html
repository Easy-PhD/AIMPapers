  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel R-adaptive sigma point filter entitled variational Bayesian Gaussian sum cubature Kalman filter (VB-GSCKF) for joint estimation of harmonic amplitude, phase, and frequencies along with the noise parameters. Since Gaussian filters may not guarantee good estimates in real-time applications involving non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise, alternative techniques are required. The proposed algorithm contributes to this gap as it automatically tunes the noise covariance matrix using the variational Bayesian approach and its Gaussian sum framework effectively models the non-Gaussian noise. The proposed VB-GSCKF algorithm demonstrates its superiority over other competing adaptive Gaussian filters and new hybrid based estimation approach where the signal is first denoised using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and then the estimation is done using GSCKF in the presence of non-Gaussian and non-stationary measurement noise. Finally, real harmonic data produced by a grid-connected inverter hardware configuration is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VB-GSCKF.},

  abstract     = {The benchmark consensus protocol is used by the most notable distributed algorithms for controlling multiagent systems through local interaction rules, where it yields to the well-known Laplacian matrix whose null space is fixed and is spanned by the vector of ones provided that the underlying graph is connected. Since this protocol is the key building block for a wide range of other existing distributed algorithms, its extensions are likewise based on this Laplacian matrix. However, the fixed nature of the null space of this Laplacian matrix limits the composition of complex (i.e. reconfigurable) cooperative behaviours for multiagent systems. Motivated by this standpoint, the contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) For undirected and connected graphs, we introduce a new Laplacian matrix, whose null space is spanned by a user-assigned vector composed of nonzero elements. We give its mathematical definition and show that it inherits key properties of the aforementioned well-known Laplacian matrix. (ii) We next present distributed control architectures for convergence to the desired null space as well as for convergence to a specific vector within that null space. (iii) We finally multiplex information networks to distributively control the null space of this new Laplacian matrix, where this is the most important contribution of this paper. We specifically show that the resulting null space can vary through local interaction rules as desired between the spans of two or more user-assigned vectors to pave the way for composing complex cooperative behaviours for multiagent systems.},

Furthermore, the use of continuous communication in traditional control systems can result in technical and financial challenges. This paper introduces a fixed-time dynamic event-triggered secondary control for islanded microgrids, designed to achieve frequency restoration, voltage regulation and active power sharing within a specified timeframe. This distributed control approach relies solely on information from each distributed generator(DG) and its neighbours. Each DG receives communication from its neighbours and concurrently broadcasts its own information only when certain deviation were reached, thereby minimising communication costs. Several simulated instances illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this control method, including scenarios involving load changes, time delay and topology switching.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the input-to-state stability (ISS) of switched systems with unstabilizable modes using an enhanced event-triggered control (ETC) scheme. Unlike the traditional results, the switched system with unstabilisable modes is explored and the fixed constraints on the trade-off are relaxed to be greater than the reciprocal of the average time of any given varying period. The interleaving of system switching and event-triggered behaviour causes asynchronous phenomena and additional triggers. To address the two disadvantages, an improved mode-dependent event-triggered with periodic sampling is put forward by the aid of a relative threshold function combined with an asynchronous associated jumping function. A global gain norm term is introduced to relax the existing relative threshold function, which increases the degree of freedom in designing event-triggered mechanism (ETM). By adding a compensation term to the controller design, asynchronous behaviour is addressed without strict assumptions. Based on the proposed ETM and the admissible edge-dependent average dwell time (AED-ADT) switching signal, an improved and less restrictive sufficient criterion has been formulated to ensure the ISS of the system. Finally, a booster converter example is used to show the applicability and another numerical example is used to testify the availability and the advantages of the derived conclusions.},

In the backstepping, multi-dimensional Taylor networks are employed to estimate the unknown nonlinearities and the command filter is used to overcome the problem of explosion of complexity. Subsequently, a novel adaptive updated law is created for co-designing the controller and the switching threshold-based ET mechanism by introducing the Nussbaum-type functions, which effectively handles the effects of the measurement errors due to the ET mechanism, and the challenges of controller design because of the presence of unknown control directions. The proposed control strategy can achieve that the closed-loop system is semi-global finite-time stable in probability, the system states are maintained in the predefined compact sets in a finite time and the system output tracking expectation signal is commendable while easing the communications burden.

Then, an adaptive fixed-time prescribed performance controller is designed to enhance the transient and steady-state performances of the system. Meanwhile, the command filters with a fractional-order error compensation system are introduced to solve the issue of differential explosion. Further, an adaptive mutation-sparrow search algorithm (AM-SSA) is constructed to optimise the controller parameters to improve the system's convergence speed and steady-state accuracy.

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the cluster consensus problem for higher-order integrator networks modelled via signed digraphs with delayed dynamics. Contrary to the related studies in the existing literature, systems do not have to contain any special graph structures. By utilising an extended digraph approach, the trajectories of a signed delayed network are recovered from its corresponding extended unsigned digraph. For higher-order integrator systems with fixed input or communication delay under continuous-time topology, the stability properties are investigated and the upper bounds are determined so that the systems achieve cluster consensus without any change in cluster members. Furthermore, we show that the discrete-time higher-order integrator systems with nonuniform delay reach cluster consensus and are stable under bounded delay provided that the undelayed system is stable. At the end, numerical examples are provided to illustrate theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a spatial SEIAR-type epidemic model considering a quarantined population (denoted as Q), which we call the SQEIAR model. The dynamics of the SQEIAR model are described by six Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that represent the changes in the susceptible, quarantined, exposed, asymptomatic, infected, and recovered populations. Our goal is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and infected individuals while accounting for the environment, which plays a critical role in the spread of epidemics. We then propose a novel strategy for epidemic control, incorporating two key control measures: regional quarantine for the susceptible population and treatment for the infected. This approach serves as an alternative to widespread quarantine, minimising the economic, social, and other potential impacts. Additionally, we consider the possibility of reinfection among recovered individuals, a common occurrence in many diseases. To demonstrate the practical utility of our results, a numerical example centred on COVID-19 is presented.},

These recurrence equations are then utilised to derive the relevant equations needed to deduce the saddle-point equilibrium solutions for two-player zero-sum games embedded within linear and nonlinear SNSs. The resolution of these equations yields analytical expressions that encapsulate the saddle-point equilibrium solutions for such types of two-player zero-sum games.

Firstly, the dynamics of the driving robot and the vehicle are analysed. Then, the adjoint sensitivity method is used for the DRV to train the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE). The performance of the vehicle under different pedal openings is learned. A RDP controller is designed to solve the nominal target acceleration. Moreover, the unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) method is used to estimate the uncertain external disturbance of the DRV. Furthermore, dynamic compensation is used for the driving robot to track the vehicle's speed. Finally, the stability of the controller is proved. Compared with MPC, LQR, and PID methods, test results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This method simplifies the model, allowing for a faster response to the Van der Waals interaction forces between the measurement sample and the cantilever tip. For scenarios where the tip-sample interaction force is unknown, the proposed model serves as the basis for designing a nonlinear, near-optimal feedback control technique. This control approach guides the cantilever tip along a desired trajectory while maintaining it vertically aligned at the balance point of attraction and repulsion forces. Additionally, a cascaded high-gain observer is designed to estimate AFM dynamics using only the measured piezo tube position. Combined with the near-optimal feedback control, this observer addresses the output feedback control problem. The proposed controller is validated through a simulation example.},

Structural controllability is considered as one of the most prominent network controllability methods. Structural controllability uses the maximum matching algorithm to find the minimum set of control nodes. The maximum matching algorithm on temporal networks is a class of NP-hard problems. In this paper, a novel method based on temporal ACO algorithm is proposed to solve the maximum matching problem in structural controllability. The ACO algorithm has been adapted to temporal networks. The results of implementing the proposed method on real-world datasets demonstrate that the ACO algorithm has a good performance and has converged to the optimal solution with high speed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher efficiency in finding driver nodes and algorithm execution speed compared to the basic structural controllability.},

In this paper, we provide a method for calculating the maximum overshoot and the decay rate for strong global uniform exponential stability for nonlinear switched impulsive systems. We consider mode constrained switching, where not all transitions between subsystems are allowed, and where subsystems may exhibit unstable dynamics in the flow and/or jump maps. Based on direct and reverse mode-dependent average dwell-time and activation-time constraints, we derive stability bounds that can be improved by considering longer switching sequences. We provide an example that shows how to ensure the stability robustness of nonlinear systems with a global state weak linearisation.},

The flight environment contains obstacles with no prior knowledge of their locations. Instead, obstacles location are determined in real time, and the locations are used by a guidance algorithm for avoidance. Wind disturbances are also considered since their presence can potentially result in saturation of the propellers. When this occurs, the flight can become unstable, leading to a crash. Designing an AWC to mitigate the effects of saturation in the control system of a quadrotor can be a challenging task due to the heavy couplings and complex nonlinear dynamics. For this reason, we propose a new structure to design a static AWC-based control system to solve this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results are verified by comparing results from simulation experiments.},

We also consider the insurer's ambiguity towards the external source. Specifically, the intensity of the number of events from the external stochastic source cannot be estimated accurately, and hence is treated as a random variable following the insurer's prior distribution. We investigate the mean-variance optimisation problem under smooth ambiguity, which aims to search the optimal strategies in average case. By solving the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(HJB) equations and using the Lagrange multiplier method, we derive the closed-form expressions for the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies. The results suggest that reinsurance may take two different forms, and that reinsurance strategies and investment strategies are influenced by each other.

This combined ORCA-DWA approach effectively combines the speed of DWA planning with the preferred speed of the ORCA algorithm, it not only solves the problem of the ORCA algorithm's difficulty in determining the preferred speed, but also does not deviate from its optimal trajectory while avoiding obstacles. Additionally, an improved dynamic windowing method is proposed to enhance the adaptability to the environment. As a result, the mobile robot can not only use the DWA algorithm to achieve global path optimisation during navigation, but also achieve obstacle avoidance with the shortest time and path while following the robot's own constraints and considering the robot's radius. Simulation results prove that the method can greatly reduce the length and time of path planning and show that this new algorithm can make the robot's speed smoother.},

Since only weak solutions of the NSEs exist globally while global existence of their strong/smooth solutions is a millennium problem, point-wise fluid forces and moments acting on the ocean vehicle are not able to bound. This difficulty is overcome by an appropriate design of control laws and stability analysis of the closed-loop system including the NSEs using a proper extension of the vehicle body. The proposed control design ensures existence of a weak solution and practical exponential stability of the closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of detecting Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence-based attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is investigated. The influence of encryption matrix on K-L divergence has been analysed. In order to zoom in the K-L divergence of innovations in the presence and absence of attacks such that detection of the attack can be facilitated, a coding matrix is designed and inserted into the wireless transmission process. It has been proved that the K-L divergence between innovations in presence and absence of the attack will intrude the detection threshold if the secret coding matrix is designed appropriately. Sufficient conditions for the detection threshold to be intruded are provided, which essentially provide clues on how the coding matrix should be designed. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed detection strategy.},

Specifically, it focuses on the challenges posed by directed switching topologies, disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A new approach is introduced to study the consensus tracking problem with a dynamic leader. The proposed strategy utilises a resilient event-triggered consensus tracking control framework, which comprises an event-triggered controller (ETC) and an event-triggering mechanism (ETM). By establishing matrix inequalities and considering parameters associated with DoS attacks and average dwell time, sufficient conditions for solving H â consensus tracking problem are derived. One characteristic of the designed ETM is that events only occur at the triggering or switching time, preventing Zeno behaviour. Furthermore, a resilient event-triggered control strategy is suggested to tackle the containment problem with multiple dynamic leaders. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed control strategies is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

The objective functional encompasses both running and terminal costs explicitly linked to general discount functions, introducing time inconsistency in the model. Open-loop Nash equilibrium controls are detailed, supported by necessary and sufficient equilibrium conditions and a verification outcome. Furthermore, a state feedback equilibrium strategy is attained through a specific partial differentialâdifference equation.

This article addresses the ECP under monotone tube boundaries and employs optimal control strategies combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance performance in unknown state situations. By utilising error scaling functions (ESF), the proposed method effectively confines the error to a predefined neighbourhood in a specified time, without knowing the specific value of the initial error. Furthermore, this article innovatively incorporates the actor-critic structure into the monotone tube boundaries, significantly enhancing system performance. Due to the condition of state immeasurability, a neural network (NN)-based state observer is designed to estimate the states of the system. Additionally, command filters are used to simplify the multiple derivative calculations in traditional backstepping methods, addressing the âexplosion of complexityâ problem. Mathematical derivations and simulation confirm its ability to meet predefined performance criteria.},

Additionally, a constructed EID estimator is utilised to estimate the impact of the exogenous disturbances on the proposed system. It is necessary to construct a novel control law that integrates the EID estimation to provide adequate disturbance rejection performance. Utilising both a Lyapunov approach and the EID technique, we derive a collection of adequate conditions to guarantee the stability of the BW hysteresis systems. The representation of these conditions takes the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

A new equivalent data-driven model of the walker considering the human-robot training environment was established by using pseudo-Jacobian matrix. The data-driven estimation method for variations in the human-robot training environment was proposed by designing an extended state observer, and the stability of the estimation error system was analysed. In addition, the desired motion velocity of the walker was designed. This approach has the advantage that the safety of the specified velocity can be guaranteed. We proposed the data-driven tracking controller that simultaneously constrains the actual velocity and input force while stabilising the tracking error system.

The singular perturbation parameter in Markov jump complex networks characterises the system's two-time-scale behaviour. A state estimator is devised that utilises nonlinear measurement output to estimate the states of two-time-scale Markov jump complex networks with general probability information. The estimation error system is guaranteed to be stochastic stable under the passive performance criterion by establishing sufficient conditions using Lyapunov stability theory. For the purpose of reducing conservatism in the process of obtaining estimator gains, an improved decoupling approach is presented. Finally, the superiority of the proposed decoupling approach and the efficiency of the designed estimator are showcased through simulations.},

It is a more difficult problem in comparison to the standard identification of a linear system. Based on the basic assumptions, a data-driven approach for the closed-loop identification of the cascaded EIV system is proposed. In the absence of external excitation, identifiability and consistency of model estimation of the plant and the controller are achieved. Without relying on prior knowledge, time delay and model order of the plant and the controller are consistently determined from the respective estimated impulse response coefficients that are estimated by using correlation analysis on two sets of routine operating input/output data. Moreover, the model parameters of the plant and the controller are consistently determined by means of the parameterisation algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by numerical examples.},

To handle the compound constraints, the constraints on control input are solved by transforming the input saturation into an uncertain and bounded control gain firstly. Then, a Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is introduced to limit the output state errors for agents to tackle the output constraints. Moreover, in consideration of the energy constraints inherent to each agent, we have developed a novel event-triggered algorithm. This algorithm is specifically designed to curtail excessive control resource consumption, a situation typically resulting from continuous controller updates in the presence of compound constraints. Further, to overcome the uncertain dynamics in system, adaptive neural networks are introduced to approximate unknown terms. The proposed algorithms are proven to asymptotically converge using Lyapunov stability techniques and the Zeno behaviours are excluded, while simulations demonstrate their effectiveness.},

Combing the switched state feedback controllers and reduced-order observers proposed in this note, the closed-loop switched planar systems achieve prescribed-time stability. Meanwhile, the violation of asymmetric output constraints is prevented implicitly by the developed barrier Lyapunov function. The novelty of this approach lies in the ingenious construction of prescribed-time switched observers and the unified design characteristics of the method, which enable the accomplishment of prescribed-time output feedback stabilisation for switched systems with/without output constraints without necessitating any structure modifications to the switched controllers and observers.},

First, a linear data model (LDM) is presented for the heterogeneous agents by the dynamic linearisation method. The data loss caused by DoS attacks can be effectively resolved through an output compensation mechanism. Subsequently, an RBFNN estimation algorithm is used to approximate the fast varying pseudo partial derivative of LDM. With linearisation on the ideal iterative learning controller, the need to pre-determining the controller structure is eliminated. Then, the learning gain is optimised using Newton-type optimisation and a local ILC protocol relying on neighbouring agents' information is designed. Finally, the convergence of the RBFNN-based DDILC scheme is rigorously analysed and a simulation of four permanent magnet motors is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.},

A lower number of switchings reduces controller processing load, yields smoother response of the closed-loop system, simplifies controller design and implementation, and reduces mechanical wear.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the bounded consensus tracking problem for uncertain linear multi-agent systems (MASs) under Markovian switching topologies in the presence of unknown but bounded disturbances and stealthy attacks. First, a class of interval observers (IOs) is designed to estimate confidence bounds of agents states and stealthy attack signals. The stealthy attack is considered as that the output information is modified by the malicious attacker. Second, distributed control protocols under Markovian switching topologies are proposed for the MASs based on the designed IOs to achieve bounded consensus. The mean-square error bounds depend on the error bounds of disturbances. After rigorous mathematical proofs, some sufficient conditions are acquired for achieving control goals. Simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed IOs and control protocols.},

Then, based on the algebraic representation and the inequality constrained solution set, a new form of transition probability matrix is constructed for PBNs. Finally, by the proposed transition probability matrix, new criteria are proposed for the finite-time stability with positive probability of PBNs.

The memoryless sampled-data feedback controller is designed by using the emulation method together with the feedback domination technique. With the aid of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, the constructed memoryless sampled-data feedback controller achieves global exponential stability (GES) in mean square of the hybrid closed-loop systems.

This work proposes a new time-scale redesign-based robust filter backstepping controller for a class of uncertain switched nonlinear systems in strict feedback form. Here, the singular perturbation technique is exploited for two purposes: (1) designing high-gain filters to avoid the explosion of complexity in backstepping design and (2) designing high-gain disturbance observers to mitigate the undesired effects of uncertainties. The discontinuities in the system dynamics and the disturbances coupled with the high-gain filter design give rise to a three-time switched nonlinear closed loop system, whose stability is assured through an average dwell time-based Lyapunov technique. The numerical simulations are carried out on a single link manipulator, which replicates the real-time situations. The results confirmed the proposed approach's applicability to other higher-order systems.},

The analysis of these models presents additional interesting features and challenges compared to their homogeneous counterparts. In the present context, energy depends on the boundary trace of velocity. It is not clear in advance how this quantity should be controlled based on the given data, due to regularity issues. However, we establish global existence and also prove uniform stabilisation of solutions with decay rates characterised by the Neumann input. We supplement these results with numerical simulations in which the data do not necessarily satisfy the given assumptions for decay. These simulations provide, at a numerical level, insights into how energy could possibly change in the presence of, for example, improper data.},

The presence of unknown control coefficients, unknown measurement sensitivity and asymmetric output constraints makes the system under consideration essentially different from those in the existing related works. By constructing a new barrier Lyapunov function and applying homogeneous system theory, a simple proportional-derivative like finite-time output feedback controller is explicitly constructed, which only utilises the output information. A rigorous proof demonstrates that not only the closed-loop system is finite time stable, but also the requirement of asymmetric output constraint can be achieved. The novelty of the control approach lies in that it is capable to handle the FTOFS problem for uncertain planar systems with or without asymmetric output constraints in a unified manner, without changing the control structure. The efficiency of the proposed theoretical results are confirmed by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {While adaptive control has been extensively studied for a variety of uncertain nonlinear systems, overparametrization still exists in many works. By overparametrization, it means that the order of the adaptive controller is (much) higher than the number of unknown parameters of the system, which is a defect from a theoretical perspective and indicates high cost in controller's implementation. This paper investigates adaptive control with lower-order dynamics for nonlinear systems with unknown control coefficients, managing to significantly reduce or eliminate overparametrization and showing the differences in controllers' dynamic orders of different control strategies. The uncertain nonlinear system in question has n unknown control coefficients and a p -dimension unknown vector in the system nonlinearities. We consider two cases of unknown control coefficients: case (a): their signs are known; case (b): their signs are unknown, i.e. unknown control directions. For case (a), first by compensating for unknown control coefficients and their reciprocals, as well as the unknown vector, we design an adaptive controller with ( 2 n + p â 1 ) -order dynamics, where no inequality estimate is used to avoid conservatism of the controller. Second, for case (a), via bounding the system uncertainties by a single unknown constant, we design an adaptive controller with only 1-order dynamics, where inequality estimates are used and hence the controller suffers conservatism. For case (b), by adopting multiple Nussbaum functions, we design a ( 2 n + p â 1 ) -order adaptive controller, where n -order dynamic compensation is employed to overcome n non-identical unknown control directions. As in case (a), because no inequality estimate is used, conservatism of the controller is avoided. Regardless of conservatism, for case (b), by bounding the uncertainties in the destabilizing terms, we design n -order adaptive controller, where, of course, inequality estimates have to be used.},

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to describe the EulerâBernoulli beam system. The well-posedness of the system under the action of an adaptive boundary controller is proved by using the linear operator semigroup method.

The aim of this paper is to develop an experimentally efficient framework for data-driven tuning of rational feedforward controllers for general non-commutative MIMO systems. In the developed approach, the nonlinear terms in the non-convex optimisation problem of iterative learning control (ILC) are iteratively circumvented via approximation. This leads to a series of convex optimisation problems that can be solved offline to obtain the parameters of the rational feedforward controller. In addition, by limiting the number of offline iterations an experimentally intensive algorithm is derived, which could be beneficial in the case of severe model mismatch. A simulation study shows that the experimentally efficient approach converges fast through offline iterations and has improved convergence properties through the use of regularisation.},

Firstly, the relative motion kinematic models of the three agents are established. We subsequently derive the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations to design the optimal control strategies for the three agents. Through the construction of actor-critic neural networks, optimal solutions are obtained. Then, the stability of the three-agent system is ensured, and the convergence to the Nash equilibrium equations is demonstrated.

The study presents a necessary condition for the existence of a monitor-based solution for a non-convex admissible marking set. Subsequently, the disjunctive constraints are developed to derive an optimal supervisory controller, and an algorithm is proposed for solution computation. The design procedure includes off-line computation mechanisms, yielding an optimal (maximally permissive) supervisor with only a few monitors. The key advantage of the suggested approach is that, unlike the current techniques, the number of monitors in the supervisorâs structure does not rise as the number of constraints increases.},

Based on this model, output feedback switching fault-tolerant controller is developed. Compared with conventional fault-tolerant control methods, the designed controller can be used under the case of unmeasurable states, and it is more fault tolerant and less conservative. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, the robust stability analysis is carried out under normal and fault conditions, respectively. Then, depending on the findings of the stability analysis, sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop normal and faulty system are derived.

The developed control law addresses the issue of the âexplosion of termsâ encountered in the backstepping method and improves the transient stability of the closed-loop power system. By utilising Lyapunov stability arguments, the proposed control approach ensures that all tracking errors of the overall closed-loop dynamics converge within specified bounds. The radii of these bounds can be adjusted by selecting sufficiently large gain control parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, simulations are conducted on an IEEE 9-bus multi-machine power system. The findings indicate that the proposed control method is both simple and efficient, exhibiting exceptional dynamic performance while eliminating the need for filters. Moreover, it outperforms existing control methodologies such as backstepping control, dynamic surface control, and command-filtered backstepping control in terms of enhanced transient performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of robust stabilisation of uncertain nonlinear systems with both matched and unmatched uncertainties. A new robust controller is proposed to guarantee practical or asymptotic stability under non-vanishing or vanishing unmatched uncertainties. First, the system uncertainties are decomposed optimally into the matched and unmatched portions with an objective of the minimum norm for the unmatched part. Next, instead of a robust control design based on only the matched part of uncertainties commonly used in the previous works, a robust controller is synthesised based on both matched and mismatched portions of the uncertainties. It is shown that in uncertain systems whose state cannot simultaneously stay in a so-called null set and diverge to infinity, the proposed controller guarantees stability no matter how large the input-unrelated unmatched uncertainties are. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed controller is more robust against uncertainties, and offers improved damping and stabilisation features.},

An original adaptive input-to-state stabilisation strategy to derive this exceptional problem under the nonlinearities modelling is proposed using the Lyapunov method. Since all the states are not measurable, a Luenberger observer is designed to estimate unmeasurable states for input-to-state stabilisation. Thus, in the design procedure, first, a Luenberger observer is designed, and then the adaptive output feedback controller is constructed via the estimated states and adaptation law. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition, in terms of a perturbation term, to guarantee the input-to-state stability of the time-varying semi-linear systems under a stabilising nonlinear feedback law.

For such a class of uncertain nonlinear systems, a design approach, called a self-compensating and self-tuning one, is presented whereby some robust state feedback control schemes can be easily synthesised.

The existence of uncertainties naturally requires the introduction of adaptive compensation mechanisms, while, convergence rate, as an important performance specification, is usually hard to attain in the context of adaptive control. For this, we are compelled to pursue a comprehensive and competent adaptive compensation mechanism which possesses dual capabilities of compensating uncertainties and affording convergence rate. Crucially, a subtle dynamic gain is designed with its dynamic updating law incorporating exponential-type time-varying information. Notably, the gain would not only deal with the unknown polynomial-of-output growth rate but particularly ensure exponential convergence with the convergence rate online adjusting in conformity to the dynamic uncertainties. Correspondingly, an adaptive output-feedback controller is constructed based on a dynamic-gain observer, which can render exponential convergence for system and observer states.},

The other advantage of the proposed method is that both abrupt and incipient faults are considered. Furthermore, the state and output disturbances, as well as actuator and sensor faults, are considered. The LyapunovâKrasovskii concept is used to guarantee the stability of the augmented closed-loop system. Calculating observer gains and stabilisation of estimation error dynamics are accomplished by utilising a new linear matrix inequality (LMI).

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate an SEIR epidemic model in which recruitment is assumed to be regulated by a constant function. The SEIR model is a widely-used epidemiological framework that categorises the population into four distinct groups: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed. It employs a system of differential equations to describe the transitions of individuals among these groups, making it a valuable tool for understanding and modelling the dynamics of infectious diseases. Mathematical analysis is used to study the dynamic behaviour of this model. We first determine the basic reproduction number, denoted as R 0 , which governs the dynamics of the SEIR model. Our findings reveal that when R 0 is less than 1, the unique disease-free equilibrium is asymptotically stable, and there is no endemic equilibrium. However, when R 0 exceeds 1, the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable, and a unique, asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium emerges. Furthermore, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, we have studied the global asymptotic stability of the two equilibrium points. On the other hand, we have used the backstepping method to design a control law that stabilises the SEIR model towards the disease-free equilibrium, which means the eradication of the disease from the target population. Next, we have used the same method to synchronise the SEIR drive system and the SEIR response system. This method is used to stabilise the synchronisation error dynamics arising from the mismatch between the drive and response systems. Finally, we presented numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results.},

To address the nonlinearities of hydraulic active suspension systems, a new low-complexity fixed-time prescribed performance control method is proposed. In this method, the function approximators (e.g. neural networks (NNs) and fuzzy systems (FSs)) are not needed, which means that the heavy computational costs are avoided. Furthermore, by developing a fixed-time performance function, the proposed method can ensure that the suspension motions converge to the prescribed range within a finite time. Based on the Lyapunov theorem and Extreme Value Theorem, the stability of the closed-loop suspension system is strictly proved. Finally, the comparative simulation results show that the proposed method effectively improves the attitude stability and ride comfort of the suspension system.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a boundary feedback control method for the two- and three-dimensional NavierâStokes equations around an arbitrary bluff body , with prescribed drag and lift coefficients. In order to determine the feedback control law, we consider an extended system coupling the equations governing the NavierâStokes problem with an equation satisfied by the control on the bluff body, which is a part of the domain boundary. We utilize the artificial compressibility method, which approximates the NavierâStokes equations in the limit, along with a priori estimation techniques, to establish a boundary control. Such a control law ensures that the prescriptions of the drag and lift coefficients are attained. Subsequently, a compactness result allows to let the compressibility parameter tend to zero. The application of the Faedo-Galerkin method is essential in reaching this result.},

  abstract     = {The trajectory tracking of Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) under hydrodynamic, uncertainties, disturbances and dynamic interaction is studied in this paper. A robust adaptive finite-time control is proposed to attain the high tracking accuracy and strong robustness. Firstly, to enhance the dynamical performance, a continuous terminal sliding mode surface is designed to guarantee that surface and errors are stable finite-time convergent to origin. Second, a feedback control term is developed to depict the hydrodynamic, uncertainties and disturbance estimation error. Then, an adaptive nested estimation technology is developed to approach the disturbance, in which a virtual torque is tuned by the low-pass filtering, and dual nested adaptive laws are provided to approximate this virtual torque and its time derivative, which can constrain the residual error to a small elliptic domain. The validity of our proposed control is verified by Lyapunov stability theory, and its reliability is proved in the simulation cases.},

  abstract     = {With the development of robotic technology and theory, there is an expectation for robots to operate in complex environments. This paper addresses the joint tracking control problem of flexible-link manipulator system under unknown external disturbances, modelling uncertainties, and actuator saturation constraints. A research is conducted, proposing a composite learning control scheme based on adaptive finite-time disturbance observer (AFTDO). The designed AFTDO can estimate the upper bound of unknown disturbances by adaptive laws, and a neural network controller is developed based on the AFTDO algorithm to compensate and suppress disturbances from multiple sources, ensuring the stability of all variables within a finite time. Simultaneously, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is chosen to guarantee that the system satisfies constraints under flexible vibrations. Finally, through simulation comparisons with other control strategies, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are convincingly demonstrated.},

To avoid continuous communication among agents, a distributed adaptive Zero-Gradient-Sum (ZGS) optimisation algorithm under a dynamic event-triggered scheme is proposed. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting the coupling strengths of adjacent agents within the network. Our analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm will exponentially converge to the optimal solution provided that the underlying communication graph is undirected and connected.

Furthermore, the incorporation of barrier Lyapunov function serves to ensure that the system output is limited in the prescribed limitations. In particular, two extended state observers are integrated to eliminate errors from model uncertainties and disturbances.

Such a scheme, referred to as the robust RGMPC, can handle (possibly nonlinear) state and input constraints and only requires solving an optimisation problem for MPC with polytopic input constraints, for which fast algorithms exist. Conditions are given which ensure recursive feasibility of the robust RGMPC scheme, finite-time convergence of the modified reference command to the desired reference command and asymptotic convergence of the state to an invariant neighbourhood of the associated set-point.

Then, the root mean square values of seat acceleration and body acceleration are used as the objective functions. Meanwhile, the RMS values of suspension dynamic deflection and tire dynamic displacement are used as constraints, and the optimal feedback parameters are obtained using particle swarm optimisation.

  abstract     = {Because of computation time, one-step delay is inherent in the real-time implementation of state-feedback controllers. Ignoring this delay can degrade performance and lead to instability. This paper analyses the effect of this delay and presents design techniques for mitigating its effect. Two new approaches, namely, delayed state-feedback (DSF) and predictor state feedback (PSF), are introduced to address these challenges and enable the design of real-time-implementable state-feedback controllers. DSF leverages a static-output-feedback framework, while PSF utilises a state predictor to compensate for the delay. It is shown that both DSF and PSF can achieve stability under specific conditions. The performance and robustness of these techniques are also compared.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses modelling and control of traffic flow networks for congestion mitigation. We first model the traffic flow of an urban area and derive a state-space model composed of multiple compartments. Each compartment expresses the dynamics of the traffic demand that depends on drivers' decision-making on route choices influenced by tolling. Two practical properties are found in the proposed state space model: one is the positivity of the model, and the other is the conservation law in the number of vehicles. Based on the positivity of the model, we next propose the optimal tolling design aiming at the peak demand mitigation, which is expressed by nonlinear programming. We transform the nonlinear programming into a linear one, which is numerically tractable. Finally, we show that the proposed tolling design mitigates the peak demand in designated compartments in a numerical experiment and present a demonstration of the proposed control system.},

  abstract     = {Over two thirds of women of all ages in the UK have experienced some form of sexual harassment in a public space. Recent tragic incidents involving female pedestrians have highlighted some of the personal safety issues that women still face in cities today. There exist many popular location-based safety applications as a result of this; however, these applications tend to take a reactive approach where action is taken only after an incident has occurred. This paper proposes a preventative approach to the problem by creating safer public environments through societal incentivisation. The proposed system, called âHerd Routesâ, improves the safety of female pedestrians by generating busier pedestrian routes as a result of route incentivisation. A novel application of distributed ledgers and ergodic feedback control is proposed to provide security and trust, a record of system users' locations and IDs, and a platform for token exchange. A proof-of-concept was developed using the simulation package SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), and a smartphone application was built in Android Studio so that pedestrian Hardware-in-the-Loop testing could be carried out to validate the technical feasibility and desirability of the system. With positive results from the initial testing of the proof-of-concept, further development could significantly contribute towards creating safer pedestrian routes through cities, and tackle the societal change that is required to improve female pedestrian safety in the long term.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, classic controllability and structural controllability under two protocols are investigated. For classic controllability, the multiplicity of eigenvalue zero of general Laplacian matrix ð¿ â is shown to be determined by the sum of the numbers of zero circles, identical nodes and opposite pairs; however, it is always simple for the Laplacian L with diagonal entries in absolute form. For a fixed structurally balanced topology, the controllable subspace is proved to be invariant even if the antagonistic weights are selected differently under the corresponding protocol with L . For a graph expanded from a star graph rooted from a single leader, the dimension of controllable subspace is two under the protocol associated with L â . In addition, the system is structurally controllable under both protocols if and only if the topology without unaccessible nodes is connected. As a reinforcing case of structural controllability, strong structural controllability requires the system to be controllable for any choice of weights. The connection between parent nodes and child nodes affects strong structural controllability because it determines the linear relationship of the control information from parent nodes. This discovery is a major factor in establishing the sufficient conditions on strong structural controllability for multi-agent systems under both protocols, rather than for complex networks, about latter results are already abundant. Finally, we present a sufficient and necessary condition to identify the strong structural controllability. Moreover, a method to construct a strongly structurally controllable graph is proposed.},

Contraction analysis considers stability with respect to a nominal trajectory rather than an equilibrium point. If two neighbouring trajectories of a system are located in a contraction region, then they will tend to each other and to a nominal trajectory. In the event-triggered control algorithm that we introduce, we suggest to update the control law whenever the system trajectory is about to leave the contraction region. We show that such a scheduling of the control law guarantees system stability, and we show that a minimum inter-event time exists between consecutive updates of the control law. We also show how to place the system trajectory in a contraction region and demonstrate that the classical controllability assumption on LTV systems is enough to ensure the existence of the required transformation to perform that.},

The main conclusions are discussed in three cases (system without input, system with disturbance input, system with disturbance input and control input). And the H â stabilisation problem is solved by constructing a controller which is inserted with system parameters and their derivatives. The structures of Lyapunov function and controller lead to that the derived criteria for exponential stabilisation are expressed by state-and-parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities, which are efficiently solved by sum-of-squares program. The effectiveness and superiority are verified through two numerical examples.},

In this paper, a PV grid-connected system in a two-stage configuration is studied. In this configuration, an improvement to a control MPPT is proposed. To achieve this, we propose a novel concept for MPPT control that consists of generating an adaptive step size for P&O control that is based on sliding mode control in order to minimise ripple phenomena and chattering phenomena. The proposed control approach was then tested using MATLAB/Simulink simulations under varying irradiation conditions. We compared this approach to the conventional P&O method as well as the adaptive step size of P&O and hybrid P&O-sliding mode control. The results of the test indicate that the proposed control strategy significantly minimises the two phenomena and improves overall efficiency.},

By exploring the monotonicity of system trajectories, a condition that is both sufficient and necessary for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the system is presented. Importantly, under a weak assumption for the growth rate of time-varying delays, a universal framework is provided for characterising the decay rate of the system. Furthermore, typical examples of decay rate analysis are presented when delays are bounded or experience linear, sublinear, or logarithmic growth rates.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of global regulation for uncertain feedforward nonlinear systems using event-triggered impulsive control. By constructing a state transformation with a time-varying scaling gain, both the state-feedback and output-feedback event-triggered impulsive control strategies are established. It is proven that the proposed impulsive controllers ensure the global regulation of the concerned systems while avoiding the Zeno behaviour. Furthermore, the derived results of this work are generalised to a broader class of uncertain feedforward nonlinear systems incorporating time-varying nonlinearities, as well as to a class of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems. It is noteworthy that this paper is the first attempt to design an impulsive regulating controller for feedforward nonlinear systems. Finally, a simulation example is presented to verify the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

To identify the unstructured uncertainties, a novel broad learning system (BLS) approximation technique is introduced in this study to solve it. On this basis, a nonlinear state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable state variables. A dynamic signal is introduced to deal with the effect of unmodeled dynamics, and the appropriate error transformation is utilised to handle the effect of input delays. The decentralised adaptive tracking control strategy is proposed to the considered interconnected nonlinear systems using the design procedures of backstepping control with command filter. The semi-globally uniformly ultimately boundedness (SGUUB) stability and the tracking performance of the whole closed-loop systems could be guaranteed by using the Lyapunov approach.

Based on these observers, two boundary control protocols are designed via the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method for suppressing elastic vibration and regulating the angle of the joint. A significant feature of LMI is that the control gains can be efficiently solved. Finally, some simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

The method utilises an actor-critic framework with optimal backstepping to minimise a discounted value function and uses a single-layer NN identifier for estimating the unknown dynamics. For safety assurance, a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) is used in the control design to handle the constraints. A novel weight-tuning law by using the control input error, integral Bellman error, and the NN identifier is used for the actor-critic framework. A novel lifelong learning (LL)-based method for critic NN is utilised in an optimal framework by incorporating the Bellman error to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multitasking scenarios. Stability analysis using Lyapunov stability theory is obtained for the overall closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {Indirect field oriented control (IFOC) is the industry standard for high performance current-fed induction motors. It is well-known that this controller preserves stability in the face of large rotor resistance variations â which are inevitable in practical scenarios â but its performance is significantly degraded. To overcome this drawback many adaptation schemes have been reported, both in drives and control-oriented publications, with the overwhelming majority of these developments done in continuous-time . This, in spite of the fact that the IFOC, as well as their proposed adaptive versions, involve the solution of highly nonlinear differential equations, whose discretization is far from obvious. In this paper we try to reverse this trend and present a discrete-time estimator of the motor parameters and an adaptive IFOC based on it. It is shown that the proposed estimator and adaptive controller are globally convergent under very weak prior knowledge and excitation assumptions. Simulations, that validate the theoretical claims and illustrate the robustness of the schemes, are also presented.},

To assess secondary infections, four effective reproduction rates are computed corresponding to different disease states. The sensitivity analysis of the reproduction rates is conducted using the PRCC to identify influential compartments and parameters. The model is extended to incorporate five time-dependent control interventions to reduce infected compartments, with optimisation performed using the Pontryagin maximum principle. A cost-effectiveness analysis of these strategies is conducted using the average cost-effectiveness ratio. Analysis shows that the model does not undergo backward bifurcation, meaning a stable disease-free equilibrium cannot coexist with a stable endemic equilibrium. The findings show that strict adherence to standard operating procedures is the most effective single intervention. In contrast, a combined approach incorporating all five control interventions is the most effective in averting infections with the lowest ACER.},

Firstly, the RBF-ARX model is transformed into an extended Non-Minimal State-Space (NMSS) model in which integral action and set-point information are naturally contained to decrease steady-state error. Then, to reduce computational burden, the control variables of the NMPC is parameterised by Laguerre polynomials for dimensionality reduction.

However, applying PMP encounters challenges when state constraints must be satisfied. This arises because the optimal trajectory often requires a blend of unconstrained and constrained arcs with unknown junction points. To address this issue, relaxation methods are frequently explored, where state constraints are replaced with penalty functions. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a method of penalty functions allowing for coping with soft state constraints is examined. We prove the recursive feasibility of this method and demonstrate its efficiency in a numerical example. Second, the finite-time practical stability for the optimal reference tracking NMPC problem is addressed. By appropriately choosing the terminal cost, one can guarantee the convergence of the state vector to a predefined neighbourhood of the target state.},

In this work, a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for multi-period portfolio optimization is proposed, where the return prediction model is estimated via a novel trading-oriented learning paradigm. According to such a perspective, the model parameters are not the ones minimizing the prediction error but those that directly maximize the investor's utility.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new practical stabilization method for discrete-time switched nonlinear systems without a common equilibrium point among all modes. The proposed method has two main features. First, the number of nonlinear terms in the stability conditions is independent of the number of switched system modes. The result is that the computational cost is reduced, and it can be applied to switched systems with a large number of subsystems. Second, using switched Lyapunov functions, hybrid switching laws are designed to preserve the practical stability property in both the closed-loop state-dependent switching function and the open-loop time-dependent one. As a result, when the state data is lost during sensor or communication failures, the controller can change the control scheme from a closed-loop state-dependent switching function to an open-loop time-dependent one without loss of stability property. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Since the dead-zone phenomenon is frequently encountered in the control of nonlinear strict feedback system, it is very necessary to consider the effect of dead-zone in the OB control. However, the published OB control methods are to rarely deal with the dead-zone problem because of the complex algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL). In this OB control, the dead-zone problem is effectively solved by utilising a simplified RL algorithm. For effective eliminating the effect of dead-zone, an adaptive compensation of dead-zone function's remainder is added to this RL. Since the RL under identifier-critic-actor architecture is implemented in every backstepping step, the requirement of complete dynamic acknowledge is released. Ultimately, the validity of this OB method is certified both theory and simulation.},

The proposed controller consists of two linear and nonlinear parts, without any switching elements. The linear part is designed to solve the main regulation problem, while the nonlinear part is designed to enhance the performance of the closed-loop system in the face of input saturation. The delay-range dependent stability conditions of the closed-loop system are analysed using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) approach, which involves solving an LMI problem to determine the parameters of the proposed controller. Furthermore, the admissibility of the closed-loop system is assessed to ensure the systemâs stability, regularity, and causality. Finally, the theoretical achievements are endorsed by simulations through numerical and practical examples.},

Specifically, we add a kind of nonnegative impulses which is consistent with the switching behaviours for the systems. We first study switched homogeneous positive nonlinear systems (SHPNS) case, then we extend the SHPNS to a time-varying SHNS case. The primary difficulty of this research is the estimation of Lyapunov function value at switching-impulse points under the coupling effects of synchronous switches and state jumps. By employing the max-separable Lyapunov function approach, we present new sufficient stability criteria and design new switching-impulse signals, and successfully establish the new relation between the average dwell time parameter and impulse strength. Then, we apply the obtained results to the time-varying vehicle formation model with impulses. At last, four examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of our results, which includes the specific algorithm verification process.},

This approach adopts a reference trajectory strategy. By utilising the designed exponential reaching law, it is demonstrated that, compared with traditional methods, both the sliding mode variable and the steps required to enter the quasi-sliding mode domain can be adaptively adjusted based on the system's state and parameters. Subsequently, a disturbance-dependent reaching law, built upon the exponential model, is developed to ensure the Lyapunov stability of the system and to attenuate its ultimate bandwidth. Furthermore, an analysis is conducted on the stability condition between the exponential and disturbance-dependent reaching laws, illustrating that the designed referred sliding phase optimises the ultimate bandwidth. This methodology is then applied to multi-agent systems to validate its effectiveness, where quasi-leader-following consensus and error boundedness are explored. Finally, the results are corroborated through numerical simulations, considering both a general discrete-time system and a multi-agent systems.},

A novel disturbance observer-based control (DOBC) scheme is proposed through combining radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and prescribed performance function (PPF). In contrast to traditional DOBC, the proposed approach employs RBFNN technology to approximate unknown nonlinear functions in the system, instead of treating them as part of lumped disturbances. A novel disturbance observer is developed to estimate disturbances characterised by a nonlinear exogenous system. To enhance control performance, a PPF that characterises both transient and steady-state behaviour is used for the transformation of tracking errors. It can be proved that all the states of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and that the tracking error evolves within the prespecified boundaries. Theoretical results are validated and supported by two simulation examples.},

We assume that the transfer function of the infinite-dimensional system can be expressed as a ratio of two infinite series in s (the Laplace variable). We also assume that certain identifiability conditions, which include a persistency of excitation condition, hold. For a fixed integer n , we propose an adaptive update law (a differential equation in time) driven by real-time input-output data for estimating the first n +â1 coefficients in the numerator and the denominator of the transfer function. We show that the estimates for the transfer function coefficients generated by the update law are close to the true values at large times provided n is sufficiently large (the estimates converge to the true values as time and n tend to infinity). The unknown parameter can be reconstructed using the transfer function coefficient estimates obtained with n large and the algebraic expressions relating the transfer function coefficients to the unknown parameter. We also provide a numerical scheme for verifying the identifiability conditions and for choosing n sufficiently large so that the value of the reconstructed parameter is close to the true value. The class of systems to which our approach is applicable includes many partial differential equations with constant/spatially-varying coefficients and distributed/boundary input and output. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach using three examples: a delay system with four unknown scalars, a 1D heat equation with two unknown scalars and a 1D wave equation with an unknown linearly-varying (in space) coefficient.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the non-singular control for strict-feedback nonlinear time-delay systems. The boundedness of all the signals of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved by introducing a class of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, including exponential functions. Besides, novel auxiliary functions with continuous derivatives are proposed to construct the control law to avoid the discontinuity of the virtual controllers. Besides, the amount of computation is reduced by applying the new auxiliary functions when the other control methods require loads of calculations for handling singular problems. In the end, numerical examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Concretely, we introduce a minimisation problem associated with a vector of functionals of multiple integral type. In addition, the considered multi-objective controlled optimisation problem is governed by several mixed constraints generated by partial derivatives of second order and uncertain data. For this new class of control problems, we establish and characterise Wolfe, Mond-Weir and mixed type robust dual models. To this aim, by using the notion of convex multiple integral functional , generated by a controlled second-order Lagrangian with uncertain data, and the concept of robust weak efficient solution to the problem under study, we build a new mathematical context to state and prove the duality theorems.},

Then an adaptive finite-time ELM-based velocity observer is developed to estimate the unavailable velocity states. Further, based on the estimations and the approximations of model uncertainties, an adaptive finite-time observer-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode (TSM) control strategy is constructed to guarantee the finite-time bounded tracking of the uncertain EL system by using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results on a robotic manipulator platform demonstrate the efficiency of the developed finite-time observation and control methods.},

Supervisor reduction/localisation is based on merging pairs of states of the supervisor that are control consistent. Our proposed algorithm employs two new lists â a mergeable list and a non-mergeable list â which store state pairs that have been confirmed to be control consistent or inconsistent, respectively. With these two lists, our algorithm eliminates any repeated control consistency checks, and guarantees that every state pair will be checked exactly once. We prove that the time complexity of our new algorithm is O ( n 2 ) , where n is the state number of the supervisor; this improves all previously known results on supervisor reduction/localisation algorithms. We employ numerical examples to empirically compare the computation time and local controller's state number obtained by our proposed algorithm and the original supervisor reduction/localisation algorithms.},

Secondly, by perceiving the input nodes from other subnetworks as a switching signal, several new criteria are proposed for the robust set stability of each subnetwork with disturbance inputs under arbitrary switching signal. Finally, by combining the (robust) set stability of all subnetworks, the robust set stability of large-scale BNs with disturbance inputs is discussed.

Other contributing factors include system parameter uncertainty, functional uncertainty that originates from input functions, and sensors noises to mention a few. This indeterminism has led to major challenges in the development of accurate control methods for atomic scale systems. To address the probabilistic and uncertain nature of these systems, this work proposes a novel control framework that considers the representation of the quantum system states and the quantification of its physical properties following a probabilistic approach. Our framework is fully probabilistic. It uses the Shannon relative entropy from information theory to design optimal randomised controllers that can achieve a desired outcome of an atomic scale system.

This problem may prove impractical, especially for hardware-limited setups. By removing the need for online solvers, Explicit MPC (ExMPC) stands out as a strong candidate. Yet, the formulation was usually hindered by the system's nonlinearity and dimensionality. In this paper, we propose an ExMPC solution for quadcopter position stabilisation. With the former issue, the system is exactly linearised into a concatenation of three double integrators. For the latter, with a suitable characterisation of the new convoluted constraints, the stabilising ExMPC can be computed for each double integrator separately. The controller is validated via simulations and experiments on a nanodrone platform. The proposed scheme provides similar performance and theoretical guarantees to the up-to-date nonlinear MPC solutions but with notably less computational effort, allowing scalability in a centralised manner.},

The goal of the insurer is to maximise the probability that its wealth exceeds a predetermined level l before the regulatory time arrives. By constructing an auxiliary control problem without regime switching, together with the classical results on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and fixed-point method, we prove the regularity of the value function. When the current state of the Markov chain is given, we found that the optimal policies for an insurer in a multiple-regime market is the same as those in a single-regime market. Explicit optimal policies can be derived when the premium is calculated by the expectation principle. For more general cases, numerical schemes for value functions and feedback optimal policies are given by the Markov chain approximating method.},

We develop compactification methods in decision processes and show that the existence of optimal policies. Subsequently, through the dynamic programming principle of the delay-dependent control policies, the differential-difference Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the setting of discrete space is established. Under certain conditions, we give the comparison principle and further prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution to this HJB equation. Based on this, we show that among the class of delay-dependent control policies, there is an optimal one which is Markovian.},

Cobra maneuver commands the quadrotor in Â± ð / 2 (rad) pitch angle such that the conventional hovering assumption for quadrotor flight is not applicable. The finite-time Î¸ - D method is proposed to control the Cobra maneuver. Based on this technique, the intractable HamiltonâJacobiâBellman equation can be approximated by a differential Riccati equation and a series of state-dependent Lyapunov equations, which can be solved recursively and lead to the closed-form state feedback control law . This control law can achieve semi-global asymptomatic stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed technique is compared favourably with the finite-time state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique in terms of computation efficiency and control effort, and also shows faster recovery of the quadrotor after the Cobra maneuver compared with conventional dynamics without the derivative of the rotation matrix.},

The paper makes two main contributions: (i) it proposes a new partitioning of the saturation/quantization nonlinearity; and (ii) it formulates and solves a two-stage anti-windup problem on the basis of this partitioned nonlinearity. The anti-windup compensator contains two distinct elements: one to assuage the effects of quantization, the other to do the same when saturation occurs. Theoretical results provide conditions which must be satisfied in order for the two-stage anti-windup compensator to bestow stability on the resulting closed-loop system. These results are expressed as linear matrix inequalities and naturally lead to algorithms for anti-windup design. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

The major difficulties are that the actuator dynamics is covered by an unstable heat equation and it has non-collocated configuration between control input and disturbance. To overcome these difficulties, the trajectory planning technique is first introduced to carry the disturbance to control channel, and then backstepping strategy is applied to cope with the source term of instability in the heat equation. Following, by virtue of system similarity, the recently developed dynamic compensation approach for linear system is utilised to guarantee the performance output tracks reference signal exponentially and closed-loop states are uniformly bounded.

The goal of control is to bring such a system from a given initial position to a given final state in certain finite time. The admissible controls are piecewise continuous and bounded vector-functions with values from some parallelepiped. The original problem is reduced to unconditional minimisation of some penalty functional which takes into account constraints in the form of differential equations, constraints on the initial and the final positions of the object as well as constraints on controls. Moreover, it is known that this functional vanishes on the solution of the original problem and only on it. The quasidifferentiability of this functional is proved, necessary and sufficient conditions for its minimum are written out in terms of quasidifferential. Further, in order to solve the obtained minimisation problem in the functional space the method of quasidifferential descent is applied. The algorithm developed is demonstrated by examples.},

Second, a switching law depending on external parameters, system state, dwell time is designed to guarantee switching frequency. Third, a time-varying switching controller is designed, under which a solvable condition of the FTBTC issue is presented. It allows the FTBTC issue of each subsystem to be unsolvable.

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of non-smooth finite-time (FT) adaptive state feedback stabilisation is investigated for asymmetric output-constrained cascade switched nonlinear systems (AOCCSNSs) with mixed powers, parametric uncertainties and zero dynamics. To better address the uncertain parameters and the asymmetric output constraints, a new type of common Lyapunov function (CLF) including a quadratic squared term of the estimated error and a tangent-type barrier Lyapunov function ( T t -BLF) is constructed. Then, with some mild assumptions, such as input-to-state stability (ISS) property of zero dynamics, upper boundedness of subsystems' nonlinear terms and some well-known small signal conditions, state feedback controllers (SFCs) constructed by adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique and the update law to estimate the unknown parameter are proposed to guarantee resultant closed-loop switched systems FT stable. The proposed method for switched systems is presented in a unified manner, capable of addressing FT stabilisation by effectively handling situations with or without output constraints. This is achieved through the construction of T t -BLF, which degenerates into a quadratic form when the output constraint disappears or approaches infinity. At last, the method is verified by a switched RLC circuit system (RLC-CS) and a numerical simulation.},

Transient vibration of the powertrain caused by sudden changes in the engine torque significantly degrades the driving performance and driver comfort. In addition, the nonlinear characteristics owing to the backlash increase the adverse effects of these oscillations. To suppress the transient vibration of the powertrain, a controller is designed based on the mixed H 2 /H â control theory. Subsequently, to adjust for the vibration amplification owing to the backlash, we propose the application of a shock-reducing controller based on the FSC. Linearly decreasing the inertia weight in particle swarm optimisation (LDWPSO) was applied to the design of this controller and parameters were optimised. Finally, simulations were conducted using the control method; the controller could prevent the occurrence of shocks owing to the gear collisions and achieved smooth anÂ acceleration.},

In this work, we use a highly robust model-based control methodology, sliding mode control, without the need for an a priori model. We use a neural network to learn an approximate system model fully online, with no pretraining. The neural network term is found to increase control accuracy while alleviating chatter, the primary drawback of conventional sliding mode control. The controller is verified by simulating a non-planar 3 degree-of-freedom robotic arm picking up a load, and the proposed controller is shown to outperform conventional model-based sliding mode control, especially when the built-in load margin on the end effector in the conventional model-based controller is exceeded.},

We firstly propose the formulation of the optimal control problem (OCP) of maximising the probability of finite-time reachability subject to output trackability. Then, by converting the dynamics of MJSBCNs into an equivalent expectation system, an LLO is established for MJSBCNs. In this setup, a Luenberger-like observation matrix is constructed, which is an effect tool to solve the finite-time reachability problem. Finally, an LLO method is developed to find the FHOCS by maximising the T -step Luenberger-like observation matrix. In a biological example, we show the effectiveness of our developed methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a method to compute solutions of optimal controls for dynamic systems in terms of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) with Gaussian neurons. The RBFNN is used to compute the value function from HamiltonâJacobiâBellman equation with the policy iteration. The concept of dominant system is introduced to create initial coefficients of the neural networks to stabilise unstable systems and guarantee the convergence of policy iteration. Model reduction and transfer learning techniques are introduced to improve robustness of RBFNN optimal control, and reduce computational time. Numerical and experimental results show that the resulting optimal control has excellent control performance in stabilisation and trajectory tracking, and much-improved robustness to disturbances and model uncertainties even when the system responses move to a domain of the state space that is larger than the domain where the neural networks are trained.},

The incomplete measurement problem caused by packet loss, saturation, and other issues during data transmission can lead to the unavailability of system state variables, which can degrade system performance and even lead to instability. To solve these problems, a state estimator for data-losing case and two controllers for normal and data-losing cases are designed utilising event-triggered strategies which can reduce the burden of calculation and data transmission. Radial basis function neural networks are adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinear system functions. A strict stability analysis in probability shows that the control laws for the considered strict-feedback nonlinear system can guarantee all the closed-loop to be uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square. Two examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the provided control method.},

One such bio-inspired optimal control approach, applicable in static environments, is âlocal pursuitâ, a method that iteratively solves partially-constrained final state problems by having agents follow one another, each agent moving optimally towards its predecessor. We show that if, instead, agents evolve in their own time-delayed âcopyâ of the environment and act based on the most recent time history of their predecessors local neighbourhoods, then the original method can be extended to the dynamic environments described above.

The region-reaching control task consists of three basic control objectives: reaching an objective region, maintaining a rest state in the objective region, and stabilising at a desired posture. The constraints imposed on the motion of the mobile robot system are not integrable and have no inverse resolution, and thus increase the complexity of the controller design for non-holonomic systems. A system decomposition approach is proposed to convert the non-holonomic constraint control system to the cascade holonomic constraint control subsystems, and an adaptive control gain technique is presented to guarantee the stability of the non-holonomic system. Then, a novel torque controller is presented to implement the region-reaching control task. Specially, the objective region can be considered as a parking spot for a mobile robot.},

  abstract     = {In discrete-event systems, to save sensor resources, the agent continuously adjusts sensor activation decisions according to a sensor activation policy based on the changing observations. However, new challenges arise for sensor activation in networked discrete-event systems, where observation delays and control delays exist between the sensor systems and the agent. In this paper, a new framework for activating sensors in networked discrete-event systems is established. In this framework, we construct a communication automaton that explicitly expresses the interaction process between the agent and the sensor systems over the observation channel and the control channel. Based on the communication automaton, we can define dynamic observations of a communicated string. To guarantee that a sensor activation policy is physically implementable and insensitive to non-deterministic control delays and observation delays, we further introduce the definition of delay feasibility. We show that a delay feasible sensor activation policy can be used to dynamically activate sensors even if control delays and observation delays exist. A set of algorithms are developed to minimise sensor activation in a transition-based domain while ensuring a given specification condition is satisfied. A practical example is also provided to show the application of the proposed framework. Finally, we briefly discuss how to extend the proposed framework to a decentralised observation setting.},

The results are then used to derive Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov conditions for characterising necessary and sufficient conditions for strong dissipativity in terms of the system functions of the dynamical system using continuously differentiable storage functions and quadratic supply rates. Furthermore, using strong dissipativity concepts we present serval stability results for nonlinear feedback systems that guarantee finite time stability.

The dual gains are embedded in the observers and controllers, which can effectively compensate for time-varying control coefficients and unknown constant growth rate multiplied by output-polynomial function. Three different threshold schemes including fixed threshold, relative threshold and time-varying threshold are introduced to save communication resources.

Secondly, new tighter upper bounds of the positive (semi-)definite solution of the continuous algebraic Riccati equation (CARE) corresponding to the redundant control input problem are studied uniformly in the stabilizable case. Thirdly, based on them, a class of sufficient conditions to guarantee that the norm of the feedback matrix decreases is presented.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the stability of the one-dimensional parabolic system, where one end changes over time and the other is the control end with the external disturbance. Firstly, by the boundary immobilisation method, the displacement change of the system boundary is transferred into the equation so that the original system is transformed into a system with fixed boundaries. Secondly, by combining the backstepping transformation and the sliding mode control method, the feedback control is proposed to compensate the instability of the system itself and reject the matched disturbance. Then, the resulting closed-loop system will be in the form of A + B ( Ï ) + C D ( Ï ) , where A generates a C 0 semigroup, B ( Ï ) and C are bounded and unbounded operators respectively, and D ( Ï ) is the external input. The existence of the generalised solution to the closed-loop system is proved by using the eigenfunction expansion of the system solution. By the Lyapunov method, the closed-loop system is shown to be exponentially stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {In the article, for air-handling units (AHUs), an almost disturbance decoupling temperature and humidity tracking controller is constructed directly based on dynamic nonlinear models by backstepping. Compared with model-free techniques such as proportion integration differentiation (PID) and so on, the proposed scheme uses the known information effectively in the model to ensure control accuracy. Different from linearisation methods, the almost disturbance decoupling method is employed to attenuate the impact of disturbances. Without fuzzy logics, the proposed controller requires less computation since the exponential explosion of computation caused by the increase of fuzzy rules can be avoided. To show the practicability, the outdoor temperature and humidity, strength of humidity source, and heat load are considered to be time-varying. Finally, compared with PID, feedback linearisation and fuzzy controllers, the effectiveness and superiority of the constructed controller are proved.},
