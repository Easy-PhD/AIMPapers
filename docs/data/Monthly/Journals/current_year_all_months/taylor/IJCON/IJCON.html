  abstract     = {This paper investigates the optimal spacecraft reorientation issue while adhering to attitude pointing and actuator constraints. To handle the second-order nature of the pointing constraint in the attitude dynamics, a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) is developed, ensuring forward invariance of the pointing constraint set via Lyapunov-like conditions. A fixed-time stability (FxTS) Lyapunov function is introduced to achieve fixed-time reorientation using sliding mode techniques. The problem is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) optimisation with actuator limits, leveraging slack variables to ensure feasibility. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Two types of sparse attack estimators for CPS are presented and compared. The first proposed estimator uses the 1-norm approximation of the 0-norm minimisation problem which is the basis of this estimator. The second estimator combines the norm-based estimator with the unknown input observer architecture. It is demonstrated through analytic considerations and simulations that the combined norm-unknown input observer based estimator is superior to the norm-based only estimator. A novel design method that uses error correcting code (ECC) approach is proposed to enhance estimation accuracy. The main idea behind this approach is to add redundant information to the signals sent. To accomplish the design objective, fictitious output measurements are generated to increase the sparsity of the collected measurements resulting in more accurate estimates of the state, communication errors, and disturbances.},

The objective of the min-max DDP refers to a game-theoretic approach where one controller aims to minimise a cost function, while the other controller seeks to maximise the same cost function. The min-max DDP relies on full knowledge of dynamics which is challenging in output feedback systems. To address this challenge, we first employ the High Order Sliding Mode (HOSM) observer to obtain unobserved states and approximate the dynamics of the nonlinear system. Then, by integrating the HOSM observer with the optimisation capabilities of min-max DDP, this paper details the update rules for the minimising and maximising controls for both players and introduces a set of backward differential equations for the second-order approximation of the value function. Finally, results of two examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

A novel Energy Trading Model considering ESS degradation (ETMED) is established to maximise system benefits, and then transformed into a Markov game problem. Self-Attention based Double Deep Q Network (SA-DDQN) is proposed to solve it. In SA-DDQN, the self-attention mechanism weights the state information, enhancing the algorithm's ability to capture the internal relationship between state data. Furthermore, the duelling architecture divides the value function into the state value function and the action advantage function, enabling the algorithm to better adapt to the complex trading environment and make accurate trading decisions, thus increasing the system benefits. Compared to the baseline algorithms, simulation results demonstrate that SA-DDQN obtains higher system benefits with better convergence.},

However, it has been shown that the conditions do not hold for all problems, and therefore these conditions have later been referred to as Mcdanell's Conjecture. There have been numerous attempts to either prove or disprove this conjecture. In this paper, we summarise the findings related to Mcdanell's Conjecture, and clarify the ambiguous definitions of certain variables used in Mcdanell and Powers original work and subsequent literature.

Additionally, a terminal attractor function is incorporated into the IHSTD to effectively reduce chattering in control tracking systems. Simulation results are presented, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed IHSTD compared to other TDs in terms of faster signal tracking and more effective noise suppression. Furthermore, the IHSTD is employed to estimate the unknown states in the sliding mode control (SMC) based on the radial basis function (RBF), which serves as the tracking controller for the manipulator system.

The system is characterised using a partial differential equation model established through the Hamilton principle. An adaptive control law, grounded in the Nussbaum function, is developed to address challenges stemming from uncertain actuator dynamics. Additionally, to address the issue of unknown end payload, a projection mapping operator is used to devise an adaptive law. Theoretical analysis establishes that under proposed control law, all closed-loop signals remain uniformly bounded. Additionally, the vibration of the manipulator converges asymptotically to 0, while ensuring that the angles of both rotating base and manipulator accurately track desired angles. Furthermore, the effectiveness of control method is corroborated by numerical simulation. In summary, the the proposed control scheme not only solves the uncertainty problem, but improves the overall performance and stability of system, and ensures operation safety in engineering.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of global stabilisation in mean-square for a class of stochastic uncertain systems with time-delay. Under the lower-triangular linear growth condition, it is proved that global exponential stabilisation (GES) in mean square of the stochastic nonlinear systems with a limited input delay and arbitrary large state delay is possible by memoryless feedback. A counterexample is constructed to show that without the linear growth condition, the considered system might not be GES in mean square by any memoryless feedback controller no matter how small the input delay is. By the feedback domination approach and the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, a linear and delay-free feedback controller is constructed such that the stochastic time-delay nonlinear system is GES in mean square. Application of the memoryless control scheme to the one-link manipulator system with time-delay is given with simulation.},

MTNs are utilised to estimate uncertain system functions and to enhance reliable control performance. Additionally, a command filter technique is introduced to circumvent the ‘explosion of complexity’ issue during derivative computation for virtual control laws and further improve reliable control performance. The paper addresses critical non-smooth nonlinearities, such as input saturation and dead zone, by approximating them with non-affine smooth functions and transforming them into an affine form using the mean value theorem. Using Lyapunov stability theory and the backstepping method, an adaptive controller is designed to ensure bounded signals in the closed-loop system. Additionally, it achieves excellent performance with small tracking errors through careful selection of control parameters. A simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In the first scenario, a new optimal policy iteration is suggested based on observed states and inputs to find an optimal state feedback controller. Furthermore, based on the development of case one's results, a new optimal policy iteration is provided for case two, where the system's outputs are only ones accessible, to obtain the optimal output feedback controller. In this case, the states that only the outputs are used are also assumed to be known. It has been proved that the suggested algorithms converge to the locally optimal controllers.},

  abstract     = {Recent results on the unique ergodicity of feedback systems, which strive to orchestrate the behaviour of a single ensemble of agents, demonstrate that, under straightforward conditions, convergence in distribution of the feedback loop to a unique invariant measure can be guaranteed. These results were motivated by sharing-economy applications, where one strives to provide guarantees on the allocation of constrained resources under a feedback signal. In this paper, we extend these existing results to the case of larger-scale interconnections containing two or more ensembles of agents. This direction may be construed as an analogue of the classical theory of interconnected dynamical systems under uncertainty of the systems' models. Our key finding is that traditional small-gain-like results do not apply. In the case of linear filters and controllers, interconnections of such ensembles of agents are uniquely ergodic if and only if the controllers and filters are stable.},

The initial matrix for the algorithms can be obtained by the HIFOO software, called to compute a zero-order controller. Standard benchmark examples demonstrate that this approach yields comparatively superior controllers, resulting in either a lower H ∞ performance index and/or a lower order controller realisation.

By combining adaptive techniques and recursive gain control, an adaptive tracking controller is successfully devised to accomplish asymptotic tracking. An important distinguishing feature of the proposed controller is its integration of a smooth function with a time-varying function that is both integrable and positive. This integration endows the controller with the capability to effectively compensate for unknown time-varying parameters and disturbances. Notably, a Lyapunov function is used to establish the closed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the presented control, surpassing command filter adaptive asymptotic backstepping control and dynamic surface adaptive asymptotic control, addressing the challenge of the ‘explosion of complexity,’ and achieving asymptotic tracking despite the existence of time-varying parameters and disturbances.},

The proposed algorithm contributes to this gap as it automatically tunes the noise covariance matrix using the variational Bayesian approach and its Gaussian sum framework effectively models the non-Gaussian noise. The proposed VB-GSCKF algorithm demonstrates its superiority over other competing adaptive Gaussian filters and new hybrid based estimation approach where the signal is first denoised using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and then the estimation is done using GSCKF in the presence of non-Gaussian and non-stationary measurement noise. Finally, real harmonic data produced by a grid-connected inverter hardware configuration is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VB-GSCKF.},

Since this protocol is the key building block for a wide range of other existing distributed algorithms, its extensions are likewise based on this Laplacian matrix. However, the fixed nature of the null space of this Laplacian matrix limits the composition of complex (i.e. reconfigurable) cooperative behaviours for multiagent systems. Motivated by this standpoint, the contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) For undirected and connected graphs, we introduce a new Laplacian matrix, whose null space is spanned by a user-assigned vector composed of nonzero elements. We give its mathematical definition and show that it inherits key properties of the aforementioned well-known Laplacian matrix. (ii) We next present distributed control architectures for convergence to the desired null space as well as for convergence to a specific vector within that null space. (iii) We finally multiplex information networks to distributively control the null space of this new Laplacian matrix, where this is the most important contribution of this paper. We specifically show that the resulting null space can vary through local interaction rules as desired between the spans of two or more user-assigned vectors to pave the way for composing complex cooperative behaviours for multiagent systems.},

This distributed control approach relies solely on information from each distributed generator(DG) and its neighbours. Each DG receives communication from its neighbours and concurrently broadcasts its own information only when certain deviation were reached, thereby minimising communication costs.

Unlike the traditional results, the switched system with unstabilisable modes is explored and the fixed constraints on the trade-off are relaxed to be greater than the reciprocal of the average time of any given varying period. The interleaving of system switching and event-triggered behaviour causes asynchronous phenomena and additional triggers. To address the two disadvantages, an improved mode-dependent event-triggered with periodic sampling is put forward by the aid of a relative threshold function combined with an asynchronous associated jumping function. A global gain norm term is introduced to relax the existing relative threshold function, which increases the degree of freedom in designing event-triggered mechanism (ETM). By adding a compensation term to the controller design, asynchronous behaviour is addressed without strict assumptions. Based on the proposed ETM and the admissible edge-dependent average dwell time (AED-ADT) switching signal, an improved and less restrictive sufficient criterion has been formulated to ensure the ISS of the system. Finally, a booster converter example is used to show the applicability and another numerical example is used to testify the availability and the advantages of the derived conclusions.},

Subsequently, a novel adaptive updated law is created for co-designing the controller and the switching threshold-based ET mechanism by introducing the Nussbaum-type functions, which effectively handles the effects of the measurement errors due to the ET mechanism, and the challenges of controller design because of the presence of unknown control directions. The proposed control strategy can achieve that the closed-loop system is semi-global finite-time stable in probability, the system states are maintained in the predefined compact sets in a finite time and the system output tracking expectation signal is commendable while easing the communications burden.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the trajectory tracking optimisation control problem of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with external disturbances, and an adaptive disturbance observers-based fixed-time prescribed performance optimisation control strategy is introduced. First, the adaptive disturbance observers are designed to observe the external disturbances in fixed time without the previous knowledge. Then, an adaptive fixed-time prescribed performance controller is designed to enhance the transient and steady-state performances of the system. Meanwhile, the command filters with a fractional-order error compensation system are introduced to solve the issue of differential explosion. Further, an adaptive mutation-sparrow search algorithm (AM-SSA) is constructed to optimise the controller parameters to improve the system's convergence speed and steady-state accuracy. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the system tracking error can converge to the zero region within a fixed time. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are proved through the comparative analysis involving simulations and experiments.},

To improve the actuating performance, an effective control scheme needs to be developed to address the negative effects caused by the nonlinear nature of the internal SMA material and accommodate complex operating conditions. A modified generalised Prandtl-Ishlinskii (MGPI) hysteresis model is proposed to accurately characterise the strong saturated asymmetric hysteresis nonlinearity in the SMA wires. The modification of the input shape function allows for greater flexibility in controller design. Using this hysteresis modelling approach, an adaptive neural network (NN) control with a command filter is designed to achieve superior control performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller strategy.},

In the envisioned scenario, there are inexpensive agents without localisation sensors and limited communication capabilities. More expensive nodes serve as fixed towers and forward noisy position and velocity measurements using directional antennae. There is no assumptions on initial network connectivity. By proposing a set of flocking rules and set-membership estimation, the formation drives to a vicinity of nearby local maximum of the function while having theoretical guarantees of no collisions. The performance of the method is evaluated both in Matlab simulations and using the Crazyswarm package under the robot operating system (ROS) environment, including cases of moving destinations, obstacles, undesirable zones, and different number of nodes and sizes of the mission plane.},

By utilising an extended digraph approach, the trajectories of a signed delayed network are recovered from its corresponding extended unsigned digraph. For higher-order integrator systems with fixed input or communication delay under continuous-time topology, the stability properties are investigated and the upper bounds are determined so that the systems achieve cluster consensus without any change in cluster members. Furthermore, we show that the discrete-time higher-order integrator systems with nonuniform delay reach cluster consensus and are stable under bounded delay provided that the undelayed system is stable.

The dynamics of the SQEIAR model are described by six Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that represent the changes in the susceptible, quarantined, exposed, asymptomatic, infected, and recovered populations. Our goal is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and infected individuals while accounting for the environment, which plays a critical role in the spread of epidemics. We then propose a novel strategy for epidemic control, incorporating two key control measures: regional quarantine for the susceptible population and treatment for the infected. This approach serves as an alternative to widespread quarantine, minimising the economic, social, and other potential impacts. Additionally, we consider the possibility of reinfection among recovered individuals, a common occurrence in many diseases. To demonstrate the practical utility of our results, a numerical example centred on COVID-19 is presented.},

These recurrence equations are then utilised to derive the relevant equations needed to deduce the saddle-point equilibrium solutions for two-player zero-sum games embedded within linear and nonlinear SNSs. The resolution of these equations yields analytical expressions that encapsulate the saddle-point equilibrium solutions for such types of two-player zero-sum games.

Firstly, the dynamics of the driving robot and the vehicle are analysed. Then, the adjoint sensitivity method is used for the DRV to train the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE). The performance of the vehicle under different pedal openings is learned. A RDP controller is designed to solve the nominal target acceleration. Moreover, the unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) method is used to estimate the uncertain external disturbance of the DRV. Furthermore, dynamic compensation is used for the driving robot to track the vehicle's speed. Finally, the stability of the controller is proved.

For scenarios where the tip-sample interaction force is unknown, the proposed model serves as the basis for designing a nonlinear, near-optimal feedback control technique. This control approach guides the cantilever tip along a desired trajectory while maintaining it vertically aligned at the balance point of attraction and repulsion forces. Additionally, a cascaded high-gain observer is designed to estimate AFM dynamics using only the measured piezo tube position. Combined with the near-optimal feedback control, this observer addresses the output feedback control problem. The proposed controller is validated through a simulation example.},

Structural controllability is considered as one of the most prominent network controllability methods. Structural controllability uses the maximum matching algorithm to find the minimum set of control nodes. The maximum matching algorithm on temporal networks is a class of NP-hard problems. In this paper, a novel method based on temporal ACO algorithm is proposed to solve the maximum matching problem in structural controllability. The ACO algorithm has been adapted to temporal networks. The results of implementing the proposed method on real-world datasets demonstrate that the ACO algorithm has a good performance and has converged to the optimal solution with high speed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher efficiency in finding driver nodes and algorithm execution speed compared to the basic structural controllability.},

We consider mode constrained switching, where not all transitions between subsystems are allowed, and where subsystems may exhibit unstable dynamics in the flow and/or jump maps. Based on direct and reverse mode-dependent average dwell-time and activation-time constraints, we derive stability bounds that can be improved by considering longer switching sequences. We provide an example that shows how to ensure the stability robustness of nonlinear systems with a global state weak linearisation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of anti-windup compensator (AWC) design for implementation in the autonomous guidance and control of quadrotors is addressed. The flight environment contains obstacles with no prior knowledge of their locations. Instead, obstacles location are determined in real time, and the locations are used by a guidance algorithm for avoidance. Wind disturbances are also considered since their presence can potentially result in saturation of the propellers. When this occurs, the flight can become unstable, leading to a crash. Designing an AWC to mitigate the effects of saturation in the control system of a quadrotor can be a challenging task due to the heavy couplings and complex nonlinear dynamics. For this reason, we propose a new structure to design a static AWC-based control system to solve this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results are verified by comparing results from simulation experiments.},

We also consider the insurer's ambiguity towards the external source. Specifically, the intensity of the number of events from the external stochastic source cannot be estimated accurately, and hence is treated as a random variable following the insurer's prior distribution. We investigate the mean-variance optimisation problem under smooth ambiguity, which aims to search the optimal strategies in average case. By solving the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(HJB) equations and using the Lagrange multiplier method, we derive the closed-form expressions for the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies. The results suggest that reinsurance may take two different forms, and that reinsurance strategies and investment strategies are influenced by each other. Finally, we analyse the property of strategies under one single factor and the interaction between thinning dependence and smooth ambiguity.},

This combined ORCA-DWA approach effectively combines the speed of DWA planning with the preferred speed of the ORCA algorithm, it not only solves the problem of the ORCA algorithm's difficulty in determining the preferred speed, but also does not deviate from its optimal trajectory while avoiding obstacles. Additionally, an improved dynamic windowing method is proposed to enhance the adaptability to the environment. As a result, the mobile robot can not only use the DWA algorithm to achieve global path optimisation during navigation, but also achieve obstacle avoidance with the shortest time and path while following the robot's own constraints and considering the robot's radius. Simulation results prove that the method can greatly reduce the length and time of path planning and show that this new algorithm can make the robot's speed smoother.},

Since only weak solutions of the NSEs exist globally while global existence of their strong/smooth solutions is a millennium problem, point-wise fluid forces and moments acting on the ocean vehicle are not able to bound. This difficulty is overcome by an appropriate design of control laws and stability analysis of the closed-loop system including the NSEs using a proper extension of the vehicle body. The proposed control design ensures existence of a weak solution and practical exponential stability of the closed-loop system. A simulation on an omni-directional intelligent navigator illustrates the results.},

It has been proved that the K-L divergence between innovations in presence and absence of the attack will intrude the detection threshold if the secret coding matrix is designed appropriately. Sufficient conditions for the detection threshold to be intruded are provided, which essentially provide clues on how the coding matrix should be designed.

Specifically, it focuses on the challenges posed by directed switching topologies, disturbances and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A new approach is introduced to study the consensus tracking problem with a dynamic leader. The proposed strategy utilises a resilient event-triggered consensus tracking control framework, which comprises an event-triggered controller (ETC) and an event-triggering mechanism (ETM). By establishing matrix inequalities and considering parameters associated with DoS attacks and average dwell time, sufficient conditions for solving H ∞ consensus tracking problem are derived. One characteristic of the designed ETM is that events only occur at the triggering or switching time, preventing Zeno behaviour. Furthermore, a resilient event-triggered control strategy is suggested to tackle the containment problem with multiple dynamic leaders. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed control strategies is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

By utilising error scaling functions (ESF), the proposed method effectively confines the error to a predefined neighbourhood in a specified time, without knowing the specific value of the initial error. Furthermore, this article innovatively incorporates the actor-critic structure into the monotone tube boundaries, significantly enhancing system performance. Due to the condition of state immeasurability, a neural network (NN)-based state observer is designed to estimate the states of the system. Additionally, command filters are used to simplify the multiple derivative calculations in traditional backstepping methods, addressing the ‘explosion of complexity’ problem. Mathematical derivations and simulation confirm its ability to meet predefined performance criteria.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the optimal synchronisation problem of multi-agent systems with unknown system dynamics, where each agent is subject to both input saturation and external disturbances. A novel data-driven control approach is developed in this paper based on low-gain technique, output regulation, differential game theory, and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Unlike existing approaches to the data-driven optimal synchronisation problem, our method eliminates the need for an initially admissible stabilising control policy, and the proposed distributed control law ensures asymptotic tracking even in the presence of both modelling disturbances and unmodeled disturbances.},

  abstract     = {This paper concentrates on dealing with two problems of 8/6-type Multi-phase Switched Reluctance Machines (MSRMs). Two problems are the stabilisation of rotational speed and minimising the output torque ripple for this machine. For the first issue, the output torque of 8/6 MSRMs is stabilised by determining an optimal holding time for the switching process. Minimising the total output torque ripple facilitates the 8/6 MSRMs operating more smoothly and counteracts the mechanical vibrations. For the second issue, this paper proposed a new synchronisation of high-order harmonic eradication mechanisms (HF-HEM) based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network and a hyperbolic-secant-like-function hierarchical method. The proposed scheme not only eliminates the high-frequency harmonics but also stabilises the rotational speed of 8/6 MSRMs at the desired values. Finally, the mathematical analyses are given by theorems. All the stable performance and impressive effectiveness of the proposals will be validated in the simulation section.},

First, an adaptive disturbance observer is presented for accurately estimating the lumped disturbances within predefined time. Second, a predefined-time estimator is constructed to obtain estimations of the tracking errors. Finally, a novel event-triggered fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to realise consensus tracking within a predefined time. The Lyapunov method is used to demonstrate that MAS can realise the practical predefined-time leader–follower consensus and rule out Zeno behaviour completely. Furthermore, in contrast to existing findings, the settling time of the presented predefined-time control scheme is determined entirely by a preset value, which benefits the construction of the control scheme based on convergence time requirements. Finally, the presented scheme is applied to the attitude of cooperative control of multi-spacecraft systems, and numerical simulations confirm their effectiveness and superiority.},

A novel output feedback hysteresis state estimator is formulated to estimate the virtual hysteresis state. Additionally, a constructed EID estimator is utilised to estimate the impact of the exogenous disturbances on the proposed system. It is necessary to construct a novel control law that integrates the EID estimation to provide adequate disturbance rejection performance. Utilising both a Lyapunov approach and the EID technique, we derive a collection of adequate conditions to guarantee the stability of the BW hysteresis systems. The representation of these conditions takes the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example illustrating the efficacy and practicality of the devised control strategy is used in conjunction with a real-world application called a piezo-positioning mechanical system.},

By decomposing the generalised input force and coefficient matrix in the dynamic model, a mathematical description of the human-robot training environment was constructed. A new equivalent data-driven model of the walker considering the human-robot training environment was established by using pseudo-Jacobian matrix. The data-driven estimation method for variations in the human-robot training environment was proposed by designing an extended state observer, and the stability of the estimation error system was analysed. In addition, the desired motion velocity of the walker was designed. This approach has the advantage that the safety of the specified velocity can be guaranteed. We proposed the data-driven tracking controller that simultaneously constrains the actual velocity and input force while stabilising the tracking error system. We also illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven algorithm, and whose effectiveness was further verified by simulation-based comparative analysis.},

The estimation error system is guaranteed to be stochastic stable under the passive performance criterion by establishing sufficient conditions using Lyapunov stability theory.

It is a more difficult problem in comparison to the standard identification of a linear system. Based on the basic assumptions, a data-driven approach for the closed-loop identification of the cascaded EIV system is proposed. In the absence of external excitation, identifiability and consistency of model estimation of the plant and the controller are achieved. Without relying on prior knowledge, time delay and model order of the plant and the controller are consistently determined from the respective estimated impulse response coefficients that are estimated by using correlation analysis on two sets of routine operating input/output data. Moreover, the model parameters of the plant and the controller are consistently determined by means of the parameterisation algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by numerical examples.},

To handle the compound constraints, the constraints on control input are solved by transforming the input saturation into an uncertain and bounded control gain firstly. Then, a Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is introduced to limit the output state errors for agents to tackle the output constraints. Moreover, in consideration of the energy constraints inherent to each agent, we have developed a novel event-triggered algorithm. This algorithm is specifically designed to curtail excessive control resource consumption, a situation typically resulting from continuous controller updates in the presence of compound constraints. Further, to overcome the uncertain dynamics in system, adaptive neural networks are introduced to approximate unknown terms. The proposed algorithms are proven to asymptotically converge using Lyapunov stability techniques and the Zeno behaviours are excluded, while simulations demonstrate their effectiveness.},

Then, deliberately constructed prescribed-time switched reduced-order observers are presented to estimate the unmeasurable state. Combing the switched state feedback controllers and reduced-order observers proposed in this note, the closed-loop switched planar systems achieve prescribed-time stability. Meanwhile, the violation of asymmetric output constraints is prevented implicitly by the developed barrier Lyapunov function. The novelty of this approach lies in the ingenious construction of prescribed-time switched observers and the unified design characteristics of the method, which enable the accomplishment of prescribed-time output feedback stabilisation for switched systems with/without output constraints without necessitating any structure modifications to the switched controllers and observers.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to design the output feedback stabilising controller for a class of nonlinear systems. The considered system is in the strict-feedback form, and the nonlinear terms are allowed to depend on both the unmeasured states and the measured output. Meanwhile, the growth rate of the nonlinear term can be a general continuous function of the output, which is not required to be polynomial. We introduce a switching control gain approach and design the controller through considering the output feedback stabilisation based on a linear dynamic. It avoids a continuous update in a control gain. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated through a presented example in the end.},

First, a linear data model (LDM) is presented for the heterogeneous agents by the dynamic linearisation method. The data loss caused by DoS attacks can be effectively resolved through an output compensation mechanism. Subsequently, an RBFNN estimation algorithm is used to approximate the fast varying pseudo partial derivative of LDM. With linearisation on the ideal iterative learning controller, the need to pre-determining the controller structure is eliminated. Then, the learning gain is optimised using Newton-type optimisation and a local ILC protocol relying on neighbouring agents' information is designed. Finally, the convergence of the RBFNN-based DDILC scheme is rigorously analysed and a simulation of four permanent magnet motors is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.},

Due to the special structure of the Volterra model, the approximated model has a high order and some redundant terms. A regularised term is introduced to pick out these redundant terms, and then a proximal gradient method is provided to estimate the unknown parameters of the Volterra model. Furthermore, an accelerated technique is proposed to increase the convergence rates. The advantages of this algorithm are as follows: (1) can pick out the redundant terms without any prior knowledge of the model; (2) has fast convergence rates; and (3) is robust to the step-size. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further substantiated through a simulation example.},

To mitigate errors and approximate unknown functions, radial basis function neural networks are leveraged as part of the solution. By combining neural networks with the backstepping technique, an adaptive finite-time tracking controller is formulated. The utilisation of a common Lyapunov function (CLF) for stability analysis ensures that all closed-loop signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Moreover, the tracking error is guaranteed to converge within a finite time to a defined compact set. The effectiveness of the proposed control methodology is validated through the successful demonstration in two simulation scenarios, including a practical electromechanical system.},

The stealthy attack is considered as that the output information is modified by the malicious attacker. Second, distributed control protocols under Markovian switching topologies are proposed for the MASs based on the designed IOs to achieve bounded consensus. The mean-square error bounds depend on the error bounds of disturbances. After rigorous mathematical proofs, some sufficient conditions are acquired for achieving control goals.

This work proposes a new time-scale redesign-based robust filter backstepping controller for a class of uncertain switched nonlinear systems in strict feedback form. Here, the singular perturbation technique is exploited for two purposes: (1) designing high-gain filters to avoid the explosion of complexity in backstepping design and (2) designing high-gain disturbance observers to mitigate the undesired effects of uncertainties. The discontinuities in the system dynamics and the disturbances coupled with the high-gain filter design give rise to a three-time switched nonlinear closed loop system, whose stability is assured through an average dwell time-based Lyapunov technique. The numerical simulations are carried out on a single link manipulator, which replicates the real-time situations. The results confirmed the proposed approach's applicability to other higher-order systems.},

By using the different inequality techniques (DIT), L' Hoptial' rule and limit algorithms, three criteria to assure the GAS for the DRCHCNS are derived. Up to now, the results on GAS for DRCHCNS have been obtained usually by applying linear matrix inequality (LMI) and matrix measure approach (MMA). But, in this paper, without applying above approaches, we establish the GAS criteria for the DRCHCNS by using L' Hoptial' rule and limit algorithms. So, our study approach for the complex networks (CNS) extends the study fields of synchronisation of the CNS.},

For both models, we assume that waves are subject to an inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition on a portion of the domain's boundary. The analysis of these models presents additional interesting features and challenges compared to their homogeneous counterparts. In the present context, energy depends on the boundary trace of velocity. It is not clear in advance how this quantity should be controlled based on the given data, due to regularity issues. However, we establish global existence and also prove uniform stabilisation of solutions with decay rates characterised by the Neumann input. We supplement these results with numerical simulations in which the data do not necessarily satisfy the given assumptions for decay. These simulations provide, at a numerical level, insights into how energy could possibly change in the presence of, for example, improper data.},

The presence of unknown control coefficients, unknown measurement sensitivity and asymmetric output constraints makes the system under consideration essentially different from those in the existing related works. By constructing a new barrier Lyapunov function and applying homogeneous system theory, a simple proportional-derivative like finite-time output feedback controller is explicitly constructed, which only utilises the output information. A rigorous proof demonstrates that not only the closed-loop system is finite time stable, but also the requirement of asymmetric output constraint can be achieved. The novelty of the control approach lies in that it is capable to handle the FTOFS problem for uncertain planar systems with or without asymmetric output constraints in a unified manner, without changing the control structure. The efficiency of the proposed theoretical results are confirmed by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {While adaptive control has been extensively studied for a variety of uncertain nonlinear systems, overparametrization still exists in many works. By overparametrization, it means that the order of the adaptive controller is (much) higher than the number of unknown parameters of the system, which is a defect from a theoretical perspective and indicates high cost in controller's implementation. This paper investigates adaptive control with lower-order dynamics for nonlinear systems with unknown control coefficients, managing to significantly reduce or eliminate overparametrization and showing the differences in controllers' dynamic orders of different control strategies. The uncertain nonlinear system in question has n unknown control coefficients and a p -dimension unknown vector in the system nonlinearities. We consider two cases of unknown control coefficients: case (a): their signs are known; case (b): their signs are unknown, i.e. unknown control directions. For case (a), first by compensating for unknown control coefficients and their reciprocals, as well as the unknown vector, we design an adaptive controller with ( 2 n + p − 1 ) -order dynamics, where no inequality estimate is used to avoid conservatism of the controller. Second, for case (a), via bounding the system uncertainties by a single unknown constant, we design an adaptive controller with only 1-order dynamics, where inequality estimates are used and hence the controller suffers conservatism. For case (b), by adopting multiple Nussbaum functions, we design a ( 2 n + p − 1 ) -order adaptive controller, where n -order dynamic compensation is employed to overcome n non-identical unknown control directions. As in case (a), because no inequality estimate is used, conservatism of the controller is avoided. Regardless of conservatism, for case (b), by bounding the uncertainties in the destabilizing terms, we design n -order adaptive controller, where, of course, inequality estimates have to be used.},

The aim of this paper is to develop an experimentally efficient framework for data-driven tuning of rational feedforward controllers for general non-commutative MIMO systems. In the developed approach, the nonlinear terms in the non-convex optimisation problem of iterative learning control (ILC) are iteratively circumvented via approximation. This leads to a series of convex optimisation problems that can be solved offline to obtain the parameters of the rational feedforward controller. In addition, by limiting the number of offline iterations an experimentally intensive algorithm is derived, which could be beneficial in the case of severe model mismatch. A simulation study shows that the experimentally efficient approach converges fast through offline iterations and has improved convergence properties through the use of regularisation.},

The study presents a necessary condition for the existence of a monitor-based solution for a non-convex admissible marking set. Subsequently, the disjunctive constraints are developed to derive an optimal supervisory controller, and an algorithm is proposed for solution computation. The design procedure includes off-line computation mechanisms, yielding an optimal (maximally permissive) supervisor with only a few monitors.

Based on this model, output feedback switching fault-tolerant controller is developed.

According to the Lyapunov stability theory, the robust stability analysis is carried out under normal and fault conditions, respectively. Then, depending on the findings of the stability analysis, sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop normal and faulty system are derived.

To reduce the computational complexity, a new method to solve the ORP is adopted in this paper. Firstly, the relationship among the attractors of two BNs and their augmented system is studied, based on which, the ORP is converted into the set stabilisation problem of the original BN, and some necessary and sufficient conditions are given to detect the solvability of the ORP. Secondly, a pinning control for the ORP is considered according to the attractors of the original BNs, and an algorithm to design this kind of controls is provided. Finally, a practical example of signal transduction network is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method in this paper.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an improved Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) scheme for nonlinear control-affine systems, achieving superior robustness/ performance trade-offs. By leveraging the flatness property within a closed-loop structure, Nonlinear Internal Model Control (NLIMC) is employed as a model-based controller utilises partial plant knowledge to enhance control performance and eliminate static tracking errors. Subsequently, an improved Extended State Observer (IESO) is incorporated with NLIMC to address unmodelled dynamics, disturbances, and parameter uncertainties in addition to the full state's estimation. The IESO's added hyperbolic function dynamic ensures higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to conventional linear ESOs, especially in case of large errors. Control performances are evaluated through a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) application. Numerical simulations have been carried out and the results confirm its effectiveness and superiority compared to Ocean Disturbance Observer-based Double-loop Sliding Mode Controller (ODSMC) and the linear ADRC.},

A secure boundary protection method (SBPM) and a new prescribed finite-time performance function (PFTPF) are proposed. The SBPM can construct automatically two adjustable secure boundaries, so that the system meets both the control performance prescribed by the PFTPF and the constraint of the secure boundaries. In order to solve the problem of the excessive jitter of control input caused by the mutation of the output constraint, a bidirectional filtering smoothing mechanism (BFSM) is proposed. The proposed method can effectively deal with the mutation of actual output constraint, and it is not necessary to predict the system output value to adjust the desired output trajectory.

The developed control law addresses the issue of the ‘explosion of terms’ encountered in the backstepping method and improves the transient stability of the closed-loop power system. By utilising Lyapunov stability arguments, the proposed control approach ensures that all tracking errors of the overall closed-loop dynamics converge within specified bounds. The radii of these bounds can be adjusted by selecting sufficiently large gain control parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, simulations are conducted on an IEEE 9-bus multi-machine power system. The findings indicate that the proposed control method is both simple and efficient, exhibiting exceptional dynamic performance while eliminating the need for filters. Moreover, it outperforms existing control methodologies such as backstepping control, dynamic surface control, and command-filtered backstepping control in terms of enhanced transient performance.},

A new robust controller is proposed to guarantee practical or asymptotic stability under non-vanishing or vanishing unmatched uncertainties. First, the system uncertainties are decomposed optimally into the matched and unmatched portions with an objective of the minimum norm for the unmatched part. Next, instead of a robust control design based on only the matched part of uncertainties commonly used in the previous works, a robust controller is synthesised based on both matched and mismatched portions of the uncertainties. It is shown that in uncertain systems whose state cannot simultaneously stay in a so-called null set and diverge to infinity, the proposed controller guarantees stability no matter how large the input-unrelated unmatched uncertainties are. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed controller is more robust against uncertainties, and offers improved damping and stabilisation features.},

Thus, in the design procedure, first, a Luenberger observer is designed, and then the adaptive output feedback controller is constructed via the estimated states and adaptation law.

The existence of uncertainties naturally requires the introduction of adaptive compensation mechanisms, while, convergence rate, as an important performance specification, is usually hard to attain in the context of adaptive control. For this, we are compelled to pursue a comprehensive and competent adaptive compensation mechanism which possesses dual capabilities of compensating uncertainties and affording convergence rate. Crucially, a subtle dynamic gain is designed with its dynamic updating law incorporating exponential-type time-varying information. Notably, the gain would not only deal with the unknown polynomial-of-output growth rate but particularly ensure exponential convergence with the convergence rate online adjusting in conformity to the dynamic uncertainties. Correspondingly, an adaptive output-feedback controller is constructed based on a dynamic-gain observer, which can render exponential convergence for system and observer states.},

  abstract     = {This paper recommends an unknown input observer (UIO) for uncertain nonlinear time-delay dynamics that enables online fault estimation. The main novelty of this paper is designing UIO to fault estimation for nonlinear systems that include time-varying delays in states and time-varying uncertainties in all matrices of the system. The other advantage of the proposed method is that both abrupt and incipient faults are considered. Furthermore, the state and output disturbances, as well as actuator and sensor faults, are considered. The Lyapunov–Krasovskii concept is used to guarantee the stability of the augmented closed-loop system. Calculating observer gains and stabilisation of estimation error dynamics are accomplished by utilising a new linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, an uncertain continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with a time-varying delay is used to evaluate the performance of the suggested technique.},

The uncertainties arising from the actuator fault and external disturbances are treated as lumped uncertainties, and fixed-time observers are designed to observe them. The fault-tolerant controller with full-state constraints is then developed using the fixed-time backstepping method, integrating the Improved Prescribed Performance Function (IPPF) method and the Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) method. Additionally, command filters with error compensations are devised to resolve the ‘explosion of complexity’ problem during the controller derivation process. The parameters of the designed controller are optimised using the Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) algorithm to enhance nonlinear systems’ dynamic performance. Lastly, the validity and practicality of the proposed approach are verified through the comparative study of simulations and experiments, with the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) position system employed as a case study.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate an SEIR epidemic model in which recruitment is assumed to be regulated by a constant function. The SEIR model is a widely-used epidemiological framework that categorises the population into four distinct groups: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed. It employs a system of differential equations to describe the transitions of individuals among these groups, making it a valuable tool for understanding and modelling the dynamics of infectious diseases. Mathematical analysis is used to study the dynamic behaviour of this model. We first determine the basic reproduction number, denoted as R 0 , which governs the dynamics of the SEIR model. Our findings reveal that when R 0 is less than 1, the unique disease-free equilibrium is asymptotically stable, and there is no endemic equilibrium. However, when R 0 exceeds 1, the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable, and a unique, asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium emerges. Furthermore, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, we have studied the global asymptotic stability of the two equilibrium points. On the other hand, we have used the backstepping method to design a control law that stabilises the SEIR model towards the disease-free equilibrium, which means the eradication of the disease from the target population. Next, we have used the same method to synchronise the SEIR drive system and the SEIR response system. This method is used to stabilise the synchronisation error dynamics arising from the mismatch between the drive and response systems. Finally, we presented numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Different from existing results that ignore the dynamics of the actuator, this paper considers a hydraulic actuator in the controller design. To address the nonlinearities of hydraulic active suspension systems, a new low-complexity fixed-time prescribed performance control method is proposed. In this method, the function approximators (e.g. neural networks (NNs) and fuzzy systems (FSs)) are not needed, which means that the heavy computational costs are avoided. Furthermore, by developing a fixed-time performance function, the proposed method can ensure that the suspension motions converge to the prescribed range within a finite time. Based on the Lyapunov theorem and Extreme Value Theorem, the stability of the closed-loop suspension system is strictly proved. Finally, the comparative simulation results show that the proposed method effectively improves the attitude stability and ride comfort of the suspension system.},

In order to determine the feedback control law, we consider an extended system coupling the equations governing the Navier–Stokes problem with an equation satisfied by the control on the bluff body, which is a part of the domain boundary. We utilize the artificial compressibility method, which approximates the Navier–Stokes equations in the limit, along with a priori estimation techniques, to establish a boundary control. Such a control law ensures that the prescriptions of the drag and lift coefficients are attained. Subsequently, a compactness result allows to let the compressibility parameter tend to zero. The application of the Faedo-Galerkin method is essential in reaching this result.},

Firstly, to enhance the dynamical performance, a continuous terminal sliding mode surface is designed to guarantee that surface and errors are stable finite-time convergent to origin. Second, a feedback control term is developed to depict the hydrodynamic, uncertainties and disturbance estimation error. Then, an adaptive nested estimation technology is developed to approach the disturbance, in which a virtual torque is tuned by the low-pass filtering, and dual nested adaptive laws are provided to approximate this virtual torque and its time derivative, which can constrain the residual error to a small elliptic domain. The validity of our proposed control is verified by Lyapunov stability theory, and its reliability is proved in the simulation cases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, considering the physical restriction of hypersonic vehicle systems in a practical flight environment, the altitude tracking problem is studied with input magnitude, input rate, output constraints, system parameter uncertainties and disturbances, which expands the traditional considerations of control methods in the hypersonic vehicle field. The hyperbolic tangent function is employed to address the system input constraints. Furthermore, the incorporation of barrier Lyapunov function serves to ensure that the system output is limited in the prescribed limitations. In particular, two extended state observers are integrated to eliminate errors from model uncertainties and disturbances. Based on the effective combination of these techniques and auxiliary variable designs, a novel backstepping controller is proposed to simultaneously handle problems of input and output constraints, model uncertainties and disturbances. The closed-loop system stability is demonstrated using the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller compared with the traditional backstepping controller.},

Instead of using only one control method, a control scheme combining periodically intermittent control with H ∞ performance is employed. By manipulating the algebraic graph theory and constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals, sufficient solutions assuring the exponential H ∞ consensus of the considered systems are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The communication graph among the followers is directed, which removes the restrictions on undirected graph or balanced graph in the literature.

Such a scheme, referred to as the robust RGMPC, can handle (possibly nonlinear) state and input constraints and only requires solving an optimisation problem for MPC with polytopic input constraints, for which fast algorithms exist. Conditions are given which ensure recursive feasibility of the robust RGMPC scheme, finite-time convergence of the modified reference command to the desired reference command and asymptotic convergence of the state to an invariant neighbourhood of the associated set-point. Simulation results for a constrained spacecraft rendezvous manoeuvre demonstrate that the rRGMPC scheme has lower average computational time than several robust state and input-constrained MPC controllers.},

Firstly, the double time-delay dynamic response equation of the system with three degrees of freedom is established. Then, the root mean square values of seat acceleration and body acceleration are used as the objective functions. Meanwhile, the RMS values of suspension dynamic deflection and tire dynamic displacement are used as constraints, and the optimal feedback parameters are obtained using particle swarm optimisation. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and frequency domain scanning methods are used to verify the stability of the double time-delay system. Finally, simulation in the time domain and frequency domain is accomplished. It is verified that this feedback control method has strong robustness and anti-interference ability.},

Two new approaches, namely, delayed state-feedback (DSF) and predictor state feedback (PSF), are introduced to address these challenges and enable the design of real-time-implementable state-feedback controllers. DSF leverages a static-output-feedback framework, while PSF utilises a state predictor to compensate for the delay. It is shown that both DSF and PSF can achieve stability under specific conditions.

We first model the traffic flow of an urban area and derive a state-space model composed of multiple compartments. Each compartment expresses the dynamics of the traffic demand that depends on drivers' decision-making on route choices influenced by tolling. Two practical properties are found in the proposed state space model: one is the positivity of the model, and the other is the conservation law in the number of vehicles. Based on the positivity of the model, we next propose the optimal tolling design aiming at the peak demand mitigation, which is expressed by nonlinear programming. We transform the nonlinear programming into a linear one, which is numerically tractable. Finally, we show that the proposed tolling design mitigates the peak demand in designated compartments in a numerical experiment and present a demonstration of the proposed control system.},

  abstract     = {Over two thirds of women of all ages in the UK have experienced some form of sexual harassment in a public space. Recent tragic incidents involving female pedestrians have highlighted some of the personal safety issues that women still face in cities today. There exist many popular location-based safety applications as a result of this; however, these applications tend to take a reactive approach where action is taken only after an incident has occurred. This paper proposes a preventative approach to the problem by creating safer public environments through societal incentivisation. The proposed system, called ‘Herd Routes’, improves the safety of female pedestrians by generating busier pedestrian routes as a result of route incentivisation. A novel application of distributed ledgers and ergodic feedback control is proposed to provide security and trust, a record of system users' locations and IDs, and a platform for token exchange. A proof-of-concept was developed using the simulation package SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), and a smartphone application was built in Android Studio so that pedestrian Hardware-in-the-Loop testing could be carried out to validate the technical feasibility and desirability of the system. With positive results from the initial testing of the proof-of-concept, further development could significantly contribute towards creating safer pedestrian routes through cities, and tackle the societal change that is required to improve female pedestrian safety in the long term.},

For classic controllability, the multiplicity of eigenvalue zero of general Laplacian matrix 𝐿 ∗ is shown to be determined by the sum of the numbers of zero circles, identical nodes and opposite pairs; however, it is always simple for the Laplacian L with diagonal entries in absolute form. For a fixed structurally balanced topology, the controllable subspace is proved to be invariant even if the antagonistic weights are selected differently under the corresponding protocol with L . For a graph expanded from a star graph rooted from a single leader, the dimension of controllable subspace is two under the protocol associated with L ∗ . In addition, the system is structurally controllable under both protocols if and only if the topology without unaccessible nodes is connected. As a reinforcing case of structural controllability, strong structural controllability requires the system to be controllable for any choice of weights. The connection between parent nodes and child nodes affects strong structural controllability because it determines the linear relationship of the control information from parent nodes. This discovery is a major factor in establishing the sufficient conditions on strong structural controllability for multi-agent systems under both protocols, rather than for complex networks, about latter results are already abundant. Finally, we present a sufficient and necessary condition to identify the strong structural controllability. Moreover, a method to construct a strongly structurally controllable graph is proposed.},

Contraction analysis considers stability with respect to a nominal trajectory rather than an equilibrium point. If two neighbouring trajectories of a system are located in a contraction region, then they will tend to each other and to a nominal trajectory. In the event-triggered control algorithm that we introduce, we suggest to update the control law whenever the system trajectory is about to leave the contraction region. We show that such a scheduling of the control law guarantees system stability, and we show that a minimum inter-event time exists between consecutive updates of the control law. We also show how to place the system trajectory in a contraction region and demonstrate that the classical controllability assumption on LTV systems is enough to ensure the existence of the required transformation to perform that.},

Unlike some existing linear parameter-varying results that treat system parameters as time invariant factors, this paper makes full use of the nonlinearity and time-varying characteristics of system through introducing a novel delay-and-parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. The main conclusions are discussed in three cases (system without input, system with disturbance input, system with disturbance input and control input). And the H ∞ stabilisation problem is solved by constructing a controller which is inserted with system parameters and their derivatives. The structures of Lyapunov function and controller lead to that the derived criteria for exponential stabilisation are expressed by state-and-parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities, which are efficiently solved by sum-of-squares program. The effectiveness and superiority are verified through two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Given the importance of renewable energies, several countries are integrating these energies into their energy strategies, such as their connections to the grid, in particular photovoltaic energy. In this paper, a PV grid-connected system in a two-stage configuration is studied. In this configuration, an improvement to a control MPPT is proposed. To achieve this, we propose a novel concept for MPPT control that consists of generating an adaptive step size for P&O control that is based on sliding mode control in order to minimise ripple phenomena and chattering phenomena. The proposed control approach was then tested using MATLAB/Simulink simulations under varying irradiation conditions. We compared this approach to the conventional P&O method as well as the adaptive step size of P&O and hybrid P&O-sliding mode control. The results of the test indicate that the proposed control strategy significantly minimises the two phenomena and improves overall efficiency.},

Sufficient criteria for achieving FTSS are established, and the estimates of TC and EC are further obtained. At last, the validity of theoretical findings is checked using numerical simulations.

First, a sufficient criterion ensuring the cone invariance of the system is introduced. By exploring the monotonicity of system trajectories, a condition that is both sufficient and necessary for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the system is presented. Importantly, under a weak assumption for the growth rate of time-varying delays, a universal framework is provided for characterising the decay rate of the system. Furthermore, typical examples of decay rate analysis are presented when delays are bounded or experience linear, sublinear, or logarithmic growth rates. Eventually, the rationality of the results is illustrated through a numerical simulation.},

A novel weight-tuning law by using the control input error, integral Bellman error, and the NN identifier is used for the actor-critic framework. A novel lifelong learning (LL)-based method for critic NN is utilised in an optimal framework by incorporating the Bellman error to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multitasking scenarios.

It is well-known that this controller preserves stability in the face of large rotor resistance variations – which are inevitable in practical scenarios – but its performance is significantly degraded. To overcome this drawback many adaptation schemes have been reported, both in drives and control-oriented publications, with the overwhelming majority of these developments done in continuous-time . This, in spite of the fact that the IFOC, as well as their proposed adaptive versions, involve the solution of highly nonlinear differential equations, whose discretization is far from obvious. In this paper we try to reverse this trend and present a discrete-time estimator of the motor parameters and an adaptive IFOC based on it. It is shown that the proposed estimator and adaptive controller are globally convergent under very weak prior knowledge and excitation assumptions. Simulations, that validate the theoretical claims and illustrate the robustness of the schemes, are also presented.},

To assess secondary infections, four effective reproduction rates are computed corresponding to different disease states. The sensitivity analysis of the reproduction rates is conducted using the PRCC to identify influential compartments and parameters. The model is extended to incorporate five time-dependent control interventions to reduce infected compartments, with optimisation performed using the Pontryagin maximum principle. A cost-effectiveness analysis of these strategies is conducted using the average cost-effectiveness ratio. Analysis shows that the model does not undergo backward bifurcation, meaning a stable disease-free equilibrium cannot coexist with a stable endemic equilibrium. The findings show that strict adherence to standard operating procedures is the most effective single intervention.

  abstract     = {For processes with strong nonlinearity and fast response, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm is proposed based on Laguerre functions and Radial Basis Function-based AutoRegressive model with eXogenous variable (RBF-ARX-LMPC), which is built to capture the nonlinear dynamics of such process. Firstly, the RBF-ARX model is transformed into an extended Non-Minimal State-Space (NMSS) model in which integral action and set-point information are naturally contained to decrease steady-state error. Then, to reduce computational burden, the control variables of the NMPC is parameterised by Laguerre polynomials for dimensionality reduction. The proposed control strategy is applied to a maglev ball system and is compared with Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller, the RBF-ARX model-based Linear Quadratic Regulator (RBF-ARX-LQR), and the RBF-ARX model-based Model Predictive Control (RBF-ARX-MPC). The experimental results show that the proposed control strategy improves transient performance and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) is a powerful tool for solving Nonlinear Model Predictive Control problems (NMPC), enabling the handling of time-varying input constraints and cost functions. However, applying PMP encounters challenges when state constraints must be satisfied. This arises because the optimal trajectory often requires a blend of unconstrained and constrained arcs with unknown junction points. To address this issue, relaxation methods are frequently explored, where state constraints are replaced with penalty functions. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a method of penalty functions allowing for coping with soft state constraints is examined. We prove the recursive feasibility of this method and demonstrate its efficiency in a numerical example. Second, the finite-time practical stability for the optimal reference tracking NMPC problem is addressed. By appropriately choosing the terminal cost, one can guarantee the convergence of the state vector to a predefined neighbourhood of the target state.},

A major critical issue concerns the prediction of future asset returns to forecast market evolution, due to the non-stationarity and volatility of asset prices. In this work, a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for multi-period portfolio optimization is proposed, where the return prediction model is estimated via a novel trading-oriented learning paradigm. According to such a perspective, the model parameters are not the ones minimizing the prediction error but those that directly maximize the investor's utility.

The proposed method has two main features. First, the number of nonlinear terms in the stability conditions is independent of the number of switched system modes. The result is that the computational cost is reduced, and it can be applied to switched systems with a large number of subsystems. Second, using switched Lyapunov functions, hybrid switching laws are designed to preserve the practical stability property in both the closed-loop state-dependent switching function and the open-loop time-dependent one. As a result, when the state data is lost during sensor or communication failures, the controller can change the control scheme from a closed-loop state-dependent switching function to an open-loop time-dependent one without loss of stability property. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Since the dead-zone phenomenon is frequently encountered in the control of nonlinear strict feedback system, it is very necessary to consider the effect of dead-zone in the OB control. However, the published OB control methods are to rarely deal with the dead-zone problem because of the complex algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL). In this OB control, the dead-zone problem is effectively solved by utilising a simplified RL algorithm. For effective eliminating the effect of dead-zone, an adaptive compensation of dead-zone function's remainder is added to this RL. Since the RL under identifier-critic-actor architecture is implemented in every backstepping step, the requirement of complete dynamic acknowledge is released. Ultimately, the validity of this OB method is certified both theory and simulation.},

The delay-range dependent stability conditions of the closed-loop system are analysed using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) approach, which involves solving an LMI problem to determine the parameters of the proposed controller.

We first study switched homogeneous positive nonlinear systems (SHPNS) case, then we extend the SHPNS to a time-varying SHNS case. The primary difficulty of this research is the estimation of Lyapunov function value at switching-impulse points under the coupling effects of synchronous switches and state jumps. By employing the max-separable Lyapunov function approach, we present new sufficient stability criteria and design new switching-impulse signals, and successfully establish the new relation between the average dwell time parameter and impulse strength.

A novel disturbance observer is developed to estimate disturbances characterised by a nonlinear exogenous system. To enhance control performance, a PPF that characterises both transient and steady-state behaviour is used for the transformation of tracking errors. It can be proved that all the states of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and that the tracking error evolves within the prespecified boundaries.

  abstract     = {We propose an adaptive algorithm for identifying the unknown parameter (possibly vector-valued) in a linear stable single-input single-output infinite-dimensional system. We assume that the transfer function of the infinite-dimensional system can be expressed as a ratio of two infinite series in s (the Laplace variable). We also assume that certain identifiability conditions, which include a persistency of excitation condition, hold. For a fixed integer n , we propose an adaptive update law (a differential equation in time) driven by real-time input-output data for estimating the first n + 1 coefficients in the numerator and the denominator of the transfer function. We show that the estimates for the transfer function coefficients generated by the update law are close to the true values at large times provided n is sufficiently large (the estimates converge to the true values as time and n tend to infinity). The unknown parameter can be reconstructed using the transfer function coefficient estimates obtained with n large and the algebraic expressions relating the transfer function coefficients to the unknown parameter. We also provide a numerical scheme for verifying the identifiability conditions and for choosing n sufficiently large so that the value of the reconstructed parameter is close to the true value. The class of systems to which our approach is applicable includes many partial differential equations with constant/spatially-varying coefficients and distributed/boundary input and output. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach using three examples: a delay system with four unknown scalars, a 1D heat equation with two unknown scalars and a 1D wave equation with an unknown linearly-varying (in space) coefficient.},

In addition, the considered multi-objective controlled optimisation problem is governed by several mixed constraints generated by partial derivatives of second order and uncertain data. For this new class of control problems, we establish and characterise Wolfe, Mond-Weir and mixed type robust dual models. To this aim, by using the notion of convex multiple integral functional , generated by a controlled second-order Lagrangian with uncertain data, and the concept of robust weak efficient solution to the problem under study, we build a new mathematical context to state and prove the duality theorems.},

Then an adaptive finite-time ELM-based velocity observer is developed to estimate the unavailable velocity states. Further, based on the estimations and the approximations of model uncertainties, an adaptive finite-time observer-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode (TSM) control strategy is constructed to guarantee the finite-time bounded tracking of the uncertain EL system by using the Lyapunov stability theorem.

Our proposed algorithm employs two new lists – a mergeable list and a non-mergeable list – which store state pairs that have been confirmed to be control consistent or inconsistent, respectively. With these two lists, our algorithm eliminates any repeated control consistency checks, and guarantees that every state pair will be checked exactly once. We prove that the time complexity of our new algorithm is O ( n 2 ) , where n is the state number of the supervisor; this improves all previously known results on supervisor reduction/localisation algorithms. We employ numerical examples to empirically compare the computation time and local controller's state number obtained by our proposed algorithm and the original supervisor reduction/localisation algorithms.},

Other contributing factors include system parameter uncertainty, functional uncertainty that originates from input functions, and sensors noises to mention a few. This indeterminism has led to major challenges in the development of accurate control methods for atomic scale systems. To address the probabilistic and uncertain nature of these systems, this work proposes a novel control framework that considers the representation of the quantum system states and the quantification of its physical properties following a probabilistic approach. Our framework is fully probabilistic. It uses the Shannon relative entropy from information theory to design optimal randomised controllers that can achieve a desired outcome of an atomic scale system. Two experiments are carried out to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

More specifically, torque–speed characteristic safe limit functions associated to each actuator are taking into account to ensure that besides of global joint positioning, the requested torque control inputs to robot actuators remain inside user prescribed safe operating torque–speed areas, so avoiding thermal and physical actuator damages. A static smooth nonlinear controller is proposed to achieve global position regulation under prescribed speed-depending bound torque input. Numerical simulations and experimental results are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

A nonlinear closed-loop feedback system is designed, whose solutions converge to a target set consisting of the optimal points of the underlying optimisation problem. The feedback law for the control input of the nonlinear dynamical system is designed by exact linearisation of a dynamical formulation of a first-order optimality condition. For the problem formulation and the stability analysis of the nonlinear closed-loop feedback system, the notion of V-detectability is considered. An application to energy-optimal feed-forward torque control for different types of synchronous machines is presented, which demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

  abstract     = {Due to the nonlinearities and operational constraints of quadcopters, Model Predictive Control (MPC) encounters the requirement of high computational power. This problem may prove impractical, especially for hardware-limited setups. By removing the need for online solvers, Explicit MPC (ExMPC) stands out as a strong candidate. Yet, the formulation was usually hindered by the system's nonlinearity and dimensionality. In this paper, we propose an ExMPC solution for quadcopter position stabilisation. With the former issue, the system is exactly linearised into a concatenation of three double integrators. For the latter, with a suitable characterisation of the new convoluted constraints, the stabilising ExMPC can be computed for each double integrator separately. The controller is validated via simulations and experiments on a nanodrone platform. The proposed scheme provides similar performance and theoretical guarantees to the up-to-date nonlinear MPC solutions but with notably less computational effort, allowing scalability in a centralised manner.},

By constructing an auxiliary control problem without regime switching, together with the classical results on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and fixed-point method, we prove the regularity of the value function. When the current state of the Markov chain is given, we found that the optimal policies for an insurer in a multiple-regime market is the same as those in a single-regime market. Explicit optimal policies can be derived when the premium is calculated by the expectation principle. For more general cases, numerical schemes for value functions and feedback optimal policies are given by the Markov chain approximating method.},

The finite-time θ - D method is proposed to control the Cobra maneuver. Based on this technique, the intractable Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation can be approximated by a differential Riccati equation and a series of state-dependent Lyapunov equations, which can be solved recursively and lead to the closed-form state feedback control law . This control law can achieve semi-global asymptomatic stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed technique is compared favourably with the finite-time state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique in terms of computation efficiency and control effort, and also shows faster recovery of the quadrotor after the Cobra maneuver compared with conventional dynamics without the derivative of the rotation matrix.},

The anti-windup compensator contains two distinct elements: one to assuage the effects of quantization, the other to do the same when saturation occurs. Theoretical results provide conditions which must be satisfied in order for the two-stage anti-windup compensator to bestow stability on the resulting closed-loop system. These results are expressed as linear matrix inequalities and naturally lead to algorithms for anti-windup design. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

The major difficulties are that the actuator dynamics is covered by an unstable heat equation and it has non-collocated configuration between control input and disturbance. To overcome these difficulties, the trajectory planning technique is first introduced to carry the disturbance to control channel, and then backstepping strategy is applied to cope with the source term of instability in the heat equation. Following, by virtue of system similarity, the recently developed dynamic compensation approach for linear system is utilised to guarantee the performance output tracks reference signal exponentially and closed-loop states are uniformly bounded.

The admissible controls are piecewise continuous and bounded vector-functions with values from some parallelepiped. The original problem is reduced to unconditional minimisation of some penalty functional which takes into account constraints in the form of differential equations, constraints on the initial and the final positions of the object as well as constraints on controls. Moreover, it is known that this functional vanishes on the solution of the original problem and only on it. The quasidifferentiability of this functional is proved, necessary and sufficient conditions for its minimum are written out in terms of quasidifferential. Further, in order to solve the obtained minimisation problem in the functional space the method of quasidifferential descent is applied. The algorithm developed is demonstrated by examples.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of non-smooth finite-time (FT) adaptive state feedback stabilisation is investigated for asymmetric output-constrained cascade switched nonlinear systems (AOCCSNSs) with mixed powers, parametric uncertainties and zero dynamics. To better address the uncertain parameters and the asymmetric output constraints, a new type of common Lyapunov function (CLF) including a quadratic squared term of the estimated error and a tangent-type barrier Lyapunov function ( T t -BLF) is constructed. Then, with some mild assumptions, such as input-to-state stability (ISS) property of zero dynamics, upper boundedness of subsystems' nonlinear terms and some well-known small signal conditions, state feedback controllers (SFCs) constructed by adding a power integrator (AAPI) technique and the update law to estimate the unknown parameter are proposed to guarantee resultant closed-loop switched systems FT stable. The proposed method for switched systems is presented in a unified manner, capable of addressing FT stabilisation by effectively handling situations with or without output constraints. This is achieved through the construction of T t -BLF, which degenerates into a quadratic form when the output constraint disappears or approaches infinity. At last, the method is verified by a switched RLC circuit system (RLC-CS) and a numerical simulation.},

Transient vibration of the powertrain caused by sudden changes in the engine torque significantly degrades the driving performance and driver comfort. In addition, the nonlinear characteristics owing to the backlash increase the adverse effects of these oscillations. To suppress the transient vibration of the powertrain, a controller is designed based on the mixed H 2 /H ∞ control theory. Subsequently, to adjust for the vibration amplification owing to the backlash, we propose the application of a shock-reducing controller based on the FSC. Linearly decreasing the inertia weight in particle swarm optimisation (LDWPSO) was applied to the design of this controller and parameters were optimised. Finally, simulations were conducted using the control method; the controller could prevent the occurrence of shocks owing to the gear collisions and achieved smooth an acceleration.},

Firstly, in the case that the system dynamics is known, the optimal controller and optimal switching condition are determined by introducing a non-quadratic cost function and employing the embedding transformation technique. After that, an adaptive algorithm is established for estimating the unknown dynamics of the switched linear systems. Then, when the system dynamics is unknown, the adaptive optimal controller and optimal switching condition are deduced by resorting to the certainty equivalent principle. A common Lyapunov function is constructed, by using which, it is proved that the closed-loop system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable. Simulations are finally conducted to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Model-based control systems allow engineers to leverage known system information in controllers, often resulting in improved control accuracy or robustness. However, these system models can change over time, be difficult to obtain for complex systems, or fail to capture higher-order effects in the system. In this work, we use a highly robust model-based control methodology, sliding mode control, without the need for an a priori model. We use a neural network to learn an approximate system model fully online, with no pretraining. The neural network term is found to increase control accuracy while alleviating chatter, the primary drawback of conventional sliding mode control. The controller is verified by simulating a non-planar 3 degree-of-freedom robotic arm picking up a load, and the proposed controller is shown to outperform conventional model-based sliding mode control, especially when the built-in load margin on the end effector in the conventional model-based controller is exceeded.},

On the one hand, the properties of the bisimulation relation between two different NFSRs are examined, while on the other hand, a necessary and sufficient condition is discovered, as well as a reduction strategy utilising bisimulation.

We firstly propose the formulation of the optimal control problem (OCP) of maximising the probability of finite-time reachability subject to output trackability. Then, by converting the dynamics of MJSBCNs into an equivalent expectation system, an LLO is established for MJSBCNs. In this setup, a Luenberger-like observation matrix is constructed, which is an effect tool to solve the finite-time reachability problem. Finally, an LLO method is developed to find the FHOCS by maximising the T -step Luenberger-like observation matrix. In a biological example, we show the effectiveness of our developed methods.},

Model reduction and transfer learning techniques are introduced to improve robustness of RBFNN optimal control, and reduce computational time. Numerical and experimental results show that the resulting optimal control has excellent control performance in stabilisation and trajectory tracking, and much-improved robustness to disturbances and model uncertainties even when the system responses move to a domain of the state space that is larger than the domain where the neural networks are trained.},

The incomplete measurement problem caused by packet loss, saturation, and other issues during data transmission can lead to the unavailability of system state variables, which can degrade system performance and even lead to instability. To solve these problems, a state estimator for data-losing case and two controllers for normal and data-losing cases are designed utilising event-triggered strategies which can reduce the burden of calculation and data transmission. Radial basis function neural networks are adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinear system functions. A strict stability analysis in probability shows that the control laws for the considered strict-feedback nonlinear system can guarantee all the closed-loop to be uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square.

One such bio-inspired optimal control approach, applicable in static environments, is ‘local pursuit’, a method that iteratively solves partially-constrained final state problems by having agents follow one another, each agent moving optimally towards its predecessor. We show that if, instead, agents evolve in their own time-delayed ‘copy’ of the environment and act based on the most recent time history of their predecessors local neighbourhoods, then the original method can be extended to the dynamic environments described above. Furthermore, we discuss the computational complexity of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and computational advantages in a series of simulations.},

The constraints imposed on the motion of the mobile robot system are not integrable and have no inverse resolution, and thus increase the complexity of the controller design for non-holonomic systems. A system decomposition approach is proposed to convert the non-holonomic constraint control system to the cascade holonomic constraint control subsystems, and an adaptive control gain technique is presented to guarantee the stability of the non-holonomic system.

However, new challenges arise for sensor activation in networked discrete-event systems, where observation delays and control delays exist between the sensor systems and the agent. In this paper, a new framework for activating sensors in networked discrete-event systems is established. In this framework, we construct a communication automaton that explicitly expresses the interaction process between the agent and the sensor systems over the observation channel and the control channel. Based on the communication automaton, we can define dynamic observations of a communicated string. To guarantee that a sensor activation policy is physically implementable and insensitive to non-deterministic control delays and observation delays, we further introduce the definition of delay feasibility. We show that a delay feasible sensor activation policy can be used to dynamically activate sensors even if control delays and observation delays exist. A set of algorithms are developed to minimise sensor activation in a transition-based domain while ensuring a given specification condition is satisfied. A practical example is also provided to show the application of the proposed framework. Finally, we briefly discuss how to extend the proposed framework to a decentralised observation setting.},

This approach provides partially decentralised adaptive output feedback controllers with three event-triggered mechanisms to achieve the global practical tracking of a family of uncertain large-scale nonlinear systems subject to unknown control coefficients and strongly interconnected nonlinearities with output-polynomial growth rate. The dual gains are embedded in the observers and controllers, which can effectively compensate for time-varying control coefficients and unknown constant growth rate multiplied by output-polynomial function. Three different threshold schemes including fixed threshold, relative threshold and time-varying threshold are introduced to save communication resources. The stability analysis shows that the solutions of the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded and the tracking error converges to a preset compact set after a finite time; also, there will be no zeno behaviour in the closed-loop response.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of global output-feedback tracking control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. The system studied in this paper has unknown time-varying control coefficients and unknown reference signal. Notably, the nonlinearities of the system are bounded by the lower triangular linear unmeasured states multiplying the unknown constant, the polynomial-of-output and the polynomial-of-input growth rates, which indicates the presence of serious uncertainties. Motivated by the closely related works, by combining the ideas of universal control and deadzone with backstepping technique, this paper presents a new adaptive tracking control scheme based on two dynamic high-gains in the new forms. The proposed control scheme ensures that the tracking error converges to a specified arbitrarily small interval range after a finite time while the state of the resulting closed-loop system is globally bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the control scheme is verified by an illustrative example.},

First, estimates of faults and disturbances in the system can be obtained by designing observers. Then, through the obtained estimation, the controller with anti-interference performance and fault tolerance performance is designed. Under the arbitrary switching rules and the minimum dwell time switching rules, the stability of the system is guaranteed.

  abstract     = {For the nonlinear systems with input delay, an adaptive fixed-time tracking control strategy based on multi-dimensional Taylor network (MTN) is proposed for the first time. First, to address the main challenge brought by input delay, an auxiliary system is constructed, which transforms the input delay systems into non-delay systems. Second, the MTNs are introduced into the backstepping design process, which reduce the design difficulty by approximating unknown nonlinear functions. Thus, a control scheme subject to low complexity is obtained. Third, aside from ensuring that the tracking error converges within a small neighbourhood of the origin within a fixed-time, the designed control scheme not only makes all signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded, but also avoids the problem of finite-time control relying on initial state. Finally, three simulations are given to prove the feasibility and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

By using some key properties of a class of parametric Lyapunov equations and constructing time-varying Lyapunov-like functions, two time-varying high-gain controllers, where scalar time-varying functions are generated by differential equations, are designed. Both state feedback and observer-based output feedback are considered. It is shown that the proposed methods can achieve finite-time semi-global stabilisation for closed-loop systems and the controls are bound.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the redundant control input problem in the sense of linear quadratic regulator optimal control. Increasing redundant control inputs leads to a decrease in the quadratic performance index. However, in some cases, this also increases the norm of the feedback matrix, resulting in actuator saturation. To solve the problem, a comparative analysis of the latest research results on the redundant control input problem under different conditions is first presented. Secondly, new tighter upper bounds of the positive (semi-)definite solution of the continuous algebraic Riccati equation (CARE) corresponding to the redundant control input problem are studied uniformly in the stabilizable case. Thirdly, based on them, a class of sufficient conditions to guarantee that the norm of the feedback matrix decreases is presented. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our conclusions. Meanwhile, a simulation experiment demonstrates that systems with redundant control inputs can achieve good control performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the stability of the one-dimensional parabolic system, where one end changes over time and the other is the control end with the external disturbance. Firstly, by the boundary immobilisation method, the displacement change of the system boundary is transferred into the equation so that the original system is transformed into a system with fixed boundaries. Secondly, by combining the backstepping transformation and the sliding mode control method, the feedback control is proposed to compensate the instability of the system itself and reject the matched disturbance. Then, the resulting closed-loop system will be in the form of A + B ( τ ) + C D ( τ ) , where A generates a C 0 semigroup, B ( τ ) and C are bounded and unbounded operators respectively, and D ( τ ) is the external input. The existence of the generalised solution to the closed-loop system is proved by using the eigenfunction expansion of the system solution. By the Lyapunov method, the closed-loop system is shown to be exponentially stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {In the article, for air-handling units (AHUs), an almost disturbance decoupling temperature and humidity tracking controller is constructed directly based on dynamic nonlinear models by backstepping. Compared with model-free techniques such as proportion integration differentiation (PID) and so on, the proposed scheme uses the known information effectively in the model to ensure control accuracy. Different from linearisation methods, the almost disturbance decoupling method is employed to attenuate the impact of disturbances. Without fuzzy logics, the proposed controller requires less computation since the exponential explosion of computation caused by the increase of fuzzy rules can be avoided. To show the practicability, the outdoor temperature and humidity, strength of humidity source, and heat load are considered to be time-varying. Finally, compared with PID, feedback linearisation and fuzzy controllers, the effectiveness and superiority of the constructed controller are proved.},
