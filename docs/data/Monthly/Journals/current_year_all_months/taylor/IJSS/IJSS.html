  abstract     = {This paper investigates the exponential stability in mean square of theta numerical solutions for neutral stochastic delay differential equations (NSDDEs) with Poisson jumps and time-dependent delays. Analysing the stability of such equations poses significant challenges due to the combined effects of the neutral term, Poisson jumps, and time-dependent delays. To address a gap in the existing literature, we propose novel criteria for the exponential stability of both exact and numerical solutions derived from the stochastic linear theta method and the split-step theta method. Unlike previous criteria, our approach does not require the differentiability of the time-dependent delay function, allowing us to analyse a wider class of NSDDEs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for sufficiently small step sizes, the theta approximations can arbitrarily accurately replicate the mean-square exponential decay rate of the exact solutions. We provide two examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our criteria.},

  abstract     = {In the context of actual physical processes over time and space, focussing on a spatial two-dimensional (2-D) framework is more practical. As the number of spatial dimension increases, the complexity of controller design escalates significantly. This study presents a fuzzy stabilisation design aimed at spatial 2-D time-delay nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems utilising mobile sensor/actuator pairs. Initially, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to accurately characterise the 2-D nonlinear time-delay PDE systems. Following this, a fuzzy controller design scheme is introduced that strategically leverages mobile sensor/actuator pairs placed in various subdomains within the spatial domain based on the T-S fuzzy model. Subsequently, using the developed T-S fuzzy model and the Lyapunov direct method, a membership-dependent fuzzy stabilisation controller design is formulated, along with the guidance laws for mobile sensor/actuator pairs, ensuring that the resulting closed-loop system for the spatial 2-D time-delay scenario achieves the exponential stability. The mobile strategy integrates two directional guidance laws, with each dimension having its own specific guidance form. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the Beetle Olfactory-based Manipulability Optimizer Recurrent Neural Network (BOMO-RNN), an advanced RNN-based controller designed to enhance the manipulability of redundantly actuated industrial robotic arms. The manipulability index, which quantifies the maneuverability of the robotic arm, is crucial for avoiding kinematic singularities that restrict the mobility of robotic arm in the task space. The proposed approach formulates an optimisation problem using the penalty method to incorporate the manipulability index into the tracking control objective function. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on velocity-level control and require precise initialisation, BOMO-RNN operates at the position level, allowing direct trajectory tracking from arbitrary starting configurations, thereby increasing flexibility and ease of deployment. This function aims to maximise maneuverability while ensuring accurate tracking of the reference trajectory, effectively avoiding joint-space singularities. The BOMO-RNN framework leverages a metaheuristic optimisation strategy, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional search spaces without requiring explicit Jacobian pseudo-inversion, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving numerical stability. The BOMO-RNN algorithm efficiently addresses the time-varying optimisation problem at the position level, eliminating the need for computationally intensive Jacobian pseudo-inversion. This ensures robustness in real-world scenarios where high-speed control and adaptability to dynamic environments are critical. The algorithm's convergence is theoretically analysed, and its performance is validated through numerical simulations and experimental results using the LBR IIWA 7-DOF robot. Extensive experimental verification demonstrates the effectiveness of BOMO-RNN across diverse trajectory patterns, including circular, sinusoidal, and piecewise straight-line motions, confirming its generalizability and practical applicability. The results demonstrate BOMO-RNN's practical effectiveness in optimising manipulability and its potential for real-world robotic applications.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modelling of various fuzzy controllers has been extensively researched and well-documented. As a result, it is well-known that the model of a fuzzy controller depends on several factors, including AND operator, OR operator, inference method, aggregation operator, and defuzzification method. As it appears from the literature, Maximum (Max) aggregation operator has been often used in the modelling of fuzzy controllers. However, utilisation of Bounded Sum (BS) aggregation operator has been rarely seen. This paper aims to address three important issues: (i) studying the characteristics of three-input fuzzy Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers developed via BS aggregation operator, (ii) studying the uniqueness of all 14 possible three-input fuzzy PID controllers, and (iii) studying the computational aspects of unique controllers. Surprisingly, it has been observed that the controllers developed using the BS aggregation operator are not unique. Moreover, out of 14 controllers, only nine have been identified as distinct and appropriate for control purposes, while one controller has been deemed unsuitable for control.},

While most existing research on cooperative formation control has been based on the premise of complete information, the complex dynamics of operational robots inevitably introduce incomplete information, including input nonlinearity, external disturbances, and dynamic coupling within the network, which can significantly impact the performance of the formation system. This study makes two significant contributions. First, it proposes a distributed bearing-based formation control method for nonholonomic systems operating in environments characterised by incomplete information, such as uncertain disturbances and nonlinear dead-zones in actuators. Second, fully distributed adaptive dynamic estimators, which rely on relative bearing measurements, are employed to effectively counteract the adverse impacts of nonlinear dead-zone inputs and external disturbances. Additionally, an input-to-state stable formation control law, relying exclusively on relative bearing measurements of nonholonomic unicycles, is developed to achieve the desired bearing rigid formation without collisions in a multi-robot system. Finally, the global stability of the nonholonomic bearing-rigid formation system is established using the ISS Lemma for cascade systems. The effectiveness of the proposed formation control strategy is demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results.},

First, by augmenting the state-related vectors in the double integral term and combining with zero inequalities, more cross-term information is captured. According to periodicity and monotonicity, the time-varying delay is divided into monotonically decreasing and increasing intervals. Then, by constructing delay-product terms in each interval, a novel Lyapuov-Krasovskii functional is derived, which contributes to the reduction of conservatism, and thus a refined allowable set of the delay is obtained. Finally, two improved RSE criteria that consider complete and incomplete transition probabilities are obtained, by which smaller bounded sets can be found with less conservatism.

  abstract     = {The optimal autonomous safe prescribed performance tracking control problem is studied for homogeneous vehicular platoon systems (VPSs) encountering sudden obstacles in this paper. It focuses on the situation where obstacles suddenly intrude into the driving lane of a vehicle platoon. A secure boundary protection method (SBPM) is used to design an autonomous safety tracking strategy for emergency obstacle avoidance, which includes the control design after obstacle removal. When an obstacle suddenly enters the lane and conflicts with the desired trajectory, the strategy can automatically construct two adjustable secure boundaries by using the SBPM, so that the VPS enters a safe region in advance to avoid collision. After the obstacle is removed, the platoon can autonomously track the original desired trajectory based on a new secure boundary self-adjustment law (SBSAL). In the controller design, a novel constraint control method, which is independent of the initial spacing errors between adjacent vehicles, is adopted based on a variable barrier function (VBF), and the string stability of the platoon is guaranteed. Specifically, only one collective performance constraint function is needed for all vehicles in this platoon. The reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is utilised to optimise the control input of each vehicle in the VPS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the tube-based robust model predictive control problem for autonomous vehicles, which can address the complexities of lateral and longitudinal coupling dynamics along with multiple system state and control input constraints. Firstly, an integrated vehicle tracking model by T-S fuzzy technology is established by combining lateral dynamics and longitudinal kinematics, where parametric uncertainties and external disturbances arising from fluctuations in vehicle speed and road conditions are considered simultaneously. Due to the strong coupling inherent in tire-road forces, a tire friction circle is constructed to encapsulate the interplay between longitudinal and lateral forces. The friction circle can approximate by octagon, which facilitates the translation of vehicle tracking dynamics related to coupled friction forces into a framework of convex constraints. Then, a linear tube-based model predictive controller and a fuzzy tube-based model predictive controller are designed for both the longitudinal and lateral movement adjustment of the vehicles. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller design method is illustrated in the Carsim/Simulink co-simulation environment. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper has better tracking performance in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions compared to traditional linear time-varying-model predictive control approaches.},

  abstract     = {By the aid of the time Euler difference and the finite difference, this paper discusses the realm of global stabilisations in the mean-squared sense of space-time discrete stochastic coopetition neural networks with time-varying delays and Dirichlet, Neumann boundaries. It presents some criteria of global asymptotic stabilisation in the mean-squared sense for stochastic coopetition neural networks through the methods of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and the discrete Wirtinger inequality. The current research considers global exponential stabilisation in the mean-squared sense, which offers a more comprehensive view of stabilised networks than asymptotic stabilisation. By transforming the left Dirichlet boundary into Reumann boundary, the researchers also discuss global stabilisations in the mean-squared sense of space-time discrete networks. More importantly, this study shows that it can achieve better global mean-squared stabilisations of space-time discrete networks endowed with the smaller diffusion intensities, smaller coupling strengths and bigger connection weights. In comparison to preceding researches in this area, this paper presents a framework for discussing issues of global stabilisation in the context of space-time discrete networks. Furthermore, the article concludes with an illustrative example that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the reliability of the piecewise affine systems under actuator failures and uncertainties, where these factors may cause system performance degradation or even instability. Specifically, the actuator failures are described by loss of effectiveness faults and bias faults. Utilising the tracking error, the system state and the external input of the reference model, the adaptive update mechanisms are constructed. In order to overcome the difficulty of controller design caused by the simultaneous presence of actuator failure and system uncertainties, an auxiliary control gain is integrated into the adaptive compensation fault tolerant tracking controller. Besides, under the framework of the switching system theory, all signals of the closed-loop systems can be proved to be bounded if the average dwell time meets certain condition. Finally, the proposed robust adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control protocol is demonstrated by an example.},

Output-constraint is considered by zone barrier Lyapunov function (zBLF), which is designed to enforce safety constraints and offer flexibility when the system states remain within a safe region of operation, even in the presence of nonlinear uncertainties. Adaptive fuzzy neural control is adopted to approximate the nonlinear uncertainties for practical stability analysis and design, which aims to adjust the control parameters online according to the system's behaviour.

The output state converges to the trajectory and moves freely in a region around the origin, and then it is demonstrated the developed design method guarantees the boundedness of the states of a closed-loop system.

Due to the presence of disturbances in the T-S fuzzy systems, a fuzzy optimal state feedback control approach is presented by employing a two-player zero-sum game. Since the analytical optimal control solutions and the worst-case disturbance policies of T-S fuzzy systems can be boiled down to solving the algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), which are difficult to be obtained directly, a model-free policy iteration (PI) learning algorithm is proposed to obtain their approximation solutions. It is proved that the developed fuzzy optimal state feedback controller can ensure the fuzzy systems to be asymptotically stable and satisfy the disturbance attenuation condition simultaneously. Also, the designed PI learning algorithm can converge to their optimal solutions.

The proposed controller demonstrates superior robustness and performance, particularly in tracking the end-effector's position and contact force, compared to the hybrid sliding mode force/position control (HSMC) method, even in the presence of structural and non-structural uncertainties. The RL-HC controller is designed around a fixed-time sliding mode model, integrating force and position control components. The stability of this controller is established using the Lyapunov theory. Additionally, the reward function within the reinforcement learning network is carefully crafted to align with key objectives, including minimising chattering, force error, position error, and control effort. A simulation performed using a 3-DOF Delta Robot illustrates the effectiveness of the RL-HC approach. Results indicate that RL-HC outperforms traditional methods, showcasing better performance and robustness when facing various external disturbances and uncertainties. Specifically, the findings highlight a significant reduction in position error, force error, total control effort, and chattering. The study also illustrates how different reward function designs impact the achievement of the desired objectives.},

In order to estimate the unmeasurable states, a state observer is constructed. Then, an adaptive NN-RL controller is designed. Different from the existing results, the proposed scheme consists of a basic controller and a compensation controller. For the basic controller, the NN approximation technique and the backstepping design method are adopted to address the tracking control problem. By utilising the error variables defined in the basic controller, the compensation controller is constructed based on critic-actor RL algorithm, which optimises the tracking performance while ensuring that the final controller adherence to the time-varying constraints. Due to the projection operator is introduced to design critic-action NN, the issue of gradient explosion encountered in gradient descent methods is averted. Finally, the stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated via the tangent type time-varying barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs).

  abstract     = {In this research, a new advanced Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA) and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method is proposed to address challenges in dynamic obstacle avoidance for robotic manipulators while minimising real-time computational burden. The computational limitations of conventional NMPC methods stem from high dimensionality, nonlinearity and non-convexity, necessitating powerful processors with large memory. These limitations lead to reduced control horizon and suboptimal performance, particularly in real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance applications. To address these challenges, a novel hybrid control method is proposed by integrating SOA, which offers significant advantages in modelling efficiency and computational cost, with NMPC to enhance its predictive and control capabilities. The SOA-NMPC controller enables efficient autonomous path planning and obstacle avoidance while ensuring compliance with constraints. The validity of the proposed method is verified through experimental studies involving various collision scenarios, including static and dynamic obstacles. After verification, an additional collision experiment is conducted to investigate its ability to minimise real-time computational burden. The results confirm the SOA-NMPC method's robust planning-tracking performance and collision-free operation. Controller stability is demonstrated using the Lyapunov method. The computational efficiency of the SOA-NMPC enables more flexible prediction and control horizon selection, overcoming traditional limitations and enhancing dynamic obstacle avoidance performance.},

The SCP channel selection and fading coefficient changes are modelled as MJSs. A dynamic output feedback controller ensures the system state remains within a threshold for a finite time. Using the Lyapunov method, sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability and H ∞ performance are derived. However, the developed stability and controller design conditions include nonlinear and non-convex constraints. To address nonlinear constraints and achieve optimal finite-time H ∞ performance, an algorithm that integrates the whale optimisation algorithm (WOA) with linear matrix inequality method is introduced, including an initial value selection method for WOA.

A master–slave networked control framework is constructed which is under dual-channel attacks, that is, the channel from sensor to controller and the channel from controller to actuator. False data injection attacks can destroy easily the positivity of positive neural networks, by injecting large negative data into the sampled signals, for instance. In this case, assuming a non-negative synchronisation error, as in previous work, to maintain the positivity of the slave system is inadequate. A newly designed regulator-based switching control method is proposed to synchronise the master–slave system decreasing the influence of dual-channel attacks. The positivity constraint in synchronisation error system is removed. To further reduce the turbulence caused by the switching of variable control inputs, a bumpless transfer strategy is considered. By using the Lyapunov theorem, some sufficient delay-dependent conditions for finite-time synchronisation of master–slave positive neural networks are proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example and a water management system are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The proposed control strategy framework combines an event-triggered mechanism with topology-dependent impulsive control, where impulsive instants are dynamically determined.

A novel observer structure is devised to estimate states and disturbances by predicting the actual output of the system. Moreover, the disturbance constraint is broadened to encompass wider types such as unbounded finite derivatives. Based on the obtained estimation of disturbance and state, a resilient controller is proposed to compensate for the impact caused by controller parameter perturbations. In particular, a new class of Lyapunov-like functionals is constructed to extend the sampling interval associated with exponential convergence. By employing matrix analysis and integration techniques, sufficient criteria are established to guarantee the exponential convergence of the networked aperiodic sampled-data closed-loop dynamics. The obtained criteria reveal that the estimation error of the disturbance depends only on the errors of the predictor and state observation, benefiting from the novel structure of the devised observer. The parameter gains of the observer and controller are readily determined by solving a set of convex optimisation constraints. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed observer-based control algorithm are confirmed through developed examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the mean-square exponential consensus problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems in the presence of actuation delays under sequential scaling attacks. Given the limited energy of the attacker, specific attack characteristics such as attack duration and attack frequency are introduced to characterise the sequential scaling attacks. Firstly, an event-triggering mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication resource consumption by determining when agents need to communicate with their neighbours, thereby avoiding continuous information transmission. Considering the effect of actuation delays, a distributed delayed impulsive controller is designed. An impulse-switching error system is then constructed, which transforms the original system with time delays into one without. Furthermore, sufficient consensus criteria is derived, imposing constraints on event-triggering parameters. The design of impulsive gain matrix is also presented. Finally, the obtained results are demonstrated to be effective through an example.},

Firstly, in order to more effectively address the control requirements of complex systems and reduce the communication load, the modeling of LSNSs with different plant and communication topologies is constructed on an undirected graph. Subsequently, the chordal decomposition theorem was employed to establish a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) over maximal cliques, with the objective of ensuring the mean-square asymptotic stability of LSNSs with input saturation constraints. Additionally, a design methodology was proposed for the design of the H ∞ scalable controllers, which ensures that the controllers of the maximal clique to which it belongs and the controllers of neighbouring maximal cliques are updated only when plugging-in or plugging-out subsystems. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers significant advantages in terms of reduced computational complexity and increased privacy. Finally, the effecyiveness of the proposed scalable control approach is validated by analyzing microgrids.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the distributed 𝐻 ∞ moving horizon estimation problem for nonlinear systems over energy harvesting sensor networks in a deterministic framework, where each sensor is able to gather energy from the surrounding environment. A transformed Poisson process model is introduced to describe the energy collected by each sensor, with particular consideration given to the minimum energy collected. In contrast to previous research on distributed state estimation over energy harvesting sensor networks, which solely considered the energy costs associated with transmission and assumed knowledge of the statistical properties of harvested energy, we consider a more comprehensive scenario. Specifically, we account for the energy costs associated with both sensor sensing and data transmission to neighbouring sensors, while only the parameters of the minimum harvested energy are known. Subsequently, a novel energy allocation strategy is proposed to provide energy for each sensor sensing and transmission based on a predetermined fixed circular order, which determines a maximum time interval for each sensor sensing and transmission. Then, local measurement output predictors and prior state predictors are constructed to handle interruptions in sensor sensing and communication caused by the energy harvesting mechanism. Furthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a distributed moving horizon estimator, ensuring H ∞ consensus. To illustrate the proposed method's effectiveness, a single-machine infinite-bus power system is presented.},

  abstract     = {In model predictive control (MPC), the control input is determined at each instance by formulating and solving an optimisation problem that incorporates real-time measurement updates. Applications characterised by rapid process dynamics often necessitate shorter sampling intervals, which impose stringent requirements on computational consistency. Also, implementing MPC on hardware with constrained computational resources remains a significant challenge. Consequently, the realisation of MPC for such scenarios mandates an appropriate choice of an optimisation algorithm that exhibits consistency in terms of iteration numbers, ensuring optimised solutions within a sampling period in real-time environments. This study introduces the application of an infeasible interior-point barrier algorithm tailored for MPC. The MPC is formulated for linear systems in the condensed framework so that the number of decision variables in the optimisation problem is reduced. The solution algorithm of the optimisation problem is formulated on primal-dual conditions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in real-time on a coupled tank system. Both the state and output feedback MPC are implemented that demonstrate consistent iteration count throughout its runtime. Comparative performance analyses with other methodologies are conducted elucidating the trade-offs inherent in different approaches.},

Then, a fully distributed event-triggered scheme is introduced, under which the coupling communication resources can be effectively saved. In this scheme, continuous coupling communication will be avoided in the updating of control laws and the monitoring of triggering function. Besides, the Zeno behaviour is excluded by showing that the interval between any two triggering events is lower-bounded by a strictly positive value.

This study emphasises the importance of noise-robust data decomposition and proposes a novel online method designed for efficient and reliable decomposition under noisy conditions. To address this challenge, we define an optimisation objective that simultaneously suppresses noise while satisfying physical constraints. To mitigate the sensitivity of gradient descent-based methods to initial conditions, which can often lead to local optima, we simplify the optimisation objective propose and advanced techniques. This approach eliminates irrelevant variables, fully exploits the efficiency of sparse matrices, and quickly solves for both spatial and temporal modes, significantly improving overall performance. Theoretical derivations and analyses are provided to elucidate the optimisation process and its impact on noise robustness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively avoids local optima and outperforms traditional methods in terms of noise robustness. Specifically, in real-world data experiments, the proposed method achieves an 89.6% reduction in the root mean square error of reconstructed data, compared to a 68.06% reduction achieved by existing methods, representing a 31.6% relative improvement. These results highlight the superior reliability and robustness of the proposed method in practical applications.},

This fills the research gaps in the finite/fixed-time stability of stochastic distributed parameter systems and the semiglobal finite/fixed-time stability of stochastic systems. Moreover, compared to existing results on finite/fixed-time stability for stochastic systems, our Lyapunov criterion can still work well under more stringent conditions.

The proposed predefined-time event-triggered fault-tolerant sliding mode control is designed to not only exhibit non-singularity and chattering-free characteristics but also ensure the convergence of the tracking error within a predetermined time-frame to a narrow vicinity. The proposed approach exhibits superior control performance compared to conventional finite-time and fixed-time methods. Simultaneously, employing fuzzy universal approximators enhances the system's capability to handle unknown nonlinear functions, contributing to its adaptability in real-world scenarios, and introducing the event-triggered mechanism achieves more efficient resource utilisation. Notably, the input-state-stable assumption is no longer needed for event-triggered control. Finally, simulation comparative results under different scenarios are employed to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning methodology that develops the capability to make sequential decisions in intricate issues using trial-and-error techniques. RL has become increasingly prevalent for decision-making and control tasks in diverse fields such as industrial processes, biochemical systems and energy management. This review paper presents a comprehensive examination of the development, models, algorithms and practical uses of RL, with a specific emphasis on its application in process control. The study examines the fundamental theories, methodology and applications of RL, classifying them into two categories: classical RL such as such as Markov decision processes (MDP) and deep RL viz., actor critic methods. RL is a topic of discussion in multiple process industries, such as industrial chemical process control, biochemical process control, energy systems, wastewater treatment and the oil and gas sector. Nevertheless, the paper also highlights challenges that hinder its larger acceptance, including the requirement for substantial computational resources, the complexity of simulating real-world settings and the challenge of guaranteeing the stability and resilience of RL algorithms in dynamic and unpredictable environments. RL has demonstrated significant promise, but more research is needed to fully integrate it into industrial and environmental systems in order to solve the current challenges.

  abstract     = {In this article, the consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with time-varying input delay and saturation constraints of relative states via observer-based truncated predictor feedback is considered. First, the estimation of relative states (relative information) is converted to edge information (estimation of edge states) by applying the incidence matrix. As a result, the consensus problem of MASs with input delay and relative information saturation is transformed into the stabilization problem of delayed edge dynamics in bounded sets. Then, for the consensus of MASs with input delay and dynamic leader, an observer-based truncated predictor protocol using saturation functions is proposed, which ensures the consensus of MASs despite the constraints of relative information saturation. Next, sufficient conditions for the stability of the agents are obtained by creating the suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Using these conditions, all agents reach a consensus and follow the path of the dynamic leader well. In addition, the saturation of relative states does not happen. Also, the error of estimating the states of the agents quickly becomes zero. This consensus and stability are obtained by preserving the connectivity of the communication network. In the end, to show the correctness of the above content, a practical example is simulated.},

Consequently, a generalised extended state observer is incorporated into the closed-loop structure to estimate system states and disturbances by alleviating the disturbance effects on tracking outcomes.

Subsequently, an adaptive free-will arbitrary time terminal sliding mode control is designed for prescribed-time convergence of the system states and handles the actuator faults simultaneously. The sliding surface of the proposed control design utilises the concept of free-will arbitrary time stabilisation, ensuring prescribed-time convergence of the system states irrespective of initial conditions. The existence of model uncertainty and unknown disturbances is compensated by implementing a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) along with secondary adaptive law without requiring prior knowledge of the uncertainty and disturbances. The stability analysis of the closed-loop dynamics is established by utilising the Lyapunov method.

This observer provides accurate finite-time estimations of both the system states and multiple disturbances and uncertainties without exhibiting chattering. This enhancement improves the disturbance rejection ability and the tracking performance. An ADRC scheme using a H-OSMESO remains unexplored for F-O systems control. We start by designing a H-OSMESO to obtain the extended state and system state estimates. The extended state includes external disturbances and uncertainties (total disturbance). It is proven that the ESO (Extended State Observer) converges in finite time. The estimates of the total disturbance and states are then used to construct a backstepping control law to track the desired references while compensating for the total disturbance. The closed-loop system stability is demonstrated using the Lyapunov function. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed ADRC scheme are demonstrated by simulating two numerical examples. These results are then compared with other available approaches.},

The state information and the switching information are sampled and transmitted to the controller only when the event-triggered condition is met, which causes the controller still adopting the controller gain of the previous subsystem between the switching instant and the first triggering instant after system switching. That is, the asynchronous switching between subsystem and controller caused by event-triggered transmission is inevitable. First, we introduce a switching event-triggered mechanism (SETM), which requires a certain time to wait after each sampling before the event-triggered condition is judged. This SETM can efficiently avoid Zeno behaviour but makes the traditional Lyapunov function method no longer applicable. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new switching Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (SLKF) involving time delay and waiting time, based on which the sufficient criterion for the stability of the closed-loop system is given. Then, the corresponding solvable condition for the controller gains is established under asynchronous switching. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed theory is verified by an example.},

  abstract     = {This paper puts forward a novel deep reinforcement learning control framework to realise continuous action control for a partially observable system. One of the central problems in continuous action control is finding an optimal policy, which can make the agent achieve the control goals without violating the constraints. Although the reinforcement learning technique (RL) is primarily applied for addressing the optimisation problem in continuous action space, the critical limitation of the existing methods is that they utilise only a one-step state transition approach and fail to capitalise on the information available in the sequence of its previous states. Consequently, learning an optimal policy for continuous action space through current techniques may not be effective. Hence, this study attempts to solve the optimisation problem by integrating a convolutional neural network in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework and realise an optimal policy through an inverse n -step temporal difference learning method. Moreover, we formulate a novel convolutional deep deterministic policy gradient (CDDPG) algorithm and present the convergence analysis through the Bellman contraction operator. One of the key benefits of the proposed approach is that it improves the performance of the RL agent by not only utilising information from a one-step transition but also extracting the hidden information from previous state sequences. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is experimentally validated on a rotary flexible link (RFL) system for tracking control and vibration suppression problems. The experimental validation of the proposed scheme on an RFL system highlights that the CDDPG can offer better tracking and vibration suppression features compared to those of the conventional DDPG and the state-of-the-art proximal policy optimisation (PPO) techniques.},

Firstly, the state observer is constructed for switched nonlinear systems to estimate the unmeasured states, and the output-feedback approach is presented. Next, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilised to approximate the unknown functions, the novel event-triggered fixed-time control strategy is addressed based on common Lyapunov function (CLF) method and backstepping technology, which can greatly reduce the communication load. The asynchronous error compensation function is introduced into the designed controller and triggering mechanism, which effectively solves the asynchronous switching problem caused by the interaction of triggering and switching. Eventually, all closed-loop signals are assured to be bounded, the system output tracks the given reference trajectory at a fixed time, and the convergence time does not depend on the initial states of system. Two illustrative examples are shown to verify the effectiveness of the developed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The industrial systems usually not only suffer from unknown disturbances but also measurement noise. In sliding mode control society, to counteract the disturbances, especially mismatched disturbances, the extended state observer is usually utilised for disturbance estimation. However, fast convergence speed for the extended state observer requires high gains, which will amplify the measurement noise and cause serious chattering for the sliding mode controller. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sliding mode control scheme by utilizing the Kalman filter and an extended state observer, in which the Kalman filter serves as measurement noise filtration, and the extended state observer can on-line estimate unknown disturbances. The above two parts are interconnected since the Kalman filter needs disturbance estimation from the extended state observer, and the real measurement signal to be injected into the conventional extended state observer is replaced by its estimation value derived from the Kalman filter. Disturbance and state estimations from the extended state observer based on Kalman filter are introduced into the dynamic sliding manifold as well as the composite sliding mode controller. The proposed approach is applied in a magnetic levitation system subject to external disturbance and measurement noise for solving the position tracking problem, and simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the approach.},

In this paper, an integrated control design for orbit injection of launchers is proposed using a fully-actuated system approach, which offers interpretability and high flexibility for nonlinear systems. First, a refined time-varying model of the launcher is established, accounting for mass property variations caused by propellant consumption. Next, both guidance and attitude closed-loop error dynamics are parameterised through the fully-actuated system approach. Furthermore, the Lyapunov stability of the integrated closed-loop system is demonstrated by explicitly considering the influence of attitude tracking error on control force generation. Additionally, a constraint-compatible online optimisation scheme for feedback controller gains is proposed to adaptively meet multiple desired performance indicators as the system state evolves.

A high-order fully actuated (HOFA) approach is applied to reformulate the quadrotor model into three HOFA subsystems, which introduce high-order derivative terms of inputs, system states, and disturbances. To observe high-order terms and reject disturbances for control design, extended state observers (ESOs) are designed for the HOFA systems. The convergence of these ESOs is rigorously established using the Lyapunov stability theory.

In the communication process of FIR systems, denial-of-service(DoS) attacks cause data packet loss, and the introduction of event-driven communication mechanism can reduce the sensitivity of the system to DoS attacks, however, the coupling of the two increases the difficulty of parameter identification. In this paper, we explore the problem of FIR parameter identification in the presence of DoS attacks and event-driven communication from the perspective of the defense side. Initially, the inadequacy of the original identification algorithm in estimating parameters during attacks is acknowledged. Compared to the original algorithm, the improved algorithm incorporates parameters of a model based on DoS attacks and analyzes its convergence performance. Subsequently, the trace of the asymptotic normal variance matrix of the improved identification algorithm is utilised as a metric to gauge the attack's effectiveness, leading to the design of an optimal attack strategy. Building upon the enhanced identification algorithm, adjustments are made to the event-driven mechanism, and an adaptive identification algorithm is formulated. The convergence performance of this algorithm is analysed, followed by the calculation of a communication rate aimed at optimisation based on selected indicators. Lastly, the paper concludes with an examination of the correctness and validity of the findings through numerical simulation.},

Based on this, the FAS approach is utilised to formulate the nominal controller, which can efficiently manage the nonlinear and coupled dynamics of the system. To deal with the disparities between the learning model and the actual system dynamics, the robust MPC is incorporated. This also ensures compliance with operating limits and improves the accuracy of the tracking control. Moreover, the iterative feasibility and stability analysis are completed.

Leveraging the unique characteristics of high-order fully actuated systems, distributed control protocols are designed that eliminate nonlinearities in the open-loop dynamics while establishing new closed-loop system behaviours. The H ∞ consensus problem is tackled for both undirected and directed communication graphs using the Kronecker product, inequality techniques, and the bounded real lemma. Linear matrix inequalities are employed to derive the design parameters for the control protocols. Additionally, a multi-spacecraft attitude model based on high-order fully actuated systems is proposed. Two illustrative examples are provided, one for an undirected graph and the other for a directed graph, to show the effectiveness and practical application of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {A distributed data-driven algorithm is proposed for market clearing within a community-based energy market. The objective is to maximise social welfare in energy trading. Each participant in the market, known as a prosumer, employs an extremum-seeking control (ESC) algorithm within a consensus-based architecture based on simple third-order dynamics. The proposed method circumvents the need for a central coordinator in the market clearing process. Furthermore, prosumers do not require analytical and exact formulations of cost or utility functions. They are required to transmit only a single local decision variable to the neighbours through an undirected connected graph. Under the assumption that prosumers have strongly convex local objective functions, the proposed algorithm demonstrates semi-global practical asymptotic (SPA) convergence to the optimal solution. This convergence is established using averaging theory. Simulation results validate the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of the proposed distributed strategy.},

Then by employing a neural network to approximate the unknown vehicle dynamics, we derive both distance and angle merging controllers satisfying prescribed performance, and a set of bound estimation schemes is involved to deal with the effect of actuator faults. On the basis of Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that our controller is capable of guaranteeing the boundedness of all vehicles states.

The characteristic function of output process is represented from the terms of its residual characteristic function. An explicit formula to compute the Rényi entropy for the output process of the MCARMA system is derived. In addition, we investigate the covariance matrix to find the upper bound of Rényi entropy. We present three simulations that serve to illustrate the behaviour of information in the MCARMA system, where the control and noise follow the Gaussian, Cauchy and Laplace distributions.

To effectively counteract the external disturbances and guide the states of all agents toward an optimal consensus point, the controller is designed based on gradient descent and the internal model principle.

  abstract     = {The study of conformable fractional-order systems has gained significant importance due to their ability to model complex dynamic behaviors across various applications. However, these systems encounter several challenges, such as the unique properties of conformable derivatives, the presence of nonlinear perturbations, and time-varying delays, all of which complicate stability and control design. Additionally, traditional control approaches often struggle to balance stability, performance, and efficient resource utilization, particularly when addressing event-triggered mechanism that are prone to Zeno behavior. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing a novel event-triggered control framework to solve the guaranteed cost control problem for delayed conformable fractional-order systems with nonlinear perturbations. By utilizing the Razumikhin stability theorem and conformable fractional calculus, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the existence of guaranteed cost state-feedback control. A key contribution of this work is the development of a criterion to eliminate Zeno behavior, ensuring the practical implementation of the event-triggered control strategy. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two simulation examples: a conformable fractional-order neural network and an electrical circuit model.},

Second, stochastic sampling control is employed for singular systems with time-varying delay using the Bernoulli distribution technique, rather than the deterministic sampling used by existing works.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a switching anti-windup design for linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems with asymmetric input constraint. Firstly, the input space of the LTI plant is divided into several regions based on the sign of each control input. In each of these regions, the original asymmetric saturation function can be equivalently written as a symmetric one. Then, we design a separate anti-windup gain for each region and implement it when the value of the input signal falls into this region. The online switching between different anti-windup gains enables the full utilisation of the available range of control action on both sides of the saturation limits, which is something that the classical single gain anti-windup design cannot achieve. By incorporating the special properties of asymmetric saturation constraints, a multiple Lyapunov function is constructed for closed-loop stability and performance analysis. This can significantly reduce the conservatism of the resulting stability and performance synthesis conditions. Finally, numerical simulation and aero-engine hardware-in-loop testing demonstrate that, the proposed design has the ability to obtain a significantly larger domain of attraction and an improved control performance than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The cooperative tracking consensus problem for discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) with state and input constraints is addressed by a novel safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. In MASs, all agents communicate through a directed communication graph. The algorithm is developed within the policy iteration (PI) framework, relying solely on measured data from the system trajectories in the environment. Additionally, the reward functions are enhanced by the integration of control barrier functions (CBFs) and input constraint functions. The iterative value function’s monotonically non-increasing feature guarantees that the safe set stays forward invariant inside the PI framework. Furthermore, theoretical proofs are provided to establish both safety and convergence. The algorithm’s design and implementation are elaborated through neural networks. Finally, experiment results validate the efficacy and safety of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on designing a resilient active disturbance rejection hybrid-triggered control scheme for mode-dependent parabolic-type nonlinear PDE systems when subjected to gain fluctuations and multiple disturbances. Specifically, matched disturbances are precisely estimated by using a disturbance observer, while the H ∞ control strategy mitigates the effects of mismatched disturbances. Further, to alleviate network communication transmission and conserve network resources, the hybrid-triggered technique has been implemented, which encompasses both time-triggered and event-triggered approaches. Here, the switching behaviour within the hybrid mechanism is governed by Bernoulli distributions. From thereon, the resilient hybrid-triggered active disturbance rejection controller is developed to achieve the intended disturbance rejection and stabilisation of the considered system. Therein, the gain fluctuations in both controller and disturbance observer gain matrices are factored, thereby improving resiliency. Afterward, through picking mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidates, sufficient requirements are obtained in the setting of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the assayed system. Ultimately, the proposed control method effectiveness is exemplified through the presentation of two numerical examples.},

A predefined-time extended state observer (PTESO) is derived to estimate both the unknown system states and disturbances, with the upper bound for the settling time (UBST) precisely defined by one design parameter in a less conservative manner than those of finite-time or fixed-time ESOs. Furthermore, the peak observation errors are small during the transient process. Then, using the estimates, a CPTSMC law is designed for the chattering-alleviated predefined-time convergence of system states. The internal mechanism of parameter tuning for improving transient performance is theoretically explored. In addition to proving that the UBST of the whole system is precisely defined by one design parameter, we show the continuity of CPTSMC and the boundedness of all system signals that are vital for practical applications.

Meanwhile, the piecewise linear (PWL) model has been proven to have the ability to approximate complex nonlinear systems. The construction of a PWL model entail to partitioning the state space into finite regions, and estimating the parameters of each subsystem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accomplish these two tasks via an intelligent Voronoi partition approach and solving a series of optimization problems. Firstly, we estimate the certain range of the subsystem parameters of one region directly from noisy data. This estimation is fulfilled by set operation between noise zonotope and the input-state data set, the optimal subsystem parameters are obtained by minimizing the noise zonotope. Secondly, this procedure is applied to all regions, a cost function is designed based on these noise zonotopes, by changing the partition, the cost function varies. Finally, an annealing simulation (SA) algorithm is utilized to search for the most adequate partition to ensure the fitting accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example and on experimental data from an actual water supply system.},

First, the problem in the single decision maker case is investigated in terms of guaranteed cost control approaches to derive suboptimal conditions at the supremum of the cost function. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is used to derive the necessary conditions which are expressed as a large stochastic combined matrix equation (SCME). Second, the preliminary results in the single decision maker case are used to study the Pareto optimal strategy in a cooperative game. As our main contribution, we derive the high-order centralised strategies and the low-order decentralised strategies, respectively, for the cooperative game. In order to avoid the difficulty of higher-order dimensional problem related to SCMEs, a new reduced-order decomposition numerical scheme by means of Newton's method is developed. The computation for designing the proposed strategy set can be performed in low dimension, even when the number of decision makers approachs to infinity. Moreover, the degradation of the cost function is rigorously evaluated by comparing the centralised strategy set with the proposed strategy set. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy set.},

Then, a heuristic approach is proposed to automate mission planning within a limited time. Routing is handled through a greedy algorithm that selects tasks based on their distance to a baseline path and score. B-spline path smoothing is implemented for smooth and continuous routes. The results are examined in terms of robustness, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, and non-technical requirements. Scenarios with extreme parameters are generated for validation and testing.

Maintaining course stability and precise control in complex maritime environments is crucial for the operation of USV. However, traditional control methods are often constrained by factors such as limited communication bandwidth, internal model uncertainties, and external disturbances. To address these challenges, firstly, we introduce a composite quantizer to describe the quantisation process linearly and then utilise a neural network system to mitigate model uncertainties and external disturbances to address these challenges, subsequently, by designing an adaptive neural network controller with input quantisation and output constraints, which not only reduces the controller's execution frequency but also ensures that control command execution remains within a safe range. By creating a Barrier Lyapunov function, the suggested control method's stability is finally shown, proving that all of the system signals eventually become confined. The system simulation results show that this methodology can enhance USV course performance, validating the effectiveness of the suggested control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This brief proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based composite near-optimal output feedback (OPFB) control method for discrete time-delay singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) with unknown dynamics and unmeasured system states. Firstly, an optimal control problem of the full-order time-delay SPS is formulated. The singular perturbation techniques are used to obtain the reduced-order subsystems and equivalent subproblems. Then, a state reconstruction method is presented to represent the state in terms of available input and output data. In addition, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on input and output data is developed. Theoretical analyses are discussed on the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the asymptotical stability of the system under the composite controller. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The algorithm is applied to two distinct models of fractional-order time delay systems. A new reference model is proposed, utilising a unity feedback structure and incorporating a fractional-order time-delayed Bode transfer function in the forward path. The parameters of this proposed reference model are determined based on the specified phase margin and gain margin requirements. Before solving the design problem, the stability analysis of the proposed reference model is analysed through a theorem. Next, the four nonlinear equations with four unknown parameters are formulated and a solution method is provided in this study. By employing the recently introduced reference model, a robust fractional-order controller is formulated. The effectiveness of this robust controller is validated through simulations that employ various phase and gain margin specifications and through the existing controllers in the literature.},

The primary objective of this study is to provide a fault-tolerant non-fragile control protocol that ensures the targeted stabilisation of the system despite gain variations and actuator faults. Moreover, the impact of external disturbances is minimised by employing mixed H ∞ and passivity performance. After that, adequate criteria are established in the framework of linear matrix inequalities through the construction of a proper Lyapunov function together with the employment of integral-based Wirtinger's inequality such that it ensures the accomplishment of finite-time boundedness with a satisfactory performance level for the closed-loop system. Consequently, the explicit configuration of the developed controller gain matrices is computed, which is obtained by solving the developed criteria. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the devised control approach, simulation results with numerical examples are made available.},

Based on this groundwork, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) submodels are developed to capture domain-wide dynamics rather than one single value. Crucially, MISMS has pioneered the application of sequence interpretation for model decomposition and transparency, improving interpretability. The proposed scheme employs different temporal models in practical scenarios and can ensure a better prediction with long-term accuracy and stability.

  abstract     = {Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years. It provides an effective control strategy, especially in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances, and is particularly valuable when a precise system model is not available. Despite its simple control structure, ADRC exhibits high robustness to plant uncertainties and external disturbances. Numerous studies have used this technique in the case of integer-order systems, so this technique has given good results. However, only a few works have been realised in the case of fractional-order systems. Fractional systems have become important for modelling many physical phenomena. Some research has taken advantage of the fractional calculus to design ADRC for both linear and nonlinear fractional-order systems. This paper presents a novel fractional-order backstepping active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) approach that integrates the backstepping control technique with a fixed-time synergetic extended state observer (ESO). This approach, which employs a fractional macro-variable to ensure fixed-time convergence in nonlinear systems, represents a new direction in ADRC design for fractional-order systems. The method begins with the development of a fixed-time synergetic ESO for estimating the extended state, which includes uncertainties and external disturbances, the fixed-time convergence of this observer is demonstrated. A backstepping controller is then designed based on the estimated states and total disturbance to achieve system stabilisation and reference tracking, while effectively compensating for the total disturbance. The proposed backstepping ADRC is compared with existing methods, including backstepping ADRC with a fractional high-order sliding mode ESO (FHOSMESO), sliding mode ADRC with FHOSMESO, and sliding mode ADRC with a fixed-time synergetic ESO (FTSESO). Superior performance in disturbance rejection and reference tracking is demonstrated by simulation results of the proposed approach.},

First, a piecewise function is proposed to characterise FTPP and eliminate the initial value limitations present in traditional prescribed performance control methods. To ensure that tracking errors satisfy prescribed performance, barrier functions are further constructed and introduced into the control design process. Second, based on the approximation of neural networks, adaptive neural state observers are designed to estimate the unmeasured states. Then, an adaptive FTPP consensus control scheme is developed based on command filtered backstepping technique and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. It guarantees that (1) all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded; and (2) for any bounded initial values, all followers' outputs can track the leader's output within a prescribed fixed-time and tracking accuracy, while satisfying the required transient tracking performance.

In this context, communication protocols have been introduced to schedule the signal transmission, thus properly allocating limited network resources. The main aim of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of networked systems, communication protocols and recursive filtering. First, we review some basic introductions to networked systems and some common network-induced phenomena.

In light of the proposed encryption rule combined with bit-rate constraints, an iterative recursive scheme in a distributed way, receiving the desired estimator gains, is proposed by optimising the upper bound of the estimation error covariance. In addition, the impact of the allocated bit rate is made available to distributed state estimators, and the privacy of encryption strategies adopted is systematically evaluated.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a dynamic event-based distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to address the resource allocation problem in a smart grid. The main challenge lies in the presence of unknown resource transfer functions and cost functions. Our objective is to discover a set of resource allocation solutions that minimise the total cost functions over a specified period. Our approach involves re-constructing a new convex optimisation problem to facilitate the approximation of Q-values in the reinforcement learning training process. Additionally, to avoid continuous communication, we integrate an event-based distributed optimisation approach to approximate the action-value function. We support our methodology with theoretical proofs that establish the validity of the event-triggered conditions and demonstrate the algorithm's convergence. We further validate the algorithm's feasibility through an illustrative example involving output power allocation in a smart grid.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we seamlessly integrate machine learning techniques with stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) to address the regulation problem of nonlinear discrete-time step backward High-Order Fully Actuated (HOFA) systems with additive disturbance. By exploiting the full-actuation characteristic of the HOFA system, we neatly eliminate the non-linearity of the system, thus circumventing the complex computation of uncertainty propagation in nonlinear stochastic MPC. To cope with the random disturbance, its probability distribution on each principal component is well captured from data based on principal component analysis, and the uncertainty bound is effectively estimated via kernel density estimation and quantile functions. Based upon such probabilistic information, we impose constraint tightening on the state limits and define terminal sets by drawing on the concept of tubes. On this basis, we employ stochastic MPC for receding horizon control of HOFA systems, of which the recursive feasibility and stability are proved theoretically. Finally, numerical experiments and an application to hydrogen electrolyzer temperature control are used to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

The nonlinear characteristics of each agent are structured in a triangular pattern and are susceptible to influence from unspecified external disturbances. Within the framework of the lower triangular structure, a compensator with time-varying gain is tailored for each agent. This compensator is established by the output of the follower and its neighbouring agents. By utilising a directed communication topology, a distributed output feedback control protocol is crafted for the system at hand. This protocol ensures that consensus errors gradually converge towards a customisable bounded region. Moreover, the time-varying gain method can be extended to achieve consensus control for multi-agent systems, where each agent is characterised by an upper triangular structure.

This allows each subtask to focus on a specific local issue, independently learning and optimising, making the learning process simpler and more efficient. In the learning of triggering instants, an event-triggered strategy is incorporated, which greatly reduces the controller update rate, thereby reducing communication and resources occupation. In the learning of control inputs, the reward function not only considers tracking performance, but also considers both inter-vehicle distance and acceleration change rate, which ensures tracking accuracy while enhancing driving safety and comfort.

Subsequently, the necessary and sufficient conditions for robust observability are established by examining changes of state transitions, employing a logical equation set. Additionally, a novel criterion to ascertain the (weak) detectability is proposed based on the data form of BNs, from which criteria are proposed to evaluate robust (weak) detectability.

Compared to static ETIC, the proposed dynamic ETIC scheme effectively minimises the amount of controller updates and saves a significant amount of energy without reducing the system decay rate. Utilizing Lyapunov stability theory and the variation of the parameter formula, some appropriate conditions are set to keep the synchronisation error within a non-zero bound.

Different from existing distributed average consensus approaches that require each follower to exchange and expose state information to its neighbours, our strategy avoids the requirement for communication during information interaction by decomposing each follower's state information into two sub-states. The status information is leaked, thereby achieving privacy preservation. Furthermore, for this class of MAS with unknown dynamics, we use an extended state observer to estimate the unknown dynamics and design an auxiliary system. The auxiliary variables generated by this auxiliary system combined with the back-stepping method can effectively compensate for dynamics. By combining graph theory knowledge and techniques such as Lyapunov functions, it is proven that the output-consensus tracking error of an MAS is ultimately bounded.

In the proposed methodology, a descriptor system is formulated by augmenting sensor fault vectors with the states of the system. A novel fast adaptive unknown input observer (FAUIO) structure is proposed for the simultaneous estimation of both faults and states of a class of nonlinear systems. A new LMI condition is established by utilising the H ∞ criterion to ensure the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error of the developed observer. This derived LMI condition is deduced by incorporating the reformulated Lipschitz property, a new variant of Young inequality, and the well-known linear parameter varying (LPV) approach. It is less conservative than the existing ones in the literature, and its effectiveness is compared with the other proposed approaches. Further, the proposed observer methodology is extended for the disturbance-affected nonlinear system for the purpose of the reconstruction of states and faults/attacks with optimal noise attenuation. Later on, both designed approaches are validated through an application of a single-link robotic arm manipulator in MATLAB Simulink.},

  abstract     = {It has been previously found that partially homomorphic encryption based controllers cannot operate in an infinite time horizon, unless all elements of their state matrices are integer numbers. Considering this fact and the results of a recent research revealing the role of Pisot numbers to act as the poles of integer state matrix based state space models involving no unstable pole-zero cancellation, the present paper aims to introduce some classes of realisations implementing first-order discrete-time controllers, which can be used in an infinite time horizon in encrypted control systems. These classes of controller realisations are obtained based on sequences approaching to limit points of positive Pisot numbers settled in the range ( 1 , 2 ) . An analytical procedure is also suggested to find the exact range of the controller gain for ensuring the closed-loop stability.},

Based on this theorem, an adaptive state-feedback controller is designed and analysed by introducing an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function and a time-varying scaling function. It is proved that the closed-loop system is uniformly bounded, the state-constraints are not violated, and the tracking error can converge to the origin in any prescribed time independent of initial conditions.

A team of agents is tasked with monitoring multiple targets to minimise mean overall target state uncertainties, while simultaneously satisfying the monitoring count requirements of specific targets within predetermined time intervals. The inherent demands of assigning different monitoring tasks to each agent and determining the appropriate execution times introduce significant complexities, making it difficult to meet the monitoring count requirements. To address this, a persistence predicate based on Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications is introduced, which allows monitoring count requirements to be concisely expressed as multiple sub-STL requirements. A two-stage distributed receding horizon control (DRHC) algorithm is then proposed to optimise the agent trajectory, including their arrival and dwell times on the targets. In the first stage, each sub-STL task is dynamically reallocated within the DRHC framework to ensure feasibility. In the second stage, a finite horizon DRHC problem is formulated to optimise the monitoring performance while meeting the local monitoring count requirements. Agents solve their problems sequentially to obtain controllers that optimise overall monitoring performance while ensuring the satisfaction of global STL tasks.

The unknown model of the agent is first converted through dynamic linearisation into a equivalent data model, comprising a linear combination of an unknown dynamic parameter and an uncertain term. An adaptive algorithm is then formulated to estimate the unknown dynamic parameters accurately. The total uncertainty, which arises from the parameter estimation error and the uncertain term, is estimated by the extended state observer. The estimations are used by the controller to compensate for total uncertainty. Further, considering the resource limitations of communication and the constraints of the actual control input, a constrained iterative learning controller with a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developed, which guarantees control performance and reduces the number of communications in MASs. It is proven that the tracking error asymptotically approaches a small bound around zero under the proposed DDILC framework.

The approach combines policy iteration with a fault compensator, solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with this innovative value function via a critic neural network. Actuator faults are reconstructed for online fault compensation without the need for fault detection and isolation. The Lyapunov functional analysis demonstrates the closed-loop system's asymptotic stability in the presence of actuator faults and time-delay states.

A model-based ship simulation is used for structural analysis and the design of fault diagnosis models. This not only identifies faults but quantifies their impact on engine operation. Additionally, optimal sensor placement is investigated to enhance fault diagnosis across the engine system. These diagnosis models are integrated into a supervisory FTC scheme, allowing reconfiguration in response to faults. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in maintaining safe engine speed control under various fault scenarios, successfully diagnosing and reconfiguring multiple sensor faults. This research provides a novel framework for improving the safety and reliability of large marine engines, addressing a critical need in the maritime industry.},

Using a unified barrier function in place of the traditional barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) allows for the transformation of nonlinear stochastic systems with time-varying full-state constraints into equivalent ‘unconstrained’ systems for processing, which can eliminate the feasibility condition required by the virtual controllers generated using the BLF approach. The problem of unknown control gain caused by actuator failures is solved via devising reasonable adaptive laws. At the same time, a prescribed-time tracking controller is devised by using the approximation ability of fuzzy logic systems, which can adapt to the uncertainty of the system and deal with the actuator failures. In addition, the control scheme proposed in this paper can guarantee the performance of the system within prescribed-time and all state variables do not violate the constraint boundaries despite suffering from actuator failures.

The aim of the sensors is to minimise the mean square error of the fusion filter from the perspective of infinite time domain power management. The attacker interferes the fusion channels to reach the opposite goal. The competitive relationship among the sensors and attacker is modelled as a general-sum deterministic game based on Stackelberg game. Taking into account the practical situation where each player does not have a good knowledge of the global information, a distributed reinforcement learning in groups algorithm based on Stackelberg strategy is proposed to learn the joint optimal strategy. In particular, we consider that the strategy space of each player is unknown to other players and can be infinitely expanded through the individual local observation information.

The conventional paradigm in this field is to construct an iterative learning controller with the approximately identified model, considering only tracking error information at the current iteration. This leads to the neglect of the error variation trend along historical iterations. To circumvent unmodeled dynamics and capitalise on multi-step iteration error information, a backward difference iterative learning control (BD-ILC) approach is formulated. Initially, a vector data transfer mechanism employing the backward difference iteration error is introduced based on the dynamic data mapping. Within this mechanism, the proportional, differential and quadratic differential control terms are firstly incorporated simultaneously along the iteration domain. Furthermore, a convergence analysis approach is developed using the error deflation spanning tree technique. Simulations validate the enhanced efficacy of the BD-ILC approach, surpassing that of distinct control approaches.},

To be precise, with an aim to effectively lower the network transmission rate in both the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels, the triggering mechanism is implemented to both the outputs. Later, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is utilised to establish the stability criterion and the necessary conditions for ensuring the synchronisation of chosen CNDNs are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {The main purpose of the paper is to transforming the commensurate time-delay systems (TDSs) with multi-inputs to fully actuated systems via differential flatness. The flat output of commensurate TDSs with multi-inputs can be constructed explicitly on the basis of the solution to the Bezout identity. By taking the flat output of TDSs as the generalised state, the commensurate TDSs with multi-inputs can be equivalently transformed into a higher-order fully actuated systems (HOFAS). Then the finite spectrum assignment (FSA) problem of the commensurate TDSs with multi-inputs can be addressed immediately by the utilisation of the HOFAS approach. A numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the results presented in this paper.},

A technique based on approximation of the derivative of the estimation error for impulse time and after impulse value design is developed. An open-loop observer is utilised to estimate the derivative of the estimation error norm. The stability of the estimation error of the IHGO is discussed, and an upper bound for the estimation error is presented, which depends on the after impulse value of IHGO. Finally, the performance of proposed impulsive high-gain observers is evaluated by simulating different examples. It is shown that the proposed impulsive high-gain observer can reduce the peaking phenomenon significantly and outperform other hybrid high-gain observers.},

To address this issue, a network of observers is proposed, where each observer only measures partial system output, which may not be sufficient to observe the complete state of the system. Subsequently, all observers within the network collaborate by sharing their estimated states with their neighbours through the network, facilitating a cooperative reconstruction of the entire state at each local observer. To better reflect the communication environment, we consider a situation in which communication links may fail and rebuild over time, and communication noises may occur when observers exchange information through Markovian switching topologies. Parameters of observers are designed properly, under which each observer fulfills the estimation task in the mean square sense. Illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed observers are also provided.},

The bounds of the unknown control coefficients and unknown measurement sensitivity are unknown, which prevent the construction of conventional constrained output-feedback finite-time controllers. Based on homogeneous systems theory, a simple constrained output-feedback finite-time controller is successfully constructed by utilising a new type of barrier Lyapunov function. Rigorous theoretical analysis suggests that the considered system under the proposed output-feedback controller is finite-time stable, and the requirement of output constraint is achieved. The innovative aspect of this control approach is its unification of the output-feedback finite-time stabilisation problem for high-order uncertain planar systems, addressing both scenarios with and without output constraints, all within a unified framework, without altering the established control structure. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

A fuzzy high-gain state observer is constructed to reconstruct the unmeasurable states of the system by leveraging the universal approximation property of fuzzy logic systems for arbitrary unknown nonlinear functions. Within the framework of backstepping control design and in conjunction with adaptive techniques, an adaptive fuzzy control approach is presented. Subsequently, to work out the inherent ‘complexity explosion’ problem of the proposed control approach, dynamic surface control technique is introduced, leading to a simplified adaptive fuzzy output feedback control scheme. Stability analysis shows that the two proposed control schemes can ensure that all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, meanwhile the system tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood around the origin. Ultimately, a numerical simulation example is provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.},

Motivated by the necessity for accuracy and reliability as well as the growing importance and widespread application of fractional-order controllers in control systems, which offer increased flexibility in controller design, this paper focuses on introducing a dependable procedure for determining the stabilising region of FOPID controllers applicable to interval fractional-order plants with an interval time delay. An interval fractional-order plant is characterised by a fractional-order transfer function wherein the coefficients are uncertain and confined within specified intervals in both the numerator and denominator. Moreover, an interval time delay pertains to a delay term whose value varies within a specified interval. To comprehensively analyze the robust stability of the resulting system, we introduce two theorems and two lemmas in this study. Following this, we propose a method to address the challenge of achieving robust stabilisation for interval plants with an interval time delay using FOPID controllers. Moreover, an additional function is introduced to improve the performance of the systems. To illustrate the proposed procedure, we provide numerical examples and an experimental verification.},

The proposed control approach employs a leader-following strategy, where the dynamics of the LPV virtual leader are defined. The synchronisation error between the followers and the virtual leader is considered, and a consensus control law is introduced. The fault-tolerant mechanism involves the design of a distributed LPV observer and an LPV virtual actuator. Fault-tolerance is achieved through the redistribution of control inputs based on the effectiveness of actuators and dynamic virtual actuators. The primary focus is on establishing Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) conditions ensuring the existence of LPV consensus control, LPV observers, and LPV virtual actuator gains.

  abstract     = {Policy formulation and planning in many disciplines depends on mathematical modelling of empirical data. Linear regressions are common. However, data may vary substantially from one situation to another. This paper does not focus on statistical fluctuation. Rather, data at one time (e.g. prior to the 2019 Covid outbreak) may differ in important ways from data at a later time (e.g. post-Covid). Likewise, data from one location may differ substantively from data elsewhere with a different population, culture, milieu, etc. This challenge introduces data-uncertainty for which probabilistic models are unavailable or require assumptions that may be unjustified. This paper uses non-probabilistic info-gap models of uncertainty to represent data-uncertainty, and the info-gap concept of robustness to uncertainty as the basis for choosing between alternative realizations of a linear regression of empirical data. We demonstrate three properties of info-gap robustness functions when predicting an outcome variable of interest: zeroing, trade off and preference reversal. We also demonstrate the potential utility of excluding selected dependent variables. This analysis supports the use of linear regressions for policy analysis, planning, and decision making. We illustrate the analysis with an epidemiological example.},

Secondly, we establish the equivalence relations between the admissibility of RDSs and their corresponding square systems. Then we give the admissibility results of DRDSs in the case of m ≥ n and m < n , respectively, which are necessary and sufficient. With these conditions, we present the sufficient condition for a state feedback stabilising controller to make the closed-loop system admissible.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel Fault Diagnosis (FD) approach for nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems susceptible to multiple, potentially concurrent sensor faults. We formulate the FD problem as a hybrid state estimation problem. To achieve this, a vector of binary state variables is introduced to augment the continuous-valued state variables. These binary variables act as an on-off switching mechanism, providing a framework for independent reasoning about the presence or absence of each sensor fault. Leveraging this hybrid dynamic system formulation, encompassing both binary and continuous-valued states within a single Particle Filter (PF) framework, enables our approach to efficiently co-estimate fault modes alongside dynamic system states. This innovation ensures efficient diagnosis of multiple, potentially concurrent sensor faults while circumventing the need for the cumbersome bank of estimators characteristic of traditional Multiple Model (MM) approaches used for FD. The performance of the proposed algorithm in diagnosing multiple sensor faults is evaluated using a benchmark nonlinear system from the literature. The results demonstrably validate the algorithm's efficacy, solidifying its potential for practical sensor FD applications under conditions of single or multiple faults.},

The inherent hysteresis phenomenon in piezoelectric materials introduces nonlinearity and delay, rendering conventional control methods inappropriate for deformable mirror actuation. This study presents a disturbance observer-based controller with the generalised Bouc–Wen hysteresis parameter identification algorithm. Analytical proofs establish fixed-time stability for the observer and controller. A key feature of the proposed disturbance observer is the convergence of the estimated hysteresis to the actual value after a prescribed settling time, which facilitates precise hysteresis parameter identification. This is based on a data clustering technique, unlike most previous works. The proposed controller has the capability of hysteresis compensation and reference tracking in the piezoelectric deformable mirror actuators. Numerical simulation results are present to evaluate the tracking performance of the controller in the presence of random wavefront, the convergence of disturbance to the actual value in the fixed time, and identification of hysteresis parameters.},

Due to the openness of network-based transmission, DoS attacks are encountered during data transmissions, where the DoS attacks considered in this paper follow the Bernoulli distribution. This paper aims to design a controller for nonlinear systems considering the impact of DoS attacks and accumulation-based ETMs, ensuring that the controlled system state is ultimately bounded in the mean square. Firstly, sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the system state can achieve the given control performance, along with an explicit expression for the ultimate bound.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to achieve distributed optimal consensus control for discrete-time multi-agent systems (MASs) under composite switching topologies through utilising the iterative Q-learning approach. First, the optimal consensus control strategy, independent of system dynamics information, is developed by using the designed iterative Q-learning approach to guarantee that all follower states can synchronise to the desired trajectory formulated by the leader. Compared with the invariable algebraic or edge-fixed topology structures, the designed Q-learning control algorithm in this paper is implemented based on the composite switching topologies consisting of periodic and stochastic mechanisms. Then, an error dynamic system is established, which transforms the optimal consensus control issue into an optimal regulation issue and removes the influence of the two types of switching topologies. To conquer the problems of lack of model information and the inaccessible analytical solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, an iterative Q-learning approach is designed according to the reconstructed Q-function Bellman equation. Through further iterative learning, the optimal control strategy can be acquired so as to realise consensus control and ensure the stability of the closed-loop systems. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed optimal control scheme.},

Convergence of the approximated cost functional to the exact optimal cost has been proved, and the stability of the proposed algorithm has been investigated.

We also relax the constraints between impulsive delay and the delay in the continuous dynamics by comparing their sizes, rather than requiring them to satisfy certain inequalities. We employ the comparison principle and the Razumikhin condition to derive Razumikhin-type stability results for our systems.

Second, the first substate and external system state are augmented into a new state, and the explicit relationships between state and unknown parameters are established by applying global filtering transformation. Subsequently, the DREM-based parameter estimator and parameter estimation-based observer are developed to simultaneously estimate the first substate and disturbance in finite time.

Secondly, by applying the adaptive backstepping design technique and the inverse optimal control theory, an adaptive fuzzy inverse optimal output feedback decentralised controller is ultimately designed. It is proved that the proposed adaptive fuzzy inverse optimal decentralised controller not only minimises the cost function but also ensures that all variables of the control systems are semi-globally ultimately bounded and that the tracking errors converge to a small residual set with the prescribed performance bound. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control approach is verified by a nonlinear inverted pendulum large-scale system.},

For this purpose, first, a new integer order system is introduced and its convergence to zero exponentially within an arbitrary time is proven. Using this system, a novel adaptive exponential arbitrary time sliding mode controller is established to synchronise the fractional order chaotic systems. Then, to estimate the disturbance terms of the fractional systems an exponential arbitrary time disturbance observer is developed. The use of the disturbance observer can lead to simple controller design, low chattering control input, and more accurate response. Finally, a disturbance observer based sliding mode control is presented, that by incorporating the disturbance estimation in controller design ensures synchronisation of chaotic systems. The exponential arbitrary time synchronisation and the stability of the closed loop control system are confirmed using the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results on synchronisation of different fractional order systems, validate the proposed control schemes. It is noteworthy that the introduced adaptive sliding mode controllers can be used for controlling a wide variety of fractional order systems.},

More precisely, to reconstruct the immeasurable states of the addressed CPDPSs, a proportional-integral (PI) observer is implemented since the system states are not always readily measurable. Furthermore, the stability analysis is investigated for CPDPSs in the presence of actuator failures, deception assaults, external disturbances and linear fractional uncertainties. Further, a PI observer-based secured quantised reliable controller is designed to ensure the IO-FT stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the communication medium, the control input data is quantised before transmission by employing logarithmic quantisers. In the meantime, the deception attacks are assumed to possess a stochastic nature which follows Bernoulli distribution. Besides, by utilising Lyapunov stability theory and integral inequality, a set of adequate conditions is obtained for achieving the required result of the undertaken system. Furthermore, the resulting stability criteria are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved using the MATLAB software. Eventually, two numerical examples with simulation results are provided to validate the efficacy of the designed controller.},

The neural network disturbance observer is crucial for approximating external disturbance signals within a finite time, while the finite-time backstepping scheme accelerates the convergence of tracking errors. The command filtering technique is employed to avoid the complex derivation of virtual control laws, simplifying the controller design. The importance of this method lies in its ability to achieve fast, disturbance-resistant trajectory tracking for UAVs, making the control system more robust in practical applications. Simulations were conducted, showing that the proposed control strategy enables the quadrotor UAV to track its desired trajectory effectively, with improved anti-jamming capability. Both filtering and observation errors converged to the equilibrium point, validating the effectiveness of the approach. However, internal factors like actuator failure were not considered, pointing to future work in refining the method and applying it in real-world UAV experiments.},

By integrating an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) for optimal fault estimation with the EG scheme, the solution enables fault-tolerant control without requiring modifications to the baseline controller, which can be impractical or unsuitable in certain applications. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme completely avoids windup, thereby replacing conventional Anti-Windup (AW) schemes for PIDs, and is computationally cheap and easy to implement, needing only the same inputs as conventional AW algorithms and the actuator fault estimation. Simulation results on the MIMO model of the Zagi flying-wing aerial vehicle show that the EG reduces the tracking error in presence of actuator faults by − 49.92 % in terms of Integral Absolute Error (IAE), outperforming conventional AW methods.},

The method is formulated to strategically accelerate or decelerate the system response's rate of change to enhance reference tracking and disturbance rejection performance while preserving closed-loop stability. It uses the normalised acceleration of the system response, a metric that provides insights into the ‘fastness’ or ‘slowness’ of the system response. The effectiveness of the proposed online tuning method is validated through a case study on quadcopter position control. Our research includes both simulation and real-time testing of Variable-Order Fractional PD (VOFPD) controllers, which utilise our online tuning method to adjust their fractional derivatives in real-time. Stability analysis via the D-decomposition method confirms that the quadcopter's closed-loop stability is preserved.

This approach is guided by the fluctuating tendency of state errors, and a link is established between the stability of the zero solution in the neurodynamic system and the convergence of neuron states in a zeroing neural network. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made by numerous scholars to advance the development of ZND, resulting in the formation of a series of ZND models for various mathematical issues and real-world applications. In this paper, the advances in ZND are synthesised from three aspects: models, theories, and applications. Specifically, ZND models are categorised into two main frameworks based on their structures and further classified into different types depending on the dynamics of the specific models under each framework. The two main frameworks identified are the foundational ZND framework and the integral ZND framework. The former serves as the basic structure for exponential type ZND, finite-time type ZND, fixed-time type ZND, and predefined-time type ZND, while the latter is extended with the single-integral type ZND and the double-integral type ZND. Furthermore, the primary analytical methods for the dynamics of each type of ZND are summarised, and the current applications of ZND, including robot manipulator control, multi-agent consistency, dynamic positioning, chaos synchronisation, and image processing, are introduced. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding of the development history of ZND research, the current research focuses and challenges in ZND models, theories, and applications, as well as future directions and key breakthroughs in ZND research, will be provided to readers.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to address the cooperative output regulation (COR) problem of nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with time-varying parameters under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, to address the challenges of unavailable leader signals and non-differentiability issue caused by the DoS attacks, a class of first-order low-pass filters is employed to develop a novel distributed resilient observer, which accurately estimate the exosystem state with the existence of high-order derivatives. Then, by viewing the output of observer as the reference signal, a distributed resilient controller is designed for each follower to address the reference-tracking problem. By introducing a smooth function with positive integrable time-varying function, novel adaptive laws are developed and incorporated with the controller design to effectively compensate for the unknown time-varying parameters. By utilising Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotic convergence of output regulation error can be ensured. Finally, simulation results are conducted to verify the validity of the designed method.},

  abstract     = {Single link flexible manipulators have the advantage of a higher degree of manipulability as compared to rigid manipulators. However, their inherent structural flexibility causes the deformation of the manipulator link during task. The dynamic model of a flexible manipulator, which is ideally represented by a partial differential equation (PDE), is not be always conducive to the design of a comprehensive controller. To address this issue, this work proposes a controller design based on a balanced truncated model that effectively contains the dominant dynamics of the single link flexible manipulator system, which substantially reduces the computational cost of controller implementation while also simplifying the design process. Further, the work also proposes a strategy to design a robust functional observer-based output feedback sliding mode controller for position control of the single link flexible manipulator. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art controllers used for comparison.},

This control method combines decentralised adaptive event-triggering mechanism (DAETM) and anti-bump condition. The main work is as follows: First, a DAETM is considered to allocate network resources properly and resist data injection attacks. Then, a data buffer is adopted to consolidate data from decentralised channels for ensuring timely utilisation. In addition, a controller gain condition is presented to achieve the bumpless switching between subsystems. Moreover, by adopting piecewise Lyapunov function method, sufficient conditions are obtained for triggered switched systems to be exponentially stable and anti-bump under injection attacks.

The analysis employs the mode-dependent average dwell time approach. Firstly, the concept of dissipativity on finite-region for 2-D switched systems is introduced. Then, a sufficient condition under which the considered systems can demonstrate the finite-region boundedness with the external disturbances is established by the special recursive formulas. Additionally, a sufficient condition for finite-region dissipativity of the considered systems is provided. Furthermore, the dissipative state feedback controller is derived to ensure the finite-region dissipativity of the closed-loop systems.

In order to combat signal fading from sensors to controllers and improve communication reliability, spatial diversity is achieved through cooperative terminal relay signals. At each transmission instant, the terminal only selects a better signal for transmission and a switched system is constructed. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework of RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying DFCP is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the randomness of DFCP derived from a three nodes model composed of DF relay, a new objective function based on the mathematical expectation of the traditional quadratic function of MPC is established. Then, the orthogonal complement technique is applied to handle the inherent couplings of variables to formulate a solvable optimisation problem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC strategy and the stability of the established closed-loop system in terms of the average dwell time (ADT) method. Finally, three experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of systems with polytopic uncertainties and persistent bounded disturbances in the long-distance transmission environment. The signal transmitted over a long distance is very likely to be destroyed by the channel fading. To address this issue, an amplify-and-forward cooperation protocol (AFCP) is adopted in the forward channel, i.e. from sensor nodes to the remote controller node, to improve the transmission quality. Considering the difficulty of obtaining the system state in practice, the dynamic output feedback control in the framework of RMPC is put forward. With respect to the parameter uncertainty, persistent bounded disturbances, and randomness of the transmission power stored in sensors and the AF relay, the objective function is defined by the mathematical expectation of a quadratic function over the infinite time horizon. Then, based on this establishment, a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem is readily formulated. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition technique is utilised to mitigate the non-convexity and formulate an auxiliary optimisation problem with the solvability, meanwhile, the sufficient criterion for the mean-square input-to-state stability of the underlying system is obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

With this formula, we present a precise counterpart to compute the credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Leveraging these analytical formulations, we construct a novel tri-objective portfolio selection problem, integrating credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness as objectives, along with some practical constraints. When used with the returns of the portfolio as a whole, the derived analytical expressions help to overcome the otherwise computationally expensive approach involving the simulation of results using individual assets' returns. The proposed model is solved by adapting an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been specifically designed to solve portfolio selection models of this type. The efficiency of the proposed model is then demonstrated by taking a real-world scenario of financial stock market datasets from the NSE India. Based on the results of this study, it appears that the proposed novel tri-objective portfolio selection model produces promising results compared to the baseline model and the NIFTY 50 Index considered as a benchmark.},

First, a distributed predefined-time observer is constructed to estimate the leader's state information for each follower agent. Then, based on the recovered information, the predefined-time local controller is designed for each follower agent by utilising the predefined-time backstepping control approach. Moreover, the neural network (NN) is incorporated to identify the lumped unknown item. Particularly, an indirect learning mechanism is adopted to determine the upper bound of the optimal NN weight. In this way, the computational cost of the presented controller is greatly degraded. Stability evaluation shows that the presented controller can guarantee the position and velocity synchronisation errors regulate to the minor regions around zero in predefined time. Lastly, simulated studies are conducted on the consensus of networked robotic manipulators to validate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the secure bipartite consensus tracking of multiagent systems (MASs) with the communication event-triggered mechanism (ETM) and the controller ETM under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Unlike the existing analysis method, not all attacks lead to bad consequences in the paper. By a tag update, an attack detection mechanism is proposed to estimate whether malicious attacks happen or not. It can do its utmost to identify all connections and generate a new spanning tree to reduce the adverse impact if attacks occur. Both dynamic communication ETM and dynamic controller ETM are designed with adjusting parameters to further decrease the resource usage. Requirements are acquired to achieve the bipartite consensus tracking by the Young's inequality, Lyapunov functions and rigorous mathematical analysis. In addition, an iterative algorithm is designed to get the most relaxed restriction of the grievous attack time. Simulation results are shown to certify the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript delves into the realm of projective synchronisation in delayed neural networks governed by Caputo fractional-order dynamics, addressing the intricate challenges of attaining finite-time synchronisation in networks with distinct structures, functions, and orders. To start, the integration of a compensation controller within the control architecture is examined, aiming to formulate the projection error dynamics. By leveraging projection error system analysis alongside output observation and sliding mode control, a meticulously crafted derivative-based sliding mode surface along with a sliding mode controller are devised, ensuring both convergence and seamless sliding motion. Afterwards, the accessibility of the surface is assessed through relevant lemmas, Caputo derivative characteristics and the Lyapunov direct approach. The subsequent stability of sliding path is corroborated, and indispensable prerequisites for achieving finite-time projective synchronisation are outlined. Furthermore, the establishment of an upper bound for synchronisation time of distinct Caputo fractional-order delayed neural networks (CFDNNs) with inconsistent orders is carried out. Ultimately, simulations on distinct CFDNNs with consistent and inconsistent orders are conducted to exemplify our approach, employing the continuous frequency distribution model.},

For the torsional vibration subsystem, a new robust state feedback controller is constructed via a backstepping technique to ensure the vibration angle of the motor rotor within given constraints via a proper asymmetric barrier function.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the tracking control problem of nonlinear time delay systems. For time delay systems, we consider nonaffine pure-feedback structure. Additionally, the case where the time delay systems are subject to input saturation and unknown states is also taken into account. To begin with, a mean value theorem and an implicit function theorem are exploited to transform the systems into an affine form. Afterwards, a state observer is developed to estimate the unknown state variables and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to approximate the unknown functions. The output of the command filter replaces the virtual control signal'derivative, thereby circumventing the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Meanwhile, compensation signals are introduced to eliminate the filtering errors in a dynamic surface control (DSC). A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is designed to mitigate the unknown constant state time delay. During the controller design process, combining a prescribed performance control (PPC) with a command filter control, the tracking error can converge to a predetermined bound. Additionally, the effect of input saturation is eliminated with the aid of an auxiliary system. Finally, the effectiveness of such controller is further proved by taking an electromechanical system as an application object.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of a discrete-time Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control (FSMC) system for Single Input Single Output (SISO) applications, utilising the Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) method for system modelling. The proposed methodology emphasises the Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) to ensure minimal tracking errors through a transformation of tracking errors based on a specified performance function. A Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (FQSMC) is subsequently developed to maintain the tracking error within predetermined bounds, effectively addressing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with the traditional sliding mode control. The integration of fractional calculus enhances the smoothness of the output while ensuring accurate tracking, making it ideal for real-world applications. Additionally, a novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) observer is introduced to bolster the system's resilience against uncertainties and disturbances without complicating the computational process. The effectiveness of the proposed Prescribed Performance Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (PP-FQSMC) is validated through extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental studies conducted on a Tank system. Results demonstrate that the PP-FQSMC significantly outperforms traditional methods, with maximum tracking errors of 1.6 × 10 −4 compared to 0.2 for the PP-QSMC and a Root Mean Square Tracking Error (RMSTE) of 1.3 × 10 −3 compared to 1.2 × 10 −4 for the PP-QSMC, ensuring strong tracking performance and stability. The findings indicate that the proposed controller effectively mitigates chattering in control signals while maintaining a smooth output. It showcases its potential for practical applications in environments characterised by model inaccuracies, time delays, and external disturbances.},

To guarantee predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free performance of the closed-loop system, a predefined-time sliding mode function with adjustable parameters is proposed. This sliding mode function contains two equilibrium points. When the states of the closed-loop system are on the sliding mode surface, they converge to the equilibrium point near the initial states. Based on this sliding mode function, an adaptive attitude stabilising control law with tuning parameters is designed to compensate the external disturbances and inertia uncertainty. The presented control law guarantees that the settling time of the closed-loop system and the bounds of the system states can be explicitly determined in advance by adjusting parameters of the sliding mode function and the control law. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law.

A special combination of super twisting differentiator (STD) and event-triggered ESO is devised with a designed event-triggered mechanism. Specially, the proposed STD-ETESO incorporates a finite-time switching strategy, which improves the poor transient performance of the STD acting as a pre-filter to prepare relatively smooth signals for the ESO. The locally asymptotic boundedness of the estimation error can be guaranteed by the Input-state-stability (ISS) and existing research for the STD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a general example and a practical motion control system. Different integral criteria is introduced to evaluate the overall tracking accuracy and energy usage for comparison with existing different ESOs, which reveals the superiority of the proposed STD-ETESO in noise attenuation and disturbance rejection.},

With the rapid development of the various adaptive algorithms, it is both urgent and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. Therefore, this paper thoroughly examined adaptive filters for the existing literature related to adaptive filtering in noise cancellation. The adaptive filter provides a superior approach for the suppression of noise from non-stationary signals. Although there already exist some valuable surveys on adaptive filters, they do not provide a systematic overview of the challenges faced by adaptive filters and lack a careful distinction and comparison of the various adaptive filter techniques in noise cancellation in non-stationary signals. Three key aspects, namely the challenges faced by adaptive filters, the evolutionary paths involved in the adaptive filter algorithm, and the specific application tasks are discussed in detail. Further, the MATLAB simulations have been carried out to evaluate the filtering performance of the adaptive filter.},

This article first reviews the development history and trends of manned/unmanned teaming systems in the U.S. military. It then elaborates on the new challenges in intelligent networking posed by manned/unmanned teaming operations at the levels of networks, links, and nodes.

Next, a sliding mode observer is devised to track the sliding motion and error system, demonstrating system stability and robustness through linear matrix inequalities.

To solve this problem, we propose a distributed optimisation algorithm based on iterative learning methods that combines the terminal iterative learning strategy with the subgradient strategy. When the initial states of all agents are the same in each iteration, by the proposed algorithm, it is proved that all agents' states asymptotically converge to the optimal solution. Moreover, considering that the initial states of agents in each iteration may not be accurately measured, we further study the distributed optimisation problem under different initial states. We find that all agents' states asymptotically converge to the neighbourhood of the optimal solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the numerical simulations.},

Departing from the traditional approaches of using the property of the terminal cost or relaxed Lyapunov inequalities, this paper establishes its stability based on the property of a modified stage cost. First, we rotate the stage cost with the terminal cost. Then a one-step optimisation problem is defined based on this augmented stage cost. It is shown that a slightly modified Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm is stable if the value function of the augmented one-step cost (OSVF) is a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF). Stability for MPC algorithms with zero terminal cost or even negative terminal cost can be unified with this new approach. Combining it with the existing MPC stability theories, we are able to significantly relax the stability requirement on MPC and extend the stabilising MPC design space to the region that no existing MPC stability theories can cover. The proposed stage cost-based approach will help to further reduce the gap between stability theory and practical applications of MPC and other optimisation-based control methods.},

First, in the absence of interference, a time-varying Lyapunov function with increasing coefficient is introduced to derive sufficient conditions for the reference adaptive control of the H ∞ model, where the dwell time is an arbitrary preset constant. Secondly, an adaptive controller and adaptive law are proposed to ensure the asymptotic tracking of the switched system. Then, in the case of interference, the sufficient conditions for the solvable H ∞ model reference adaptive tracking control under dwell time switching are proposed, and the standard L 2 -gain performance of the switching system is analysed. The characteristic of this paper is to solve the H ∞ model reference adaptive tracking control problem of a class of switched systems with uncertain parameters by using time-varying Lyapunov function with increasing coefficient. The increasing coefficient in Lyapunov function can increase the degree of freedom of controller design and improve the control performance of the system. Dwell time switching can avoid the H ∞ control problem of switched system which cannot realise state-dependent switching because all state information cannot be obtained.},

  abstract     = {Switched affine systems (SASs) are a special class of switched systems. The existing works about SASs predominantly focuses on steady-state performance. There exist limited attention given to transient performance, particularly the transient performance induced by switchings. The inappropriate switchings can induce severe signal jumps, degrade the steady-state performance of the system, and even lead to instability. The bumpless transfer control (BTC) represents an effective strategy for mitigating signal jumps. However, the existing BTC methods are primarily designed for general switched systems, and these approaches are often not applicable to SASs. This article is focussed on the issue of H ∞ BTC for SASs under unmodeled disturbances. Firstly, an affine term (AT) related to H ∞ bumpless transfer (BT) performance definition is introduced for the SAS to characterise the alleviation level of the bumps in the control input signal at switching points. Secondly, a criterion is established to enable the solvability of the H ∞ BTC problem for the SAS. Thirdly, an H ∞ BT controller and a switching signal are co-designed to drive the SAS to satisfy the H ∞ BT performance which may not be shared by the subsystems. Finally, a turbofan engine model example is implemented to illustrate the availability and rationality of the suggested H ∞ BTC scheme.},

To avoid any unexpected alteration due to failures, the proposed control scheme design addresses all types of actuator faults that are bias, drift, and loss of accuracy as additive faults, as well as a multiplicative fault that results in loss of effectiveness with nonaffine state-dependency. Restrictions on control gains and unmatched interconnections are eliminated, and the explosion complexity caused by recursive back-stepping designs is avoided. Fuzzy Systems approximate the unknown ideal control laws along side the acutator faults and disturbances.

By imposing new conditions on the Lyapunov function and its derivative, the state convergence to the origin from any initial condition with bounded norm in the classical setting is extended to the initial conditions with unbounded norms in the present work. The proposed new notions of stability are called extended global asymptotic stability (EGAS) and extended global uniform asymptotic stability (EGUAS) in this paper. The proposed Lyapunov-based criteria yield the global asymptotic stability of the origin and fixed-time/predefined-time attractiveness of any selected neighbourhood of the origin. The result is that the dynamical behaviour of the state trajectories from the convergence time point of view is improved considerably. The relationship between the smoothness and input-to-state stability (ISS) properties is also studied from a quantitative point of view. Under some new sufficient conditions, it is shown that dynamical systems with smaller Lipschitz constants represent smaller ultimate bounds, and as a result, are more robust. The desirable dynamical behaviour and robustness property of the proposed stability notion makes it comparable with the finite/fixed/predefined/prescribed (exact) stable systems that are naturally non-Lipschitz at the origin. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Landslides are a major threat to the safety of human life and property. The purpose of landslide spatial prediction is to establish the relationship between the location of landslides and each landslide evaluation factor, and to spatially identify high landslide risk areas using data mining and geographic information science. In this paper, a landslide spatial prediction model is put forward based on cascade forest (CF) and Stacking ensemble learning algorithm. Firstly, the landslide spatial prediction scheme is designed. Then, the improved CF is established by combining random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The Stacking ensemble learning algorithm is introduced to establish CF-Stacking model combined with the improved CF. Finally, experiments are conducted using geospatial data of the actual study area. 12 landslide disaster-inducing factors are extracted from the study area, and the CF-Stacking model is applied to the spatial prediction of landslides. The result shows that CF-Stacking outperforms comparative models in terms of the area under curve and brier score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting landslide spatial patterns. The CF-Stacking model is used to generate a landslide susceptibility map for Fengjie, which provides valuable guidance for geological hazard early warning.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are fundamental in numerous advanced engineering applications, from aerospace to telecommunications, where precise system identification is critical for optimal performance. However, the identification of such systems often faces significant hurdles due to data scarcity, with existing approaches typically requiring substantial amounts of data for effective training. Addressing this challenge, this paper introduces a novel transfer learning framework designed specifically for MIMO system identification under conditions of limited data and inherent uncertainties. The proposed framework is applied to two case studies: the first in metal additive manufacturing, specifically the laser-blown powder-directed energy deposition as the source domain and the laser hot wire-directed energy deposition as the target domain, and the second involving a nonlinear case study of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) with a temperature-dependent reaction. The results underscore the framework's effectiveness in capturing the dynamics of the target systems, including the ability to effectively model nonlinear dynamics. Comparative analyses highlight the benefits of employing dimensionless numbers in dynamic system modelling, offering reduced dimensionality, more physical meaning, and increased model accuracy. Overall, the proposed framework presents a promising approach to enhance system identification in MIMO systems with limited data and uncertainties, with potential applications across diverse domains.},

The structure of the proposed controller consists of two parts designed based on the offline/online schemes. In the offline-scheme, an H ∞ -based robust tracking controller is provided to satisfy the robust and tracking performance. Based on the H ∞ performance, a new linear matrix inequality problem is developed to calculate the offline-controller gains. By considering the Lyapunov-function of the offline-controller as the terminal cost of the MPC and the designed offline-controller, the online optimisation problem (OOP) is structured. This means, the MPC is designed based on the stabilised system to satisfy the physical limitations of the overall controller and the system states. Moreover, to improve the feasibility problem of the OOP, an ellipsoidal terminal constraint is added to the proposed MPC problem. Therefore, compared with the existing min–max MPC and tube MPC, the advantages of the overall controller are feasibility improvement and reducing the computational complexity with less conservatism while the robustness against parametric uncertainties and disturbances is achieved. Two simulation examples are employed to show the superiorities of the proposed robust MPC.},

Distinct from the relevant results which utilise the current intercepted data or additionally consider side information, a more universal attack model is proposed which combines historical data and side information with the current intercepted data to synergistically deteriorate the system estimation performance. In order to quantify the impact resulting from the proposed attack strategy, the optimisation objective is characterised by deriving the error covariance matrix under the attacks, which becomes more intricate since the proposed attack model introduces more decision variables and coupled terms. Take the stealthiness which is characterised by Kullback-Leibler divergence as the constraints, the problem investigated in this work is equivalently transformed into the constrained multi-variable non-convex optimisation problems, which are not able to be solved directly by the methods in the relevant results. By utilising the Lagrange multiplier method, the structural characteristic of the optimal mean and the optimal covariance which only related to the Lagrange multiplier are derived, such that the optimal distribution of the modified innovation is able to be obtained by a simple search procedure. Following that, the design of the optimal attack strategy is completed by using semi-definite programming to derive the optimal attack matrices. Finally, the simulation examples are given such that the validity of the results is verified.},

On the basis of fuzzy logic systems (FLS), an FLS observer was designed to dispose of unmeasurable states. Under the framework of backstepping technique design, a practical adaptive fixed-time control method is proposed by combining FLS observer with fixed-time theory. In the course of designing the controller, a hyperbolic tangent function is introduced to tackle the singularity problem that may pertain in the derivative of the controller, thereby shunning the phenomenon of chattering and diminishing the computational complexity. For the sake of lessening the communication burden of MASs, a modified dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is proposed. The developed controller assures that all signals of the MASs are bounded, and the consensus tracking errors converge to a small neighbourhood of the zero within a fixed-time interval. Ultimately, multiple UAVs were simulated as examples, and the emulation outcomes display that the availability of the presented control scheme was certified.},

In parametric approach, the concepts of survival function, hazard rate function and mean residual function were extended for fuzzy random variables. After that, we obtain and analyse these indexes for fuzzy exponential and fuzzy two-parameter Weibull distributions as two frequently used lifetime distribution in reliability theory. Moreover, with the assumption that the distribution of fuzzy observations is unknown (non-parametric approach), first an estimate for the fuzzy distribution function is presented, and then an estimate for the aging indices of the system is investigated. To do this, the concept of fuzzy empirical distribution function is investigated as an estimator of cumulative distribution function.

  abstract     = {This study focused on designing a smooth velocity observer (VO) for mechanical systems whose mathematical model is uncertain. The uncertainties that appear in the observer dynamics are, via utilising their universal approximation property, modelled with fuzzy logics. A novel self-adaptive fuzzy logic (SAFL)-based term in which control representative value matrix (CRVM), centres and widths of membership function are all dynamically updated is used as part of the observer design. Through the application of Lyapunov-type stability analysis techniques, the practical stability of the observed velocity error was guaranteed. The outcomes derived from experimentation on a planar robotic manipulator are showcased to illustrate the performance of the devised VO design.},

Inspired in the discrete-time robust dynamic programming, sufficient conditions for the existence of a type of robust feedback NE are given in the solution of a set of discrete-time difference equations. A formal induction proof is provided for the closed form of the obtained robust set of strategies. Two illustrative simulation examples are included, one related to the problem of coordination of a two-echelon supply chain with uncertain seasonal demand. The goal of the agents is to reduce the expected cost of storage while satisfying a partially known demand. The second example is related to a game of government debt stabilisation.

In contrast to the majority of existing event-triggered control results, where only the input or output signal is triggered, the design problem of a dual-channel event-triggered mechanism is studied to achieve a more comprehensive saving of communication resources. Subsequently, in order to reconstruct system states, a continuous-discrete observer that can achieve asymptotic convergence of estimation errors is constructed based on event-triggered output. Then, an event-triggered asymptotic tracking control scheme is introduced through Levant differentiators, filtered error compensation signals, and the backstepping technique. The Levant differentiators not only address the challenge of computational complexity explosion but also effectively resolve the problem of controller segmentation continuity. The control scheme has been proven to maintain all signals in the closed-loop system bounded and achieve zero tracking error as time approaches infinity. Subsequently, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is one of the features used in CAVs. Using CACC increases the vulnerability of such systems to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. To address this, this paper proposes a novel mitigation approach to compensate for FDI attacks and noise in real-time. In addition to FDI attacks, the current CACC algorithm suffers from input delay and disturbance. Here, we develop a nonlinear controller and an FDI attacks estimation technique to mitigate the effects of FDI attacks, noise, input delay and additive disturbance. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the Lyapunov-based stability analysis to ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded tracking. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we validate it through simulation analysis.},

In addition, the improved event-triggered control strategy effectively reduces the transmission burden and saves the resource cost. The stability analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves the ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop systems and the states of the systems do not violate the corresponding constraints.

With the help of an existing model-based value iteration (VI) algorithm, we propose two data-driven VI algorithms to solve the GARE. The first one relies on transforming the stochastic system into a deterministic control system first and then solving the LQSOC problem by the data of the deterministic system. Consequently, this algorithm does not need the information of two system coefficients and has a lower algorithm complexity. The second algorithm directly uses the data generated by the stochastic system, and thus it circumvents the requirement of all system coefficients.

Using the log-barrier penalty method, we only need to study an unconstrained approximation problem of the original problem. Firstly, each agent's state converges to the optimal value of the related local objective function in a fixed time. Simultaneously, the upper bound of fixed time in this paper is smaller than some existing results. Then, in the case of communication delay, time-triggered and event-triggered methods with non-uniform sampling interval are proposed in this paper, which make the communication cost lower and the application broader. Using the Lyapunov function method, the sufficient conditions for each agent's state to converge to the optimal point are given, and the Zeno behaviour is excluded.

Traditional numerical algorithms for OCPs with pantograph delay systems have predominantly focused on unconstrained scenarios, neglecting constrained problems. Therefore, we propose a novel symplectic pseudospectral iteration framework for constrained problems. First, we employ the successive convexification (SCvx) method to transform the original problem into a series of linear quadratic (LQ) problems, addressing nonlinearity. Then, leveraging time-scale transformations and parametric variational principles, we derive the first-order necessary conditions (FONCs) for these convexified problems, including a Hamiltonian two-point boundary value problem (HTBVP) with stretching terms and a linear complementarity problem. To handle pantograph time delays effectively, we employ a local Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) pseudospectral method with proportional grid discretization. Finally, employing a symplectic indirect algorithm, we develop a symplectic pseudospectral method (SPM) for solving the transformed LQ problems, converting them into a system of sparse linear algebraic equations and a linear complementarity problem. Validation of the framework is performed using diverse illustrative examples, demonstrating strong agreement between SCvx and SPM in computational efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the sparsity of the core matrix and robustness to initial guesses.},

The estimation of unknown input is obtained from innovation through weighted least-squares (WLS) estimation. The approximate linear regression form allows us to process the nonlinear system with unknown input direct feedthrough by using the UMV state estimation framework, and derive the filter by minimising the trace of the state error covariance of the measurement update under the unbiased condition. The URTSF-UMV requires that the unknown input distribution matrix is full column rank. We use the full rank decomposition method to deal with the nonlinear system containing the unknown input rank-deficient distribution matrix.

Specifically, this article presents a dynamic event-triggered strategy and energy restrictions to reduce network traffic and protect network resources during deception attacks. To prevent the system state from becoming unavailable, a state estimator is concurrently developed using the output signal. The application of Lyapunov stability theory yields sufficient criteria that ensure neural network stability. The study also accurately describes the controller gain's by solving Linear matrix inequality. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

The objective is to introduce control algorithms to steer a team of mobile agents into a desired, moving geometrical pattern while the agents are unaware of their own and other agents' velocity information during the entire process. We introduce a formation control law under which the agents asymptotically shape a desired geometrical pattern and track a constant reference velocity. Another control law is then introduced to address the case where the reference velocity is time-varying. Both control laws are based on the complex Laplacian approach and do not require agents' velocity information. The convergence of these algorithms are proved and their performance are examined via numerical examples. Simulation results verify the outperformance of the proposed control laws compared to the rival control schemes in the literature.},

Then, by employing compromised state variables, a fuzzy adaptive iterative learning resilient control method is presented based on the composite energy function, where unknown nonlinear functions are handled using fuzzy logic systems.

In contrast, a fixed-time estimate of the settling-time is obtained for destabilising impulses. Secondly, terminal sliding mode ( TSM ) control is designed in the presence of hybrid (continuous and impulsive) matched disturbances for n -dimensional systems. It shows that the trajectories can reach the sliding surfaces in fixed-time and thus will stay on it after that under the influence of the proposed TSM . Thus, the system states will converge to the origin in a fixed-time.

Due to the practical limitation inherent to physical systems (or their mathematical representation) and constraints on the input variables, the constrained control theory became an important research field. In this work, based on set-invariance theory, we propose an eigenstructure assignment optimisation using a state-feedback control law that guarantees the respect of state and control constraints for second-order systems. Positive invariance is the property of keeping the trajectory of the system states inside the set. This characteristic is incorporated into the analysis and design of the control law to ensure local stability and constraint fulfilment.},

First, a general nonlinear autoregressive moving average with the exogenous input (NARMAX) model is used as the dynamic nonlinear PLS model. Then, by introducing a dynamic linearisation approach in each latent variable (LV) space, the unknown NARMAX-based PLS model is transformed to a linear dynamic PLS data model (dPLSDM), which can be improved in real time by estimating its unknown parameter using the latent input and output (I/O) data. Next, a data-driven latent variable adaptive control (DDLVAC) is proposed in each LV loop. By virtue of the dPLSDM, the multivariable nonlinear process is decoupled into multiple single-loop systems and the high dimensions of the process data are reduced such that the corresponding DDLVAC is simplified. Further, the DDLVAC only depends on the I/O data without requiring any model information of the original process. Theoretical analysis confirms the validity of the DDLVAC. The simulation study demonstrates the advantages of the DDLVAC such as less storage space, smaller computation burden, less control cost, as well as more robustness against uncertainties.},

To this end, a tracking controller is firstly synthesised by introducing the fading parameter as an amplification factor towards ‘retrieving’ the original information to some extent. An auxiliary function and the multi-dimensional Chebyshev inequality make it possible to derive sufficient conditions such that the tracking error falls into its specified domain with a frequency larger than a pre-given value. By employing an inequality involving unmatched membership functions of the controller and fuzzy system, the favourite property of matched membership functions can be employed.

A novel adaptive neural network (NN)-based event-triggered control is considered that uses the nonlinear estimator to predict the state of other agents. Since data access is denied during DoS attacks, the overall system switches between two modes of stable and unstable containment behaviours. Therefore, the maximum of attack duration and frequency is determined such that the overall system evolution leads to containment convergence in the presence of DoS attacks. We proposed an adaptive NN-based distributed disturbance observer to estimate external disturbances in a nonlinear system's dynamics. The state estimator predicts neighbouring agents' states, and each agent's input and event times are determined without monitoring other agents. The directed graph topology is used to determine data exchange among agents instead of an undirected graph that reduces implementation conditions. Zeno-free behaviour is also proved by analysis of the system. Eventually, the numerical simulation of the proposed approach is shown.

In particular, an edge-based event-triggered protocol is proposed to reduce unnecessary information transmission through energy-limited and fragile networks, where the dynamic event-triggered condition is designed by introducing internal dynamic variables. The state of agents is dynamically estimated, and the control inputs based on estimated value can offer better control performance. It is demonstrated that under DoS attacks, the security consensus of multi-agent systems can be realised without Zeno behaviour by adopting the dynamic edge-based event-triggered control strategy. Finally, a numerical simulation example is included to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Feedforward control with model inversion is a widely-used solution for high-precision output tracking. However, because inverting a non-minimum phase model generates unbounded control input, model-inversion only applies to limited types of systems. This paper presents a new non-parametric pseudo-inversion approach to design bounded optimal control input with desirable properties for arbitrary types of systems. Closed-form equations are presented for the batch (full preview) and recursive (limited preview) implementations of this approach, and its performance is compared against existing pseudo-inversion methods in benchmark numerical examples. Furthermore, the practical implementation of the proposed method is demonstrated by designing a feedforward controller for a commercial 3-Dimensional (3D) printer. The results show that the proposed approach effectively compensates for the structural vibrations of the printer, preventing layer-shifting errors that usually happen during high-speed printing.},
