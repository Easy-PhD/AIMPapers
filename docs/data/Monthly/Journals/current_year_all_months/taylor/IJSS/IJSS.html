  abstract     = {A distributed data-driven algorithm is proposed for market clearing within a community-based energy market. The objective is to maximise social welfare in energy trading. Each participant in the market, known as a prosumer, employs an extremum-seeking control (ESC) algorithm within a consensus-based architecture based on simple third-order dynamics. The proposed method circumvents the need for a central coordinator in the market clearing process. Furthermore, prosumers do not require analytical and exact formulations of cost or utility functions. They are required to transmit only a single local decision variable to the neighbours through an undirected connected graph. Under the assumption that prosumers have strongly convex local objective functions, the proposed algorithm demonstrates semi-global practical asymptotic (SPA) convergence to the optimal solution. This convergence is established using averaging theory. Simulation results validate the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of the proposed distributed strategy.},

Then, radial basis function neural networks and adaptive estimation strategies are introduced to deal with unknown nonlinear functions and actuator fault parameters, which improves the fault tolerance of the system. Then, with the purpose of reducing the control cost, this paper adds the control method of handling event-triggered inputs to the control strategy.

The performance constraint is solved by means of the barrier Lyapunov function transformation of merging errors, and the initial transformation limitation is thoroughly removed due to the use of tuning function. Then by employing a neural network to approximate the unknown vehicle dynamics, we derive both distance and angle merging controllers satisfying prescribed performance, and a set of bound estimation schemes is involved to deal with the effect of actuator faults. On the basis of Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that our controller is capable of guaranteeing the boundedness of all vehicles states.

The characteristic function of output process is represented from the terms of its residual characteristic function. An explicit formula to compute the Rényi entropy for the output process of the MCARMA system is derived. In addition, we investigate the covariance matrix to find the upper bound of Rényi entropy. We present three simulations that serve to illustrate the behaviour of information in the MCARMA system, where the control and noise follow the Gaussian, Cauchy and Laplace distributions. Finally, the behaviour of Rényi entropy is illustrated in two real-world applications: a paper-making process and an electric circuit system.},

To effectively counteract the external disturbances and guide the states of all agents toward an optimal consensus point, the controller is designed based on gradient descent and the internal model principle. Furthermore, with Lyapunov stability theory, the designed controller can be proved to achieve asymptotic stability without time-varying parameters and the Zeno-behaviour is effectively excluded.

  abstract     = {The study of conformable fractional-order systems has gained significant importance due to their ability to model complex dynamic behaviors across various applications. However, these systems encounter several challenges, such as the unique properties of conformable derivatives, the presence of nonlinear perturbations, and time-varying delays, all of which complicate stability and control design. Additionally, traditional control approaches often struggle to balance stability, performance, and efficient resource utilization, particularly when addressing event-triggered mechanism that are prone to Zeno behavior. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing a novel event-triggered control framework to solve the guaranteed cost control problem for delayed conformable fractional-order systems with nonlinear perturbations. By utilizing the Razumikhin stability theorem and conformable fractional calculus, we derive sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the existence of guaranteed cost state-feedback control. A key contribution of this work is the development of a criterion to eliminate Zeno behavior, ensuring the practical implementation of the event-triggered control strategy. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two simulation examples: a conformable fractional-order neural network and an electrical circuit model.},

Second, stochastic sampling control is employed for singular systems with time-varying delay using the Bernoulli distribution technique, rather than the deterministic sampling used by existing works.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a switching anti-windup design for linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems with asymmetric input constraint. Firstly, the input space of the LTI plant is divided into several regions based on the sign of each control input. In each of these regions, the original asymmetric saturation function can be equivalently written as a symmetric one. Then, we design a separate anti-windup gain for each region and implement it when the value of the input signal falls into this region. The online switching between different anti-windup gains enables the full utilisation of the available range of control action on both sides of the saturation limits, which is something that the classical single gain anti-windup design cannot achieve. By incorporating the special properties of asymmetric saturation constraints, a multiple Lyapunov function is constructed for closed-loop stability and performance analysis. This can significantly reduce the conservatism of the resulting stability and performance synthesis conditions. Finally, numerical simulation and aero-engine hardware-in-loop testing demonstrate that, the proposed design has the ability to obtain a significantly larger domain of attraction and an improved control performance than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The cooperative tracking consensus problem for discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) with state and input constraints is addressed by a novel safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. In MASs, all agents communicate through a directed communication graph. The algorithm is developed within the policy iteration (PI) framework, relying solely on measured data from the system trajectories in the environment. Additionally, the reward functions are enhanced by the integration of control barrier functions (CBFs) and input constraint functions.

  abstract     = {This research focuses on designing a resilient active disturbance rejection hybrid-triggered control scheme for mode-dependent parabolic-type nonlinear PDE systems when subjected to gain fluctuations and multiple disturbances. Specifically, matched disturbances are precisely estimated by using a disturbance observer, while the H ∞ control strategy mitigates the effects of mismatched disturbances. Further, to alleviate network communication transmission and conserve network resources, the hybrid-triggered technique has been implemented, which encompasses both time-triggered and event-triggered approaches. Here, the switching behaviour within the hybrid mechanism is governed by Bernoulli distributions. From thereon, the resilient hybrid-triggered active disturbance rejection controller is developed to achieve the intended disturbance rejection and stabilisation of the considered system. Therein, the gain fluctuations in both controller and disturbance observer gain matrices are factored, thereby improving resiliency. Afterward, through picking mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidates, sufficient requirements are obtained in the setting of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the assayed system. Ultimately, the proposed control method effectiveness is exemplified through the presentation of two numerical examples.},

A predefined-time extended state observer (PTESO) is derived to estimate both the unknown system states and disturbances, with the upper bound for the settling time (UBST) precisely defined by one design parameter in a less conservative manner than those of finite-time or fixed-time ESOs. Furthermore, the peak observation errors are small during the transient process. Then, using the estimates, a CPTSMC law is designed for the chattering-alleviated predefined-time convergence of system states. The internal mechanism of parameter tuning for improving transient performance is theoretically explored. In addition to proving that the UBST of the whole system is precisely defined by one design parameter, we show the continuity of CPTSMC and the boundedness of all system signals that are vital for practical applications.

Meanwhile, the piecewise linear (PWL) model has been proven to have the ability to approximate complex nonlinear systems. The construction of a PWL model entail to partitioning the state space into finite regions, and estimating the parameters of each subsystem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accomplish these two tasks via an intelligent Voronoi partition approach and solving a series of optimization problems. Firstly, we estimate the certain range of the subsystem parameters of one region directly from noisy data. This estimation is fulfilled by set operation between noise zonotope and the input-state data set, the optimal subsystem parameters are obtained by minimizing the noise zonotope. Secondly, this procedure is applied to all regions, a cost function is designed based on these noise zonotopes, by changing the partition, the cost function varies. Finally, an annealing simulation (SA) algorithm is utilized to search for the most adequate partition to ensure the fitting accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example and on experimental data from an actual water supply system.},

  abstract     = {A mean-field social control problem for uncertain nonlinear stochastic systems is investigated by using a robust static output feedback (SOF) strategy. First, the problem in the single decision maker case is investigated in terms of guaranteed cost control approaches to derive suboptimal conditions at the supremum of the cost function. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is used to derive the necessary conditions which are expressed as a large stochastic combined matrix equation (SCME). Second, the preliminary results in the single decision maker case are used to study the Pareto optimal strategy in a cooperative game. As our main contribution, we derive the high-order centralised strategies and the low-order decentralised strategies, respectively, for the cooperative game. In order to avoid the difficulty of higher-order dimensional problem related to SCMEs, a new reduced-order decomposition numerical scheme by means of Newton's method is developed. The computation for designing the proposed strategy set can be performed in low dimension, even when the number of decision makers approachs to infinity. Moreover, the degradation of the cost function is rigorously evaluated by comparing the centralised strategy set with the proposed strategy set. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy set.},

Therefore, it is of significant interest to explore the issues of PID control and PI state estimation for complex networked systems, particularly in mitigating the adverse effects of imperfect data transmission on system performance. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliographical review addressing PID control and PI state estimation problems for networked systems.

Subsequently, the discussion focuses on PID control and PI state estimation issues under various performance indicators.

Then, a heuristic approach is proposed to automate mission planning within a limited time. Routing is handled through a greedy algorithm that selects tasks based on their distance to a baseline path and score. B-spline path smoothing is implemented for smooth and continuous routes. The results are examined in terms of robustness, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, and non-technical requirements.

Maintaining course stability and precise control in complex maritime environments is crucial for the operation of USV. However, traditional control methods are often constrained by factors such as limited communication bandwidth, internal model uncertainties, and external disturbances. To address these challenges, firstly, we introduce a composite quantizer to describe the quantisation process linearly and then utilise a neural network system to mitigate model uncertainties and external disturbances to address these challenges, subsequently, by designing an adaptive neural network controller with input quantisation and output constraints, which not only reduces the controller's execution frequency but also ensures that control command execution remains within a safe range. By creating a Barrier Lyapunov function, the suggested control method's stability is finally shown, proving that all of the system signals eventually become confined. The system simulation results show that this methodology can enhance USV course performance, validating the effectiveness of the suggested control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces an innovative algorithm for designing a PI controller filtered with fractional-order derivatives or integrals. The algorithm is applied to two distinct models of fractional-order time delay systems. A new reference model is proposed, utilising a unity feedback structure and incorporating a fractional-order time-delayed Bode transfer function in the forward path. The parameters of this proposed reference model are determined based on the specified phase margin and gain margin requirements. Before solving the design problem, the stability analysis of the proposed reference model is analysed through a theorem. Next, the four nonlinear equations with four unknown parameters are formulated and a solution method is provided in this study. By employing the recently introduced reference model, a robust fractional-order controller is formulated. The effectiveness of this robust controller is validated through simulations that employ various phase and gain margin specifications and through the existing controllers in the literature.},

The primary objective of this study is to provide a fault-tolerant non-fragile control protocol that ensures the targeted stabilisation of the system despite gain variations and actuator faults. Moreover, the impact of external disturbances is minimised by employing mixed H ∞ and passivity performance. After that, adequate criteria are established in the framework of linear matrix inequalities through the construction of a proper Lyapunov function together with the employment of integral-based Wirtinger's inequality such that it ensures the accomplishment of finite-time boundedness with a satisfactory performance level for the closed-loop system. Consequently, the explicit configuration of the developed controller gain matrices is computed, which is obtained by solving the developed criteria.

Based on this groundwork, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) submodels are developed to capture domain-wide dynamics rather than one single value. Crucially, MISMS has pioneered the application of sequence interpretation for model decomposition and transparency, improving interpretability. The proposed scheme employs different temporal models in practical scenarios and can ensure a better prediction with long-term accuracy and stability.

  abstract     = {Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years. It provides an effective control strategy, especially in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances, and is particularly valuable when a precise system model is not available. Despite its simple control structure, ADRC exhibits high robustness to plant uncertainties and external disturbances. Numerous studies have used this technique in the case of integer-order systems, so this technique has given good results. However, only a few works have been realised in the case of fractional-order systems. Fractional systems have become important for modelling many physical phenomena. Some research has taken advantage of the fractional calculus to design ADRC for both linear and nonlinear fractional-order systems. This paper presents a novel fractional-order backstepping active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) approach that integrates the backstepping control technique with a fixed-time synergetic extended state observer (ESO). This approach, which employs a fractional macro-variable to ensure fixed-time convergence in nonlinear systems, represents a new direction in ADRC design for fractional-order systems. The method begins with the development of a fixed-time synergetic ESO for estimating the extended state, which includes uncertainties and external disturbances, the fixed-time convergence of this observer is demonstrated. A backstepping controller is then designed based on the estimated states and total disturbance to achieve system stabilisation and reference tracking, while effectively compensating for the total disturbance. The proposed backstepping ADRC is compared with existing methods, including backstepping ADRC with a fractional high-order sliding mode ESO (FHOSMESO), sliding mode ADRC with FHOSMESO, and sliding mode ADRC with a fixed-time synergetic ESO (FTSESO). Superior performance in disturbance rejection and reference tracking is demonstrated by simulation results of the proposed approach.},

First, a piecewise function is proposed to characterise FTPP and eliminate the initial value limitations present in traditional prescribed performance control methods. To ensure that tracking errors satisfy prescribed performance, barrier functions are further constructed and introduced into the control design process. Second, based on the approximation of neural networks, adaptive neural state observers are designed to estimate the unmeasured states. Then, an adaptive FTPP consensus control scheme is developed based on command filtered backstepping technique and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. It guarantees that (1) all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded; and (2) for any bounded initial values, all followers' outputs can track the leader's output within a prescribed fixed-time and tracking accuracy, while satisfying the required transient tracking performance.

In light of the proposed encryption rule combined with bit-rate constraints, an iterative recursive scheme in a distributed way, receiving the desired estimator gains, is proposed by optimising the upper bound of the estimation error covariance. In addition, the impact of the allocated bit rate is made available to distributed state estimators, and the privacy of encryption strategies adopted is systematically evaluated.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we seamlessly integrate machine learning techniques with stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) to address the regulation problem of nonlinear discrete-time step backward High-Order Fully Actuated (HOFA) systems with additive disturbance. By exploiting the full-actuation characteristic of the HOFA system, we neatly eliminate the non-linearity of the system, thus circumventing the complex computation of uncertainty propagation in nonlinear stochastic MPC. To cope with the random disturbance, its probability distribution on each principal component is well captured from data based on principal component analysis, and the uncertainty bound is effectively estimated via kernel density estimation and quantile functions. Based upon such probabilistic information, we impose constraint tightening on the state limits and define terminal sets by drawing on the concept of tubes. On this basis, we employ stochastic MPC for receding horizon control of HOFA systems, of which the recursive feasibility and stability are proved theoretically. Finally, numerical experiments and an application to hydrogen electrolyzer temperature control are used to demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {A data-driven control scheme based on pattern-moving is proposed for the control problem of multi-input continuous-time non-Newtonian mechanical systems. A sampling data-driven dynamic linearisation method for pattern-moving is proposed by constructing pattern category variables with statistical characteristics to describe the output uncertainty of the system. The multi-input continuous-time non-Newtonian mechanical system is transformed into an affine Input/Output (I/O) model which includes pattern category variables and the statistical feature terms. And the statistical properties of the system are represented by the posterior probability of the pattern category variable. On this basis, the probability density evolution of the tracking error is obtained using the principle of probability density conservation, and a sampling data-driven control based on pattern-moving is proposed by constructing tracking error entropy. The algorithm for estimating controller related parameters is also provided. Then, the convergence of parameter estimation algorithms and control system tracking errors has been proven through the contraction mapping principle and the convergence theorem of iterative matrices.

The nonlinear characteristics of each agent are structured in a triangular pattern and are susceptible to influence from unspecified external disturbances. Within the framework of the lower triangular structure, a compensator with time-varying gain is tailored for each agent. This compensator is established by the output of the follower and its neighbouring agents. By utilising a directed communication topology, a distributed output feedback control protocol is crafted for the system at hand. This protocol ensures that consensus errors gradually converge towards a customisable bounded region. Moreover, the time-varying gain method can be extended to achieve consensus control for multi-agent systems, where each agent is characterised by an upper triangular structure.

This allows each subtask to focus on a specific local issue, independently learning and optimising, making the learning process simpler and more efficient. In the learning of triggering instants, an event-triggered strategy is incorporated, which greatly reduces the controller update rate, thereby reducing communication and resources occupation. In the learning of control inputs, the reward function not only considers tracking performance, but also considers both inter-vehicle distance and acceleration change rate, which ensures tracking accuracy while enhancing driving safety and comfort.

Subsequently, the necessary and sufficient conditions for robust observability are established by examining changes of state transitions, employing a logical equation set. Additionally, a novel criterion to ascertain the (weak) detectability is proposed based on the data form of BNs, from which criteria are proposed to evaluate robust (weak) detectability.

The impulsive moments are determined by a certain dynamic state-dependent event mechanism. Compared to static ETIC, the proposed dynamic ETIC scheme effectively minimises the amount of controller updates and saves a significant amount of energy without reducing the system decay rate. Utilizing Lyapunov stability theory and the variation of the parameter formula, some appropriate conditions are set to keep the synchronisation error within a non-zero bound.

Different from existing distributed average consensus approaches that require each follower to exchange and expose state information to its neighbours, our strategy avoids the requirement for communication during information interaction by decomposing each follower's state information into two sub-states. The status information is leaked, thereby achieving privacy preservation. Furthermore, for this class of MAS with unknown dynamics, we use an extended state observer to estimate the unknown dynamics and design an auxiliary system. The auxiliary variables generated by this auxiliary system combined with the back-stepping method can effectively compensate for dynamics. By combining graph theory knowledge and techniques such as Lyapunov functions, it is proven that the output-consensus tracking error of an MAS is ultimately bounded.

A novel fast adaptive unknown input observer (FAUIO) structure is proposed for the simultaneous estimation of both faults and states of a class of nonlinear systems. A new LMI condition is established by utilising the H ∞ criterion to ensure the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error of the developed observer. This derived LMI condition is deduced by incorporating the reformulated Lipschitz property, a new variant of Young inequality, and the well-known linear parameter varying (LPV) approach. It is less conservative than the existing ones in the literature, and its effectiveness is compared with the other proposed approaches. Further, the proposed observer methodology is extended for the disturbance-affected nonlinear system for the purpose of the reconstruction of states and faults/attacks with optimal noise attenuation. Later on, both designed approaches are validated through an application of a single-link robotic arm manipulator in MATLAB Simulink.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the open prescribed-time control for nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty and asymmetric state-constraints. First, a new Lyapunov theorem is given for constrained nonlinear systems, which enables the system to converge in a prescribed time without violating constraints. Based on this theorem, an adaptive state-feedback controller is designed and analysed by introducing an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function and a time-varying scaling function. It is proved that the closed-loop system is uniformly bounded, the state-constraints are not violated, and the tracking error can converge to the origin in any prescribed time independent of initial conditions. Finally, simulations and comparisons are provided for inverted pendulum system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of multi-agent persistent monitoring with monitoring count requirements. A team of agents is tasked with monitoring multiple targets to minimise mean overall target state uncertainties, while simultaneously satisfying the monitoring count requirements of specific targets within predetermined time intervals. The inherent demands of assigning different monitoring tasks to each agent and determining the appropriate execution times introduce significant complexities, making it difficult to meet the monitoring count requirements. To address this, a persistence predicate based on Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications is introduced, which allows monitoring count requirements to be concisely expressed as multiple sub-STL requirements. A two-stage distributed receding horizon control (DRHC) algorithm is then proposed to optimise the agent trajectory, including their arrival and dwell times on the targets. In the first stage, each sub-STL task is dynamically reallocated within the DRHC framework to ensure feasibility. In the second stage, a finite horizon DRHC problem is formulated to optimise the monitoring performance while meeting the local monitoring count requirements. Agents solve their problems sequentially to obtain controllers that optimise overall monitoring performance while ensuring the satisfaction of global STL tasks. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Then, starting from the basic problem of MPC without model uncertainty, a series of MPC methods and basic research ideas for solving systems with model uncertainty are presented. Furthermore, three classes of typical complicated control systems (networked systems, Markov jump systems and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems) are introduced and the key issues in adopting MPC methods for these classes of systems are illustrated.

The unknown model of the agent is first converted through dynamic linearisation into a equivalent data model, comprising a linear combination of an unknown dynamic parameter and an uncertain term. An adaptive algorithm is then formulated to estimate the unknown dynamic parameters accurately. The total uncertainty, which arises from the parameter estimation error and the uncertain term, is estimated by the extended state observer. The estimations are used by the controller to compensate for total uncertainty. Further, considering the resource limitations of communication and the constraints of the actual control input, a constrained iterative learning controller with a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developed, which guarantees control performance and reduces the number of communications in MASs. It is proven that the tracking error asymptotically approaches a small bound around zero under the proposed DDILC framework.

The approach combines policy iteration with a fault compensator, solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with this innovative value function via a critic neural network. Actuator faults are reconstructed for online fault compensation without the need for fault detection and isolation. The Lyapunov functional analysis demonstrates the closed-loop system's asymptotic stability in the presence of actuator faults and time-delay states. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault compensation strategy.

This paper presents a holistic FTC strategy, systematically addressing sensor, actuator, and component faults. A model-based ship simulation is used for structural analysis and the design of fault diagnosis models. This not only identifies faults but quantifies their impact on engine operation. Additionally, optimal sensor placement is investigated to enhance fault diagnosis across the engine system. These diagnosis models are integrated into a supervisory FTC scheme, allowing reconfiguration in response to faults. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in maintaining safe engine speed control under various fault scenarios, successfully diagnosing and reconfiguring multiple sensor faults. This research provides a novel framework for improving the safety and reliability of large marine engines, addressing a critical need in the maritime industry.},

Using a unified barrier function in place of the traditional barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) allows for the transformation of nonlinear stochastic systems with time-varying full-state constraints into equivalent ‘unconstrained’ systems for processing, which can eliminate the feasibility condition required by the virtual controllers generated using the BLF approach. The problem of unknown control gain caused by actuator failures is solved via devising reasonable adaptive laws. At the same time, a prescribed-time tracking controller is devised by using the approximation ability of fuzzy logic systems, which can adapt to the uncertainty of the system and deal with the actuator failures. In addition, the control scheme proposed in this paper can guarantee the performance of the system within prescribed-time and all state variables do not violate the constraint boundaries despite suffering from actuator failures.

The aim of the sensors is to minimise the mean square error of the fusion filter from the perspective of infinite time domain power management. The attacker interferes the fusion channels to reach the opposite goal. The competitive relationship among the sensors and attacker is modelled as a general-sum deterministic game based on Stackelberg game. Taking into account the practical situation where each player does not have a good knowledge of the global information, a distributed reinforcement learning in groups algorithm based on Stackelberg strategy is proposed to learn the joint optimal strategy. In particular, we consider that the strategy space of each player is unknown to other players and can be infinitely expanded through the individual local observation information.

The conventional paradigm in this field is to construct an iterative learning controller with the approximately identified model, considering only tracking error information at the current iteration. This leads to the neglect of the error variation trend along historical iterations. To circumvent unmodeled dynamics and capitalise on multi-step iteration error information, a backward difference iterative learning control (BD-ILC) approach is formulated. Initially, a vector data transfer mechanism employing the backward difference iteration error is introduced based on the dynamic data mapping. Within this mechanism, the proportional, differential and quadratic differential control terms are firstly incorporated simultaneously along the iteration domain. Furthermore, a convergence analysis approach is developed using the error deflation spanning tree technique. Simulations validate the enhanced efficacy of the BD-ILC approach, surpassing that of distinct control approaches.},

To be precise, with an aim to effectively lower the network transmission rate in both the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels, the triggering mechanism is implemented to both the outputs. Later, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is utilised to establish the stability criterion and the necessary conditions for ensuring the synchronisation of chosen CNDNs are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an Impulsive High-Gain Observer (IHGO) for the nonlinear system in the normal form is designed to deal with high-gain observer limitations, including the peaking phenomenon. A technique based on approximation of the derivative of the estimation error for impulse time and after impulse value design is developed. An open-loop observer is utilised to estimate the derivative of the estimation error norm. The stability of the estimation error of the IHGO is discussed, and an upper bound for the estimation error is presented, which depends on the after impulse value of IHGO. Finally, the performance of proposed impulsive high-gain observers is evaluated by simulating different examples. It is shown that the proposed impulsive high-gain observer can reduce the peaking phenomenon significantly and outperform other hybrid high-gain observers.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the distributed state estimation problem for a linear system that is jointly observable with the consideration of communication noises and Markovian switching topologies. To address this issue, a network of observers is proposed, where each observer only measures partial system output, which may not be sufficient to observe the complete state of the system. Subsequently, all observers within the network collaborate by sharing their estimated states with their neighbours through the network, facilitating a cooperative reconstruction of the entire state at each local observer. To better reflect the communication environment, we consider a situation in which communication links may fail and rebuild over time, and communication noises may occur when observers exchange information through Markovian switching topologies. Parameters of observers are designed properly, under which each observer fulfills the estimation task in the mean square sense. Illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed observers are also provided.},

The bounds of the unknown control coefficients and unknown measurement sensitivity are unknown, which prevent the construction of conventional constrained output-feedback finite-time controllers. Based on homogeneous systems theory, a simple constrained output-feedback finite-time controller is successfully constructed by utilising a new type of barrier Lyapunov function. Rigorous theoretical analysis suggests that the considered system under the proposed output-feedback controller is finite-time stable, and the requirement of output constraint is achieved. The innovative aspect of this control approach is its unification of the output-feedback finite-time stabilisation problem for high-order uncertain planar systems, addressing both scenarios with and without output constraints, all within a unified framework, without altering the established control structure. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

A fuzzy high-gain state observer is constructed to reconstruct the unmeasurable states of the system by leveraging the universal approximation property of fuzzy logic systems for arbitrary unknown nonlinear functions. Within the framework of backstepping control design and in conjunction with adaptive techniques, an adaptive fuzzy control approach is presented. Subsequently, to work out the inherent ‘complexity explosion’ problem of the proposed control approach, dynamic surface control technique is introduced, leading to a simplified adaptive fuzzy output feedback control scheme. Stability analysis shows that the two proposed control schemes can ensure that all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, meanwhile the system tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood around the origin. Ultimately, a numerical simulation example is provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.},

Motivated by the necessity for accuracy and reliability as well as the growing importance and widespread application of fractional-order controllers in control systems, which offer increased flexibility in controller design, this paper focuses on introducing a dependable procedure for determining the stabilising region of FOPID controllers applicable to interval fractional-order plants with an interval time delay. An interval fractional-order plant is characterised by a fractional-order transfer function wherein the coefficients are uncertain and confined within specified intervals in both the numerator and denominator. Moreover, an interval time delay pertains to a delay term whose value varies within a specified interval. To comprehensively analyze the robust stability of the resulting system, we introduce two theorems and two lemmas in this study. Following this, we propose a method to address the challenge of achieving robust stabilisation for interval plants with an interval time delay using FOPID controllers. Moreover, an additional function is introduced to improve the performance of the systems. To illustrate the proposed procedure, we provide numerical examples and an experimental verification.},

Then the state vector, mixed probabilities, auxiliary parameters, and Bernoulli variables of the system are jointly estimated employing the variational Bayesian (VB) method.

The proposed control approach employs a leader-following strategy, where the dynamics of the LPV virtual leader are defined. The synchronisation error between the followers and the virtual leader is considered, and a consensus control law is introduced. The fault-tolerant mechanism involves the design of a distributed LPV observer and an LPV virtual actuator. Fault-tolerance is achieved through the redistribution of control inputs based on the effectiveness of actuators and dynamic virtual actuators. The primary focus is on establishing Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) conditions ensuring the existence of LPV consensus control, LPV observers, and LPV virtual actuator gains.

  abstract     = {Policy formulation and planning in many disciplines depends on mathematical modelling of empirical data. Linear regressions are common. However, data may vary substantially from one situation to another. This paper does not focus on statistical fluctuation. Rather, data at one time (e.g. prior to the 2019 Covid outbreak) may differ in important ways from data at a later time (e.g. post-Covid). Likewise, data from one location may differ substantively from data elsewhere with a different population, culture, milieu, etc. This challenge introduces data-uncertainty for which probabilistic models are unavailable or require assumptions that may be unjustified. This paper uses non-probabilistic info-gap models of uncertainty to represent data-uncertainty, and the info-gap concept of robustness to uncertainty as the basis for choosing between alternative realizations of a linear regression of empirical data. We demonstrate three properties of info-gap robustness functions when predicting an outcome variable of interest: zeroing, trade off and preference reversal. We also demonstrate the potential utility of excluding selected dependent variables. This analysis supports the use of linear regressions for policy analysis, planning, and decision making. We illustrate the analysis with an epidemiological example.},

The proposed analysis method shows that the size of the truncation of an infinite network does not need to be known. As an application, assuming the subsystems only need to have M-step approximate bisimilarity relations, it is possible to construct approximately bisimilar abstractions, under small-gain type conditions.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel Fault Diagnosis (FD) approach for nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems susceptible to multiple, potentially concurrent sensor faults. We formulate the FD problem as a hybrid state estimation problem. To achieve this, a vector of binary state variables is introduced to augment the continuous-valued state variables. These binary variables act as an on-off switching mechanism, providing a framework for independent reasoning about the presence or absence of each sensor fault. Leveraging this hybrid dynamic system formulation, encompassing both binary and continuous-valued states within a single Particle Filter (PF) framework, enables our approach to efficiently co-estimate fault modes alongside dynamic system states. This innovation ensures efficient diagnosis of multiple, potentially concurrent sensor faults while circumventing the need for the cumbersome bank of estimators characteristic of traditional Multiple Model (MM) approaches used for FD. The performance of the proposed algorithm in diagnosing multiple sensor faults is evaluated using a benchmark nonlinear system from the literature. The results demonstrably validate the algorithm's efficacy, solidifying its potential for practical sensor FD applications under conditions of single or multiple faults.},

A dynamic memory event-triggered (DMET) mechanism is developed to optimise the utilisation of transmission resources. A composite switching observer is devised to approximate the unmeasurable state, fault and disturbance. By utilising the DMET mechanism, composite switching observer and time-relevant switching regulator, an ETADFT controller is formulated to counteract the impact of the unknown disturbance and tolerant unknown faults.

The inherent hysteresis phenomenon in piezoelectric materials introduces nonlinearity and delay, rendering conventional control methods inappropriate for deformable mirror actuation. This study presents a disturbance observer-based controller with the generalised Bouc–Wen hysteresis parameter identification algorithm. Analytical proofs establish fixed-time stability for the observer and controller. A key feature of the proposed disturbance observer is the convergence of the estimated hysteresis to the actual value after a prescribed settling time, which facilitates precise hysteresis parameter identification. This is based on a data clustering technique, unlike most previous works. The proposed controller has the capability of hysteresis compensation and reference tracking in the piezoelectric deformable mirror actuators. Numerical simulation results are present to evaluate the tracking performance of the controller in the presence of random wavefront, the convergence of disturbance to the actual value in the fixed time, and identification of hysteresis parameters.},

In contrast to traditional event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), an accumulation-based ETM, which is robust to abrupt signals, is employed to schedule the signal transmission between sensors and controllers, thereby saving more communication resources. Due to the openness of network-based transmission, DoS attacks are encountered during data transmissions, where the DoS attacks considered in this paper follow the Bernoulli distribution. This paper aims to design a controller for nonlinear systems considering the impact of DoS attacks and accumulation-based ETMs, ensuring that the controlled system state is ultimately bounded in the mean square. Firstly, sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the system state can achieve the given control performance, along with an explicit expression for the ultimate bound. Then, the controller gains are obtained by solving certain linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the designed controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to achieve distributed optimal consensus control for discrete-time multi-agent systems (MASs) under composite switching topologies through utilising the iterative Q-learning approach. First, the optimal consensus control strategy, independent of system dynamics information, is developed by using the designed iterative Q-learning approach to guarantee that all follower states can synchronise to the desired trajectory formulated by the leader. Compared with the invariable algebraic or edge-fixed topology structures, the designed Q-learning control algorithm in this paper is implemented based on the composite switching topologies consisting of periodic and stochastic mechanisms. Then, an error dynamic system is established, which transforms the optimal consensus control issue into an optimal regulation issue and removes the influence of the two types of switching topologies. To conquer the problems of lack of model information and the inaccessible analytical solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, an iterative Q-learning approach is designed according to the reconstructed Q-function Bellman equation. Through further iterative learning, the optimal control strategy can be acquired so as to realise consensus control and ensure the stability of the closed-loop systems. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed optimal control scheme.},

Convergence of the approximated cost functional to the exact optimal cost has been proved, and the stability of the proposed algorithm has been investigated.

We also relax the constraints between impulsive delay and the delay in the continuous dynamics by comparing their sizes, rather than requiring them to satisfy certain inequalities. We employ the comparison principle and the Razumikhin condition to derive Razumikhin-type stability results for our systems.

Second, the first substate and external system state are augmented into a new state, and the explicit relationships between state and unknown parameters are established by applying global filtering transformation. Subsequently, the DREM-based parameter estimator and parameter estimation-based observer are developed to simultaneously estimate the first substate and disturbance in finite time.

  abstract     = {In this paper, adaptive synchronisation of fractional order chaotic systems with external disturbances is studied. For this purpose, first, a new integer order system is introduced and its convergence to zero exponentially within an arbitrary time is proven. Using this system, a novel adaptive exponential arbitrary time sliding mode controller is established to synchronise the fractional order chaotic systems. Then, to estimate the disturbance terms of the fractional systems an exponential arbitrary time disturbance observer is developed. The use of the disturbance observer can lead to simple controller design, low chattering control input, and more accurate response. Finally, a disturbance observer based sliding mode control is presented, that by incorporating the disturbance estimation in controller design ensures synchronisation of chaotic systems. The exponential arbitrary time synchronisation and the stability of the closed loop control system are confirmed using the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results on synchronisation of different fractional order systems, validate the proposed control schemes. It is noteworthy that the introduced adaptive sliding mode controllers can be used for controlling a wide variety of fractional order systems.},

More precisely, to reconstruct the immeasurable states of the addressed CPDPSs, a proportional-integral (PI) observer is implemented since the system states are not always readily measurable. Furthermore, the stability analysis is investigated for CPDPSs in the presence of actuator failures, deception assaults, external disturbances and linear fractional uncertainties. Further, a PI observer-based secured quantised reliable controller is designed to ensure the IO-FT stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the communication medium, the control input data is quantised before transmission by employing logarithmic quantisers. In the meantime, the deception attacks are assumed to possess a stochastic nature which follows Bernoulli distribution. Besides, by utilising Lyapunov stability theory and integral inequality, a set of adequate conditions is obtained for achieving the required result of the undertaken system. Furthermore, the resulting stability criteria are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved using the MATLAB software. Eventually, two numerical examples with simulation results are provided to validate the efficacy of the designed controller.},

This method is used to address input saturation and disturbances, ensuring that the UAV can accurately follow the desired trajectory in finite time. The neural network disturbance observer is crucial for approximating external disturbance signals within a finite time, while the finite-time backstepping scheme accelerates the convergence of tracking errors. The command filtering technique is employed to avoid the complex derivation of virtual control laws, simplifying the controller design. The importance of this method lies in its ability to achieve fast, disturbance-resistant trajectory tracking for UAVs, making the control system more robust in practical applications. Simulations were conducted, showing that the proposed control strategy enables the quadrotor UAV to track its desired trajectory effectively, with improved anti-jamming capability. Both filtering and observation errors converged to the equilibrium point, validating the effectiveness of the approach. However, internal factors like actuator failure were not considered, pointing to future work in refining the method and applying it in real-world UAV experiments.},

By integrating an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) for optimal fault estimation with the EG scheme, the solution enables fault-tolerant control without requiring modifications to the baseline controller, which can be impractical or unsuitable in certain applications. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme completely avoids windup, thereby replacing conventional Anti-Windup (AW) schemes for PIDs, and is computationally cheap and easy to implement, needing only the same inputs as conventional AW algorithms and the actuator fault estimation. Simulation results on the MIMO model of the Zagi flying-wing aerial vehicle show that the EG reduces the tracking error in presence of actuator faults by − 49.92 % in terms of Integral Absolute Error (IAE), outperforming conventional AW methods.},

If the reference signals are not available, then a set of estimators is designed to generate estimated reference signals to ensure that the agents are still able to accomplish the containment control task.

The method is formulated to strategically accelerate or decelerate the system response's rate of change to enhance reference tracking and disturbance rejection performance while preserving closed-loop stability. It uses the normalised acceleration of the system response, a metric that provides insights into the ‘fastness’ or ‘slowness’ of the system response. The effectiveness of the proposed online tuning method is validated through a case study on quadcopter position control. Our research includes both simulation and real-time testing of Variable-Order Fractional PD (VOFPD) controllers, which utilise our online tuning method to adjust their fractional derivatives in real-time. Stability analysis via the D-decomposition method confirms that the quadcopter's closed-loop stability is preserved.

This approach is guided by the fluctuating tendency of state errors, and a link is established between the stability of the zero solution in the neurodynamic system and the convergence of neuron states in a zeroing neural network. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made by numerous scholars to advance the development of ZND, resulting in the formation of a series of ZND models for various mathematical issues and real-world applications. In this paper, the advances in ZND are synthesised from three aspects: models, theories, and applications. Specifically, ZND models are categorised into two main frameworks based on their structures and further classified into different types depending on the dynamics of the specific models under each framework. The two main frameworks identified are the foundational ZND framework and the integral ZND framework. The former serves as the basic structure for exponential type ZND, finite-time type ZND, fixed-time type ZND, and predefined-time type ZND, while the latter is extended with the single-integral type ZND and the double-integral type ZND. Furthermore, the primary analytical methods for the dynamics of each type of ZND are summarised, and the current applications of ZND, including robot manipulator control, multi-agent consistency, dynamic positioning, chaos synchronisation, and image processing, are introduced. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding of the development history of ZND research, the current research focuses and challenges in ZND models, theories, and applications, as well as future directions and key breakthroughs in ZND research, will be provided to readers.},

  abstract     = {Single link flexible manipulators have the advantage of a higher degree of manipulability as compared to rigid manipulators. However, their inherent structural flexibility causes the deformation of the manipulator link during task. The dynamic model of a flexible manipulator, which is ideally represented by a partial differential equation (PDE), is not be always conducive to the design of a comprehensive controller. To address this issue, this work proposes a controller design based on a balanced truncated model that effectively contains the dominant dynamics of the single link flexible manipulator system, which substantially reduces the computational cost of controller implementation while also simplifying the design process. Further, the work also proposes a strategy to design a robust functional observer-based output feedback sliding mode controller for position control of the single link flexible manipulator. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art controllers used for comparison.},

In this paper, the anti-bump (or bumpless) switching control for triggered and switched systems under injection attacks is studied. This control method combines decentralised adaptive event-triggering mechanism (DAETM) and anti-bump condition. The main work is as follows: First, a DAETM is considered to allocate network resources properly and resist data injection attacks. Then, a data buffer is adopted to consolidate data from decentralised channels for ensuring timely utilisation. In addition, a controller gain condition is presented to achieve the bumpless switching between subsystems. Moreover, by adopting piecewise Lyapunov function method, sufficient conditions are obtained for triggered switched systems to be exponentially stable and anti-bump under injection attacks.

The analysis employs the mode-dependent average dwell time approach. Firstly, the concept of dissipativity on finite-region for 2-D switched systems is introduced. Then, a sufficient condition under which the considered systems can demonstrate the finite-region boundedness with the external disturbances is established by the special recursive formulas. Additionally, a sufficient condition for finite-region dissipativity of the considered systems is provided. Furthermore, the dissipative state feedback controller is derived to ensure the finite-region dissipativity of the closed-loop systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design approach, an example is presented.},

Third, more relaxing stability conditions are presented that do not depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes, which means that the conditions on impulses are weaker than those commonly used in the existing literature.

In order to combat signal fading from sensors to controllers and improve communication reliability, spatial diversity is achieved through cooperative terminal relay signals. At each transmission instant, the terminal only selects a better signal for transmission and a switched system is constructed. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework of RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying DFCP is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the randomness of DFCP derived from a three nodes model composed of DF relay, a new objective function based on the mathematical expectation of the traditional quadratic function of MPC is established. Then, the orthogonal complement technique is applied to handle the inherent couplings of variables to formulate a solvable optimisation problem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC strategy and the stability of the established closed-loop system in terms of the average dwell time (ADT) method. Finally, three experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of systems with polytopic uncertainties and persistent bounded disturbances in the long-distance transmission environment. The signal transmitted over a long distance is very likely to be destroyed by the channel fading. To address this issue, an amplify-and-forward cooperation protocol (AFCP) is adopted in the forward channel, i.e. from sensor nodes to the remote controller node, to improve the transmission quality. Considering the difficulty of obtaining the system state in practice, the dynamic output feedback control in the framework of RMPC is put forward. With respect to the parameter uncertainty, persistent bounded disturbances, and randomness of the transmission power stored in sensors and the AF relay, the objective function is defined by the mathematical expectation of a quadratic function over the infinite time horizon. Then, based on this establishment, a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem is readily formulated. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition technique is utilised to mitigate the non-convexity and formulate an auxiliary optimisation problem with the solvability, meanwhile, the sufficient criterion for the mean-square input-to-state stability of the underlying system is obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

With this formula, we present a precise counterpart to compute the credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Leveraging these analytical formulations, we construct a novel tri-objective portfolio selection problem, integrating credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness as objectives, along with some practical constraints. When used with the returns of the portfolio as a whole, the derived analytical expressions help to overcome the otherwise computationally expensive approach involving the simulation of results using individual assets' returns. The proposed model is solved by adapting an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been specifically designed to solve portfolio selection models of this type. The efficiency of the proposed model is then demonstrated by taking a real-world scenario of financial stock market datasets from the NSE India. Based on the results of this study, it appears that the proposed novel tri-objective portfolio selection model produces promising results compared to the baseline model and the NIFTY 50 Index considered as a benchmark.},

First, a distributed predefined-time observer is constructed to estimate the leader's state information for each follower agent. Then, based on the recovered information, the predefined-time local controller is designed for each follower agent by utilising the predefined-time backstepping control approach. Moreover, the neural network (NN) is incorporated to identify the lumped unknown item. Particularly, an indirect learning mechanism is adopted to determine the upper bound of the optimal NN weight. In this way, the computational cost of the presented controller is greatly degraded. Stability evaluation shows that the presented controller can guarantee the position and velocity synchronisation errors regulate to the minor regions around zero in predefined time. Lastly, simulated studies are conducted on the consensus of networked robotic manipulators to validate the obtained results.},

Both dynamic communication ETM and dynamic controller ETM are designed with adjusting parameters to further decrease the resource usage.

  abstract     = {This manuscript delves into the realm of projective synchronisation in delayed neural networks governed by Caputo fractional-order dynamics, addressing the intricate challenges of attaining finite-time synchronisation in networks with distinct structures, functions, and orders. To start, the integration of a compensation controller within the control architecture is examined, aiming to formulate the projection error dynamics. By leveraging projection error system analysis alongside output observation and sliding mode control, a meticulously crafted derivative-based sliding mode surface along with a sliding mode controller are devised, ensuring both convergence and seamless sliding motion. Afterwards, the accessibility of the surface is assessed through relevant lemmas, Caputo derivative characteristics and the Lyapunov direct approach. The subsequent stability of sliding path is corroborated, and indispensable prerequisites for achieving finite-time projective synchronisation are outlined. Furthermore, the establishment of an upper bound for synchronisation time of distinct Caputo fractional-order delayed neural networks (CFDNNs) with inconsistent orders is carried out. Ultimately, simulations on distinct CFDNNs with consistent and inconsistent orders are conducted to exemplify our approach, employing the continuous frequency distribution model.},

To facilitate the control design, the overall coupling vibration system is decoupled into vertical-horizontal coupling vibration subsystem and torsional vibration subsystem. For the vertical-horizontal coupling vibration subsystem, a novel robust low-complexity controller is designed via constructed error transformations to provide strong robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. For the torsional vibration subsystem, a new robust state feedback controller is constructed via a backstepping technique to ensure the vibration angle of the motor rotor within given constraints via a proper asymmetric barrier function. The overall coupling vibration system is proved to be stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness, and the vibration amplitude of the rolling mill can be reached arbitrarily small by selecting appropriate controller parameters.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the tracking control problem of nonlinear time delay systems. For time delay systems, we consider nonaffine pure-feedback structure. Additionally, the case where the time delay systems are subject to input saturation and unknown states is also taken into account. To begin with, a mean value theorem and an implicit function theorem are exploited to transform the systems into an affine form. Afterwards, a state observer is developed to estimate the unknown state variables and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to approximate the unknown functions. The output of the command filter replaces the virtual control signal'derivative, thereby circumventing the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Meanwhile, compensation signals are introduced to eliminate the filtering errors in a dynamic surface control (DSC). A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is designed to mitigate the unknown constant state time delay. During the controller design process, combining a prescribed performance control (PPC) with a command filter control, the tracking error can converge to a predetermined bound. Additionally, the effect of input saturation is eliminated with the aid of an auxiliary system. Finally, the effectiveness of such controller is further proved by taking an electromechanical system as an application object.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of a discrete-time Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control (FSMC) system for Single Input Single Output (SISO) applications, utilising the Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) method for system modelling. The proposed methodology emphasises the Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) to ensure minimal tracking errors through a transformation of tracking errors based on a specified performance function. A Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (FQSMC) is subsequently developed to maintain the tracking error within predetermined bounds, effectively addressing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with the traditional sliding mode control. The integration of fractional calculus enhances the smoothness of the output while ensuring accurate tracking, making it ideal for real-world applications. Additionally, a novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) observer is introduced to bolster the system's resilience against uncertainties and disturbances without complicating the computational process. The effectiveness of the proposed Prescribed Performance Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (PP-FQSMC) is validated through extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental studies conducted on a Tank system. Results demonstrate that the PP-FQSMC significantly outperforms traditional methods, with maximum tracking errors of 1.6 × 10 −4 compared to 0.2 for the PP-QSMC and a Root Mean Square Tracking Error (RMSTE) of 1.3 × 10 −3 compared to 1.2 × 10 −4 for the PP-QSMC, ensuring strong tracking performance and stability. The findings indicate that the proposed controller effectively mitigates chattering in control signals while maintaining a smooth output. It showcases its potential for practical applications in environments characterised by model inaccuracies, time delays, and external disturbances.},

To guarantee predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free performance of the closed-loop system, a predefined-time sliding mode function with adjustable parameters is proposed. This sliding mode function contains two equilibrium points. When the states of the closed-loop system are on the sliding mode surface, they converge to the equilibrium point near the initial states. Based on this sliding mode function, an adaptive attitude stabilising control law with tuning parameters is designed to compensate the external disturbances and inertia uncertainty. The presented control law guarantees that the settling time of the closed-loop system and the bounds of the system states can be explicitly determined in advance by adjusting parameters of the sliding mode function and the control law. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law.

Specially, the proposed STD-ETESO incorporates a finite-time switching strategy, which improves the poor transient performance of the STD acting as a pre-filter to prepare relatively smooth signals for the ESO. The locally asymptotic boundedness of the estimation error can be guaranteed by the Input-state-stability (ISS) and existing research for the STD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a general example and a practical motion control system. Different integral criteria is introduced to evaluate the overall tracking accuracy and energy usage for comparison with existing different ESOs, which reveals the superiority of the proposed STD-ETESO in noise attenuation and disturbance rejection.},

Although there already exist some valuable surveys on adaptive filters, they do not provide a systematic overview of the challenges faced by adaptive filters and lack a careful distinction and comparison of the various adaptive filter techniques in noise cancellation in non-stationary signals.

  abstract     = {The U.S. military continuously innovates its combat theories, proposing new styles of warfare such as multi-domain joint operations and mosaic operations. The form of warfare is shifting from network-centric warfare towards intelligent warfare. Intelligent warfare emphasises decentralised forces and intelligent coordination, with a typical example being manned/unmanned teaming systems. This article first reviews the development history and trends of manned/unmanned teaming systems in the U.S. military. It then elaborates on the new challenges in intelligent networking posed by manned/unmanned teaming operations at the levels of networks, links, and nodes. Finally, based on these challenges, it proposes a limited centralised manned/unmanned intelligent command architecture, providing insights for the construction of next generation manned/unmanned teaming systems on the future battlefield for our military.},

The networked control system is first modelled, and an event-triggered communication strategy based on neural networks is proposed, allowing the observer to selectively receive the latest sampled data. Next, a sliding mode observer is devised to track the sliding motion and error system, demonstrating system stability and robustness through linear matrix inequalities. In order to pledge the attainment of the sliding surface within a prescribed period, a dynamically adaptive sliding mode controller driven by event-based triggering is devised, proving the positivity of the lower bound of event-triggered intervals.

To solve this problem, we propose a distributed optimisation algorithm based on iterative learning methods that combines the terminal iterative learning strategy with the subgradient strategy. When the initial states of all agents are the same in each iteration, by the proposed algorithm, it is proved that all agents' states asymptotically converge to the optimal solution. Moreover, considering that the initial states of agents in each iteration may not be accurately measured, we further study the distributed optimisation problem under different initial states. We find that all agents' states asymptotically converge to the neighbourhood of the optimal solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a promising new approach to establish the stability of finite receding horizon control with a terminal cost. Departing from the traditional approaches of using the property of the terminal cost or relaxed Lyapunov inequalities, this paper establishes its stability based on the property of a modified stage cost. First, we rotate the stage cost with the terminal cost. Then a one-step optimisation problem is defined based on this augmented stage cost. It is shown that a slightly modified Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm is stable if the value function of the augmented one-step cost (OSVF) is a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF). Stability for MPC algorithms with zero terminal cost or even negative terminal cost can be unified with this new approach. Combining it with the existing MPC stability theories, we are able to significantly relax the stability requirement on MPC and extend the stabilising MPC design space to the region that no existing MPC stability theories can cover. The proposed stage cost-based approach will help to further reduce the gap between stability theory and practical applications of MPC and other optimisation-based control methods.},

First, in the absence of interference, a time-varying Lyapunov function with increasing coefficient is introduced to derive sufficient conditions for the reference adaptive control of the H ∞ model, where the dwell time is an arbitrary preset constant. Secondly, an adaptive controller and adaptive law are proposed to ensure the asymptotic tracking of the switched system. Then, in the case of interference, the sufficient conditions for the solvable H ∞ model reference adaptive tracking control under dwell time switching are proposed, and the standard L 2 -gain performance of the switching system is analysed. The characteristic of this paper is to solve the H ∞ model reference adaptive tracking control problem of a class of switched systems with uncertain parameters by using time-varying Lyapunov function with increasing coefficient. The increasing coefficient in Lyapunov function can increase the degree of freedom of controller design and improve the control performance of the system. Dwell time switching can avoid the H ∞ control problem of switched system which cannot realise state-dependent switching because all state information cannot be obtained.},

  abstract     = {Switched affine systems (SASs) are a special class of switched systems. The existing works about SASs predominantly focuses on steady-state performance. There exist limited attention given to transient performance, particularly the transient performance induced by switchings. The inappropriate switchings can induce severe signal jumps, degrade the steady-state performance of the system, and even lead to instability. The bumpless transfer control (BTC) represents an effective strategy for mitigating signal jumps. However, the existing BTC methods are primarily designed for general switched systems, and these approaches are often not applicable to SASs. This article is focussed on the issue of H ∞ BTC for SASs under unmodeled disturbances. Firstly, an affine term (AT) related to H ∞ bumpless transfer (BT) performance definition is introduced for the SAS to characterise the alleviation level of the bumps in the control input signal at switching points. Secondly, a criterion is established to enable the solvability of the H ∞ BTC problem for the SAS. Thirdly, an H ∞ BT controller and a switching signal are co-designed to drive the SAS to satisfy the H ∞ BT performance which may not be shared by the subsystems. Finally, a turbofan engine model example is implemented to illustrate the availability and rationality of the suggested H ∞ BTC scheme.},

To extend the application of secure dynamic edge pinning consensus scheme, we further develop the distributed asynchronous adaptive laws, under which only the coupling strengths of the attacked edges stop updating rather than all coupling strengths when DoS attacks are activated. Note that the proposed secure dynamic edge pinning consensus protocols with distributed synchronous and asynchronous adaptive laws are fully distributed and operate independently of any global information.

To avoid any unexpected alteration due to failures, the proposed control scheme design addresses all types of actuator faults that are bias, drift, and loss of accuracy as additive faults, as well as a multiplicative fault that results in loss of effectiveness with nonaffine state-dependency. Restrictions on control gains and unmatched interconnections are eliminated, and the explosion complexity caused by recursive back-stepping designs is avoided. Fuzzy Systems approximate the unknown ideal control laws along side the acutator faults and disturbances.

By imposing new conditions on the Lyapunov function and its derivative, the state convergence to the origin from any initial condition with bounded norm in the classical setting is extended to the initial conditions with unbounded norms in the present work. The proposed new notions of stability are called extended global asymptotic stability (EGAS) and extended global uniform asymptotic stability (EGUAS) in this paper. The proposed Lyapunov-based criteria yield the global asymptotic stability of the origin and fixed-time/predefined-time attractiveness of any selected neighbourhood of the origin. The result is that the dynamical behaviour of the state trajectories from the convergence time point of view is improved considerably. The relationship between the smoothness and input-to-state stability (ISS) properties is also studied from a quantitative point of view. Under some new sufficient conditions, it is shown that dynamical systems with smaller Lipschitz constants represent smaller ultimate bounds, and as a result, are more robust. The desirable dynamical behaviour and robustness property of the proposed stability notion makes it comparable with the finite/fixed/predefined/prescribed (exact) stable systems that are naturally non-Lipschitz at the origin. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Landslides are a major threat to the safety of human life and property. The purpose of landslide spatial prediction is to establish the relationship between the location of landslides and each landslide evaluation factor, and to spatially identify high landslide risk areas using data mining and geographic information science. In this paper, a landslide spatial prediction model is put forward based on cascade forest (CF) and Stacking ensemble learning algorithm. Firstly, the landslide spatial prediction scheme is designed. Then, the improved CF is established by combining random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The Stacking ensemble learning algorithm is introduced to establish CF-Stacking model combined with the improved CF. Finally, experiments are conducted using geospatial data of the actual study area. 12 landslide disaster-inducing factors are extracted from the study area, and the CF-Stacking model is applied to the spatial prediction of landslides. The result shows that CF-Stacking outperforms comparative models in terms of the area under curve and brier score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting landslide spatial patterns. The CF-Stacking model is used to generate a landslide susceptibility map for Fengjie, which provides valuable guidance for geological hazard early warning.},

A row-column decomposition and a column-row decomposition are provided to partition the augmented matrix associated with the linear equations into several block matrices, respectively. By assigning an equation solver layer to computation and a data integration layer to data exchanges, a row-column decomposition-based discrete-time distributed algorithm and a column-row decomposition-based discrete-time distributed algorithm are proposed for solving large-scale linear equations, respectively. It is shown that the distributed algorithms proposed can reach a consensus exponentially on one of the solutions of linear equations.

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are fundamental in numerous advanced engineering applications, from aerospace to telecommunications, where precise system identification is critical for optimal performance. However, the identification of such systems often faces significant hurdles due to data scarcity, with existing approaches typically requiring substantial amounts of data for effective training. Addressing this challenge, this paper introduces a novel transfer learning framework designed specifically for MIMO system identification under conditions of limited data and inherent uncertainties. The proposed framework is applied to two case studies: the first in metal additive manufacturing, specifically the laser-blown powder-directed energy deposition as the source domain and the laser hot wire-directed energy deposition as the target domain, and the second involving a nonlinear case study of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) with a temperature-dependent reaction. The results underscore the framework's effectiveness in capturing the dynamics of the target systems, including the ability to effectively model nonlinear dynamics. Comparative analyses highlight the benefits of employing dimensionless numbers in dynamic system modelling, offering reduced dimensionality, more physical meaning, and increased model accuracy. Overall, the proposed framework presents a promising approach to enhance system identification in MIMO systems with limited data and uncertainties, with potential applications across diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a robust model predictive control (MPC) method is introduced based on Lyapunov-theory to control the discrete-time uncertain linear systems due to external disturbances. The structure of the proposed controller consists of two parts designed based on the offline/online schemes. In the offline-scheme, an H ∞ -based robust tracking controller is provided to satisfy the robust and tracking performance. Based on the H ∞ performance, a new linear matrix inequality problem is developed to calculate the offline-controller gains. By considering the Lyapunov-function of the offline-controller as the terminal cost of the MPC and the designed offline-controller, the online optimisation problem (OOP) is structured. This means, the MPC is designed based on the stabilised system to satisfy the physical limitations of the overall controller and the system states. Moreover, to improve the feasibility problem of the OOP, an ellipsoidal terminal constraint is added to the proposed MPC problem. Therefore, compared with the existing min–max MPC and tube MPC, the advantages of the overall controller are feasibility improvement and reducing the computational complexity with less conservatism while the robustness against parametric uncertainties and disturbances is achieved. Two simulation examples are employed to show the superiorities of the proposed robust MPC.},

Distinct from the relevant results which utilise the current intercepted data or additionally consider side information, a more universal attack model is proposed which combines historical data and side information with the current intercepted data to synergistically deteriorate the system estimation performance. In order to quantify the impact resulting from the proposed attack strategy, the optimisation objective is characterised by deriving the error covariance matrix under the attacks, which becomes more intricate since the proposed attack model introduces more decision variables and coupled terms. Take the stealthiness which is characterised by Kullback-Leibler divergence as the constraints, the problem investigated in this work is equivalently transformed into the constrained multi-variable non-convex optimisation problems, which are not able to be solved directly by the methods in the relevant results. By utilising the Lagrange multiplier method, the structural characteristic of the optimal mean and the optimal covariance which only related to the Lagrange multiplier are derived, such that the optimal distribution of the modified innovation is able to be obtained by a simple search procedure. Following that, the design of the optimal attack strategy is completed by using semi-definite programming to derive the optimal attack matrices. Finally, the simulation examples are given such that the validity of the results is verified.},

On the basis of fuzzy logic systems (FLS), an FLS observer was designed to dispose of unmeasurable states. Under the framework of backstepping technique design, a practical adaptive fixed-time control method is proposed by combining FLS observer with fixed-time theory. In the course of designing the controller, a hyperbolic tangent function is introduced to tackle the singularity problem that may pertain in the derivative of the controller, thereby shunning the phenomenon of chattering and diminishing the computational complexity. For the sake of lessening the communication burden of MASs, a modified dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is proposed. The developed controller assures that all signals of the MASs are bounded, and the consensus tracking errors converge to a small neighbourhood of the zero within a fixed-time interval. Ultimately, multiple UAVs were simulated as examples, and the emulation outcomes display that the availability of the presented control scheme was certified.},

After that, we obtain and analyse these indexes for fuzzy exponential and fuzzy two-parameter Weibull distributions as two frequently used lifetime distribution in reliability theory. Moreover, with the assumption that the distribution of fuzzy observations is unknown (non-parametric approach), first an estimate for the fuzzy distribution function is presented, and then an estimate for the aging indices of the system is investigated. To do this, the concept of fuzzy empirical distribution function is investigated as an estimator of cumulative distribution function.

  abstract     = {This paper considers a discrete-time non-cooperative M -players linear affine quadratic game of pre-specified fixed duration, affected by stochastic noise and deterministic disturbances. The last one is seen as a pernicious fictitious player looking to maximise the expected cost functions of each player. Inspired in the discrete-time robust dynamic programming, sufficient conditions for the existence of a type of robust feedback NE are given in the solution of a set of discrete-time difference equations. A formal induction proof is provided for the closed form of the obtained robust set of strategies. Two illustrative simulation examples are included, one related to the problem of coordination of a two-echelon supply chain with uncertain seasonal demand. The goal of the agents is to reduce the expected cost of storage while satisfying a partially known demand. The second example is related to a game of government debt stabilisation. Comparing the simulation with the standard Nash strategy, the robust one achieves a better performance.},

In contrast to the majority of existing event-triggered control results, where only the input or output signal is triggered, the design problem of a dual-channel event-triggered mechanism is studied to achieve a more comprehensive saving of communication resources. Subsequently, in order to reconstruct system states, a continuous-discrete observer that can achieve asymptotic convergence of estimation errors is constructed based on event-triggered output. Then, an event-triggered asymptotic tracking control scheme is introduced through Levant differentiators, filtered error compensation signals, and the backstepping technique. The Levant differentiators not only address the challenge of computational complexity explosion but also effectively resolve the problem of controller segmentation continuity. The control scheme has been proven to maintain all signals in the closed-loop system bounded and achieve zero tracking error as time approaches infinity. Subsequently, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are shaping the future of transportation systems; however, their future development requires consideration of the upcoming challenges with cyber-physical attacks. Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is one of the features used in CAVs. Using CACC increases the vulnerability of such systems to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. To address this, this paper proposes a novel mitigation approach to compensate for FDI attacks and noise in real-time. In addition to FDI attacks, the current CACC algorithm suffers from input delay and disturbance. Here, we develop a nonlinear controller and an FDI attacks estimation technique to mitigate the effects of FDI attacks, noise, input delay and additive disturbance. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the Lyapunov-based stability analysis to ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded tracking. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we validate it through simulation analysis.},

At the same time, the high-order log-type time-varying barrier Lyapunov function method is chosen to ensure that the desired output and states of the systems do not violate the relevant constraints. In addition, the improved event-triggered control strategy effectively reduces the transmission burden and saves the resource cost. The stability analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves the ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop systems and the states of the systems do not violate the corresponding constraints. It should be noted that the proposed controller has a known bound and this bound can be ensured by the rectification of the feedback control gain.

With the help of an existing model-based value iteration (VI) algorithm, we propose two data-driven VI algorithms to solve the GARE. The first one relies on transforming the stochastic system into a deterministic control system first and then solving the LQSOC problem by the data of the deterministic system. Consequently, this algorithm does not need the information of two system coefficients and has a lower algorithm complexity. The second algorithm directly uses the data generated by the stochastic system, and thus it circumvents the requirement of all system coefficients. We also provide convergence proofs of these two data-driven algorithms and validate these algorithms through two simulation examples.},

Using the log-barrier penalty method, we only need to study an unconstrained approximation problem of the original problem. Firstly, each agent's state converges to the optimal value of the related local objective function in a fixed time. Simultaneously, the upper bound of fixed time in this paper is smaller than some existing results. Then, in the case of communication delay, time-triggered and event-triggered methods with non-uniform sampling interval are proposed in this paper, which make the communication cost lower and the application broader. Using the Lyapunov function method, the sufficient conditions for each agent's state to converge to the optimal point are given, and the Zeno behaviour is excluded.

Traditional numerical algorithms for OCPs with pantograph delay systems have predominantly focused on unconstrained scenarios, neglecting constrained problems. Therefore, we propose a novel symplectic pseudospectral iteration framework for constrained problems. First, we employ the successive convexification (SCvx) method to transform the original problem into a series of linear quadratic (LQ) problems, addressing nonlinearity. Then, leveraging time-scale transformations and parametric variational principles, we derive the first-order necessary conditions (FONCs) for these convexified problems, including a Hamiltonian two-point boundary value problem (HTBVP) with stretching terms and a linear complementarity problem. To handle pantograph time delays effectively, we employ a local Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) pseudospectral method with proportional grid discretization. Finally, employing a symplectic indirect algorithm, we develop a symplectic pseudospectral method (SPM) for solving the transformed LQ problems, converting them into a system of sparse linear algebraic equations and a linear complementarity problem. Validation of the framework is performed using diverse illustrative examples, demonstrating strong agreement between SCvx and SPM in computational efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the sparsity of the core matrix and robustness to initial guesses.},

The estimation of unknown input is obtained from innovation through weighted least-squares (WLS) estimation. The approximate linear regression form allows us to process the nonlinear system with unknown input direct feedthrough by using the UMV state estimation framework, and derive the filter by minimising the trace of the state error covariance of the measurement update under the unbiased condition. The URTSF-UMV requires that the unknown input distribution matrix is full column rank. We use the full rank decomposition method to deal with the nonlinear system containing the unknown input rank-deficient distribution matrix.

  abstract     = {This paper is focused on formation tracking control of multi-agent systems in a leader–follower setting. The objective is to introduce control algorithms to steer a team of mobile agents into a desired, moving geometrical pattern while the agents are unaware of their own and other agents' velocity information during the entire process. We introduce a formation control law under which the agents asymptotically shape a desired geometrical pattern and track a constant reference velocity. Another control law is then introduced to address the case where the reference velocity is time-varying. Both control laws are based on the complex Laplacian approach and do not require agents' velocity information. The convergence of these algorithms are proved and their performance are examined via numerical examples. Simulation results verify the outperformance of the proposed control laws compared to the rival control schemes in the literature.},

Specifically, the linear cyber physical system becomes a time delay system after the replay attack, and then an algorithm is designed to transform the system into a delay-free system and ensure its stability.

First, in order to reduce the impact of FDI attacks on the nonlinear MASs, a novel coordinate transformation technique is proposed, which is composed of the states after being attacked, and the Nussbaum gain technique is adopted to address the problem of unknown attack gains resulting from FDI attacks. Then, by employing compromised state variables, a fuzzy adaptive iterative learning resilient control method is presented based on the composite energy function, where unknown nonlinear functions are handled using fuzzy logic systems. The presented approach can guarantee that the outputs of all followers precisely track the leader in a limited time interval while ensuring that all closed-loop signals are bounded.

Impulse-dependent sufficient conditions are derived for predefined-time estimation of settling-time under the influence of stabilising impulses. In contrast, a fixed-time estimate of the settling-time is obtained for destabilising impulses. Secondly, terminal sliding mode ( TSM ) control is designed in the presence of hybrid (continuous and impulsive) matched disturbances for n -dimensional systems. It shows that the trajectories can reach the sliding surfaces in fixed-time and thus will stay on it after that under the influence of the proposed TSM . Thus, the system states will converge to the origin in a fixed-time. Finally, three examples, which also consist of the stability of Cohen-Grossberg BAM neural networks, are provided to justify the proposed results numerically.},

Due to the practical limitation inherent to physical systems (or their mathematical representation) and constraints on the input variables, the constrained control theory became an important research field. In this work, based on set-invariance theory, we propose an eigenstructure assignment optimisation using a state-feedback control law that guarantees the respect of state and control constraints for second-order systems. Positive invariance is the property of keeping the trajectory of the system states inside the set. This characteristic is incorporated into the analysis and design of the control law to ensure local stability and constraint fulfilment.},

  abstract     = {This article aims at a new partial least squares (PLS) control design and analysis in a data-driven framework for nonlinear multivariable processes whose mechanistic models are completely unknown. First, a general nonlinear autoregressive moving average with the exogenous input (NARMAX) model is used as the dynamic nonlinear PLS model. Then, by introducing a dynamic linearisation approach in each latent variable (LV) space, the unknown NARMAX-based PLS model is transformed to a linear dynamic PLS data model (dPLSDM), which can be improved in real time by estimating its unknown parameter using the latent input and output (I/O) data. Next, a data-driven latent variable adaptive control (DDLVAC) is proposed in each LV loop. By virtue of the dPLSDM, the multivariable nonlinear process is decoupled into multiple single-loop systems and the high dimensions of the process data are reduced such that the corresponding DDLVAC is simplified. Further, the DDLVAC only depends on the I/O data without requiring any model information of the original process. Theoretical analysis confirms the validity of the DDLVAC. The simulation study demonstrates the advantages of the DDLVAC such as less storage space, smaller computation burden, less control cost, as well as more robustness against uncertainties.},

The main control objective is to confine the tracking error into its pre-given bounds no lower than a certain probability. To this end, a tracking controller is firstly synthesised by introducing the fading parameter as an amplification factor towards ‘retrieving’ the original information to some extent. An auxiliary function and the multi-dimensional Chebyshev inequality make it possible to derive sufficient conditions such that the tracking error falls into its specified domain with a frequency larger than a pre-given value. By employing an inequality involving unmatched membership functions of the controller and fuzzy system, the favourite property of matched membership functions can be employed.

A novel adaptive neural network (NN)-based event-triggered control is considered that uses the nonlinear estimator to predict the state of other agents. Since data access is denied during DoS attacks, the overall system switches between two modes of stable and unstable containment behaviours. Therefore, the maximum of attack duration and frequency is determined such that the overall system evolution leads to containment convergence in the presence of DoS attacks. We proposed an adaptive NN-based distributed disturbance observer to estimate external disturbances in a nonlinear system's dynamics. The state estimator predicts neighbouring agents' states, and each agent's input and event times are determined without monitoring other agents. The directed graph topology is used to determine data exchange among agents instead of an undirected graph that reduces implementation conditions. Zeno-free behaviour is also proved by analysis of the system. Eventually, the numerical simulation of the proposed approach is shown.

However, because inverting a non-minimum phase model generates unbounded control input, model-inversion only applies to limited types of systems. This paper presents a new non-parametric pseudo-inversion approach to design bounded optimal control input with desirable properties for arbitrary types of systems. Closed-form equations are presented for the batch (full preview) and recursive (limited preview) implementations of this approach, and its performance is compared against existing pseudo-inversion methods in benchmark numerical examples. Furthermore, the practical implementation of the proposed method is demonstrated by designing a feedforward controller for a commercial 3-Dimensional (3D) printer. The results show that the proposed approach effectively compensates for the structural vibrations of the printer, preventing layer-shifting errors that usually happen during high-speed printing.},
