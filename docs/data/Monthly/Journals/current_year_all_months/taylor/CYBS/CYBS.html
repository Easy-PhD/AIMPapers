  abstract     = {Due to advent of sensors with less in weight, tiny in size and low power, it designates as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However in recent times, the key issue is noted in WSN is reducing the lifetime of the system. Hence in this paper, an advanced selection of Cluster Head (CH) and optimal routing is implemented by utilizing the improved heuristic algorithm. The developed Hybrid Walrus and Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (HWCSA) is performed by optimally select the CH and the multi-objective functions with constraints like residual energy, distance, and delay are derived in the CH selection approach. Moreover, the same HWCSA is used for performing the routing process to provide better communication between Base Station (BS) and sensor nodes. Here, multi-objective function with constraints like throughput, distance, packet delivery ratio, and hop count are optimally derived by optimizing the shortest path. In the end, the designed HWCSA approach is estimated with several performance metrics. Validating cost function analysis, the proposed model achieves 4%, 7.6%, 9.4%, and 8.5% better than BMO, OOA, WOA, and CSA algorithms. Throughout the empirical analysis, the designed model attains effective performance than state-of-the-art-methods.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), an proactive risk management approach, has been widely applied in a variety of industries, especially in aircraft industry. In the process of implementation, the influence and uncertainty among different experts is inevitable. In order to handle the uncertainty in the assessments of FMEA experts, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was introduced to FMEA for its flexibility and superiority in coping with uncertain and subjective assessments. However, traditional Dempster combination rule have difficulty in dealing with highly conflicting evidence that given from FMEA experts’ assessments. Moreover, experts themselves may influence each other though process such as chatting, judging, decision-making and voting. In this paper, we explore the problem of conflict evidence fusion from a correlation perspective among FMEA experts. We use ambiguity measure and Gaussian distribution to deal with the highly conflicting evidence. We use ambiguity measure to calculate the variance of Gaussian distribution. Then, we use Gaussian model to generalize expert assessments. After that, we use Dempster combination rule to fuze assessments from different experts. Finally, we calculate the risk priority number to rank the risk level of the FMEA items. The experiment results in the air system of an aircraft turbofan engine shows the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Heart disease remains a major global cause of mortality, underscoring the need for advancements in early detection and prognosis to enhance patient recovery. This study proposes an innovative framework integrating deep learning (DL) models and optimal resource allocation strategies to improve heart disease detection and prognosis. The framework begins with rigorous preprocessing of the Internet of Things (IoT) captured Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, employing min–max normalization, and advanced median filtering techniques for noise reduction and baseline wander correction. Statistical features are extracted from the preprocessed data, while features such Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), RR interval, R peak, and PR interval are derived from ECG signals. These features are then augmented using a min–max technique to enhance dataset diversity and model robustness. Furthermore, the study introduces a hybrid model combining a Deep Residual Network (DRN) and an Improved Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for severity classification heart disease detection, leveraging augmented features. Optimal resource allocation is facilitated by the Improved Walrus Optimization Algorithm (WaOA), optimizing ventilator, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed, medical staff, and medication allocation based on predicted disease severity. Evaluation with real-world datasets demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and resource utilization efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of IoT and AI-driven approaches in cardiovascular healthcare.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive count of connected devices with different sensing support, particularly in medical health constraints sensing. In these summaries, secure communication and data collection to centralized servers is rather difficult for preventing the occurrence of diverse attacks for illegal data access. To tackle these problems, this task plans to design and implement the FoG-based secure data management system in IoT-WSN using adaptive encryption and decryption processes. As the FoG server is away from the corresponding aggregator node, it is transmitted via the other nodes using the proposed modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based encryption process. For secured data transmission the designed method undergoes two main stages as message receiving stage, and the message-extraction stage. The hybridized meta-heuristic algorithm termed Jaya-Galactic Swarm Optimization (J-GSO) is used for modifying the ECC with an optimized key. From the simulation findings, the performance of the suggested scheme at the data size of three bytes is 3.08%, 3.22%, 3.65%, and 3.33% better than the MFO-m-ECC, PSO-m-ECC, GSO-m-ECC, and JA-m-ECC at the ECC curve variation of “secp192r1”. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the designed method when tested with baseline schemes regarding time complexity, space complexity, and cost function.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of a time-sensitive data collection technique distinguishes a normal wireless sensor network (WSN) system from a WSN. To convey data promptly to the intended user, sensor nodes must compete with one another. Network speed and packet delivery rate (PDR) are impacted by the unfairness of competing nodes. To enhance node fairness, a protocol must be successful. The Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, which focuses on the power requirements of the sensor node, manages these procedures. The proposed MAC protocols, however, do not address the quality of service issues and may not offer power efficiency in certain traffic conditions. During the sensor node registration process, the proposed hybrid MAC uses CSMA/CA to register the sensor nodes and assigns time slots and duty cycle modifications to the registered sensor nodes. Basic sensor network operations like scheduling and prioritization enable this. The findings demonstrate how the suggested MAC protocol enhances network performance in terms of throughput, packet delivery rate, low latency, and minimal power consumption while achieving fairness. When all of these elements are taken into account, the finalized product will attain high data rates.},

  abstract     = {Prevalent usage of learning based systems as part of critical systems has brought wide set of security risks encompassing adversarial attacks like evasion attacks and poisoning attacks. Ascertaining adversarial robustness and security of learning based models has sparked widespread concerns. In backdoor attacks, backdoored model has normal behavior on pristine data but makes attacker induced predictions for poisoned samples. Major challenges faced with existing backdoor defense techniques is that while they sanitize the model to remove backdoors, they often reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) at the cost of model Benign Accuracy (BA) degradation. To address these problems, our proposed model sanitization technique inspired by existing backdoor elimination defense, Model Contrastive Loss (MCL) involves (1)applying Gaussian adaptive filtering to poisoned samples to mitigate effect of backdoor trigger; (2)leveraging K-means clustering to feature representation of poisoned samples to construct pseudo labels; (3) tuning model parameters by usage of Triplet Marginal Loss (TML) and Contrastive Loss (CL) to continuously refine learned feature space to yield purified model. Experimental evaluation was performed on benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, Imagenet and GTSRB against poison label backdoor attacks: BadNets, Trojan, and Blend along with clean-label backdoor attacks: consistent label and SIGNAL (SIG). Our proposed MCL++ technique exhibits improved effectiveness by exhibiting low ASR and improved BA than existing MCL technique, ensuring model’s performance on pristine data has not been compromised.},

We first define High-level Colored Time Petri Net (HCTPN) that extends time Petri Nets with color and high-level functionality encompassing both timed multi-enableness of transitions and sequential pseudo code. We then extend HCTPN with stopwatches to allow the modeling of preemptive scheduling, which is an important feature in the real-time context. We prove that the reachability problem is decidable for HCTPN but is undecidable for HCTPN with stopwatches, and we propose an abstraction of the state space for these models.

We present in this article, a novel concept of robust nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC). In fact, the use of the NFTSMC offers a fast convergence rate, avoids singularities but still suffers from chattering. To overcome this limitation, two approaches have been developed: robust nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller (RNFTSMC) and robust optimized nonsingular fast terminal sliding controller (RONFTSMC). In the first one an additional term called switching signal is added to the equivalent control law. The second one is a combination of the NFTSM technique, and a cuckoo search algorithm as optimum term. Simulations show that the control strategy can overcome the chattering phenomena ensures the accuracy and stability of the joint robot position control.},

In this work, an analysis of machine learning-based algorithms for missing data imputation is performed. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Sequential KNN (SKNN) algorithms are used to impute missing values in datasets using machine learning. Missing values handled using a statistical deletion approach (List-wise Deletion (LD)) and ML-based imputation methods (KNN and SKNN) are then tested and compared using different ML classifiers (Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree) to evaluate the effectiveness of imputed data. The used algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy, and results yielded that the ML-based imputation method (SKNN) outperforms the LD-based approach and KNN method in terms of the effectiveness of handling missing data in almost every dataset with both classification algorithms (SVM and DT).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the mobile robot motion planning approach (PSO-CF 2 -mt: PSO-CF 2 for moving targets) is improved to track a moving target following a smooth path. PSO-CF 2 -mt was tested previously in various static and dynamic environments and proved its capacity to track moving targets whatever the form of the target’s trajectory. The problem with PSO-CF 2 -mt that we want to face in this paper is the stability of the robot’s motion. It is tackled by limiting the angular velocity of the robot. The angular speed limit is PSO selected and the variance of the angular speed is added to the fitness function as a third objective. This new version of PSO-CF 2 -mt is called OS-CF 2 -mt (Optimized Stable CF 2 -mt). Simulation results prove the capacity of OS-CF 2 -mt in ensuring stable travels for mobile robots following short, secure and smooth paths when tracking moving targets whether the environment is static or dynamic and whatever the form of the target’s trajectory.},

The proposed hybrid approach is a parallel performance of gradient boosting decision tree algorithm and reptile search algorithm. The major purpose is to diminish the variance among real and reference power on battery and super capacitor. The HESS is divided into two segments: (1) Determine the super capacitor reference voltage, which is affected by load dynamics. (2) Maximize the power flow via the HESS. The super capacitor reference voltage is first calculated by assessing the load dynamics on real time, such as vehicle dynamics, motor characteristics, and regenerative braking systems. The super capacitor’s input parameters include load current, battery current, and state of charge. The RSA is created on proposed system by combining the probable data set of HESS control signals. The GBDT algorithm is trained and forecasts optimal HESS parameters using the RSA’s practiced data set. The proposed approach also improves battery current magnitude, super capacitor voltage, battery current ranges, and battery power. It optimizes the HESS parameter provides specific solutions. The proposed hybrid system is implemented on MATLAB and its performance is related to that of existing approaches.},

These conditions are then applied to the time-varying linear affine quadratic problem with multiple modes and a general cost, which includes tracking signals in both: the state and the control variables.

Hence, this paper aims to design a multimodal fake news detection model with enhanced deep learning architecture. Initially, the multi-modal information including images and text are gathered from real-time social media. Then, pre-processing of both images and text is carried out. Further, the text features are extracted using Word2vector and glove embedding techniques. Then, the optimal features from both image features and text features are attained using the Adaptive Water Strider Algorithm (A-WSA). The achieved optimal features are forwarded to the new feature fusion concept based on the weight factor that is optimized using the same A-WSA. Finally, the fused features are forwarded to the fake news classification stage with the help of “Optimized-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (O-BiLSTM),” where the hyperparameter of BiLSTM is optimized through similar A-WSA. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy rate of the designed A-WSA-BiLSTM method is attained at 96.51%. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed model is effective in using multi-modal data in automated fake news classification.},

For this, numerous novel settings like integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) should be implemented in the network system. Here, this paper plans to design an optimization-based power allocation model to increase the Effective Power Efficiency (EPE) that offers guaranteed QoS over “Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)-channel oriented 5 G networks”. Moreover, the statistical QoS-based green power allotment system was also analyzed to increase the EPE over other MIMO networks. Particularly, this paper makes an attempt to make the power allocation optimal, which directly ensures the 5 G network energy efficiency when guaranteeing QoS. This is considered to be the optimization issue, which is solved by MS-DA. Our suggested approach can be applied to hybrid energy supply networks with various network topologies, such as 5 G networks, which are now the most extensively used, and is capable of achieving a good resolution through iterative convergence.},

The hybrid fuzzy-sliding mode control (HFSMC) based maximum-power-point tracking system (MPPTs) is adopted for solar PV system to extract maximum output. To minimize the complexity of the conventional system, levenberg-marquardt trained artificial neural network (ANN) controller is proposed to the UPQC in order to generate the effective reference signals for shunt, series converters which eliminates the necessity of conventional abc, dq0, αβ transformations. The main aim of the proposed ANN based UPQC is to achieve the constant direct current (DC) link capacitor voltage during load changes with low settling time, elimination of imperfections in current waveforms, thereby reducing total harmonic distortions (THD) and to improve power factor, mitigation of sag, swell, disturbances and unbalances in source voltage. The performance of developed method is tested on five case studies with different combination of loads, variable irradiation and source voltages conditions. To demonstrate the supremacy of the developed method the comparative study with the proportional integral controller (PIC) was carried out. The proposed method shows an excellent performance in reducing voltage fluctuations and THD successfully and thereby improving power factor.},

Incorporating compensators within the distribution network can significantly reduce these problems. The proposed technique involves installing a Distribution Static Synchronous Compensator (DSTATCOM) in the distribution system, which can compensate for reactive power and eliminates harmonics. Moreover, the paper suggests a technique for obtaining an optimal dc-link voltage depending upon the grid’s need for load compensation under balanced and unbalanced loads. An innovative Squirrel Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (SqSTOA) is used to regulate the switching signals of the voltage source converter, which improves the power quality. Using Matlab/Simulink, the suggested system’s performance is examined, and the findings demonstrate SqSTOA's proficiency in enhancing power quality. Additionally, it delivers high dc-link output, reduced settling time, and enhances the steady-state response. By contrasting the optimized DSTATCOM controller with standard optimization techniques like WdCH, FFA, SSA, and STOA as well as without optimization, its applicability is determined.The suggested system’s outputs with the proposed algorithm have higher levels of accuracy when compared to those of traditional algorithms, like FFA, SSA, and STOA.},

  abstract     = {The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is one of the main issues faced by cloud service providers due to their intricate nature. The main aim of this attack is to disrupt the services of authorized users by forwarding massive malicious requests to the victim system. Even though the modern Artificial Intelligence-powered intrusion detection system offers improved benefits, it suffers from analyzing the traces of intrusion in the massive network flow. This article presents a novel Chaos-based Henry Gas Solubility Optimization—Weight initialization based-rectified linear Unit (HGSO-WIB-ReLU) framework to identify different types of DoS attacks like HTTP flood attacks, DNS flood attacks, and ICMP flood attacks. The main aim of this technique is to identify the low rate of DoS attacks which the state-of-art techniques often based on statistical analysis and machine learning are incapable of accomplishing. Convolutional neural network architecture incorporates the WIB-ReLU activation function primarily to prevent vanishing gradient issues and provide efficient training. The WIB-ReLU framework’s hyperparameters are primarily improved using the HGSO method by increasing the classifier’s accuracy rate for detecting DoS attacks. In this way, the proposed model minimized the high false positive rate in identifying low-rate DoS attacks in large datasets. Different benchmark datasets such as BUET- DDoS2020, CIC DoS Attacks, and Low Rate DDoS are used to conduct the experiments and the efficiency of the model is verified in terms of accuracy, F1-measure, and precision score. When evaluated using the BUET-DDoS, CIC-DoS, and Low rate DDoS datasets, the proposed model offers an accuracy of 97%, 96.67%, and 96%, respectively. The experimental analysis conducted demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HGSO-WIB-ReLU framework when compared to the different state-of-art methodologies.},

  abstract     = {The rise of superfluous information day by day has made the clustering of information into meaningful sets challenging. We propose an efficient approach for obtaining semantic clusters from a huge volume of documents. The preprocessing based on the lexical ontological information from WordNet helps in reducing the feature space and eliminating synonymy problems among the features. A considerable decrease in computational time is achieved by means of an enhanced k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm computes the starting centroids using a sorting technique based on Red-Black Tree, thus ensuring efficiency and meaningful clusters. Memoization techniques are utilized in the subsequent stages, to avoid redundant computations. Results indicate that our method produces more meaningful clusters than those employing word embedding models like Word2Vec, FastText, and BERT for feature extraction. The experimental results on the MiniNewsGroup, 20NewsGroup Large dataset, and Reuters-21578 dataset show remarkable achievement in clustering outcomes in terms of purity and execution time. Results on the enormous data collection 20NewsGroup Large dataset show a better NMI (Normalized Mutual Information) score compared to the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The use of network intrusion detection systems is expanding as cloud computing becomes more widespread. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are crucial to network security since network traffic is increasing and cyberattacks are being launched more frequently. Algorithms for detecting anomalies in intruder detection use either machine learning systems or pattern matching systems. Pattern-matching methods frequently produce false positive results, while AI/ML-based systems predict possible assaults by identifying connections between metrics, features, or collections of metrics, features. KNN, SVM, and other models are the most widely used, but they only apply to a few features, are not very accurate, and have a higher false positive rate. This proposal developed a deep learning model that combines the benefits of two-dimensional LSTMs and convolutional neural networks to learn the characteristics of spatial and temporal data. The study’s model was developed and evaluated using the freely available NSL-KDD dataset. The suggested model is very effective, having a low rate of false positives and a high rate of detection. Some sophisticated network intrusion detection systems use machine learning and deep learning models, and their performance is superior to that of the proposed model.},

To solve spectrum scarcity issues and to increase spectrum utilization, Honey Badger Remora Optimization-based AlexNet (HBRO-based AlexNet) is developed in this research and the test statistics model is modeled with a deep learning approach with signal parameters, like signal energy, and Eigen statistics. However, SU can use AlexNet to boost the spectrum efficiency of PU's licensed spectrum, which will then permit an increase in the chance of detection in the CR network (CRN).

This study develops a multi-objective model for charge scheduling in the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). The objective is to create a method for charging EVs in the IoEV network that is energy conscious. Here, the position of the charge station and the location of the EV are used to simulate the IoEV network. Following network simulation, charging planning is completed. First, the proposed Fractional-based Sea lion optimization algorithm (Fractional-SLO), which was developed by combining Fractional calculus (FC) with Sea Lion Optimization (SLO), is used to choose the path. Distance and energy are used to calculate one’s aptitude for selecting a path. The proposed Fractional-SLO algorithm is then used to schedule charges after that. It is now possible to model the fitness for charge scheduling using delay and energy cost. The proposed Fractional-SLO promised improved performance with a 0.279-min delay and a 20.337-km distance. When 50 vehicles are involved, the proposed method produces delays that are, respectively, 60.21%, 64.87%, 14.69%, and 17.56% smaller than those of the existing methods, namely MDP, Joint EV Routing and Charging Discharge Scheduling Strategy, and Aggregate Cost Perspective.},

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computational power. Cloud computing refers to data centers accessible to numerous customers over the Internet. It has the ability to utilize computing resources at a low cost and fast speed. Cloud data security is becoming increasingly important as we shift our devices, data centers, business processes, and other assets to the cloud. Comprehensive security policies, corporate security culture, and cloud security solutions are used to ensure the level of cloud data security. Many techniques exist to protect data communication in the cloud environment, including encryption, which is the primary component of data security and the mechanism by which data or message transmission confidentiality and integrity are achieved. Current researchers have focused on genetics-based cryptography; genetics has been implemented in cryptography for data computation, storage, and transmission. This survey paper analyzes the new type of cryptographic approaches based on genetic science to generate robust sub-keys and robust cryptographic techniques based on homologous genetics (DNA, RNA, and mRNA) to improve security in the cloud. This work reviews several approaches based on genetic cryptography and their applications and drawbacks.

The proposed finite-time quadratic criterion is minimized by solving a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The proposed analytic solution for the HJB equation exploits the properties of the EL systems, arriving at an optimal control law in a feedback configuration. Gravity, friction, and external disturbances compensations are considered. A single solution is presented that is based on the proposed Lagrange and value functions. The value function consists of the kinetic energy and a quadratic term of positions, and the Lagrange function includes the kinetic energy and a quadratic term of the EL system input. It is assumed that the kinetic energy is a quadratic form, i.e., the positions of the center of mass do not depend explicitly on time. The proposed solution does not require solving a state-dependent Riccati differential equation or solving a state-dependent ordinary differential equation. Instead, a single analytical solution is presented that converges asymptotically to the optimal value as the states approach zero. The optimal regulation control problem is solved and is illustrated by a mechanical example.},

It could guarantee that the estimation error of observer for links system is globally asymptotically stable.

Here, the image is modified effectively using the RJO algorithm because the input radar signal is applied to the image reconstruction process.

The feature extraction process is carried out to extract the significant features after the gridding step is over. This data augmentation method is carried out to increase the data dimensionality. Accordingly, the augmented result is forwarded to the DQN for target tracking, where the network is tuned efficiently by the algorithm of RJO, which is devised by the integration of Jaya Optimization and Remora optimization algorithm (ROA). Moreover, the RJO-based DQN has achieved a minimum Means Square Error (MSE) of 0.168 and maximum detection rate of 0.914, and minimum MSE of 0.168 based on Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarity.

  abstract     = {Classical cryptography is the process of hiding information and it manages the secret knowledge by encrypting the plain text message through the translation of it to an unintelligible message. Quantum cryptography is also hiding the plain text through encryption and it works based on the law of quantum physics for providing absolute security of data communication. It uses the idea of quantum mechanics to gadget a cryptographic system and the key problems are solved by intrusion detection including the Eavesdropping detection using quantum expertise. On the contrary, principles of secured communication protocol systems are demonstrated with classical quantum cryptography where the keys are distributed securely and are applied in quantum key distribution as well. In this paper, we provide a survey of works on classical cryptography and quantum cryptography and compare them with respect to time, security level and the classification of the data. Moreover, we perform a concise analysis of perspective classical cryptography and the conception of Quantum cryptography with various protocols and highlight the benefits of classical cryptography and Quantum cryptography in different applications. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations for selecting the suitable encryption model for securing the communication.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing environment offers huge computation power and enormous storage capacity. The cloud framework enables users to organize the data-intensive applications without the investment of substructure and it acts as a key role in the digital era, as it simultaneously handles the data from the number of users. Besides the useful characteristic features, providing security to data that is stored in cloud platform offers a great challenge in cloud storage. Using the proposed F-ALO technique, a privacy protection model is developed to encrypt the data before sharing it in the cloud. To achieve effective data protection, the proposed F-ALO algorithm was developed by combining the Fractional Calculus (FC) and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithms. By incorporating the privacy protection and data sharing phases, employing the MapReduce framework’s mappers and reducers, the shared data is safeguarded. Using the proposed algorithm based on the factors, such as markedness and sensitivity index, the optimal coefficient is calculated. The proposed F-ALO algorithm achieved higher performance with measures, like sensitivity index, markedness, accuracy, Database Difference Ratio (DBDR), computational overhead, time complexity and space complexity with the values of 0.8422, 0.9366, 0.9339, 0.8192, 0.7357, 0.4678, and 0.3679 using the Hungarian database.},

  abstract     = {Symptoms and types of breast cancer, like most other diseases, vary from person to person. This is while some infected people may not have any symptoms. Breast cancer is one of the common cancers among women, of course, some types of it also affect men. Basically, timely and early diagnosis before the progress of the disease can significantly provide treatment grounds. There are many approaches to breast cancer diagnosis. Classification of patients in terms of benign or malignant cancer using data mining techniques has attracted the attention of many researchers. Data mining can provide a medical assistant system with very low cost and high accuracy for early detection of breast cancer. In this regard, this study proposes a data mining-based method by a combining Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and an evolutionary approach for breast cancer diagnosis. We aim to tune MLP parameters using an evolutionary approach. Here, Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) is used as a new evolutionary approach. However, the capabilities of approaches such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Open-Source Development Model Algorithm (ODMA) are analyzed compared to TLBO. The proposed method named MLP-TLBO can simultaneously adjust all MLP parameters (i.e., effective features and their number, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, and weights of links). To improve the classification process, MLP-TLBO develops an ensemble classification mechanism in which multiple MLPs simultaneously model the training data. The evaluation of the proposed method is done on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database. We use three common datasets from Wisconsin including WBCD, WDBC and WPBC for simulations. Based on the results, the proposed method has promising results and averages between 7% and 26% better performance compared to similar methods.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering emerged as an important extension of classical clustering problems and is one of the most recent advances in unsupervised learning. Its purpose is to combine the results obtained using different algorithms by a consensus function so that the final solution is more favorable than the individual clustering algorithms. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised clustering ensemble framework using cluster consensus selection, which tries to improve the accuracy of clustering results. In general, there are two types of semi-supervised clustering algorithms, including constraint-based and metric-based. Here, the proposed ensemble clustering algorithm is equipped with a semi-supervised clustering mechanism based on pairwise constraints. Since the complexity of consensus functions scales with the number of clustering methods, processing big data for ensemble clustering is sometimes slow or impossible. Usually, all primary clusters from all clustering methods are used in the consensus function. However, the merit of clusters from different methods can be considered to improve the consensus quality. Accordingly, we propose a cluster consensus selection approach that selects a subset of meriting primary clusters to participate in the final consensus. Here, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is developed to measure the merit of clusters. Meanwhile, reducing the number of primary clusters in the consensus function can enable big data clustering. The proposed algorithm is very computationally efficient and provides linear complexity in clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of different performance metrics such as NMI, ARI and CPCC.},

The fuzzy net present value method was used to determine the strategic importance of the SWOT matrix. Taking into account the theoretical foundation of the cooperative games, the fuzzy Shapley value was used to determine the optimal combination of SWOT matrix strategies to effectively overcome the ambiguities and uncertainty of real-world conditions. In the game, any type of strategy (WT, WO, ST, and SO) was considered as a player who had partial freedom to make some choices.

This article aims to develop an optimized U-slot MPA design, where the antenna measurements such as patch height or board thickness, patch length, patch width, and feed diameter are optimally tuned by a new hybrid optimization model. As the concepts of Dingo Optimization and Black Widow Optimization are combined, the adopted algorithm is called Black Widow in Dingo Model with Logistic Chaotic Map.

Traditional watermarking techniques, unfortunately, have drawbacks when used on sensitive images like those used in medicine. A reliable and blind watermarking method is suggested in this work to protect medical picture transferred in telemedicine. Medical picture marking enables accurate patient identification, prevents scan confusion, and minimizes the risk of diagnostic mistakes that could have negative consequences. In this method, three distinct transforms are used to acquire the frequency content of the image. The low frequency subbands are subsequently subjected to Schur decomposition. In order to incorporate the watermark bits, the resultant upper triangular matrix values are modified. The proposed approaches effectively retain a considerable quality of watermarked images and are impressively resistant against numerous conventional attacks, according to imperceptibility and robustness experimental results. The average Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which was obtained was 44.90 dB, demonstrating that the integration procedure produces very low distortion to the original image. The observed results for robustness demonstrate that the watermark is resilient to the most of the attacks performed in watermarking, with a normalized cross correlation rate higher than 0.9.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) have emerging applications in real-time with lots of research challenges. Specifically, the dynamic nature of the mobile nodes limits the performance of routing in MANET. The existing routing algorithms, such as AODV, DSR, and DSDV, lack performance due to an ineffectual route discovery procedure. When it comes to large-scale applications such as air pollution monitoring, routing becomes more complex and consumes more energy for route selection. This research work aims to increase data delivery while minimizing energy consumption for air pollution monitoring applications. To achieve this, we have proposed a novel Hybrid Optimization methodology for MANETs. First, we partitioned the network into multiple dynamic clusters by using Dual Constraint Clustering (DCC) approach that works upon Mobility Metric (MoM) and Hop Count (HC). In each cluster, the Cluster Head (CH) is selected by Type-II fuzzy approach. Then, routing is performed by Hybrid Cellular Automata and African Buffalo Optimization (HCA2BO) algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm considers multiple metrics to select an optimum route. The extensive analysis in the ns-3 simulation tool shows enhanced performance in network lifetime, energy consumption, and delay. Also, an air pollution monitoring application is demonstrated in the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {In the present occupied world, time is an indispensable issue which cannot be overseen by seeing every single wonder with our tight schedule. So, now daily’s automatic projects are being favored over manual systematic works to make life easier and simpler in all angles. To make it a great achievement Internet of Things is the most recent web innovation created. IoT has major role in creating many advancements in today’s world. In many of the educational institute or business service center, it is essential to maintain a proper attendance records. This research focuses on replacing the manual attendance recording system into an automated one and also maintaining the attendance records, i.e., percentage of attendance with higher accuracy. The proposed methodology in this undertaking is the improvement of internet of things-based RFID attendance system. Currently, RFID technology has been widely used in various fields such as agriculture, transportation, sales and in many other sectors. Apart from these sectors, this technology can also be utilized for automating attendance taking system in educational sectors too. The normal method of taking attendance manually is usually a time consuming one and also there is a probability of error. This manual method may also lead to misconducting and also there is wastage of valuable time. In order to overcome this problem, the present manual attendance taking system can be replaced by a smart attendance system by implementing RFID technology. This research pretends much useful for the staff members and making the attendance taking process in an easiest and efficient way.},

  abstract     = {The Controllability on temporal complex networks is one of the most important challenges among researchers in this field. The primary purpose of network controllability is to apply inputs by selecting minimum driver nodes set (MDS) to the network components to move the network from an initial state to a final state in a limited time. The most important challenges in the controllability of temporal networks can be mentioned the high complexity of the control algorithms used in these methods as well as the high data overhead of temporal network representation models such as the layered model. In this paper, centrality measures are used as the most important characteristics of networks for network controllability. For this purpose, centrality measures have been redefined based on temporal networks and a new controllability method has been proposed based on temporal centrality measures. Then, these properties are used for selecting the minimal driver nodes set, in such a way that the network can be fully controlled using these nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that by using temporal centrality measures the execution speed of control processes is improved (57% improvement) and the overhead is not increased and also the control process has led to the same length of MDS as other conventional controllability methods, it has even been better in some cases.},
