  abstract     = {High-Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM) is designed to discover sets of itemsets that can bring high profits from the database. However, HUIM encounters several challenges in picking a suitable minimum utility threshold for each database. A class of algorithms that select the top- k itemsets based on their utility has been proposed to address this issue. Although traditional top-k HUI mining algorithms do not require a specific threshold, they tend to be very time-consuming and memory-intensive when dealing with large datasets. To tackle the combinational complexity involved in HUIM algorithms, nature-inspired methods have been suggested and adopted. Nonetheless, these algorithms have traditionally focused on handling conventional, often overlooking critical data structures like product hierarchies. Consequently, they fail to extract crucial insight from this novel database format. Thus, our research introduces a heuristic-based algorithm designed to leverage top-k itemsets from databases enriched with item taxonomy data. We propose a technique involving the early pruning of unpromising items to enhance mining efficiency. Experimental evaluations are conducted on several datasets to assess the method’s performance, both with and without adopting this strategy, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Sentence-level sentiment analysis is a natural language processing model growing rapidly and strongly due to its role in artificial intelligence systems. There are many approaches to developing and improving the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis with satisfactory performance, among which deep neural network methods are notable. However, sentence-level sentiment analysis methods based on deep neural networks often have two limitations: (i) The system architecture is not deep enough; (ii) Sentences containing unclear sentiments cannot be processed. To solve the above two challenges, in this paper, we propose a new sentence-level sentiment analysis method called Fuzzy-enhanced Deep Neural Networks (FeDN2) by deepening deep neural networks by adding fuzzy and defuzzy classes. FeDN2 includes the following main layers: (i) BERT layer to convert sentences into vectors. (ii) Fuzzification layer to blur sentence vectors. (iii) Deep convolutional layers to extract high-level features. (iv) Defuzzification layer to convert high-level feature vectors into clear values. (v) Fully connected layer to learn non-linear combinations of these high-level features. (vi) Classification layer to identify the sentiment polarity of sentences. FeDN2 was tested on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrated that it can improve the performance of previous sentence-level sentiment analysis methods based on deep neural networks.},

With growth of efficient and high accuracy methods of artificial intelligence, it is easier to obtain satisfactory results using opinion mining. Usually, more complex structure, and more sophisticated methods give us better results, but it is hard to understand why such a result was returned. Many of these methods are black-box models – it is a reason for decreasing trust in the system. To manage the problem, explainable methods were developed.

  abstract     = {Chromosome straightening plays an important role in karyotype analysis. Common straightening methods usually adopt geometric algorithms, which tend to affect the chromosome banding patterns in the process of straightening, resulting in feature changes, loss of details, and poor generalization. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel straightening method based on disentanglement representation learning. Our method consists of two main components: the Disentanglement Representation Encoder (DRE) and the Straightening Generator (SG), where DRE discovers and disentangles the bent representation and the content representation in the latent space, while SG is used to generate the straightened chromosome images based on the disentangled representations. Leveraging the bent representation and the content representation disentangled by DRE, our method produces the straightened representation by reducing the bent representation while keeping the content representation unchanged, making straightening chromosome without changing its banding patterns possible. Evaluation results on both the Frechet Initiation Distance (FID) and the Downstream Classification Accuracy (DCA) metrics show that our method achieves good performance.},

However, the overlapping of chromosome instances and their individual morphological differences make accurate chromosome instance segmentation a challenging task. Especially in handling overlapping chromosome instances, traditional segmentation methods tend to confuse instances with one another. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an innovative method named Adaptive2Former. It builds upon our novel devised Adaptive Query Decoder (AQD) module to enhance segmentation precision. The AQD effectively utilizes the [ cls ] token from the backbone network to dynamically generate adaptive query vectors instead of using fixed queries. This new design leverages the semantic information inside the input images, producing representations more conducive to subsequent segmentation module, thereby improving the model’s segmentation performance. Experiments conducted on our dataset demonstrate that the proposed Adaptive2Former significantly enhances the performance of chromosome instance segmentation compared to Mask2Former and other existing models, achieving results of 97.65% mAP75 and 0.21 Dice Loss.},

Finding consensus for an ordered partition collective is very important in making decisions. A 2-Optimality (O 2 ) consensus best represents a collective, and distances between it and collective elements are uniform. However, finding such consensus has yet to be widely examined for ordered partition collectives. The best algorithm for this task in the literature is the HG3 algorithm. This study proposed three evolutionary algorithms to solve this problem. The algorithm (μ, λ)-IES is developed based on (μ, λ)-ES. The IHG2 algorithm is developed by fuzing the local search, elitism strategy, duplicate elimination, dynamic crossover rate, and dynamic mutation rate. The IHG3 algorithm is increasing the balance of exploration and exploitation. This algorithm is developed by fuzing the longest-distance strategy (KLD), elitism strategy (IEBL), local search, duplicate elimination, dynamic crossover rate, and dynamic mutation rate. The simulation results show that these algorithms generate high consensus quality. The IHG3 algorithm provides consensus with the best quality in an acceptable running time.},

The data preparation pipeline consists of essential procedures aimed at ensuring the integrity and appropriateness of the data for analysis. The method begins by removing null values, thereafter, applying one-hot encoding to categorical features, min-max scaling for data normalization, and label encoding for efficient management of binary labels. The process of feature selection is conducted utilizing the Pearson coefficient correlation. An exhaustive evaluation is conducted on six machine learning models for the purpose of binary classification. The evaluation takes into account key performance measures like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The Random Forest model demonstrated exceptional performance, with a remarkable accuracy of 99% and a robust F1 score of 98%. Additionally, it exhibited a well-balanced precision and recall at 98%. The Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors models exhibit notable performance, achieving accuracy and F1 scores around at the 98% level. During our investigation into multi-class classification research, we thoroughly examined numerous machine learning models, all of which exhibited robust performance, with accuracy rates ranging from 97% to 98%. The aforementioned results highlight the efficacy of these models in accurately classifying data, regularly achieving high levels of precision, recall, and F1 scores for positive case predictions. This study offers a current viewpoint on the identification of cyber threats and emphasizes the appropriateness of several machine learning models in this rapidly changing field.},

The proliferation of tools based on generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including the emergence of ChatGPT, has resulted in testing as a first step and implementations in further areas of business life, including marketing, as a second step. Still only a few studies have analyzed and evaluated specific solutions for different areas of marketing, including advert design. In order to fill this gap, areas where GAI and ChatGPT are used during the various stages of creating a digital advertising campaign have been identified. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of GAI and ChatGPT on theory and practice on different stages of the digital advertising campaign building process. This objective is followed by a research question: how can marketers use GAI and ChatGPT to create an effective digital advertising campaign? The process of building a digital advertising campaign should be considered and analyzed in terms of the impact of using GAI and ChatGPT technology and, at the same time, the role played by marketers at each stage and their contribution to this process in collaboration with GAI-based tools. This article is intended as a preliminary exploration of the impact of using GAI and ChatGPT on the digital marketing campaign building process. Therefore, the methodology applied includes critical literature analysis, secondary data analysis and individual in depth interview (IDI) with an expert (CEO of a advertising agency). This represents a first step in the study, to be followed by in-depth empirical research (qualitative as well as quantitative) to verify and develop the conclusions drawn. The article analyses the impact of using generative AI and ChatGPT on the process of creating an advertising campaign in digital media from a theoretical and practical point of view.

The developed Hybrid Walrus and Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (HWCSA) is performed by optimally select the CH and the multi-objective functions with constraints like residual energy, distance, and delay are derived in the CH selection approach. Moreover, the same HWCSA is used for performing the routing process to provide better communication between Base Station (BS) and sensor nodes. Here, multi-objective function with constraints like throughput, distance, packet delivery ratio, and hop count are optimally derived by optimizing the shortest path. In the end, the designed HWCSA approach is estimated with several performance metrics.

In order to handle the uncertainty in the assessments of FMEA experts, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was introduced to FMEA for its flexibility and superiority in coping with uncertain and subjective assessments. However, traditional Dempster combination rule have difficulty in dealing with highly conflicting evidence that given from FMEA experts’ assessments. Moreover, experts themselves may influence each other though process such as chatting, judging, decision-making and voting. In this paper, we explore the problem of conflict evidence fusion from a correlation perspective among FMEA experts. We use ambiguity measure and Gaussian distribution to deal with the highly conflicting evidence. We use ambiguity measure to calculate the variance of Gaussian distribution. Then, we use Gaussian model to generalize expert assessments. After that, we use Dempster combination rule to fuze assessments from different experts. Finally, we calculate the risk priority number to rank the risk level of the FMEA items. The experiment results in the air system of an aircraft turbofan engine shows the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Heart disease remains a major global cause of mortality, underscoring the need for advancements in early detection and prognosis to enhance patient recovery. This study proposes an innovative framework integrating deep learning (DL) models and optimal resource allocation strategies to improve heart disease detection and prognosis. The framework begins with rigorous preprocessing of the Internet of Things (IoT) captured Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, employing min–max normalization, and advanced median filtering techniques for noise reduction and baseline wander correction. Statistical features are extracted from the preprocessed data, while features such Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), RR interval, R peak, and PR interval are derived from ECG signals. These features are then augmented using a min–max technique to enhance dataset diversity and model robustness. Furthermore, the study introduces a hybrid model combining a Deep Residual Network (DRN) and an Improved Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for severity classification heart disease detection, leveraging augmented features. Optimal resource allocation is facilitated by the Improved Walrus Optimization Algorithm (WaOA), optimizing ventilator, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed, medical staff, and medication allocation based on predicted disease severity. Evaluation with real-world datasets demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and resource utilization efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of IoT and AI-driven approaches in cardiovascular healthcare.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive count of connected devices with different sensing support, particularly in medical health constraints sensing. In these summaries, secure communication and data collection to centralized servers is rather difficult for preventing the occurrence of diverse attacks for illegal data access. To tackle these problems, this task plans to design and implement the FoG-based secure data management system in IoT-WSN using adaptive encryption and decryption processes. As the FoG server is away from the corresponding aggregator node, it is transmitted via the other nodes using the proposed modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based encryption process. For secured data transmission the designed method undergoes two main stages as message receiving stage, and the message-extraction stage. The hybridized meta-heuristic algorithm termed Jaya-Galactic Swarm Optimization (J-GSO) is used for modifying the ECC with an optimized key. From the simulation findings, the performance of the suggested scheme at the data size of three bytes is 3.08%, 3.22%, 3.65%, and 3.33% better than the MFO-m-ECC, PSO-m-ECC, GSO-m-ECC, and JA-m-ECC at the ECC curve variation of “secp192r1”. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the designed method when tested with baseline schemes regarding time complexity, space complexity, and cost function.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of a time-sensitive data collection technique distinguishes a normal wireless sensor network (WSN) system from a WSN. To convey data promptly to the intended user, sensor nodes must compete with one another. Network speed and packet delivery rate (PDR) are impacted by the unfairness of competing nodes. To enhance node fairness, a protocol must be successful. The Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, which focuses on the power requirements of the sensor node, manages these procedures. The proposed MAC protocols, however, do not address the quality of service issues and may not offer power efficiency in certain traffic conditions. During the sensor node registration process, the proposed hybrid MAC uses CSMA/CA to register the sensor nodes and assigns time slots and duty cycle modifications to the registered sensor nodes. Basic sensor network operations like scheduling and prioritization enable this. The findings demonstrate how the suggested MAC protocol enhances network performance in terms of throughput, packet delivery rate, low latency, and minimal power consumption while achieving fairness. When all of these elements are taken into account, the finalized product will attain high data rates.},

  abstract     = {Prevalent usage of learning based systems as part of critical systems has brought wide set of security risks encompassing adversarial attacks like evasion attacks and poisoning attacks. Ascertaining adversarial robustness and security of learning based models has sparked widespread concerns. In backdoor attacks, backdoored model has normal behavior on pristine data but makes attacker induced predictions for poisoned samples. Major challenges faced with existing backdoor defense techniques is that while they sanitize the model to remove backdoors, they often reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) at the cost of model Benign Accuracy (BA) degradation. To address these problems, our proposed model sanitization technique inspired by existing backdoor elimination defense, Model Contrastive Loss (MCL) involves (1)applying Gaussian adaptive filtering to poisoned samples to mitigate effect of backdoor trigger; (2)leveraging K-means clustering to feature representation of poisoned samples to construct pseudo labels; (3) tuning model parameters by usage of Triplet Marginal Loss (TML) and Contrastive Loss (CL) to continuously refine learned feature space to yield purified model. Experimental evaluation was performed on benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, Imagenet and GTSRB against poison label backdoor attacks: BadNets, Trojan, and Blend along with clean-label backdoor attacks: consistent label and SIGNAL (SIG). Our proposed MCL++ technique exhibits improved effectiveness by exhibiting low ASR and improved BA than existing MCL technique, ensuring model’s performance on pristine data has not been compromised.},

We first define High-level Colored Time Petri Net (HCTPN) that extends time Petri Nets with color and high-level functionality encompassing both timed multi-enableness of transitions and sequential pseudo code. We then extend HCTPN with stopwatches to allow the modeling of preemptive scheduling, which is an important feature in the real-time context. We prove that the reachability problem is decidable for HCTPN but is undecidable for HCTPN with stopwatches, and we propose an abstraction of the state space for these models. We apply this approach to model a preemptive multi-core real-time application that uses a spinlock mechanism in order to check all possible execution paths, interleaving of service calls, and preemptive scheduling.},

We present in this article, a novel concept of robust nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC). In fact, the use of the NFTSMC offers a fast convergence rate, avoids singularities but still suffers from chattering. To overcome this limitation, two approaches have been developed: robust nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller (RNFTSMC) and robust optimized nonsingular fast terminal sliding controller (RONFTSMC). In the first one an additional term called switching signal is added to the equivalent control law. The second one is a combination of the NFTSM technique, and a cuckoo search algorithm as optimum term. Simulations show that the control strategy can overcome the chattering phenomena ensures the accuracy and stability of the joint robot position control.},

In this work, an analysis of machine learning-based algorithms for missing data imputation is performed. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Sequential KNN (SKNN) algorithms are used to impute missing values in datasets using machine learning. Missing values handled using a statistical deletion approach (List-wise Deletion (LD)) and ML-based imputation methods (KNN and SKNN) are then tested and compared using different ML classifiers (Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree) to evaluate the effectiveness of imputed data. The used algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy, and results yielded that the ML-based imputation method (SKNN) outperforms the LD-based approach and KNN method in terms of the effectiveness of handling missing data in almost every dataset with both classification algorithms (SVM and DT).},

The angular speed limit is PSO selected and the variance of the angular speed is added to the fitness function as a third objective.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an efficient energy management scheme for an EV with a hybrid energy storage system like super capacitor and battery based on hybrid optimization method. The proposed hybrid approach is a parallel performance of gradient boosting decision tree algorithm and reptile search algorithm. The major purpose is to diminish the variance among real and reference power on battery and super capacitor. The HESS is divided into two segments: (1) Determine the super capacitor reference voltage, which is affected by load dynamics. (2) Maximize the power flow via the HESS. The super capacitor reference voltage is first calculated by assessing the load dynamics on real time, such as vehicle dynamics, motor characteristics, and regenerative braking systems. The super capacitor’s input parameters include load current, battery current, and state of charge. The RSA is created on proposed system by combining the probable data set of HESS control signals. The GBDT algorithm is trained and forecasts optimal HESS parameters using the RSA’s practiced data set. The proposed approach also improves battery current magnitude, super capacitor voltage, battery current ranges, and battery power. It optimizes the HESS parameter provides specific solutions. The proposed hybrid system is implemented on MATLAB and its performance is related to that of existing approaches.},

Following a mathematical programming approach, we reformulate the problem to obtain general necessary conditions that allow finding the worst-case optimality in the form of a weighted sum. These conditions are then applied to the time-varying linear affine quadratic problem with multiple modes and a general cost, which includes tracking signals in both: the state and the control variables.

Hence, this paper aims to design a multimodal fake news detection model with enhanced deep learning architecture. Initially, the multi-modal information including images and text are gathered from real-time social media. Then, pre-processing of both images and text is carried out. Further, the text features are extracted using Word2vector and glove embedding techniques. Then, the optimal features from both image features and text features are attained using the Adaptive Water Strider Algorithm (A-WSA). The achieved optimal features are forwarded to the new feature fusion concept based on the weight factor that is optimized using the same A-WSA. Finally, the fused features are forwarded to the fake news classification stage with the help of “Optimized-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (O-BiLSTM),” where the hyperparameter of BiLSTM is optimized through similar A-WSA. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy rate of the designed A-WSA-BiLSTM method is attained at 96.51%. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed model is effective in using multi-modal data in automated fake news classification.},

We will describe how, beginning with a project seed of a Necessary University, this project has evolved over the last ten years into an organic structure better fit to cope with the dynamics of the crisis.

For this, numerous novel settings like integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) should be implemented in the network system. Here, this paper plans to design an optimization-based power allocation model to increase the Effective Power Efficiency (EPE) that offers guaranteed QoS over “Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)-channel oriented 5 G networks”. Moreover, the statistical QoS-based green power allotment system was also analyzed to increase the EPE over other MIMO networks. Particularly, this paper makes an attempt to make the power allocation optimal, which directly ensures the 5 G network energy efficiency when guaranteeing QoS. This is considered to be the optimization issue, which is solved by MS-DA. Our suggested approach can be applied to hybrid energy supply networks with various network topologies, such as 5 G networks, which are now the most extensively used, and is capable of achieving a good resolution through iterative convergence.},

To minimize the complexity of the conventional system, levenberg-marquardt trained artificial neural network (ANN) controller is proposed to the UPQC in order to generate the effective reference signals for shunt, series converters which eliminates the necessity of conventional abc, dq0, αβ transformations. The main aim of the proposed ANN based UPQC is to achieve the constant direct current (DC) link capacitor voltage during load changes with low settling time, elimination of imperfections in current waveforms, thereby reducing total harmonic distortions (THD) and to improve power factor, mitigation of sag, swell, disturbances and unbalances in source voltage. The performance of developed method is tested on five case studies with different combination of loads, variable irradiation and source voltages conditions. To demonstrate the supremacy of the developed method the comparative study with the proportional integral controller (PIC) was carried out.

Moreover, the paper suggests a technique for obtaining an optimal dc-link voltage depending upon the grid’s need for load compensation under balanced and unbalanced loads. An innovative Squirrel Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (SqSTOA) is used to regulate the switching signals of the voltage source converter, which improves the power quality. Using Matlab/Simulink, the suggested system’s performance is examined, and the findings demonstrate SqSTOA's proficiency in enhancing power quality. Additionally, it delivers high dc-link output, reduced settling time, and enhances the steady-state response. By contrasting the optimized DSTATCOM controller with standard optimization techniques like WdCH, FFA, SSA, and STOA as well as without optimization, its applicability is determined.The suggested system’s outputs with the proposed algorithm have higher levels of accuracy when compared to those of traditional algorithms, like FFA, SSA, and STOA.},

  abstract     = {The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is one of the main issues faced by cloud service providers due to their intricate nature. The main aim of this attack is to disrupt the services of authorized users by forwarding massive malicious requests to the victim system. Even though the modern Artificial Intelligence-powered intrusion detection system offers improved benefits, it suffers from analyzing the traces of intrusion in the massive network flow. This article presents a novel Chaos-based Henry Gas Solubility Optimization—Weight initialization based-rectified linear Unit (HGSO-WIB-ReLU) framework to identify different types of DoS attacks like HTTP flood attacks, DNS flood attacks, and ICMP flood attacks. The main aim of this technique is to identify the low rate of DoS attacks which the state-of-art techniques often based on statistical analysis and machine learning are incapable of accomplishing. Convolutional neural network architecture incorporates the WIB-ReLU activation function primarily to prevent vanishing gradient issues and provide efficient training. The WIB-ReLU framework’s hyperparameters are primarily improved using the HGSO method by increasing the classifier’s accuracy rate for detecting DoS attacks. In this way, the proposed model minimized the high false positive rate in identifying low-rate DoS attacks in large datasets. Different benchmark datasets such as BUET- DDoS2020, CIC DoS Attacks, and Low Rate DDoS are used to conduct the experiments and the efficiency of the model is verified in terms of accuracy, F1-measure, and precision score. When evaluated using the BUET-DDoS, CIC-DoS, and Low rate DDoS datasets, the proposed model offers an accuracy of 97%, 96.67%, and 96%, respectively. The experimental analysis conducted demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HGSO-WIB-ReLU framework when compared to the different state-of-art methodologies.},

We propose an efficient approach for obtaining semantic clusters from a huge volume of documents. The preprocessing based on the lexical ontological information from WordNet helps in reducing the feature space and eliminating synonymy problems among the features. A considerable decrease in computational time is achieved by means of an enhanced k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm computes the starting centroids using a sorting technique based on Red-Black Tree, thus ensuring efficiency and meaningful clusters. Memoization techniques are utilized in the subsequent stages, to avoid redundant computations. Results indicate that our method produces more meaningful clusters than those employing word embedding models like Word2Vec, FastText, and BERT for feature extraction. The experimental results on the MiniNewsGroup, 20NewsGroup Large dataset, and Reuters-21578 dataset show remarkable achievement in clustering outcomes in terms of purity and execution time.

  abstract     = {The use of network intrusion detection systems is expanding as cloud computing becomes more widespread. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are crucial to network security since network traffic is increasing and cyberattacks are being launched more frequently. Algorithms for detecting anomalies in intruder detection use either machine learning systems or pattern matching systems. Pattern-matching methods frequently produce false positive results, while AI/ML-based systems predict possible assaults by identifying connections between metrics, features, or collections of metrics, features. KNN, SVM, and other models are the most widely used, but they only apply to a few features, are not very accurate, and have a higher false positive rate. This proposal developed a deep learning model that combines the benefits of two-dimensional LSTMs and convolutional neural networks to learn the characteristics of spatial and temporal data. The study’s model was developed and evaluated using the freely available NSL-KDD dataset. The suggested model is very effective, having a low rate of false positives and a high rate of detection. Some sophisticated network intrusion detection systems use machine learning and deep learning models, and their performance is superior to that of the proposed model.},

Even though various spectrum sensing techniques are designed in CR networks, designing test statistics still results in a complex task. To solve spectrum scarcity issues and to increase spectrum utilization, Honey Badger Remora Optimization-based AlexNet (HBRO-based AlexNet) is developed in this research and the test statistics model is modeled with a deep learning approach with signal parameters, like signal energy, and Eigen statistics. However, SU can use AlexNet to boost the spectrum efficiency of PU's licensed spectrum, which will then permit an increase in the chance of detection in the CR network (CRN). Though considering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 5 dB, the proposed spectrum sensing approach yields the probability of detection and probability of false alarm for the Rician channel as 1 and 0.999, respectively.},

This study develops a multi-objective model for charge scheduling in the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). The objective is to create a method for charging EVs in the IoEV network that is energy conscious. Here, the position of the charge station and the location of the EV are used to simulate the IoEV network. Following network simulation, charging planning is completed. First, the proposed Fractional-based Sea lion optimization algorithm (Fractional-SLO), which was developed by combining Fractional calculus (FC) with Sea Lion Optimization (SLO), is used to choose the path. Distance and energy are used to calculate one’s aptitude for selecting a path. The proposed Fractional-SLO algorithm is then used to schedule charges after that. It is now possible to model the fitness for charge scheduling using delay and energy cost. The proposed Fractional-SLO promised improved performance with a 0.279-min delay and a 20.337-km distance. When 50 vehicles are involved, the proposed method produces delays that are, respectively, 60.21%, 64.87%, 14.69%, and 17.56% smaller than those of the existing methods, namely MDP, Joint EV Routing and Charging Discharge Scheduling Strategy, and Aggregate Cost Perspective.},

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computational power. Cloud computing refers to data centers accessible to numerous customers over the Internet. It has the ability to utilize computing resources at a low cost and fast speed. Cloud data security is becoming increasingly important as we shift our devices, data centers, business processes, and other assets to the cloud. Comprehensive security policies, corporate security culture, and cloud security solutions are used to ensure the level of cloud data security. Many techniques exist to protect data communication in the cloud environment, including encryption, which is the primary component of data security and the mechanism by which data or message transmission confidentiality and integrity are achieved. Current researchers have focused on genetics-based cryptography; genetics has been implemented in cryptography for data computation, storage, and transmission. This survey paper analyzes the new type of cryptographic approaches based on genetic science to generate robust sub-keys and robust cryptographic techniques based on homologous genetics (DNA, RNA, and mRNA) to improve security in the cloud. This work reviews several approaches based on genetic cryptography and their applications and drawbacks.

  abstract     = {Applying Lyapunov theory, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is assured for fully-actuated non-linear Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems. The proposed finite-time quadratic criterion is minimized by solving a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The proposed analytic solution for the HJB equation exploits the properties of the EL systems, arriving at an optimal control law in a feedback configuration. Gravity, friction, and external disturbances compensations are considered. A single solution is presented that is based on the proposed Lagrange and value functions. The value function consists of the kinetic energy and a quadratic term of positions, and the Lagrange function includes the kinetic energy and a quadratic term of the EL system input. It is assumed that the kinetic energy is a quadratic form, i.e., the positions of the center of mass do not depend explicitly on time. The proposed solution does not require solving a state-dependent Riccati differential equation or solving a state-dependent ordinary differential equation. Instead, a single analytical solution is presented that converges asymptotically to the optimal value as the states approach zero. The optimal regulation control problem is solved and is illustrated by a mechanical example.},

In order to handle this problem, the state observer design and the structural balance tracking control for the links system with complex dynamical networks are investigated. The dynamical model of the links system is molded as the Riccati matrix difference equation, which contains a coupling term associated with external stimulations. For the discrete-time model, the pole assignment algorithm is adopted to calculate the gain matrix for the observer of the links system. It could guarantee that the estimation error of observer for links system is globally asymptotically stable. Further, combining the effective estimation information of observer and external stimulations, an asymptotically tracking controller is proposed, which could achieve the asymptotic tracking of the reference structure balance network to the links system.

This research design a novel technique, named Remora Jaya Optimization (RJO)-enabled Deep Quantum Neural Network (DQN) by considering the impacts of an unknown underwater environment for effective underwater target tracking in radar images. Here, the image is modified effectively using the RJO algorithm because the input radar signal is applied to the image reconstruction process. The modified image is fed up to the gridding phase, where the image is partitioned into a number of grids. The feature extraction process is carried out to extract the significant features after the gridding step is over. This data augmentation method is carried out to increase the data dimensionality. Accordingly, the augmented result is forwarded to the DQN for target tracking, where the network is tuned efficiently by the algorithm of RJO, which is devised by the integration of Jaya Optimization and Remora optimization algorithm (ROA). Moreover, the RJO-based DQN has achieved a minimum Means Square Error (MSE) of 0.168 and maximum detection rate of 0.914, and minimum MSE of 0.168 based on Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarity.

  abstract     = {Symptoms and types of breast cancer, like most other diseases, vary from person to person. This is while some infected people may not have any symptoms. Breast cancer is one of the common cancers among women, of course, some types of it also affect men. Basically, timely and early diagnosis before the progress of the disease can significantly provide treatment grounds. There are many approaches to breast cancer diagnosis. Classification of patients in terms of benign or malignant cancer using data mining techniques has attracted the attention of many researchers. Data mining can provide a medical assistant system with very low cost and high accuracy for early detection of breast cancer. In this regard, this study proposes a data mining-based method by a combining Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and an evolutionary approach for breast cancer diagnosis. We aim to tune MLP parameters using an evolutionary approach. Here, Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) is used as a new evolutionary approach. However, the capabilities of approaches such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Open-Source Development Model Algorithm (ODMA) are analyzed compared to TLBO. The proposed method named MLP-TLBO can simultaneously adjust all MLP parameters (i.e., effective features and their number, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, and weights of links). To improve the classification process, MLP-TLBO develops an ensemble classification mechanism in which multiple MLPs simultaneously model the training data. The evaluation of the proposed method is done on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database. We use three common datasets from Wisconsin including WBCD, WDBC and WPBC for simulations. Based on the results, the proposed method has promising results and averages between 7% and 26% better performance compared to similar methods.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering emerged as an important extension of classical clustering problems and is one of the most recent advances in unsupervised learning. Its purpose is to combine the results obtained using different algorithms by a consensus function so that the final solution is more favorable than the individual clustering algorithms. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised clustering ensemble framework using cluster consensus selection, which tries to improve the accuracy of clustering results. In general, there are two types of semi-supervised clustering algorithms, including constraint-based and metric-based. Here, the proposed ensemble clustering algorithm is equipped with a semi-supervised clustering mechanism based on pairwise constraints. Since the complexity of consensus functions scales with the number of clustering methods, processing big data for ensemble clustering is sometimes slow or impossible. Usually, all primary clusters from all clustering methods are used in the consensus function. However, the merit of clusters from different methods can be considered to improve the consensus quality. Accordingly, we propose a cluster consensus selection approach that selects a subset of meriting primary clusters to participate in the final consensus. Here, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is developed to measure the merit of clusters. Meanwhile, reducing the number of primary clusters in the consensus function can enable big data clustering. The proposed algorithm is very computationally efficient and provides linear complexity in clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of different performance metrics such as NMI, ARI and CPCC.},

Moreover, the researchers are performed to analyze the outcomes of student performance but the educational database consists of a huge data volume, which is hard to train the small sample. In this research work, a new hybrid deep learning model with optimized entropy rough set theory is developed to predict the student’s performance accurately. The preprocessing phase is performed with outlier removal and the data-filling method. The features are mined from the preprocessed data by Entropy weighted Rough set-based feature mining. A novel meta-heuristic hybrid Galactic Rider Swarm Optimization (GRSO) algorithm is developed for feature mining. A hybrid deep learning-based Convolutional Recurrent Network (CRN) is implemented for prediction, where the classification performance is improved by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are optimized by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the sensitivity and accuracy rate of the recommended GRSO-CRN method attain 94% and 93%. The simulation outcome of the proposed GRSO-CRN model achieves enriched performance.},

The fuzzy net present value method was used to determine the strategic importance of the SWOT matrix. Taking into account the theoretical foundation of the cooperative games, the fuzzy Shapley value was used to determine the optimal combination of SWOT matrix strategies to effectively overcome the ambiguities and uncertainty of real-world conditions. In the game, any type of strategy (WT, WO, ST, and SO) was considered as a player who had partial freedom to make some choices.

MPA integrating U-shape slots are renowned for including comparatively larger bandwidth impedance (around 30%). This article aims to develop an optimized U-slot MPA design, where the antenna measurements such as patch height or board thickness, patch length, patch width, and feed diameter are optimally tuned by a new hybrid optimization model. As the concepts of Dingo Optimization and Black Widow Optimization are combined, the adopted algorithm is called Black Widow in Dingo Model with Logistic Chaotic Map. The priority of the introduced scheme is examined via the assessment over existing models by varying the frequency ranges, and cost analysis is also done for varied iterations.},

  abstract     = {Watermarking is a technique for protecting multimedia data, mainly images, from malicious attacks by adding a signature into these images. Traditional watermarking techniques, unfortunately, have drawbacks when used on sensitive images like those used in medicine. A reliable and blind watermarking method is suggested in this work to protect medical picture transferred in telemedicine. Medical picture marking enables accurate patient identification, prevents scan confusion, and minimizes the risk of diagnostic mistakes that could have negative consequences. In this method, three distinct transforms are used to acquire the frequency content of the image. The low frequency subbands are subsequently subjected to Schur decomposition. In order to incorporate the watermark bits, the resultant upper triangular matrix values are modified. The proposed approaches effectively retain a considerable quality of watermarked images and are impressively resistant against numerous conventional attacks, according to imperceptibility and robustness experimental results. The average Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which was obtained was 44.90 dB, demonstrating that the integration procedure produces very low distortion to the original image. The observed results for robustness demonstrate that the watermark is resilient to the most of the attacks performed in watermarking, with a normalized cross correlation rate higher than 0.9.},

Specifically, the dynamic nature of the mobile nodes limits the performance of routing in MANET. The existing routing algorithms, such as AODV, DSR, and DSDV, lack performance due to an ineffectual route discovery procedure. When it comes to large-scale applications such as air pollution monitoring, routing becomes more complex and consumes more energy for route selection. This research work aims to increase data delivery while minimizing energy consumption for air pollution monitoring applications. To achieve this, we have proposed a novel Hybrid Optimization methodology for MANETs. First, we partitioned the network into multiple dynamic clusters by using Dual Constraint Clustering (DCC) approach that works upon Mobility Metric (MoM) and Hop Count (HC). In each cluster, the Cluster Head (CH) is selected by Type-II fuzzy approach. Then, routing is performed by Hybrid Cellular Automata and African Buffalo Optimization (HCA2BO) algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm considers multiple metrics to select an optimum route. The extensive analysis in the ns-3 simulation tool shows enhanced performance in network lifetime, energy consumption, and delay. Also, an air pollution monitoring application is demonstrated in the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {The Controllability on temporal complex networks is one of the most important challenges among researchers in this field. The primary purpose of network controllability is to apply inputs by selecting minimum driver nodes set (MDS) to the network components to move the network from an initial state to a final state in a limited time. The most important challenges in the controllability of temporal networks can be mentioned the high complexity of the control algorithms used in these methods as well as the high data overhead of temporal network representation models such as the layered model. In this paper, centrality measures are used as the most important characteristics of networks for network controllability. For this purpose, centrality measures have been redefined based on temporal networks and a new controllability method has been proposed based on temporal centrality measures. Then, these properties are used for selecting the minimal driver nodes set, in such a way that the network can be fully controlled using these nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that by using temporal centrality measures the execution speed of control processes is improved (57% improvement) and the overhead is not increased and also the control process has led to the same length of MDS as other conventional controllability methods, it has even been better in some cases.},
