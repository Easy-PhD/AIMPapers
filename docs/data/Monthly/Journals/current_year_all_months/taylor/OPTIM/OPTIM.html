The purpose of this paper is to extend this method to the class of P ∗ ( κ ) -linear complementarity problems (LCPs). First, we propose a new wide neighbourhood of the central path for LCPs, which differs from the one presented by [Ai W, Zhang S: An O ( n L ) iteration primal–dual path-following method, based on wide neighbourhoods and large updates, for monotone LCP. SIAM J Optim. 2005;16(2):400–417]. Our method uses new search directions obtained by an algebraically equivalent transformation of the system which defines the central path. We present a large-step algorithm, but we demonstrate that it has the same iteration complexity as the best short-step algorithms. Finally, we give some numerical results to prove the efficiency of the new method.},

We discuss when the sufficient descent condition holds and how it can serve for the convergence of the method.

We use the Stackelberg–Nash strategy with one leader aiming to drive the solution to zero and two followers intended to solve a Nash equilibrium corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem. Since the system is semilinear, the functionals are not convex in general. To overcome this difficulty, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash quasi-equilibrium, which is a weaker formulation of the Nash equilibrium. Next, with additional conditions, we establish the equivalence between the concepts of Nash quasi-equilibrium and Nash equilibrium. We establish a suitable Carleman inequality for the adjoint system and then an observability inequality. Based on this observability inequality, we prove the null controllability of the linearized system. Then, using Kakutani's fixed point Theorem, we demonstrate the null controllability of the main system.},

The considered predator-prey population resides in a two-dimensional habitat and is characterized by intense predatory behavior and costly acquisition of growth-promoting stimuli for the prey. Given that the standard control approach of acting on reaction terms cannot be used in the presence of such characteristics, we lay the ground-work for a new approach allowing to balance the concentrations of predators and prey. Namely, we add a cross-diffusion term to the prey equation, such that the associated time-dependent cross-diffusivity acts as control variable, incorporating various ways to direct prey towards lower concentrations of predators. Based on Schaefer's fixed point theorem and compactness arguments, we establish that the state system admits a unique essentially-bounded positive weak solution. Thereon, by means of an adequate adjoint system, we derive a necessary optimality condition for the optimization problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new-developed control strategy through illustrative numerical examples.},

In addition, many of the constructed filled functions are only for unconstrained optimization problems, and they are unable to solve constrained optimization problems. In this paper, a new filled function is constructed for solving constrained global optimization problems. The new filled function has only one parameter which needs to be adjusted, and, when the objective functions and constrained functions are all continuously differentiable functions, the constructed filled function is also a continuously differentiable function. Then, the classical local optimization methods can be used to find a better minimum of the proposed filled function and a few parameter adjustments are needed. At last, a new filled function algorithm for constrained global optimization is developed based on the proposed filled function. The new algorithm is applied to several test examples.

First, we provide a general algorithm for the conjugate gradient method using Wolfe line search but without imposing an explicit restriction on the conjugate parameter. Later, we study two variants of the algorithm, namely Fletcher-Reeves and conjugate descent, using two different choices of the conjugate parameter but with the same line search rule. In the general algorithm, the direction of movement at each iterate is identified by finding out a descent direction of a vector optimization problem. This vector optimization problem is identified with the help of the concept of partition set at the current iterate. As this vector optimization problem is different at different iterations, the conventional conjugate gradient method for vector optimization cannot be straightly extended to solve the set optimization problem under consideration. The well-definedness of the methods is provided. Further, we prove the Zoutendijk-type condition, which assists in proving the global convergence of the methods even without a regular condition of the stationary points. No convexity assumption is assumed on the objective function to prove the convergence. Lastly, some numerical examples are illustrated to exhibit the performance of the proposed method. We compare the performance of the proposed conjugate gradient methods with the existing steepest descent method. It is found that the proposed method commonly outperforms the existing steepest descent method for set optimization.},

The so-called semistrict C -quasiconvexity notion recovers the classical concept of semistrict quasiconvexity of scalar functions when Y = R and C = R + . Additionally, analogous to the scalar scenario, if the cone C is closed, a vector function is both semistrictly C -quasiconvex and C -quasiconvex (in the sense of Luc, 1989) if and only if it is explicitly C -quasiconvex (in the sense of Popovici, 2007). Finally, we convey a characterization of semistrictly C -quasiconvex functions by means of scalar semistrictly quasiconvex functions that are compositions of the nonlinear scalarization functions introduced by Gerstewitz (Tammer) in 1983 with the initial vector function. In light of this characterization, the new concept of semistrict C -quasiconvexity seems to be a natural vector counterpart for the scalar concept of semistrict quasiconvexity.},

Additionally, various improvements to FISTA have been proposed in the literature. Among them, the convergence rate of a parameterized FISTA (PFISTA) proposed by Liang, Luo and Schonlieb [SIAM J Sci Comput. 2022:44(3):A1069–A1091] is obviously faster than that of the original FISTA, which can reach o ( 1 k 2 ) convergence rate. Building upon the idea of parameterization, we introduce the fully parameterized APFISTA for complete parameterization of the inertia term, aiming to enhance the current situation of partially parameterized inertia terms. We establish the convergence speed of its objective function value and the sequence generated by the algorithm. Finally, we apply the proposed method to solve the least squares problem and linear inverse problems.

We also establish that the optimal trajectory sequence of discrete problems converges to the solution of the optimal control problem ( P ). The idea behind the approximation is based on Euler polygonal arcs and Subbotin's proximal aiming condition, which allows discrete trajectories to break the state constraint, evolve in its neighbourhood and then converge to it instead of staying in the state constraint set for all time.},

Contrary to many existing multiobjective optimization methods, this algorithm works directly with objective functions, without using any kind of a priori chosen parameters or employing any scalarization. Under appropriate assumptions, we discuss convergence to points which satisfy a necessary condition for Pareto optimality. We provide numerical results for a set of nonsmooth convex and nonconvex multiobjective optimization problems in the form of tables, figures and performance profiles.

Reducing the problem into a single-level nonlinear and nonsmooth program, necessary optimality conditions are then developed in terms of Clarke subdifferentials. Our approach consists of using the optimal value reformulation together with a partial calmness condition for the robust counterpart of the initial problem. To aid in the detection of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multipliers, an appropriate nonsmooth Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification is introduced. There are examples highlighting both our results and the limits of certain past studies.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an analysis and comparison of various algorithms applied to different scalarization methods for multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). At first, some theoretical results are provided on the relation between (weakly) efficient solutions of an MOP and optimal solutions of the related numerical method. Moreover, we consider some deficiencies in different scalarization approaches given in the literature and try to fill some gaps in these works. Hence, by considering appropriate limitations, we provide sufficient conditions for ( ε -)properly efficient and ( ε -)efficient solutions of an MOP via scalarization techniques. Then, an algorithm for approximating the Pareto front of MOPs is presented. The main purpose of this algorithm is to generate efficient points on the Pareto front with a uniform distribution. One advantage of this algorithm, compared to some other algorithms, is that in each iteration of the algorithm, more than one efficient point located on the Pareto border can be generated. The new algorithm is implemented by applying the modified Pascoletti–Serafini, the unified direction, and the modified normal boundary intersection scalarization techniques, and then the procedures are considered on different test problems including (non-)convex and discrete Pareto fronts. The capability of the numerical method is shown by comparing the results with the algorithms in the literature. To compare the algorithms, measures of coverage and spacing metric indicators are used.},

These two classes are known to be closely related due to the pioneering work of Dempe and Lohse (2006), and thus have often been discussed together ever since. In this paper, we consider inverse problems for multi-unit assignment valuations. Multi-unit assignment valuations form a subclass of strong-substitutes valuations that can be represented by edge-weighted complete bipartite graphs. These valuations play a key role in auction theory as the strong substitutes condition implies the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium. A recent line of research concentrated on the problem of deciding whether a bivariate valuation function is an assignment valuation or not. In this paper, we consider an inverse variant of the problem: we are given a bivariate function g , and our goal is to find a bivariate multi-unit assignment valuation function f that is as close to g as possible. The difference between f and g can be measured either in ℓ 1 - or ℓ ∞ -norm. Using tools from discrete convex analysis, we show that the problem is strongly NP -hard. On the other hand, we derive linear programming formulations that solve relaxed versions of the problem.},

An efficient algorithm is introduced that finds a bounded-error solution in a finite number of steps. This model captures typical price setting applications, such as network toll setting or electricity tariff optimization for demand response management. The efficiency of the general method is illustrated on demand response management in smart grids. Our computational experiments show that the method solves instances with hundreds of decision variables. The significance of these results is underlined by a proof that the above demand response management problem, and hence, the generic robust bilevel problem as well, are Σ 2 p -complete.

We present a new achievement consisting on the introduction of inertial methods for solving these types of problems. Indeed, two several inertial type methods are suggested: a proximal algorithm and a forward–backward one. Under suitable conditions and without any restrictive assumption on the trajectories, the weak and strong convergence of the sequence generated by the both iterative methods are established. Two particular cases illustrating the proposed methods are thereafter discussed with respect to hierarchical minimization problems and equilibrium problems under a saddle point constraint. Furthermore, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the implementability of our algorithms. The algorithms and their convergence results improve and develop previous results in the field.},

In this paper, we investigate the notion of lower Stackelberg equilibrium, an equilibrium concept arising as a limit point of pessimistic equilibria and of optimistic equilibria of perturbed bilevel problems. First, connections with pessimistic equilibria and optimistic equilibria are obtained in a general setting, together with existence and closure results. Secondly, the problem of finding a lower Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to be stable under general perturbation, differently from what happens for pessimistic and optimistic bilevel problems. Then, moving to the game theory viewpoint, the set of lower Stackelberg equilibria is proved to coincide with the set of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium outcomes of the associated Stackelberg game. These results allow to achieve a comprehensive look on various equilibrium concepts in bilevel optimization and in Stackelberg games as well as to add a new interpretation in terms of game theory to the previous limit results on pessimistic equilibria and optimistic equilibria under perturbation.},

  abstract     = {Support vector classification (SVC) with logistic loss has excellent theoretical properties in classification problems where the label values are not continuous. In this paper, we reformulate the hyperparameter selection for SVC with logistic loss as a bilevel optimization problem in which the upper-level problem and the lower-level problem are both based on logistic loss. The resulting bilevel optimization model is converted to a single-level nonlinear programming (NLP) based on the KKT conditions of the lower-level problem. Such NLP contains a set of nonlinear equality constraints and a simple lower-bound constraint. The second-order sufficient condition is characterized, which guarantees that the strict local optimizers are obtained. To solve such NLP, we apply the smoothing Newton method proposed in [Liang L, Sun D., Toh KC. A squared smoothing Newton method for semidefinite programming, 2023] to solve the KKT conditions, which contain one pair of complementarity constraints. We show that the smoothing Newton method has a superlinear convergence rate. Extensive numerical results verify the efficiency of the proposed approach and strict local minimizers can be achieved both numerically and theoretically. In particular, compared with other methods, our algorithm can achieve competitive results while consuming less time than other methods.},

We suggest a nonsmooth Levenberg–Marquardt method for its solution which, in contrast to the existing literature, does not require local Lipschitzness of the data functions. This is possible when using Newton-differentiability instead of semismoothness as the underlying tool of generalized differentiation. Conditions for local fast convergence of the method are given. Afterwards, in the context of over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity systems, our findings are applied, and globalized solution methods, based on a residual induced by the maximum and the Fischer–Burmeister function, respectively, are constructed. The assumptions for local fast convergence are worked out and compared. Finally, these methods are applied for the numerical solution of bilevel optimization problems. We recall the derivation of a stationarity condition taking the shape of an over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity system involving a penalty parameter, formulate assumptions for local fast convergence of our solution methods explicitly, and present results of numerical experiments. Particularly, we investigate whether the treatment of the appearing penalty parameter as an additional variable is beneficial or not.},

  abstract     = {A popular way for developing optimality conditions of bilevel programs is to express them as (single-level) constrained optimization problems involving optimal value functions of lower programs, in which the computation of first/second-order directional derivatives for the value functions or solution mappings of the lower level problems is a challenging task. This type of directional derivatives based optimality conditions are not suitable for analysing theoretical properties of numerical algorithms for bilevel programs, especially when lower programs are non-convex optimization problems. This paper focuses on bilevel programs whose lower level optimization problems are non-convex. We introduce the concept of bi-local solutions and prove that, under the Jacobian uniqueness conditions on the lower level problem, the bi-local solutions are just the local solutions of the optimization problem constrained by Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions of the lower level problem. Importantly, under suitable conditions, we prove that the KKT constrained optimization problem satisfies the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ). Based on the equivalence of bi-local solutions and local solutions of the KKT constrained optimization problem, we establish the second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the bi-local optimal solutions. Different from second-order optimality conditions in terms of second-order directional derivatives of value functions, the second-order optimality conditions in this paper rely only on the second-order derivatives of the problem functions of the bilevel program. Moreover, the second-order sufficient optimality conditions can be applied for analysing convergence properties of numerical algorithms for the bilevel program.},

In this paper, we study bilevel programmes where the lower level is generalized convex. Applying the equivalent reformulation via Moreau envelope, we derive new directional optimality conditions.

Our approach consists of using a suitable directional generalized convexity, given in terms of directional convexificators, to help us figure out the necessary and sufficient conditions for a point to be an efficient solution to the vector optimization problem. We also investigate the weak versions of the vector variational inequalities and provide several results for determining weak efficient solutions.

In the second phase, a search direction that moves toward optimality is computed by minimizing a local model of the objective function. Importantly, regardless of the feasibility of the original problem, the iterative sequence generated by our proposed method converges to a Fritz-John point of a transformed problem, wherein the constraint violation is minimized.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the large-scale composite optimization problem, which is the sum of a finite number of smooth (possibly nonconvex) functions and a convex (possibly nonsmooth) function. A common method to solve this problem is proximal incremental aggregated gradient (PIAG) method (N. D. Vanli, M. Gurbuzbalaban and A. Ozdaglar, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2018, 28(2): 1282–1300), which exploits the gradient information from previous iterations to approximate the gradient at the current point. However, as many first-order algorithms, it may suffer from slow convergence. To address this issue, this paper proposes an inexact variable metric variant of incremental aggregated Forward-Backward (iVMFB-IAG) method. This methods incorporates a variable metric strategy to accelerate the PIAG method and introduces an inexact criterion to enhance its practicality. Under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property and the uniformly bounded positive definiteness of the scaling matrix, the sequence generated by the iVMFB-IAG method converges globally to the critical point of the problem. Additionally, the convergence rate is established under the KL framework. Moreover, under certain restrictive conditions, the method exhibits local superlinear convergence. Through the numerical experiments on image reconstruction applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the iVMFB-IAG method by restoring two distinct images.},

A weighted second-order cone complementarity problem is to find a pair of vectors ( x , y ) that belong to the intersection of a manifold and a second-order cone such that the product of the vectors in a certain algebra, x ∘ y equals a given weight vector w . It is obvious to see that if w is zero, we get a second-order cone complementarity problem (SOCCP). Thus, (WSOCCP) provides the essential framework for a broader class of problems arising from real applications (science and engineering) more conveniently. This paper demonstrates the Jacobian consistency of the one-parametric class of smoothing functions. Furthermore, we provide an estimation of the distance between the subgradient of the one-parametric class of the weighted SOC complementarity functions and the gradient of its associated smoothing function. This estimation facilitates to adjust an appropriate parameter in smoothing methods.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy-rough set (FRS) has been effectively implemented as a powerful pre-processing tool to cope with the issues such as vagueness, imprecision, noise and uncertainty in high-dimensional data analysis. However, FRS fails to handle the uncertainty due to identification, which is very much common in heterogeneous data. Moreover, it is always challenging to handle different issues such as vagueness, uncertainty, and noise during elimination of irrelevant and redundant features. This paper investigates an intuitionistic fuzzy rough set (IFRS)-aided feature selection method by using information entropy notion to tackle these issues simultaneously. We establish an intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) similarity relation. Then IFRS model is discussed based on this relation. Next, we present a novel IF granular structure. Based on the granular structure, we present lambda -conditional entropy for IF framework. Further, relevant mathematical theorems are proved to justify the theoretical aspect of the models. Moreover, a positive region preserved attribute selection method is proposed. A comprehensive experimental study is discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical validation of the proposed method. Finally, a methodology is developed based on proposed models, which increases accuracy for the minority RNA silencing suppressors against majority class non-suppressors as evident from better sensitivity and G-means metrics.},

This discount is proportional to the total payment done already against the total cost accrued by the retailer. The supplier may also decide to allow the retailer to prepay a random part of the purchasing cost at any random time within the duration that an advance payment is allowed. In order to encourage the customers to increase their orders, the retailer, in turn, offers a trade-credit for a partial amount of the sale price to the customers. In this paper, we focus on the optimal replenishment policies of a retailer that could maximize the retailer's average profit when (s)he is confronted with the supplier's trade offers of credit and price-discount under a two-layer supply chain management in a stochastic environment. We have obtained some theoretical results from the optimum cycle time and optimum order quantity of the proposed model and numerically analysed with a suitable example to demonstrate the real-life applicability of the model. The extended study proposes for maximum average profit, the retailer borrow half amount of purchasing cost from financial support and has to pay at the starting of the advance payment period. Finally, sensitivity analyses are made on the significant parameters in order to gain some managerial insights.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a forward-backward-half forward splitting algorithm with deviations for solving the structured monotone inclusion problem composed of a maximally monotone operator, a maximally monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator and a cocoercive operator. The weak and linear convergence of the proposed algorithms is established. The aim of introducing deviations is to improve the performance of the forward-backward-half forward splitting algorithm through suitable choices of the deviations. A numerical example is given to show that the two-step inertial variant of the forward-backward-half forward splitting algorithms with deviations outperforms the existing methods in Briceño-Arias and Davis [Forward-backward-half forward algorithm for solving monotone inclusions, SIAM J Optimiz, 2017;28(4):2839–2871. doi: 10.1137/17M1120099 ], Zong et al.

  abstract     = {An intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set is an interesting extension of a fuzzy set (FS) that includes more accurate expression of the uncertainty in contrast to conventional FS theory. By considering positive, negative, and hesitancy degree concurrently, IF set appears as an effective notion to deal with the uncertainty included by both the judgement and identification. In this article, we propose an innovative IF rough set (IFRS) framework that integrates IF set and rough set (RS) with the concept of (alpha, beta)-indiscernibility, which incorporates two thresholds to avoid noise. In addition, we utilize the supporting proofs to defend the suggested framework. Thereafter, a feature selection method is presented by using the proposed framework, and an appropriate algorithm is provided to determine the reduct for the high-dimensional datasets. Moreover, a concrete illustration using a sample information system depicts the efficacy of the suggested idea. Then, the proposed method is applied on the benchmark datasets to produce the reduced datasets. Furthermore, performance measures of numerous machine learning techniques are evaluated over these reduced datasets. Finally, a comparative study with the recently discussed fuzzy rough set (FRS) and IFRS-assisted methods is presented to justify the superiority of the established technique.},

The result is well demonstrated with an example. In another two sections we derive a data dependence result and a weak stability result respectively for the problem considered here.

Our method goes beyond the usual assumption of the bifunction's convexity in the second argument, extending the validity of the convergence analysis of proximal point methods for equilibrium problems. For a particular choice of the Bregman function, our method reduces to the traditional proximal point method. At the end, we illustrate our algorithm and convergence result by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents several regularization schemes for data-driven optimization problems. Data-driven optimization is a challenging task because the model or the distribution describing the inherent stochastic disturbance is unknown but instead only a set of data sampled from it can be available. How to explore these data rather than the exact model of the optimization function to aid the optimization analysis becomes increasingly important in the modern big-data era. Empirical risk minimization is usually not satisfactory due to its over-fitting side effect. Regularization is a good option to combat over-fitting. By constructing Cressie–Read divergence-based ambiguity set as well as ratio-deviation based ambiguity set and by employing the distributionally robust optimization approach, a couple of regularization schemes for data-driven problems are proposed. These regularization schemes improve the popular mean-variance regularization which unfortunately leads to non-convex optimization. A linkage is also explored between the proposed regularization schemes and the classical conditional-value-at-risk problem.},

The resolvent operator associated with such a mapping is defined; its Lipschitz continuity is proved and an estimate of its Lipschitz constant is computed under some suitable conditions. At the same time, the problem of finding a common element of the set of fixed points of a given nearly asymptotically nonexpansive mapping and the set of solutions of a variational-like inclusion problem involving A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mappings in the sense of s.i.p.(p) is investigated. To achieve this goal, a new iterative algorithm is constructed. Using the notions of graph convergence and resolvent operator associated with an A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mapping in the sense of s.i.p.(p), a new equivalence relationship between the graph convergence and the resolvent operator convergence of a sequence of A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mappings in the sense of s.i.p.(p) is established. As an application of this equivalence, the strong convergence of the sequence generated by our proposed iterative algorithm to a common point of the above two sets is demonstrated under some suitable assumptions imposed on the parameters.

  abstract     = {Standard approaches to difference-of-convex (DC) programs require exact solution to a convex subproblem at each iteration, which generally requires noiseless computation and infinite iterations of an inner iterative algorithm. To tackle these difficulties, inexact DC algorithms have been proposed, mostly by relaxing the convex subproblem to an approximate monotone inclusion problem. However, there is no guarantee that such relaxation can lead to a finitely terminating inner loop. In this paper, we point out the termination issue of existing inexact DC algorithms by presenting concrete counterexamples. Exploiting the notion of ϵ -subdifferential, we propose a novel inexact proximal linearized DC algorithm termed tPLDCA. Despite permission to a great extent of inexactness in computation, tPLDCA enjoys the same convergence guarantees as exact DC algorithms. Most noticeably, the inner loop of tPLDCA is guaranteed to terminate in finite iterations as long as the inner iterative algorithm converges to a solution of the proximal point subproblem, which makes an essential difference from prior arts. In addition, by assuming the first convex component of the DC function to be pointwise maximum of finitely many convex smooth functions, we propose a computational friendly surrogate of ϵ -subdifferential, whereby we develop a feasible implementation of tPLDCA. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation of tPLDCA.},

These constraints constitute lower bounds on the return profile of the portfolio. In particular, they allow searching for a better portfolio than some reference portfolio by comparing their cumulative distribution functions. Candidate objective functions are the average return, a value at risk, or the average value at risk. The optimization problems obtained are computationally hard because of possibly non-convex constraints and possibly discontinuous objective functions. In the case of a discrete distribution of the return, we develop numerical procedures to solve the problem. The proposed approach uses new exact penalty functions to tackle with the 1st-order stochastic dominance constraints. The resulting penalized objective function is further optimized be the stochastic successive smoothing method as a local optimizer within some branch and bound global optimization scheme. The approach is numerically and graphically illustrated on small portfolio selection problems up to dimension 10.},

We introduce new notions of generalized concavity for set-valued maps and study their properties as well as their relationship with other existing well-known notions. By using the generalized concavity and semi-continuity of set-valued maps, we study the existence of solutions for set-valued equilibrium problems when the equilibrium condition is missing. We further establish sufficient conditions for lower/upper semi-continuity of the solution maps of the set-valued equilibrium problems involving set order relations.

Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm allows different step sizes in the prediction and correction steps, thus enhancing the algorithm's flexibility. Under the generalized monotonicity, we derive the almost sure convergence, the iteration complexity O ( 1 / ϵ ) and the oracle complexity O ( 1 / ϵ 2 ) for our algorithm. Furthermore, under the generalized strong monotonicity and the sample size increases at a geometric rate, the linear convergence rate of the proposed algorithm with respect to the Bregman distance between the iterations and solution is established.

Here we consider a problem where stabilizability or controllability are investigated together with the further aim of a ‘cost regulation’, namely a state-dependent upper bound of the functional. This paper is devoted to a crucial step in the programme of establishing a chain of equivalences among degree-k stabilizability with regulated cost , asymptotic controllability with regulated cost and the existence of a degree-k Minimum Restraint Function (which is a special kind of Control Lyapunov Function). Besides the presence of a cost we allow the stabilizing ‘feedback’ to give rise to directions that range in the union of original directions and the family of iterated Lie bracket of length ≤ k . In the main result asymptotic controllability [resp. with regulated cost] is proved to be necessary for degree- k stabilizability [resp. with regulated cost]. Further steps of the above-mentioned logical chain as, for instance, a Lyapunov-type inverse theorem – i.e. the possibility of deriving existence of a Minimum Restraint Function from stabilizability – are proved in companion papers.},

These problems have been tackled individually in several previous articles through kernel Sum-of-Squares (kSoS) approximations. We propose here a unified theorem to prove convergence guarantees for these schemes. Pointwise inequalities are turned into equalities within a class of nonnegative kSoS functions. Assuming further that the functions appearing in the problem are smooth, focusing on pointwise equality constraints enables the use of scattering inequalities to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in sampling the constraints. Our approach is illustrated in learning vector fields with side information, here the invariance of a set.},

This article presents an efficient numerical framework for dynamic scheduling of multiple VTOLs. It combines a scheduling problem with optimal trajectory planning. The whole setting is formulated as a mixed-integer bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, VTOLs are scheduled, and their starting times are computed. The solution of the lower level problem involves the computation of a value function and yields optimal trajectories for every aerial vehicle. In order to solve the bilevel problem, it is recast into a single-level one. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear program is then piecewise linearized and solved numerically by a mixed-integer linear solver based on the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Numerical results prove the feasibility of the approach proposed herein.},

The existence and uniqueness theorem for such an equation is proved.

An equation of optimality is provided for solving a problem of optimal control. Equilibrium equations are proposed to identify the saddle-point of a two-person zero-sum game problem. As an extension, we generalize the obtained results to the problems subject to differential equations including random matrices, multiple Liu processes, and multiple V - n jumps processes.

In the process of distribution of cold chain products, due to its perishable nature, it is not only necessary to consider the efficiency and economy of transportation, but also to pay attention to risk aversion factors. Therefore, the stochastic programming of cold chain logistics based on risk aversion has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming to minimize the economic cost and transform the carbon emission level of cold chain transportation into carbon emission cost, a distributionally robust mean-conditional value-at-risk optimization model for the perishable goods distribution management problem is established, in which the partial distribution information of uncertain demand and transportation environment temperature was known. Then a computationally tractable equivalence model is obtained under the box ambiguity set. For the proposed nonlinear model, a trust region sequential quadratic programming method with filter is proposed to solve it. Finally, through a case study, the relationship between the stochastic programming model and the distributionally robust model is analysed.},

  abstract     = {The sample average approximation (SAA) and the stochastic approximation (SA) are two popular schemes for solving the stochastic variational inequalities problem (SVIP). In the past decades, theories on the consistency of the SAA solutions and SA solutions have been well studied. More recently, the asymptotic confidence regions of the true solution to SVIP have been constructed when the SAA scheme is implemented. It is of fundamental interest to develop confidence regions of the true solution to the SVIP when the SA scheme is employed. In this paper, we discuss the framework of constructing asymptotic confidence regions for the true solution of SVIP with a focus on stochastic dual average method. We first establish the asymptotic normality of the SA solutions both in ergodic sense and non-ergodic sense. Then the online methods of estimating the covariance matrices in the normal distributions are studied. Finally, practical procedures of building the asymptotic confidence regions of solutions to SVIP with numerical simulations are presented.},

Math Program. 2006;107(1-2):231-273. doi:10.1007/s10107-005-0686-0] makes an effective paradigm to deal with payoff uncertainty and has many applications in decision analysis. The computation of Nash equilibria plays an important role in these applications. Nonetheless, the existing method fails to converge globally and it remains a challenging problem to find such an equilibrium. To meet this challenge, this paper develops a differentiable path-following method to compute Nash equilibria in robust normal-form games when the payoff uncertainty can be characterized as a polytope. Incorporating logarithmic-barrier terms into payoff functions with an extra variable, we constitute a logarithmic-barrier robust normal-form game in which each player solves a strictly convex optimization problem. An application of the optimality conditions together with the equilibrium condition yields a polynomial equilibrium system. With this polynomial equilibrium system, we establish the existence of a smooth path that starts from an arbitrary totally mixed strategy profile and ends at a Nash equilibrium. For the purpose of numerical comparison, we secure one more smooth path from a convex-quadratic-penalty robust normal-form game. Numerical results show that the logarithmic-barrier path-following method significantly outperforms the convex-quadratic-penalty path-following method.},

Utilizing the Lyapunov analysis approach, we prove that all the Lagrangian residual, the objective residual and the feasibility violation enjoy fast convergence under general scaling coefficients. We further analyse the convergence rate results under specific scaling coefficients. Our mixed dynamical system is extended to solve multi-block optimization problems, and we also consider the discrete case of the mixed dynamical system.

  abstract     = {Two-player discrete-time pursuit-evasion games are proposed with control-based strategies on the plane, where each player's position is determined by the discrete-time version of the kinematic equation related to the moving structure of vehicles. In this regard, the first game is built in a one-target fashion where the high-speed pursuer tries to reach the running evader in optimal discrete time, whereas the second game is constructed from a two-target perspective where the evader becomes an attacker whose ultimate aim is to build a control-based strategy to capture the high-speed pursuer who follows the shortest tracking policy within his target region. Each player's winning and losing strategies are designed under certain playability conditions. Later, the main results are generalized for players sharing various discrete-time speeds during the game. The motivation of the study is to investigate the losing and winning strategies of the evader against the high-speed pursuer, who tries to capture his opponent in optimal discrete time on the plane. Numerical experiments are performed on four different unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying at the same altitude with various airspeeds and turning radii, where several capture scenarios and control-based strategies for each UAV are constructed according to the main results.},

  abstract     = {Accelerating the basic gradient iteration is a critical issue in numerical optimization and deep-learning. Recently, William Kahan [Kahan, Automatic Step-Size Control for Minimization Iterations, Technical report, University of California, Berkeley CA, USA, 2019] proposed automatic step-size strategies for the gradient descent iteration without explicitly using any prior information of the Hessian; moreover, a new momentum-based gradient acceleration method, namely, an Anadromic Gradient Descent (AGD) iteration, was proposed. Besides the capability of accelerating the basic gradient descent iteration, AGD enables the iteration to return to the past iterates by just reversing steps in sign and order in the same updating formulation. Numerical performances of the automatic step-size strategies and AGD are claimed to be favourable. In this paper, for the quadratic model, through a revisit of some classical momentum-based gradient methods, we perform new analysis on the convergence and their optimal hyper-parameters. We also investigate the convergence behaviour of AGD with the optimal hyper-parameters and connect one Kahan's automatic step-size scheme with the long Barzilai–Borwein step-size. Numerical results are presented to reflect the theoretical convergence behaviours and demonstrate the practical performances of various momentum-based gradient methods.},

Due to the challenge that this model is neither a semimartingale nor a Markov process, we first introduce the semimartingale approximate optimization problem and present the convergence analysis. We use the classic stochastic control method and continuous-time Markov chain approximation approach to solve the approximate optimization problem respectively. Then the optimal investment strategy and the HJB equation satisfied by the value function are obtained respectively. Furthermore, for the classic stochastic control method, we demonstrate the existence of solutions for the associated partial differential equation via the nonlinear Feynman–Kac formula. For continuous-time Markov chain approximation method, we prove the convergence of the value function. Finally, we provide a numerical analysis to illustrate the above results by using the power utility function. The numerical analysis shows that continuous-time Markov chain approximation method is effective in solving the portfolio optimization problem under rough stochastic local volatility models.},

  abstract     = {Strong (Lagrangian) duality of general conic optimization problems (COPs) has long been studied and its profound and complicated results appear in different forms in a wide range of literatures. As a result, characterizing the known and unknown results can sometimes be difficult. The aim of this article is to provide a unified and geometric overview of strong duality of COPs for the known results, and to explain the essential ideas of the duality results with the simplest geometry. For our framework, we employ a COP minimizing a linear function in a vector variable x subject to a single hyperplane constraint x ∈ H and two cone constraints x ∈ K 1 , x ∈ K 2 . It can be identically reformulated as a simpler COP with the single hyperplane constraint x ∈ H and the single cone constraint x ∈ K 1 ∩ K 2 . This simple COP and its dual as well as their duality relation can be represented geometrically, and they have no duality gap without any constraint qualification. The dual of the original target COP is equivalent to the dual of the reformulated COP if the Minkowski sum of the duals of the two cones K 1 and K 2 is closed or if the dual of the reformulated COP satisfies a certain Slater condition. Thus, these two conditions make it possible to transfer all duality results, including the existence and/or boundedness of optimal solutions, on the reformulated COP to the ones on the original target COP, and further to the ones on a standard primal-dual pair of COPs with symmetry.},

For this purpose, we first convert the original problem into an equivalent problem by introducing some new variables and equivalent variation. Next, by using the two-part approximation and bilinear relaxation, we construct the linear relaxation of the objective function and the constraint function, respectively. Based on the characteristics of the objective functions of the equivalence problem and the relaxation problem and the branch-and-bound structure of the algorithm, we construct some image space region reduction techniques to enhance the convergence speed of the algorithm. By combining the linear relaxation program problem and the image space region reduction techniques, we construct an image space branch-reduction-bound algorithm, prove its global convergence, and estimate its maximum number of iterations in the worst case by analysing the complexity. Finally, numerical results indicate high computational efficiency of the algorithm.},
