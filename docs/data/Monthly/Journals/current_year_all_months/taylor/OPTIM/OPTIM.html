  abstract     = {Inverse and bilevel optimization problems play a central role in both theory and applications. These two classes are known to be closely related due to the pioneering work of Dempe and Lohse (2006), and thus have often been discussed together ever since. In this paper, we consider inverse problems for multi-unit assignment valuations. Multi-unit assignment valuations form a subclass of strong-substitutes valuations that can be represented by edge-weighted complete bipartite graphs. These valuations play a key role in auction theory as the strong substitutes condition implies the existence of a Walrasian equilibrium. A recent line of research concentrated on the problem of deciding whether a bivariate valuation function is an assignment valuation or not. In this paper, we consider an inverse variant of the problem: we are given a bivariate function g , and our goal is to find a bivariate multi-unit assignment valuation function f that is as close to g as possible. The difference between f and g can be measured either in ℓ 1 - or ℓ ∞ -norm. Using tools from discrete convex analysis, we show that the problem is strongly NP -hard. On the other hand, we derive linear programming formulations that solve relaxed versions of the problem.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses robust bilevel optimization with polyhedral uncertainty in the followers' objective function coefficients. It is assumed that both the leader's and the followers' models are linear, yet, bilinear terms in the followers' objective function are allowed. An efficient algorithm is introduced that finds a bounded-error solution in a finite number of steps. This model captures typical price setting applications, such as network toll setting or electricity tariff optimization for demand response management. The efficiency of the general method is illustrated on demand response management in smart grids. Our computational experiments show that the method solves instances with hundreds of decision variables. The significance of these results is underlined by a proof that the above demand response management problem, and hence, the generic robust bilevel problem as well, are Σ 2 p -complete. Finally, the infinitely robust variant of the problem is discussed, and it is shown to be tractable in polynomial time.},

Under suitable conditions and without any restrictive assumption on the trajectories, the weak and strong convergence of the sequence generated by the both iterative methods are established. Two particular cases illustrating the proposed methods are thereafter discussed with respect to hierarchical minimization problems and equilibrium problems under a saddle point constraint.

In this paper, we investigate the notion of lower Stackelberg equilibrium, an equilibrium concept arising as a limit point of pessimistic equilibria and of optimistic equilibria of perturbed bilevel problems. First, connections with pessimistic equilibria and optimistic equilibria are obtained in a general setting, together with existence and closure results. Secondly, the problem of finding a lower Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to be stable under general perturbation, differently from what happens for pessimistic and optimistic bilevel problems. Then, moving to the game theory viewpoint, the set of lower Stackelberg equilibria is proved to coincide with the set of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium outcomes of the associated Stackelberg game. These results allow to achieve a comprehensive look on various equilibrium concepts in bilevel optimization and in Stackelberg games as well as to add a new interpretation in terms of game theory to the previous limit results on pessimistic equilibria and optimistic equilibria under perturbation.},

  abstract     = {Support vector classification (SVC) with logistic loss has excellent theoretical properties in classification problems where the label values are not continuous. In this paper, we reformulate the hyperparameter selection for SVC with logistic loss as a bilevel optimization problem in which the upper-level problem and the lower-level problem are both based on logistic loss. The resulting bilevel optimization model is converted to a single-level nonlinear programming (NLP) based on the KKT conditions of the lower-level problem. Such NLP contains a set of nonlinear equality constraints and a simple lower-bound constraint. The second-order sufficient condition is characterized, which guarantees that the strict local optimizers are obtained. To solve such NLP, we apply the smoothing Newton method proposed in [Liang L, Sun D., Toh KC. A squared smoothing Newton method for semidefinite programming, 2023] to solve the KKT conditions, which contain one pair of complementarity constraints. We show that the smoothing Newton method has a superlinear convergence rate. Extensive numerical results verify the efficiency of the proposed approach and strict local minimizers can be achieved both numerically and theoretically. In particular, compared with other methods, our algorithm can achieve competitive results while consuming less time than other methods.},

We suggest a nonsmooth Levenberg–Marquardt method for its solution which, in contrast to the existing literature, does not require local Lipschitzness of the data functions. This is possible when using Newton-differentiability instead of semismoothness as the underlying tool of generalized differentiation. Conditions for local fast convergence of the method are given. Afterwards, in the context of over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity systems, our findings are applied, and globalized solution methods, based on a residual induced by the maximum and the Fischer–Burmeister function, respectively, are constructed. The assumptions for local fast convergence are worked out and compared. Finally, these methods are applied for the numerical solution of bilevel optimization problems. We recall the derivation of a stationarity condition taking the shape of an over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity system involving a penalty parameter, formulate assumptions for local fast convergence of our solution methods explicitly, and present results of numerical experiments. Particularly, we investigate whether the treatment of the appearing penalty parameter as an additional variable is beneficial or not.},

  abstract     = {A popular way for developing optimality conditions of bilevel programs is to express them as (single-level) constrained optimization problems involving optimal value functions of lower programs, in which the computation of first/second-order directional derivatives for the value functions or solution mappings of the lower level problems is a challenging task. This type of directional derivatives based optimality conditions are not suitable for analysing theoretical properties of numerical algorithms for bilevel programs, especially when lower programs are non-convex optimization problems. This paper focuses on bilevel programs whose lower level optimization problems are non-convex. We introduce the concept of bi-local solutions and prove that, under the Jacobian uniqueness conditions on the lower level problem, the bi-local solutions are just the local solutions of the optimization problem constrained by Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions of the lower level problem. Importantly, under suitable conditions, we prove that the KKT constrained optimization problem satisfies the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ). Based on the equivalence of bi-local solutions and local solutions of the KKT constrained optimization problem, we establish the second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the bi-local optimal solutions. Different from second-order optimality conditions in terms of second-order directional derivatives of value functions, the second-order optimality conditions in this paper rely only on the second-order derivatives of the problem functions of the bilevel program. Moreover, the second-order sufficient optimality conditions can be applied for analysing convergence properties of numerical algorithms for the bilevel program.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the study of novel constructions of variational analysis and generalized differentiation that are appropriate for characterizing robust stability properties of constrained set-valued mappings/multifunctions between Banach spaces important in optimization theory and its applications. Our tools of generalized differentiation revolve around the newly introduced concept of ε -regular normal cone to sets and associated coderivative notions for set-valued mappings. Based on these constructions, we establish several characterizations of the central stability notion known as the relative Lipschitz-like property of set-valued mappings in infinite dimensions. Applying a new version of the constrained extremal principle of variational analysis, we develop comprehensive sum and chain rules for our major constructions of conic contingent coderivatives for multifunctions between appropriate classes of Banach spaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the large-scale composite optimization problem, which is the sum of a finite number of smooth (possibly nonconvex) functions and a convex (possibly nonsmooth) function. A common method to solve this problem is proximal incremental aggregated gradient (PIAG) method (N. D. Vanli, M. Gurbuzbalaban and A. Ozdaglar, SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2018, 28(2): 1282–1300), which exploits the gradient information from previous iterations to approximate the gradient at the current point. However, as many first-order algorithms, it may suffer from slow convergence. To address this issue, this paper proposes an inexact variable metric variant of incremental aggregated Forward-Backward (iVMFB-IAG) method. This methods incorporates a variable metric strategy to accelerate the PIAG method and introduces an inexact criterion to enhance its practicality. Under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property and the uniformly bounded positive definiteness of the scaling matrix, the sequence generated by the iVMFB-IAG method converges globally to the critical point of the problem. Additionally, the convergence rate is established under the KL framework. Moreover, under certain restrictive conditions, the method exhibits local superlinear convergence. Through the numerical experiments on image reconstruction applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the iVMFB-IAG method by restoring two distinct images.},

A weighted second-order cone complementarity problem is to find a pair of vectors ( x , y ) that belong to the intersection of a manifold and a second-order cone such that the product of the vectors in a certain algebra, x ∘ y equals a given weight vector w . It is obvious to see that if w is zero, we get a second-order cone complementarity problem (SOCCP). Thus, (WSOCCP) provides the essential framework for a broader class of problems arising from real applications (science and engineering) more conveniently. This paper demonstrates the Jacobian consistency of the one-parametric class of smoothing functions. Furthermore, we provide an estimation of the distance between the subgradient of the one-parametric class of the weighted SOC complementarity functions and the gradient of its associated smoothing function. This estimation facilitates to adjust an appropriate parameter in smoothing methods.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy-rough set (FRS) has been effectively implemented as a powerful pre-processing tool to cope with the issues such as vagueness, imprecision, noise and uncertainty in high-dimensional data analysis. However, FRS fails to handle the uncertainty due to identification, which is very much common in heterogeneous data. Moreover, it is always challenging to handle different issues such as vagueness, uncertainty, and noise during elimination of irrelevant and redundant features. This paper investigates an intuitionistic fuzzy rough set (IFRS)-aided feature selection method by using information entropy notion to tackle these issues simultaneously. We establish an intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) similarity relation. Then IFRS model is discussed based on this relation. Next, we present a novel IF granular structure. Based on the granular structure, we present lambda -conditional entropy for IF framework. Further, relevant mathematical theorems are proved to justify the theoretical aspect of the models. Moreover, a positive region preserved attribute selection method is proposed. A comprehensive experimental study is discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical validation of the proposed method. Finally, a methodology is developed based on proposed models, which increases accuracy for the minority RNA silencing suppressors against majority class non-suppressors as evident from better sensitivity and G-means metrics.},

This manuscript investigates the connections between properties (HS) and HLUR with other convexity properties. Additionally, examples in Banach spaces demonstrate the incomparability between HLUR and CLUR Banach spaces. We also discover the relations between these convexity properties that impose the optimality constraints, such as generalized well-posedness. We connect the notion of generalized well-posedness to rotundity properties. We also study the continuity of the pre-duality mappings concerning Banach spaces with the property (HS).},

  abstract     = {Suppliers often offer item-wise price discounts and trade credit to their retailers after receiving an initial payment for the supplied product. This discount is proportional to the total payment done already against the total cost accrued by the retailer. The supplier may also decide to allow the retailer to prepay a random part of the purchasing cost at any random time within the duration that an advance payment is allowed. In order to encourage the customers to increase their orders, the retailer, in turn, offers a trade-credit for a partial amount of the sale price to the customers. In this paper, we focus on the optimal replenishment policies of a retailer that could maximize the retailer's average profit when (s)he is confronted with the supplier's trade offers of credit and price-discount under a two-layer supply chain management in a stochastic environment. We have obtained some theoretical results from the optimum cycle time and optimum order quantity of the proposed model and numerically analysed with a suitable example to demonstrate the real-life applicability of the model. The extended study proposes for maximum average profit, the retailer borrow half amount of purchasing cost from financial support and has to pay at the starting of the advance payment period. Finally, sensitivity analyses are made on the significant parameters in order to gain some managerial insights.},

  abstract     = {An intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set is an interesting extension of a fuzzy set (FS) that includes more accurate expression of the uncertainty in contrast to conventional FS theory. By considering positive, negative, and hesitancy degree concurrently, IF set appears as an effective notion to deal with the uncertainty included by both the judgement and identification. In this article, we propose an innovative IF rough set (IFRS) framework that integrates IF set and rough set (RS) with the concept of (alpha, beta)-indiscernibility, which incorporates two thresholds to avoid noise. In addition, we utilize the supporting proofs to defend the suggested framework. Thereafter, a feature selection method is presented by using the proposed framework, and an appropriate algorithm is provided to determine the reduct for the high-dimensional datasets. Moreover, a concrete illustration using a sample information system depicts the efficacy of the suggested idea. Then, the proposed method is applied on the benchmark datasets to produce the reduced datasets. Furthermore, performance measures of numerous machine learning techniques are evaluated over these reduced datasets. Finally, a comparative study with the recently discussed fuzzy rough set (FRS) and IFRS-assisted methods is presented to justify the superiority of the established technique.},

The result is well demonstrated with an example. In another two sections we derive a data dependence result and a weak stability result respectively for the problem considered here. For our purpose we define a notion of weak stability of the solution sets. The study is in the framework of metric spaces and broadly falls within the domain of set-valued optimization.},

Our method goes beyond the usual assumption of the bifunction's convexity in the second argument, extending the validity of the convergence analysis of proximal point methods for equilibrium problems. For a particular choice of the Bregman function, our method reduces to the traditional proximal point method. At the end, we illustrate our algorithm and convergence result by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents several regularization schemes for data-driven optimization problems. Data-driven optimization is a challenging task because the model or the distribution describing the inherent stochastic disturbance is unknown but instead only a set of data sampled from it can be available. How to explore these data rather than the exact model of the optimization function to aid the optimization analysis becomes increasingly important in the modern big-data era. Empirical risk minimization is usually not satisfactory due to its over-fitting side effect. Regularization is a good option to combat over-fitting. By constructing Cressie–Read divergence-based ambiguity set as well as ratio-deviation based ambiguity set and by employing the distributionally robust optimization approach, a couple of regularization schemes for data-driven problems are proposed. These regularization schemes improve the popular mean-variance regularization which unfortunately leads to non-convex optimization. A linkage is also explored between the proposed regularization schemes and the classical conditional-value-at-risk problem.},

Nontrivial local solutions are defined and characterized with the help of a necessary optimality condition in DC programming and the special structure of the problem in question. Since most of the existing solution algorithms for this problem just give some local solutions, our characterizations can be used to analyse and refine these algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the introduction of a new class of accretive mappings in the framework of q -uniformly smooth Banach spaces called A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mappings in the sense of semi-inner product of type (p) (for short, s.i.p.(p)). The resolvent operator associated with such a mapping is defined; its Lipschitz continuity is proved and an estimate of its Lipschitz constant is computed under some suitable conditions. At the same time, the problem of finding a common element of the set of fixed points of a given nearly asymptotically nonexpansive mapping and the set of solutions of a variational-like inclusion problem involving A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mappings in the sense of s.i.p.(p) is investigated. To achieve this goal, a new iterative algorithm is constructed. Using the notions of graph convergence and resolvent operator associated with an A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mapping in the sense of s.i.p.(p), a new equivalence relationship between the graph convergence and the resolvent operator convergence of a sequence of A -maximal m -relaxed η -accretive mappings in the sense of s.i.p.(p) is established. As an application of this equivalence, the strong convergence of the sequence generated by our proposed iterative algorithm to a common point of the above two sets is demonstrated under some suitable assumptions imposed on the parameters. The results presented in this paper unify, improve and generalize some recent works in this field.},

We take advantage of the convexity of the objective function to efficiently find the optimal solution in O ( nlog ⁡ n ) time, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. For the problem under the centdian cost function, we parameterize it based on the maximum cost item and prove that the induced cost function is convex.

  abstract     = {Standard approaches to difference-of-convex (DC) programs require exact solution to a convex subproblem at each iteration, which generally requires noiseless computation and infinite iterations of an inner iterative algorithm. To tackle these difficulties, inexact DC algorithms have been proposed, mostly by relaxing the convex subproblem to an approximate monotone inclusion problem. However, there is no guarantee that such relaxation can lead to a finitely terminating inner loop. In this paper, we point out the termination issue of existing inexact DC algorithms by presenting concrete counterexamples. Exploiting the notion of ϵ -subdifferential, we propose a novel inexact proximal linearized DC algorithm termed tPLDCA. Despite permission to a great extent of inexactness in computation, tPLDCA enjoys the same convergence guarantees as exact DC algorithms. Most noticeably, the inner loop of tPLDCA is guaranteed to terminate in finite iterations as long as the inner iterative algorithm converges to a solution of the proximal point subproblem, which makes an essential difference from prior arts. In addition, by assuming the first convex component of the DC function to be pointwise maximum of finitely many convex smooth functions, we propose a computational friendly surrogate of ϵ -subdifferential, whereby we develop a feasible implementation of tPLDCA. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation of tPLDCA.},

  abstract     = {The paper studies a financial portfolio selection problem under 1st-order stochastic dominance constraints. These constraints constitute lower bounds on the return profile of the portfolio. In particular, they allow searching for a better portfolio than some reference portfolio by comparing their cumulative distribution functions. Candidate objective functions are the average return, a value at risk, or the average value at risk. The optimization problems obtained are computationally hard because of possibly non-convex constraints and possibly discontinuous objective functions. In the case of a discrete distribution of the return, we develop numerical procedures to solve the problem. The proposed approach uses new exact penalty functions to tackle with the 1st-order stochastic dominance constraints. The resulting penalized objective function is further optimized be the stochastic successive smoothing method as a local optimizer within some branch and bound global optimization scheme. The approach is numerically and graphically illustrated on small portfolio selection problems up to dimension 10.},

We derive an analogue of it guaranteeing the almost openness with a linear rate of mappings acting in incomplete spaces and having non-closed graphs, in general. The main tool used is an approximate version of Ekeland's variational principle for a function that is not necessarily lower semi-continuous and is defined on an abstract (possibly incomplete) space.

Under the generalized monotonicity, we derive the almost sure convergence, the iteration complexity O ( 1 / ϵ ) and the oracle complexity O ( 1 / ϵ 2 ) for our algorithm. Furthermore, under the generalized strong monotonicity and the sample size increases at a geometric rate, the linear convergence rate of the proposed algorithm with respect to the Bregman distance between the iterations and solution is established.

Here we consider a problem where stabilizability or controllability are investigated together with the further aim of a ‘cost regulation’, namely a state-dependent upper bound of the functional. This paper is devoted to a crucial step in the programme of establishing a chain of equivalences among degree-k stabilizability with regulated cost , asymptotic controllability with regulated cost and the existence of a degree-k Minimum Restraint Function (which is a special kind of Control Lyapunov Function). Besides the presence of a cost we allow the stabilizing ‘feedback’ to give rise to directions that range in the union of original directions and the family of iterated Lie bracket of length ≤ k . In the main result asymptotic controllability [resp. with regulated cost] is proved to be necessary for degree- k stabilizability [resp. with regulated cost]. Further steps of the above-mentioned logical chain as, for instance, a Lyapunov-type inverse theorem – i.e. the possibility of deriving existence of a Minimum Restraint Function from stabilizability – are proved in companion papers.},

These problems have been tackled individually in several previous articles through kernel Sum-of-Squares (kSoS) approximations. We propose here a unified theorem to prove convergence guarantees for these schemes. Pointwise inequalities are turned into equalities within a class of nonnegative kSoS functions. Assuming further that the functions appearing in the problem are smooth, focusing on pointwise equality constraints enables the use of scattering inequalities to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in sampling the constraints.

We prove that the existence of a Slater point which lies strictly between the pointwise bounds and which satisfies the linear constraints is sufficient for the existence of Lagrange multipliers. Surprisingly, the Slater point is also necessary for the existence of Lagrange multipliers in a certain sense. We also demonstrate how to handle additional finitely many nonlinear constraints.},

  abstract     = {Modern vertical take-off and landing vehicles (VTOLs) could significantly affect the future of mobility. The broad range of their application fields encompasses urban air mobility, transportation and logistics as well as reconnaissance and observation missions in a military context. This article presents an efficient numerical framework for dynamic scheduling of multiple VTOLs. It combines a scheduling problem with optimal trajectory planning. The whole setting is formulated as a mixed-integer bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, VTOLs are scheduled, and their starting times are computed. The solution of the lower level problem involves the computation of a value function and yields optimal trajectories for every aerial vehicle. In order to solve the bilevel problem, it is recast into a single-level one. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear program is then piecewise linearized and solved numerically by a mixed-integer linear solver based on the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Numerical results prove the feasibility of the approach proposed herein.},

An equation of optimality is provided for solving a problem of optimal control. Equilibrium equations are proposed to identify the saddle-point of a two-person zero-sum game problem.

In the process of distribution of cold chain products, due to its perishable nature, it is not only necessary to consider the efficiency and economy of transportation, but also to pay attention to risk aversion factors. Therefore, the stochastic programming of cold chain logistics based on risk aversion has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming to minimize the economic cost and transform the carbon emission level of cold chain transportation into carbon emission cost, a distributionally robust mean-conditional value-at-risk optimization model for the perishable goods distribution management problem is established, in which the partial distribution information of uncertain demand and transportation environment temperature was known. Then a computationally tractable equivalence model is obtained under the box ambiguity set. For the proposed nonlinear model, a trust region sequential quadratic programming method with filter is proposed to solve it. Finally, through a case study, the relationship between the stochastic programming model and the distributionally robust model is analysed.},

  abstract     = {Just recently M. Aslantas [A new contribution to best proximity point theory on quasi metric spaces and an application to nonlinear integral equations. Optimization. 2022] established a new best proximity point theorem multivalued non-self mappings which satisfy an appropriate contractive condition in the framework of quasi metric spaces. Then he applied the existing result to present an application to the solvability of a class of nonlinear integral equations. In this short note, we show that the best proximity point theorem proved in the aforesaid article is a special case of a fixed point theorem for multivalued contraction type mappings which was studied by J. Marin et al. [ Q -functions on quasimetric spaces and fixed points for multivalued maps. Fixed Point Theory Appl. 2011:Article ID 603861].},

  abstract     = {The sample average approximation (SAA) and the stochastic approximation (SA) are two popular schemes for solving the stochastic variational inequalities problem (SVIP). In the past decades, theories on the consistency of the SAA solutions and SA solutions have been well studied. More recently, the asymptotic confidence regions of the true solution to SVIP have been constructed when the SAA scheme is implemented. It is of fundamental interest to develop confidence regions of the true solution to the SVIP when the SA scheme is employed. In this paper, we discuss the framework of constructing asymptotic confidence regions for the true solution of SVIP with a focus on stochastic dual average method. We first establish the asymptotic normality of the SA solutions both in ergodic sense and non-ergodic sense. Then the online methods of estimating the covariance matrices in the normal distributions are studied. Finally, practical procedures of building the asymptotic confidence regions of solutions to SVIP with numerical simulations are presented.},

Math Program. 2006;107(1-2):231-273. doi:10.1007/s10107-005-0686-0] makes an effective paradigm to deal with payoff uncertainty and has many applications in decision analysis. The computation of Nash equilibria plays an important role in these applications. Nonetheless, the existing method fails to converge globally and it remains a challenging problem to find such an equilibrium. To meet this challenge, this paper develops a differentiable path-following method to compute Nash equilibria in robust normal-form games when the payoff uncertainty can be characterized as a polytope. Incorporating logarithmic-barrier terms into payoff functions with an extra variable, we constitute a logarithmic-barrier robust normal-form game in which each player solves a strictly convex optimization problem. An application of the optimality conditions together with the equilibrium condition yields a polynomial equilibrium system. With this polynomial equilibrium system, we establish the existence of a smooth path that starts from an arbitrary totally mixed strategy profile and ends at a Nash equilibrium. For the purpose of numerical comparison, we secure one more smooth path from a convex-quadratic-penalty robust normal-form game. Numerical results show that the logarithmic-barrier path-following method significantly outperforms the convex-quadratic-penalty path-following method.},

This dynamical system comprises a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with α / t damping and Hessian driven damping for the primal variable, and a first-order ODE for the dual variable. Utilizing the Lyapunov analysis approach, we prove that all the Lagrangian residual, the objective residual and the feasibility violation enjoy fast convergence under general scaling coefficients. We further analyse the convergence rate results under specific scaling coefficients. Our mixed dynamical system is extended to solve multi-block optimization problems, and we also consider the discrete case of the mixed dynamical system.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the existence and optimal control of quasi-hemivariational inequalities by a method different from the one based on Minty's technique. We use an approach similar to the Galerkin method based on a minimax inequality formulation associated with the Brézis pseudomonotonicity notion of multi-valued operators, an implicit Browder–Tikhonov regularization method and a fixed point theorem. This leads us to avoid any kind of monotonicity-type conditions used in recent papers to obtain the convexity of the solution set of the variational selections. We provide applications to the optimal control of implicit obstacle problems of fractional Laplacian type involving a generalized gradient operator, and to the optimal control of contact problems for elastic locking materials. Our approach improves some recent results in the literature.},

At each iteration, a new point is generated in a subspace generated by the previous points. Of all finite points forming the subspace, a point with the largest residual norm is replaced by the new point to update the subspace. In this way, SILSA leaves regions far from the solution of NME and approaches regions near it, leading to a fast convergence to the solution. This study analyzes global convergence and complexity upper bounds on the number of iterations and the number of function evaluations required for SILSA .

  abstract     = {Two-player discrete-time pursuit-evasion games are proposed with control-based strategies on the plane, where each player's position is determined by the discrete-time version of the kinematic equation related to the moving structure of vehicles. In this regard, the first game is built in a one-target fashion where the high-speed pursuer tries to reach the running evader in optimal discrete time, whereas the second game is constructed from a two-target perspective where the evader becomes an attacker whose ultimate aim is to build a control-based strategy to capture the high-speed pursuer who follows the shortest tracking policy within his target region. Each player's winning and losing strategies are designed under certain playability conditions. Later, the main results are generalized for players sharing various discrete-time speeds during the game. The motivation of the study is to investigate the losing and winning strategies of the evader against the high-speed pursuer, who tries to capture his opponent in optimal discrete time on the plane. Numerical experiments are performed on four different unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying at the same altitude with various airspeeds and turning radii, where several capture scenarios and control-based strategies for each UAV are constructed according to the main results.},

  abstract     = {Accelerating the basic gradient iteration is a critical issue in numerical optimization and deep-learning. Recently, William Kahan [Kahan, Automatic Step-Size Control for Minimization Iterations, Technical report, University of California, Berkeley CA, USA, 2019] proposed automatic step-size strategies for the gradient descent iteration without explicitly using any prior information of the Hessian; moreover, a new momentum-based gradient acceleration method, namely, an Anadromic Gradient Descent (AGD) iteration, was proposed. Besides the capability of accelerating the basic gradient descent iteration, AGD enables the iteration to return to the past iterates by just reversing steps in sign and order in the same updating formulation. Numerical performances of the automatic step-size strategies and AGD are claimed to be favourable. In this paper, for the quadratic model, through a revisit of some classical momentum-based gradient methods, we perform new analysis on the convergence and their optimal hyper-parameters. We also investigate the convergence behaviour of AGD with the optimal hyper-parameters and connect one Kahan's automatic step-size scheme with the long Barzilai–Borwein step-size. Numerical results are presented to reflect the theoretical convergence behaviours and demonstrate the practical performances of various momentum-based gradient methods.},

We use the classic stochastic control method and continuous-time Markov chain approximation approach to solve the approximate optimization problem respectively. Then the optimal investment strategy and the HJB equation satisfied by the value function are obtained respectively. Furthermore, for the classic stochastic control method, we demonstrate the existence of solutions for the associated partial differential equation via the nonlinear Feynman–Kac formula. For continuous-time Markov chain approximation method, we prove the convergence of the value function. Finally, we provide a numerical analysis to illustrate the above results by using the power utility function. The numerical analysis shows that continuous-time Markov chain approximation method is effective in solving the portfolio optimization problem under rough stochastic local volatility models.},

  abstract     = {Strong (Lagrangian) duality of general conic optimization problems (COPs) has long been studied and its profound and complicated results appear in different forms in a wide range of literatures. As a result, characterizing the known and unknown results can sometimes be difficult. The aim of this article is to provide a unified and geometric overview of strong duality of COPs for the known results, and to explain the essential ideas of the duality results with the simplest geometry. For our framework, we employ a COP minimizing a linear function in a vector variable x subject to a single hyperplane constraint x ∈ H and two cone constraints x ∈ K 1 , x ∈ K 2 . It can be identically reformulated as a simpler COP with the single hyperplane constraint x ∈ H and the single cone constraint x ∈ K 1 ∩ K 2 . This simple COP and its dual as well as their duality relation can be represented geometrically, and they have no duality gap without any constraint qualification. The dual of the original target COP is equivalent to the dual of the reformulated COP if the Minkowski sum of the duals of the two cones K 1 and K 2 is closed or if the dual of the reformulated COP satisfies a certain Slater condition. Thus, these two conditions make it possible to transfer all duality results, including the existence and/or boundedness of optimal solutions, on the reformulated COP to the ones on the original target COP, and further to the ones on a standard primal-dual pair of COPs with symmetry.},
