  abstract     = {Jungle cats ( Felis chaus ) are one of the least studied felids with a widespread presence throughout the southern districts of West Bengal. During a survey through camera traps to document fishing cats ( Prionailurus viverrinus ), we recorded bycatch data of camera trap captured images of Jungle cats with their prey. Although the diet of Jungle cats has been extensively studied using genetic methods globally, this paper presents evidence of its prey items through camera trap data. We obtained 196 independent images of Jungle cats, with 31 showing them with prey. Our data indicates that rodents are its primary prey. The images also reveal that Jungle cats’ prey on domestic duck and other birds. We recommend organizing awareness camps among locals to reduce retaliation and ensure the safe coexistence of jungle cats in human settlement areas.},

  abstract     = {Predation is one of the most powerful selective forces driving evolution among animals, and one common form of defense against it is aposematism. The Mutillidae (Hymenoptera Aculeata), commonly known as velvet ants, are solitary parasitoid wasps that exhibit a range of colors, including shades of white, yellow, orange-red, and black. In some Hymenoptera, a distinct color pattern consisting of a black head, an orange or red mesosoma, and a black metasoma – referred to as the Black-Orange-Black (BOB) pattern – may function as an aposematic signal to deter predators, particularly in smaller species. To investigate the presence of this pattern in Mutillidae and its potential association with body size, we tested the hypothesis that the BOB pattern is more prevalent in smaller species. The total body length of the individuals was measured in millimeters (mm), and they were categorized as either displaying the BOB pattern or not (non-BOB, NBOB). A total of 448 individuals from various genera were analyzed, of which 79 exhibited the BOB pattern. The BOB pattern was more frequently observed among individuals measuring between 4.5 and 7.5 mm in body size, indicating that these individuals tended to be smaller compared to those with the NBOB pattern. A significant difference in body size was detected between the two patterns. These findings suggest that aposematism may serve as an effective defensive strategy, particularly concentrated in smaller body sizes, within this group already recognized for its diverse array of anti-predator adaptations.},

  abstract     = {Mimicry, particularly chromatic adaptation, is a defining characteristic of leaf and stick insects, which comprise phasmids (Insecta Phasmatodea). This study investigates substrate-induced color changes in three phasmid species: Extatosoma tiaratum, Hesperophasma sp. “La Ciénaga”, and Phyllium gantungense “Rizal”. For each species, two experimental groups were exposed to a grey-green lichen ( Evernia prunastri ) as a substrate, while two cages were set up with an artificial pink material. Control groups were reared on elmleaf blackberry ( Rubus ulmifolius ) alone; all groups were composed of at least 20 individuals. Using digital pictures, the RGB color channels of juveniles and adults were analyzed to quantify color variations. We revealed significant species-specific variations in color development responses related to substrates. In E. tiaratum , we did not observe a significant difference between adults reared over different substrates. However, digital image analyses revealed that E. tiaratum exhibited significant chromatic changes during development, especially among 11 juvenile females, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition for substrate-specific color adaptation. In the species P. gantungense , we did not find color changes during the experiment, indicating a lack of phenotypic plasticity in response to substrate variation. Hesperophasma sp. “La Ciénaga” showed minimal color changes; however, untreated juveniles naturally darkened as they matured, a trend that was inhibited in substrate-treated groups, indicating a potential influence of the substrate on natural color development. These findings highlight the species-specific nature of substrate-induced color variation in stick insects. Investigating the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying these changes is essential for understanding the evolutionary dynamics and ecological adaptations of these insects. Further research in this area could reveal insights into the broader implications of phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaptation in phasmids.},

  abstract     = {Human disturbances are being increasingly recognized for their impact on the behavior of urban wildlife during the Anthropocene. This study was conducted to gain insights into the changes in population density of House sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) to different degrees of human disturbance during various stages of COVID-19. A “disturbance score” was computed by considering four variables: human movement, number of vehicles plying, number of shops opened, and ambient noise level. Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was used to understand the influence of the disturbance variables on the House sparrows’ density among different phases of lockdown and across different sites. Our findings revealed that the second COVID wave exhibited the highest population density (number/ha) at 4.64 ± 0.941, followed by the first wave at 3.73 ± 1.21. In addition, our results suggest that lockdown phases and disturbance variables significantly influenced the sparrow population density. Furthermore, there were notable variations in sparrow population densities across the different lockdown phases. Similarly, the disturbance variables seem to influence the sparrow population density across the lockdown phases, except for the before-lockdown and first-wave lockdowns, possibly indicating a lag in the sparrows’ adaptive response to the changing urban environment. The findings have unveiled a significant pattern in the behavioral responses of sparrows to human disruptions. The decline in the presence of sparrows in areas with higher anthropogenic disturbances, following the relaxation of lockdown regulations indicates a potential shift of these birds to quieter sites. The capacity of sparrows to adjust their behavior has enabled them to take advantage of decreased disruptions, which could impact their documented population density. Thus, this study emphasizes the need to incorporate wildlife behavioral responses to human disturbances into urban planning and management strategies.},

The Aphidiinae subfamily, particularly Aphidius platensis , plays an important role as a parasitoid in controlling cereal aphids. There is a lack of information on the behavioral aspects associated with aphids and parasitoids, along with their influence on parasitism rates. This study aimed to observe the apterous adult’s behavior of Rhopalosiphum padi , Schizaphis graminum , Metopolophium dirhodum , and Sitobion avenae and its parasitoid ( Aphidius platensis ) when exposed to each other and evaluate how these interactions reflect on parasitism rates. The behaviors were recorded (5 min) and analyzed using BORIS software. Parasitism rates were assessed by examining the presence of larvae and mummies. Schizaphis graminum was the highest recognized and accepted aphid species by A. platensis , with 95% of parasitism, followed by R. padi (68.3%), despite its ability to escape (walking), and S. avenae (13.2%), despite its kick behavior. Metopolophium dirhodum , with minimal kicking, was not parasitized. Our results showed that the parasitoid tends to be more aggressive (mainly probing and parasitizing) toward the host with which it has greatest parasitism ( S. graminum ). Aphid defensive behaviors were not sufficient to defend themselves, as parasitoid attacks were similar in those that walked and kicked more often. We observed that the parasitoid A. platensis behaved similarly on suitable and unsuitable hosts. This finding provides new information that can contribute to a better understanding of host–parasitoid interactions, which has implications for biological control strategies targeting aphids in winter cereals.},

  abstract     = {In many organisms, changes in environmental conditions trigger modifications in physiology and signaling for reproduction. In males, sexual maturation often prompts signaling that can convey information on fighting ability and mate quality, allowing adaptative sexual selection to act. Because predation can drive the evolution of sexual signals, insights from organisms exposed to low predation pressure will benefit sexual selection theory. Here, we exposed males and females of Microsternarchus sp. nov. “Ducke” (Gymnotiformes Hypopomidae) to simulate environmental conditions of the breeding season to investigate changes in electric signaling in a species that occurs in environments with low or absent predation pressure from electroreceptive predators. We induced sexual maturation, which was confirmed by visual inspection of female gonads. After sexual maturation, both sexes underwent major changes in Electric Organ Discharges (EOD), suggesting mutual signaling in electric communication before breeding pair formation. EOD parameters related to body length were intensified in sexually mature males and, as such, changes in male electric discharges observed after gonadal maturation exaggerate information on fighting ability and mate quality, as suggested for other electric fishes. Because polarity imbalance was high in both sexes and reproductive stages, our results support the hypothesis that predation pressure did not constrain the evolution of conspicuous EODs in this species, in favor of other adaptive mechanisms of mate choice.},

  abstract     = {Severe environments, characterized by high temperatures and scarce rainfall, challenge organisms and may lead them to display behavioral adaptations to live in such areas. While there is a significant amount of research on behavioral adaptations to severe environments on land, aquatic habitats remain relatively understudied. In this study, we selected a population of Sylviocarcinus pictus crabs from the semiarid region of Brazil to investigate, describe, and quantify the behavioral repertoire of adult crabs in a laboratory setting. In the laboratory, we filmed ( n = 10) adult crabs individually (five males and five females), for 72 consecutive hours. Subsequently, we analyzed and recorded their behaviors every 20 min, totaling ( n = 240) videos analyzed. Based on the observations, we then constructed an ethogram with nine behaviors grouped into four categories: quiescence, environmental exploration, feeding, and self-cleaning. Our results indicate that, regardless of sex ( P = 0.39), S. pictus individuals remained more quiescent during the light period ( P < 0.05), with males spending 82.71% of the time quiescent and females spending 91.96% of their time quiescent. Additionally, individuals showed a substantial increase in the frequencies of activity-related behaviors during the dark period ( P < 0.05), with no significant differences between sexes. Compared to other species, S. pictus proved to be even more quiescent, especially during the day, possibly in response to the harsh environmental conditions. In the natural environment, we observed crabs seeking shelter under rocks during the day, possibly as a response to high temperatures. These findings suggest that the crabs have developed behavioral strategies to optimize energy use in severe aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Vocalizations are the most prominent signals in the communication of anuran amphibians. Frog calls can serve different roles depending on the social context. There are three categories of vocal signals (calls) based on social context. One of these is the aggressive call, which generally mediates interactions between conspecific males and conveys information about the level of aggression. In this study, we describe fighting calls elicited during physical combat between two males of Pithecopus ayeaye . We also analyzed aggressive calls not associated with physical combat, which were emitted by resident males from an established calling site toward approaching males, and discussed the variation related to different levels of aggression. The fighting call consists of one multi-pulsed note with an increment in sound amplitude throughout the note and amplitude peak by 96% of note duration. In general, fighting calls and aggressive calls have the same temporal envelope and spectral features. However, fighting calls exhibit a greater number of pulses, a higher pulse repetition rate, and a longer duration. The differences between aggressive calls of P. ayeaye produced in distinct contexts could indicate a graded signaling system in the aggressive calling behavior of the species. Our data match the pattern of escalated aggressive behavior occurring in other vocal anurans by modulating spectral and/or temporal features of their calls.},

Among amphibians, temperature variations may influence metabolism, sensory perception and behavior. We experimentally evaluated whether tadpoles of map treefrog, Boana geographica , reduce their activity and increase the use of refuge under different temperatures in response to chemical signals emitted by a predator, as an adaptive strategy to minimize the risk of predation. Tadpoles’ shelter use and feeding behavior was measured at temperatures from 28 to 36 °C using control (without predator cues) and treatment (predator cues) groups. Temperature influenced the shelter use of tadpoles when exposed to predator chemical cues. Significant differences were observed at lower temperatures and greater shelter use by tadpoles at higher temperatures. Food offering showed no significant difference in the control or treatment group. The increased use of shelter by tadpoles in response to chemical signals from predators and increased temperature highlights the adaptive capacity of organisms in the face of predation threats, highlighting the complexity of predator–prey interactions. This behavior highlights the role of environmental factors and sensory signals in shaping the survival strategies of aquatic ectotherms. Tadpoles minimize predation risk by increasing predator avoidance behavior in detecting chemical signals in the water.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the Magpie, which has ecological and behavioral flexibility, has colonized many cities. In this study, we examine the effect of urban disturbance on nesting density of the Magpie and nest height in a city in the south-eastern Baltic region. The studies were carried out in Kaliningrad (54°43’N, 20°30’E) during the leafless period in 2018–2021 in green residential areas with a predominance of 5-storey buildings (“residential area”) and low-rise individual housing areas (“individual houses”). In the residential area, nest counts were carried out separately in the central part of the city and outside the city center. Based on literature data on urban populations of the Magpie in other cities, we predict that: (1) in the central part of the city there will be a higher nesting density of magpies and (2) in the central part of the city, nests will be located higher than outside the central part of the city. The results obtained did not confirm these assumptions. The average nesting density in residential areas in the city center and outside the city center was virtually the same. And, in addition, in the residential area in the city center, nests were on average located lower than in the residential area outside the central part of the city, but the differences were not statistically significant and the median values of these city zones coincide. The work also provides data on the placement of nests on various types of trees and shrubs. The Hooded crow, being the main predator and competitor of the Magpie, shares the same habitats in Kaliningrad. This coexistence could potentially slow down the increase in Magpie nesting density, especially in the residential area of the city centre, where the nesting density of the Hooded crow is significantly higher than outside the city centre.},

  abstract     = {One of the important antipredator benefits of group living for prey species is collective vigilance that enhances early predator detection. Within the group, individuals monitor the behavior of others to gauge the level of risk in the environment. The nearest-neighbor distance is important as the information travels quickly and easily from the nearest individuals. I examined the vigilance behavior of free-ranging chital deer ( Axis axis , Gir Protected Area, India) in response to the group size, nearest neighbor distance, and habitat structure (open versus dense vegetation). The vigilance behavior showed a weak negative response to increases in group size. Overall, the vigilance levels were significantly higher for animals that had distant neighbors. There was a significant interaction effect of habitat structure and the nearest neighbor distance on vigilance levels of chitals. However, this effect was only significantly different for individuals living in dense vegetation. Chitals respond more strongly to conspecific vigilance from their nearest companion in the denser mixed forest than open acacia grasslands. The results indicate that nearest neighbor distance and habitat structure interact in determining the vigilance behavior of group living ungulates and transmission of information within a social group.},

  abstract     = {Studying the behavioral ecology of primates is essential to realize their conservation and management strategies. Geladas ( Theropithecus gelada ) are endemic primates of the Ethiopian highlands and the last remaining member of the genus Theropithecus . We present here the first-ever study on the behavioral ecology, of the newly discovered geladas in the eastern part of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. We collected data from February to September 2020, which included both dry and wet seasons, and focused on activity patterns and feeding ecology of geladas. A band of 48 individuals was selected as a study group. Data was collected through the instantaneous scan sampling method from the focal band of geladas. Feeding accounted for 49.5% of the activity patterns, followed by moving (22.3%), resting (16%), social (10.4%), and other non-social activities (1.9%). Geladas in the present study consumed 25 plant species that belong to 12 families, more than 50% (14) being graminoids. Food items included graminoid parts (66.1%), forb parts (27.5%), tree/shrub leaves (2.4%), fruit/seeds (2.6%), flowers (0.9%), and the rest being unidentified (0.5%). Geladas are fed in large quantities on graminoid leaves, although they shifted to underground (corms, rhizomes, and roots) food items when leaves were desiccated, particularly during the dry season. The data on the diurnal activity patterns and feeding ecology of the gelada helps in developing conservation strategies and understanding habitat selection and its level of dietary specialization. The current study area is known as a new distribution of geladas in the Tigray region. Thus, this study provides data that would be crucial information for conservation practitioners at local and national levels to ensure the survival of the new and isolated population of Tigray geladas that are patchily distributed to a few escarpments of eastern Tigray, Ethiopia.},

  abstract     = {We conducted a laboratory based selection experiment with two allopatric populations of Drosophila ananassae collected from two isolated geographic regions of India, namely Mysuru and Port Blair. The populations were infected enterically with the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 55 generations followed by rearing for the next 10 generations under relaxed selection. We tested development of immune-competence of the selected flies through the generations and inquired if elicitation of immune responses were needed to pay cost by trading-off with life history and morphological traits and observed progressive increase in immune response in the selected flies, which also exhibited gradual increase in survival, reproductive life span, post-reproductive life span, developmental time, fecundity rate, fat content in contrast to body length and water content that exhibited longitudinal decrease. Under relaxed selection regime the traits showed reversion of the trend but not to the basal level. Responses exhibited by the selected flies from Port Blair and Mysuru differed, with the former group exhibiting more reduction in body length, more reduction in water content, greater antioxidant enzyme activity, longer post-infection period, greater survival than the later group. On the other side, Mysuru flies showed greater fat deposition, faster developmental time and longer oviposition time than Port Blair flies. Interestingly, Port Blair flies exhibited an increase in post-ovipository period, in contrast to Mysuru flies that showed a decrease for the same. We inferred that two allopatric populations of D. ananassae from the Indian sub-continent show different trade-off between evolving immune response and life history traits. Further, the outcome of our study leads us to a point of realization how allopatric populations of a given species respond differently under given selection pressure and gradually diverge from each other in nature to develop a species barrier.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we describe and compare the diet of two populations of Pleurodema diplolister from northeastern Brazil. We assessed whether diet composition varies between the different populations and whether the size of individuals is related to the composition, volume and the size of prey consumed. Stomach contents were retrieved through the stomach-flushing technique from specimens collected in two municipalities (Morro do Chapéu and Rio de Contas) in the semi-arid region of Bahia State. We captured a total of 163 individuals and 91 of them had some type of stomach contents. A total of 278 food items were classified and distributed among 10 prey categories. The main food items consumed include Hymenoptera (Formicidae), Isoptera and Coleoptera. The morphometric measurements (snout-vent length and mouth width) of P. diplolister were significantly correlated with the diet (total volume of prey and length of the largest prey ingested). Diet composition differed between the two localities, showing little overlap between populations. Part of the variation in diet composition may be attributed to differences in the size of P. diplolister individuals. However, many factors can be associated to these differences, such as prey availability, landscape structure or even anthropic influences on the local ecosystem. In order to unravel the intricacies behind these distinct patterns, a comprehensive examination of these factors and others becomes imperative. This detailed analysis is crucial for a more thorough understanding of the extent to which these elements influence the feeding habits of anurans.},
