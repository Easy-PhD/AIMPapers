  abstract     = {The O ( 1 / t 2 ) convergence rate of second-order dynamical systems with asymptotic vanishing viscous damping is faster than the O ( 1 / t ) rate of systems with fixed viscous damping in unconstrained and linear equality constrained optimization problems. We explore whether the performance of systems with vanishing viscous damping remains superior when both use time scaling. We compare the best polynomial convergence rates of vanishing damping systems with the best exponential convergence rates of a fixed damping system with time scaling for linear equality constrained problems. We prove that the primal-dual trajectory weakly converges to an optimal solution. Additionally, we present an inertial algorithm derived from the implicit discretization of the dynamical system, establishing exponential convergence rates for the primal-dual gap, feasibility measure, and objective value without assuming strong convexity. The sequence of iterates generated by the inertial algorithm weakly converges to an optimal solution when the objective function is proper, convex, and lower semicontinuous. These results align with those in the continuous setting.},

This value is called the stability number of the graph, and its computation is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we solve the stable set problem using the D-Wave quantum annealer. By formulating the problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem with the penalty method, we show its optimal value equals the graph's stability number for specific penalty values. However, D-Wave's quantum annealer is a heuristic, so the solutions may be far from the optimum and may not represent stable sets. To address these, we introduce a post-processing procedure that identifies samples that could lead to improved solutions. Additionally, we propose a partitioning method to handle larger instances that cannot be embedded on D-Wave's quantum processing unit. Finally, we investigate how different penalty parameter values affect the solutions' quality. Extensive computational results show that the post-processing procedure significantly improves the solution quality, while the partitioning method successfully extends our approach to medium-size instances.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel algorithm, termed soft quasi-Newton (soft QN), for optimization in the presence of bounded noise. Traditional quasi-Newton algorithms are vulnerable to such noise-induced perturbations. To develop a more robust quasi-Newton method, we replace the secant condition in the matrix optimization problem for the Hessian update with a penalty term in its objective and derive a closed-form update formula. A key feature of our approach is its ability to maintain positive definiteness of the Hessian inverse approximation throughout the iterations. Furthermore, we establish the following properties of soft QN: it recovers the BFGS method under specific limits, it treats positive and negative curvature equally, and it is scale invariant. Collectively, these features enhance the efficacy of soft QN in noisy environments. For strongly convex objective functions and Hessian approximations obtained using soft QN, we develop an algorithm that exhibits linear convergence toward a neighborhood of the optimal solution even when gradient and function evaluations are subject to bounded perturbations. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that soft QN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of scenarios.},

In the conventional analysis of the various subgradient methods, including the proximal subgradient method, the Lipschitz continuity assumption has been placed to guarantee the boundedness of the subgradient and derive the convergence rate. However, the Lipschitz continuity does not hold in practical problems, including the sum-of- ℓ 2 -norms (SO ℓ 2 N) optimal control problem, which is examined in the numerical experiments of this paper. Without the Lipschitz continuity assumption, this paper provides the convergence analysis for strongly convex and non-strongly convex objective functions under mild assumptions. Suitable stepsize rules and resulting convergence rates are established; non-strongly convex cases result in a rate close to the rate of the existing subgradient method, and strongly convex cases achieve the same rate as the existing convergence analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider constrained optimization problems where both the objective and constraint functions are of the black-box type. Furthermore, we assume that the nonlinear inequality constraints are non-relaxable, i.e. the values of the objective function and constraints cannot be computed outside of the feasible region. This situation happens frequently in practice especially in the black-box setting where function values are typically computed by means of complex simulation programs which may fail to execute if the considered point is outside of the feasible region. For such problems, we propose a new derivative-free optimization method which is based on the use of a merit function that handles inequality constraints by means of a log-barrier approach and equality constraints by means of an exterior penalty approach. We prove the convergence of the proposed method to KKT stationary points of the problem under standard assumptions (we do not require any convexity assumption). Furthermore, we also carry out a preliminary numerical experience on standard test problems and comparison with state-of-the-art solvers showing the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The evaluation of objective function and its gradient is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the model has to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, a bound for the model error is used to explore regions where the model is sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as standard line-search methods, but only uses the models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to problems where the evaluation of the objective requires the solution of a large-scale system of nonlinear equations. The models are constructed from reduced order models of this system. Numerical results for partial differential equation constrained optimization problems show the benefits of the proposed algorithm.},

However, it uses a projection and a proportionality test to speed up active set identification. Matrix factor updates accompany active set changes to decrease the computational load. The development of the algorithm is motivated by problems arising in embedded applications of model predictive control in automotive, particularly in autonomous driving, hybridization, electrification, and system optimization. These applications typically lead to an ill-conditioned problem with heavy changes in an active set of solutions at each sample time. Further, underlying quadratic programming needs to be solved in a short time with limited computational and memory resources. Resistance against ill-conditioning, fast convergence, and low memory footprint are vital attributes of the proposed method. Practical aspects, namely preprocessing or Hessian factor updates, are described together with the proposed numerical method. Benchmark results accentuate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

However, the favourable convergence properties typically associated with Newton-type methods for NPGMO were not established in Ansary's work. In response to this gap, we develop a new analytic framework, rooted in an auxiliary inequality, to analyse the convergence behaviour of NPGMO. Specifically, we establish the quadratic termination of NPGMO for problems with strongly convex quadratic smooth terms. Under the assumption of strong convexity, we demonstrate that the NPGMO enjoys superlinear convergence, and quadratic convergence for problems that involve twice continuously differentiable, and twice Lipschitz continuously differentiable smooth terms, respectively. The novel study on the analytic framework simplifies the existing convergence analysis of second-order methods for multiobjective optimization problems.},

The objective functions are only assumed to be locally Lipschitz continuous instead of convexity used in the existing subgradient method for Riemannian multiobjective optimization. And the constraint manifold is a general manifold rather than some specific manifolds used in the proximal point method. The retraction mapping is introduced to avoid the use of computationally difficult geodesic. A Riemannian version of the necessary condition for Pareto optimality is proposed, which generalized the classical one in Euclidean space to the manifold setting. At every iteration, an acceptable descent direction is obtained by constructing a convex hull of some Riemannian ε -subgradients. And then a Riemannian Armijo-type line search is executed to produce the next iterate. The convergence result is established in the sense that a point satisfying the necessary condition for Pareto optimality can be generated by the algorithm in a finite number of iterations. Finally, some preliminary numerical results are reported, which show that the proposed method is efficient.},

Several popular algorithms use local search methods to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the Poisson CPD model. This work presents two new algorithms that extend state-of-the-art local methods for Poisson CPD. Hybrid GCP-CPAPR combines Generalized Canonical Decomposition (GCP) with stochastic optimization and CP Alternating Poisson Regression (CPAPR), a deterministic algorithm, to increase the probability of converging to the MLE over either method used alone. Restarted CPAPR with SVDrop uses a heuristic based on the singular values of the CPD model unfoldings to identify convergence toward optimizers that are not the MLE and restarts within the feasible domain of the optimization problem, thus reducing overall computational cost when using a multi-start strategy. We provide empirical evidence that indicates our approaches outperform existing methods with respect to converging to the Poisson CPD MLE.},

As an immediate application, we attain the approximate controllability of forward stochastic heat equations featuring a Lévy process. Subsequently, we embark upon the formulation of a nuanced optimization problem, encompassing both the determination of an optimal actuator location and its associated minimum norm control. This formulation is elegantly cast as a two-person zero-sum game problem. We then proceed to articulate a set of conditions–both sufficient and necessary–required for optimizing the solution through the prism of a Nash equilibrium. At last, we prove that the relaxed optimal solution is an optimal actuator location for the classical problem.},

Focusing on the aggregative structure of the inner-level function, we employ the hybrid variance reduction method to obtain the information on each agent's private expectation function, and apply the dynamic consensus mechanism to track the information on each agent's inner-level function. Then by combining with the standard distributed stochastic gradient descent method, we propose a distributed aggregative stochastic compositional gradient descent method. When the objective function is smooth, the proposed method achieves the convergence rate O ( K − 1 / 2 ) . We further combine the proposed method with the communication compression and propose the communication compressed variant distributed aggregative stochastic compositional gradient descent method. The compressed variant of the proposed method maintains the convergence rate O ( K − 1 / 2 ) .

Four variants of the DL method are extended and analysed from the scalar case to the vector setting. We first give a direct vector extended version of the modified Dai–Liao (DL+) method. Then the second algorithm is presented by combining a new extension form of the well-known Hager–Zhang (HZ) parameter. This new scheme equips a good descent property and its parameter also reduces to the classical one in the scalar case. The last two algorithms extend two sufficient descent DL-type methods. Particularly, two different vector forms of their parameters are considered and compared. As a result, we reveal some differences between scalar and vector cases to a certain extent. Without any convex assumption, the sufficient descent property and global convergence of all algorithms are established under inexact line searches. Finally, preliminary numerical experiments illustrate the practical behaviour of our algorithms by using Dolan and Moré performance profile.},

Due to its non-convexity, this problem is challenging, but it attracts more and more interest because of its practical applications. The algorithm is developed based on monotonic optimization combined with a recent neurodynamic approach, where the solution set of the lower-level problem is inner approximated by copolyblocks in outcome space. From that, the upper-level problem is solved using the branch-and-bound method. Finding the bounds is converted to pseudoconvex programming problems, which are solved using the neurodynamic method. The algorithm's convergence is proved, and computational experiments are implemented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {As a second-order method, the Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has the ability to accelerate training of neural networks. However, due to the prohibitive computational and memory costs of computing and inverting the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), efficient approximations are necessary to make NGD scalable to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Many such approximations have been attempted. The most sophisticated of these is KFAC, which approximates the FIM as a block-diagonal matrix, where each block corresponds to a layer of the neural network. By doing so, KFAC ignores the interactions between different layers. In this work, we investigate the interest of restoring some low-frequency interactions between the layers by means of two-level methods. Inspired from domain decomposition, several two-level corrections to KFAC using different coarse spaces are proposed and assessed. The obtained results show that incorporating the layer interactions in this fashion does not really improve the performance of KFAC. This suggests that it is safe to discard the off-diagonal blocks of the FIM, since the block-diagonal approach is sufficiently robust, accurate and economical in computation time.},

In addition to numerical experiments with standard nonsmooth test problems, we also apply the method to several image reconstruction problems in computed tomography, using total variation regularization. Performance profiles are used to compare the performance of the algorithm using different line search strategies and conjugate directions to that of the original spectral subgradient method. Our results show that the spectral conjugate subgradient algorithm outperforms the original spectral subgradient method, and that the use of the Polak–Ribière formula for conjugate directions provides the best and most robust performance.},
