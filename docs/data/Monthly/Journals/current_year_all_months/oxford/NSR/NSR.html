  abstract     = {Blinks controlled by ocular muscles and nerves can manifest as either involuntary physiological behaviors or volitional control actions, with the former serving spontaneous protective functions while the latter constitutes a biologically meaningful communicative signal. The encoding of blink information provides a novel eye–machine interaction (EMI) prototype within the realm of human–machine interaction, expanding human consciousness and capability boundaries. It facilitates motor and language rehabilitation, silent communication and even voluntary command execution. However, existing EMI devices face challenges related to wireless functionalities, ocular comfort and multi-route encoding/decoding orders. Here, we propose a wireless eye-wearable lens to encode conscious blink information via introduction of an RLC oscillating loop in the soft contact lens. The developed EMI contact lens incorporates a mechanosensitive capacitor, an inductive coil and the inherent loop resistance, generating characteristic resonance frequency for front-end capacitance signal transition or back-end control signal extraction. The EMI device delivers a sensitivity of 0.153 MHz/mmHg in the wide range of 0–70 mmHg for a normal intraocular pressure monitor and realizes conscious blink-based control command coding. A trial with participants having the EMI contact lens inserted demonstrates its wearability and biocompatibility. Finally, the five-route blink-based control command decoding mechanism is constructed via the EMI lens, linking blink counts to a drone's flight trajectory. The EMI contact lens offers an innovative prototype that transcends the capabilities of traditional brain–computer interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Reforestation and afforestation alter climate not only through biogeophysical processes such as changes in surface albedo, evapotranspiration and near‐surface turbulence, but also by modifying emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that drive biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) formation. Using an Earth system model coupled with an advanced aerosol module, we quantify how biogeophysical feedback from vegetation change influences BVOC emissions, BSOA burden and aerosol radiative effects under future land‑use scenarios. Our results reveal that biogeophysical feedback either amplifies or offsets BSOA cooling, depending on regional climate–vegetation interactions. In regions where reduced surface albedo dominates, increasing temperature and BVOC emissions enhance BSOA burden and its radiative cooling. Conversely, in regions where updrafts and cloud formation are enhanced, reduced surface radiation suppresses BVOC emissions and offsets BSOA increases from vegetation changes alone. Globally, these types of feedback amplify BVOC emission changes in 52% of reforested areas but suppress them elsewhere, intensifying spatial heterogeneity in aerosol climate effects. These divergent feedback pathways introduce strong spatial heterogeneity and non-linearity into the BSOA–climate response. Incorporating such biogeophysical modulation of BSOAs is essential for designing reforestation strategies that maximize climate mitigation benefits.},

  abstract     = {Channelized thin seismic low-velocity zones (LVZs) are observed beneath subducting slabs, extending from the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to the mantle transition zone (MTZ). While LVZs above slabs are well-explained by slab dehydration and flux melting, the origin and fate of these enigmatic subslab LVZs—persisting far deeper than expected—remain elusive. Here we use geodynamic modeling to show that subduction-induced wet upwellings from a water-bearing MTZ that generates dehydration melting feed the base of the lithosphere forming seismically detected LVZs. A similar process may occur when a pre-existing partially molten layer atop the 410-km discontinuity is displaced upward in response to subduction. These thin partially molten layers are successively entrained alongside the subducting slab and recycled back to MTZ depths. This mechanism supports a globally widespread scenario where subduction-induced upwelling of a water-rich MTZ can account for the observed mantle heterogeneities. Since minute quantities of melts may dramatically reduce viscosity, this process is likely to have non-negligible implications for the Earth's dynamics and recycling of the lithosphere into the deep mantle.},

This extreme flooding is fueled by the unprecedented warming in the Indian Ocean, with a decaying moderate El Niño in the Pacific contributing weakly. Alarmingly, similar pre-flood season flooding events have become increasingly frequent in southern China over recent decades, posing unexpected risks to local communities. We demonstrate that the recent rapid Indian Ocean warming enhances local convection efficiency, leading to more frequent intense pre-flood season rainfall. As sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean continues to rise in a warming world, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its role in shaping regional extreme weather patterns for future climate adaptation and disaster management.},

This influence should be more pronounced during agricultural stages and periods of extreme solar activity. The late Joseon Dynasty of Korea serves as an ideal civilization sample of political continuity and stability, maintaining a 285-year-long meteorological diary and rainfall records with a temporal resolution of up to 2 hours, perfectly encompassing the Maunder Minimum (MM). Here we quantitatively reconstruct the rainfall patterns, revealing a rare, nearly century-long drought around the MM, accompanied by decadal climate fluctuations correlated to the sunspot cycle. Quantitative socio-environmental analyses further indicate that the convergence of cold, arid conditions and heightened climate instability ultimately precipitated cascading ecological and societal crises during the late Joseon Dynasty. Our findings offer new perspectives for understanding and addressing the impacts of future periods of extreme solar activity on modern civilization.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety disorders frequently accompany aggression, with their co-occurrence predicting greater functional impairment and poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive, primarily due to a lack of appropriate animal models. Here, we designed a chronic conspecific outsider stress (CCS) model in which male mice underwent perceived social threats and exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors accompanied by aggression. CCS led to Fos activation and hyperexcitability of GABAergic neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Inhibition of mPOA GABAergic (mPOA Gad2 ) neurons rescued CCS-induced anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors, whereas activating these cells induced susceptibility to CCS. Moreover, CCS upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of the sexual-dimorphic gene, cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR)-encoding Cckar gene in the mPOA. Importantly, the knock-down and overexpression of CCKAR in the mPOA Gad2 neurons had alleviating and promoting effects on anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors, aligning with decreased and increased excitability by the anxiolytic CCKAR antagonist MK-329 and the anxiogenic CCKAR agonist A71623 in mPOA Gad2 neurons, respectively. Overall, our study characterizes a novel mouse model of anxiety disorders accompanied by aggression and the neuronal subpopulation and molecular mediator of the aberrant behaviors provide potential targets of intervention for anxiety disorders with aggression.},

The results explain recent alloy experiments and provide a way to exceed the maximum strength of polycrystals. Ductility and elastic moduli are also measured in the broad ( D , l ) space. In regimes without a strength-ductility trade-off, the maximum ductility and ductile–brittle transitions are identified.

Traditionally, the formation of Fe vacancies ( ⁠ V F e ′ ′ ⁠ ) in LiFePO 4 (LFP) cathodes during extended cycling has been regarded as the chief culprit contributing to capacity degradation. However, this study uncovers their functional potential as beneficial structural defects for sodium-ion batteries, repurposing V F e ′ ′ from spent LFP batteries to engineer high-performance Na–Fe–P–O series cathode materials. These pre-existing vacancies trigger a self-adaptive lattice breathing mechanism that dynamically accommodates volume changes during rapid Na + ion de-/intercalation, achieving 80% state-of-charge within 6 min and retaining 82.9% capacity after 4000 cycles at a high rate of 10 C. The proposed dual-loop upcycling model further enhances economic returns by 65% and reduces environmental footprint by 29%. This work pioneers a sustainable paradigm that transforms degradation mechanisms of LIBs into foundational design strategies for next-generation batteries.},

  abstract     = {Materials possessing long-range ordering of magnetic spins or electric dipoles have been the focus of condensed matter research. Among them, ferri-systems with two sublattices of unequal/non-collinear spins or electric dipoles are expected to combine the properties of ferro- and antiferro-systems, but lack experimental observations in single-phase materials. This is particularly true for the ferrielectric system, since the electric dipoles can usually be redefined to incorporate the two sublattices into one, making it indistinguishable from ferroelectric. This raises doubts about whether or not ferrielectricity can be considered as an independent ferroic order. Here we report the observation of true ferrielectric behaviors in a hybrid single crystal (MV)[SbBr 5 ] (MV 2+ = N , N ′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium or methyl viologen), where the two electric dipole sublattices switch asynchronously, and thus cannot be reduced to ferroelectric by redefining the unit cell. Furthermore, the complex dipole configuration imparts circularly polarized light sensitivity to the system. An electric field can modulate the non-collinear dipole sublattices and even induce a transition from ferrielectric to ferroelectric state, thereby tuning the helicity-dependent photocurrent. This study opens a new paradigm for the study of true irreducible ferrielectricity (a new class of polar systems) and provides an effective approach to the electric field control of spin-orbit coupling and circular photogalvanic effect.},

  abstract     = {Long-endurance and high-power operation of lithium batteries in cryogenic conditions is important for broader aeronautical applications but is plagued by sluggish and mismatched interfacial kinetics at both electrodes. Herein, we report the concurrent control of the solvation sheath and interfacial chemistry through anion modulation, thereby addressing the challenges associated with charge transfer kinetics. Specifically, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) serves as a salt anion adjuvant due to its steric hindrance and electron-donating properties. The spatial effect of LiHMDS induces the construction of weak bidentate coordination structures, promising a fast (de)solvation process. Moreover, electron reconfiguration within the Lewis acid-base (BF 3 -HMDS − ) promotes the formation of inorganic-rich interphases, eliminating the migration barriers at both electrodes. Consequently, practical pouch cells achieve a high power density of 980.9 W kg −1 and an energy density of 310.4 Wh kg −1 at −40°C, facilitating high-speed cruising and rapid vertical take-offs and landings of reconnaissance drones in cold environments.},

  abstract     = {Heteromaterials made of two different components have been widely studied; their interfacial bonding is essential to control their properties. How to prepare a chemically bonded metallic interface remains elusive, despite its importance for structural and functional materials. Here we synthesized a family of homologous metal heteromaterials (HMHs) featuring chemically bonded metallic interfaces, which endow them with strong interfacial binding forces and metallic conductivity. These features stem from delocalized electronic states and a uniformly distributed electric field across the interface of HMHs. We synthesized and high-throughput screened a family of HMHs comprising four categories and 20 materials. As an application example, we show that HMHs operate stably in a water electrolyzer with a decay rate of 1.06 μV h −1 at high current density over 1000 h, thanks to the above two interface properties. To our knowledge, this is the lowest decay rate reported to date, surpassing the target of the U.S. Department of Energy for 2040.},

  abstract     = {In the promotion of aqueous zinc (Zn)-metal batteries, hydrogel electrolytes have been found to come with the capability to physically obstruct dendritic Zn growth and suppress unwanted side reactions compared to their liquid counterparts. However, due to the opposite structural requirements for ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, the preparation of thin-film hydrogel electrolytes for energy-dense Zn-metal batteries remains a formidable task. Herein, electrogelation that offers several unique advantages, including precise control over the thickness, good geometric adaptability, and high tunability of the hydrogels’ microstructures and properties, is investigated as a promising technique to address the above-mentioned dilemma. It is shown that, by varying the electrogelation parameters, various biomacromolecular hydrogel electrolytes featuring highly micro-/nanostructured pores can be obtained to deliver simultaneously high mechanical strength (2.0 to 4.4 MPa) and high ionic conductivity (10.1 to 19.5 mS cm −1 ). Such in situ –built electrolytes can be as thin as 50 μm and enable excellent Zn plating/stripping reversibility at 1 mA cm −2 /1 mAh cm −2 with Coulombic efficiency averaging 99.83% for over 2800 cycles (>6 months); the Zn-metal battery with a high areal capacity of 5.4 mAh cm −2 and a practical negative-to-positive capacity ratio of 1.1 retains 70% of its initial capacity after 120 cycles. We quantitatively show the respectable recyclability, low environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness of our biomacromolecular hydrogel electrolytes by integrating experimental study, life-cycle assessment, and techno-economic analysis, thereby opening the door for research on more sustainable Zn-metal batteries and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)-cell therapy is a promising resolution for solid tumors, but its corresponding clinical translation has been hindered by unsatisfactory therapeutic potency and severe cytokine release syndrome. Herein, tetracycline (Tet)-On inducible human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1)-targeted CAR-T (Tet-HER1-CAR-T) cells were engineered to enable spatially selective activation at tumor sites by doxycycline (Doxy), which is delivered by pH-responsive stealth liposomal calcium carbonate nanoparticles (Doxy@CaCO 3 -PEG). Compared with the intravenous administration of conventional HER1-CAR-T cells and Tet-HER1-CAR-T cells activated by free Doxy, concurrent intravenous administration of Tet-HER1-CAR-T cells and Doxy@CaCO 3 -PEG leads to the localized tumor activation of Tet-HER1-CAR-T cells and reduced systemic secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Together with its ability to protect Tet-HER1-CAR-T cells from tumor-acidity-induced dysfunction by neutralizing tumor acidity, Doxy@CaCO 3 -PEG injection synergized with Tet-HER1-CAR-T cells to effectively suppress the growth of HER1-overexpressing subcutaneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors, lung tumors and orthotopic lung tumors in mice. Furthermore, Doxy@CaCO 3 -PEG-activated Tet-HER1-CAR-T-cell therapy synergistically suppressed HER1 inhibitor-resistant TNBC tumors and immunosuppressive Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.) colonized HER1-overexpressing TNBC patient-derived tumor xenografts. This study highlights that the Doxy@CaCO 3 -PEG-induced pH-responsive activation of Tet-HER1-CAR-T cells is a highly spatially selective strategy for effectively eradicating targeted solid tumors with improved safety.},

  abstract     = {The stress distribution in Li metal strongly affects the interfacial Li-ion diffusion, thereby influencing the morphology of plated Li and the performance of the battery. Here, we report a mechano-electrochemical coupling strategy that utilizes an arched structured carbon aerogel to achieve stable Li-plating/stripping electrochemistry. The arch-structured carbon aerogel can actively regulate stress distributions in response to the compressive stresses induced by Li deposition, generating the transition of stress from compressive on the convex surface to tensile on the concave surface, which can effectively promote the Li-migration kinetics and thus suppress the non-uniform deposition of Li. The carbon aerogel with synergistically enriched-oxygen vacancies on its surface boosts rapid interfacial Li-ion migration by reducing the Li + migration barrier. The non-dendritic Li-metal anode demonstrates smaller electrode level volume variation (<3%), higher coulombic efficiency (98.5%) and a longer cycle lifetime (2000 h at 1 mA cm −2 ) than conventional planar substrates. A full cell based on the LiFePO 4 cathode shows a high capacity retention of 90.2% after 300 cycles at 1 C. The carbon-aerogel/Li|sulfurized polyacrylonitrile full cell delivers a reversible capacity of 1130 mA h g −1 over 270 cycles at 0.2 C. This work reveals a stress-driven dendrite growth suppression mechanism and provides insights into the design of dendrite-free metal anodes for rechargeable metal batteries.},

We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent in the sense that one is the other’s interaction picture. Despite their mathematical equivalence, our numerical simulations show significant differences between them in performance, which is explained analytically. Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, can be viewed as quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets governed by the non-Abelian gauge matrix.},

In addition to its unprecedented performance across key metrics, including broad detection range (0.5–60.0 cm), high spatial resolution (∼10.0 µm), and fast response speed (1.6 µs), our Flex-PCI could precisely track finger kinematics and human physiological information, including position, velocity, trajectory, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Additionally, the Flex-PCI could stably operate under diverse conditions, such as various temperatures, humidities, ambient light intensities, bending states, and even underwater, addressing the reliability gap in dynamic applications. These combined, unparalleled characteristics have been demonstrated through a high-dimensional security system synergistically featuring tracking of finger kinematics and human physiological information in aerial and aquatic environments.

  abstract     = {Rhenium and osmium are both siderophilic and chalcophilic, exhibiting a strong affinity for organic-rich materials. This makes the Re–Os chronometer a valuable complement to geochronometers based on lithophile elements. In this review, we begin by discussing how the elemental abundances and isotopic compositions impact sample selection, analytical strategy, and data interpretation. We then provide an overview of how 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios can be used to trace geological processes, followed by a summary of the analytical protocols commonly used in Re–Os geochemistry. We also examine key challenges in isochron dating, including the identification and avoidance of pitfalls such as mixing lines, and inherited initial slopes. We further demonstrate that petrographic and geochemical studies can be very helpful for accurately dating sulfides with contrasting initial 187 Os/ 188 Os values and/or ages. With state-of-the-art Re–Os dating technique reaching precisions up to 0.05% for molybdenites and 1% for organic-rich sedimentary rocks, it is now possible to resolve the rapid and episodic nature of ore formation, and to investigate the dynamics of environment–life coevolution with unprecedented detail. We conclude this review by outlining future directions for Re–Os geochronology, including developing imaging-guided Re–Os dating techniques for organic-rich sediments, sharpening the in situ Re–Os dating method, and fully integrating the Re–Os geochronometer into the EarthTime initiative.},

  abstract     = {Antisolvents are one of the main components in localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs), which are considered merely as diluents to control the macro properties and preserve the anion-dominated solvation structure, but their role in shaping the micromicelle-like structure and interface chemistry remains poorly understood. Here, we utilize LHCEs with trifluorobenzene isomer as antisolvent to investigate the antisolvent polarity-dependent solvation structure, interface chemistry and Li deposition behavior in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The ‘dragging effect’ of antisolvents on anions can alter the solvation environment, correcting the existing micelle-like solvation structure model of LHCEs. Additionally, the interface adsorption of polar antisolvent negatively impacts the formation of solid electrolyte interphase and ion transport dynamics, thereby influencing the Li deposition behavior. The Li deposition/stripping efficiency in ester-based LHCEs using low-polarity antisolvents is enhanced to 98.55%, as evidenced by the Li||LiFePO 4 full cell (N/P = 3) achieving 90% capacity retention after 250 cycles. Furthermore, the significant role of high-polarity antisolvent in enhancing the ion conductivity of bulk electrolyte, especially at low temperatures, cannot be ignored. This work provides valuable insights into the intricate role of antisolvents in LHCEs, highlighting their pivotal influence on battery performance and contributing to the advancement of electrolyte design for high-energy-density LMBs.},

Herein, a face-capped tetrahedral cage, featuring Pd‒Pd-bonded vertices, with a tailored nanospace surrounded by 12 ethyl units, was facilitated to adaptively accommodate a library of guests with different sizes and shapes, including C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, adamantane derivatives, S 8 and P 4 . This nanocavity can achieve strong binding with cyclohexane in non-aqueous media in contrast to reported structurally similar non- endo -functionalized cages by an increase of four orders of magnitude. The crystal structures of free cage and host‒guest complexes demonstrate that the aliphatic units within the nanospace are allowed to adaptively deform to stabilize the guests or serve as grippers to form unique interactions. This work indicates the achievability of both efficient organic guests and elemental sulfur/phosphorus binding in a non-aqueous system with minimal synthetic efforts, by modifying inward-facing aliphatic units to the inner face of the nanospace.},

Nevertheless, the microscopic details of CISS and its integration in opto-spintronic constructs remain nascent. Reliable reporting of CISS performance characteristics represents a significant challenge in providing the necessary design rules. We show a Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) method that can quantitatively evaluate and spatially map the chirality-dependent surface contact potential difference resulting from the formation of a spin-Schottky junction. We revealed inhomogeneity in the CISS response, where low-CISS regions in the c-HP films reduce the overall macroscopic average, likely serving as a key factor in optimizing macroscopic performance. We also observed that although c-HP films made from higher precursor concentrations lead to thicker films and higher carrier concentrations with subsequent larger barrier heights in the Schottky junction, stronger spin relaxation due to non-ideal film quality reduces spin polarization.},

In this article, we report a breakthrough in uncovering universal many-body correlated properties of the quantum integrable Lieb–Liniger model. We exactly calculate the dynamical correlation functions by computing the form factors through a newly developed method, by which we are capable of calculating all possible ‘relative excitations’ over the ground state or a finite temperature state to high precision. Consequently, full spectral functions obtained for the model manifest the unique power-law singularity behaviour at the spectral threshold, confirming the validity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. Our method advances the theory of dynamical correlation functions with high precision towards the thermodynamic limit, and is capable of benchmarking experimental observation of such novel correlated properties.},

  abstract     = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have great potential as versatile platforms for proton conduction. However, the commonly applied 2D COFs that are easy to design and synthesize have only 1D channels for proton conduction, limiting the formation of continuous hydrogen bonds due to the anisotropy between their crystalline grains. Herein, we report a strategy to construct 3D channels in 2D COFs by using rotaxane structures and eliminate the strong interlayer π–π interactions, facilitating the formation of smooth 3D proton-transfer pathways during guest doping. The presence of interlocking α-cyclodextrin (CD) molecules in a rotaxane-based COF (CD-TpAzo) significantly diminishes the stacking energy between the 2D layers from 154.2 to 55.2 kJ mol −1 , resulting in easier H 3 PO 4 doping into its 3D channels and interlayers. As a result, CD-TpAzo@H 3 PO 4 -10 exhibits an eight times shorter H + spin-lattice relaxation time than TpAzo@H 3 PO 4 -10. At 150°C, the anhydrous proton conductivity of CD-TpAzo@H 3 PO 4 -18 reaches 0.78 S cm −1 , which is even higher than that of pure H 3 PO 4 (0.47 S cm −1 ) under the same conditions.},

Through a combination of spectroscopic analysis, electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we elucidated the underlying mechanism driving molecular aggregation to the formation of toroidal topologies with well-defined chirality. These nanostructures exhibit blue circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Notably, when achiral luminophores such as TPPS or CBS are adsorbed onto the toroidal nanostructures, they are induced to emit red or blue CPL, respectively, while the other vesicular or spherical assemblies could not.

  abstract     = {Given that K constitutes about 3 wt.% of Earth's crust and is present in most rock-forming minerals, and that Ar diffusion in minerals is temperature-dependent, Ar-based geochronology ( 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and K–Ar dating) can date most rocks and also reveal their thermal history. This paper reviews recent advances and longstanding limitations in 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and K–Ar geochronology, and provides perspectives into future research on Ar-based geochronometers. Over the past two decades, multi-collector noble gas mass spectrometry has witnessed remarkable advancements in both sensitivity and resolution. Successive upgrades of mass spectrometer generations have significantly enhanced the precision of Ar isotope measurements, enabling a comprehensive revision and optimization of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating standard minerals. To achieve high-precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating and minimize inter-laboratory discrepancies, researchers are focusing on refining the potassium decay constant, developing standardized mineral separation techniques, and harmonizing irradiation and data processing protocols. These efforts are pivotal for improving the analytical precision of low-K and young samples, thereby expanding the application frontiers of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. For in situ planetary dating, the K/Ar method currently remains the only feasible radiometric technique among radioactive isotope systems. Addressing challenges in simultaneous K and Ar measurements will facilitate streamlined acquisition of reliable datasets. Moreover, research is advancing toward a deeper understanding of Ar diffusion behavior in minerals—beyond temperature-dependent volume diffusion—to clarify its impact on 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data interpretation and geological significance. To further advance argon-based geochronology, the scientific community is committed to continuous exploration and resolution of methodological limitations inherent in these dating approaches.},

  abstract     = {The Past Global Changes (PAGES) project was established in 1991, initially as one of the core research projects under the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). PAGES is an international scientific organization that connects paleoscientists worldwide. Over 5000 scientists from >125 countries currently subscribe to PAGES and all interested scientists are encouraged to get involved. In May 2025, the 7th PAGES Open Science Meeting and the 5th PAGES Young Scientists Meeting took place in Shanghai, China. The conferences focused on ‘Earth System Changes from the Past towards the Future’ and attracted ∼800 experts from >40 countries to attend and communicate. Seizing this opportunity, NSR interviewed Dr. Marie-France Loutre—executive director of PAGES and based at the International Project Office in Switzerland. Dr. Loutre is a Belgian paleoclimate modeling specialist and has been directing the PAGES office for almost 10 years. During our interview, Dr. Loutre provided a comprehensive overview of the organizational structure and scientific initiatives of PAGES. She particularly emphasized PAGES' support for early-career researchers and its commitment to community diversity, while also sharing her reflections and insights from working in an international scientific coordination project.},

  abstract     = {It is widely suspected that a small percentage of males have exceptional reproductive output (ERO) but progeny numbers of males are rarely measurable, even in humans. If we define the variance ratio of reproductive-output in males and females as α′ = V M / V F , the ERO hypothesis would predict α′ ≫ 1. Since autosomal, X, and, Y chromosomes are found in males 1/2, 1/3, and 100% of the time, their DNA diversities can inform about α′ . For example, autosomal and Y-linked diversities are governed, respectively, by ( V M + V F )/2 and V M . When comparing the chromosomal diversities, α′ appears to be near 20 for chimpanzees and orangutans, and 1–10 for gorillas. The exception is bonobos with α′ < 1. In humans, extensive genomic data are coupled to a theory, developed herein, that can filter out selection influences on Y-linked diversities. Hence, the estimation of α′ is rigorous, yielding values near or above 20, depending on the population. When α′ > 10, the presence of ERO males is very likely. These analyses can be applied more generally to species with XY sex determination.},

Conventional liquid detection methods often fall short in addressing these requirements due to limitations in precision, operational complexity, and scalability. This study introduces a wireless intelligent system for the detection of suspicious liquids, leveraging advancements in programmable metasurface and software defined radio technologies. By employing a spatiotemporal coding metasurface to transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) Wi-Fi signals, the system efficiently manipulates the spectral harmonic distribution of OFDM subcarriers, thereby creating multiple independent detection channels. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification algorithms are integrated to extract liquid-specific features from the channel state information (CSI), enabling precise identification of liquid properties. The proposed system exhibits robust immunity to ambient interference, such as interfering signals, temperature fluctuations, and humidity, while achieving near-ideal accuracy in the simultaneous detection and classification of multiple liquids. This innovative approach provides a cost-effective, scalable, and intelligent solution for hazardous substance detection, with transformative potential for security screening and public safety applications.},

High-precision geochronology of Neoproterozoic stratigraphy is essential for constraining timings, durations, and rates of these major events, and for assessing the synchroneity and nature of interactions between them. Here we review recent advances in the CA-ID-TIMS zircon U-Pb dating method and discuss the factors that influence the choice of method used to date Neoproterozoic stratigraphy. Advances in the temporal calibration of major carbonate carbon isotope excursions, glaciations, and fossil assemblages of the Neoproterozoic using high-precision age constraints, are also reviewed. This enables us to construct a composite carbonate carbon isotope profile for the Neoproterozoic, which is anchored by radio-isotopic ages. Together with available biodiversity metrics, this provides critical insights into the co-evolution of life and environment in the Neoproterozoic.},

  abstract     = {The role of cholesterol metabolism in antiviral immunity has been established, but if and how this cholesterol-mediated immunometabolism can be regulated by specific small molecules is of particular interest in the quest for novel antiviral therapeutics. Here, we first demonstrate that NPC1 is the key cholesterol transporter for suppressing viral replication by changing cholesterol metabolism and triggering the innate immune response via systemic analyses of all possible cholesterol transporters. We then use the Connectivity Map (CMap), a systematic methodology for identifying functional connections between genetic perturbations and drug actions, to screen NPC1 inhibitors, and found that bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BBAs) exhibit high efficacy in the inhibition of viral infections. Among all potent BBAs that we tested, tetrandrine (Tet) is the most effective, by directly binding to NPC1 and inducing lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in order to resist viral entries. Through the NPC1-STING interface mechanism, Tet further blocks STING lysosomal degradation which leads to boosting of the interferon-based antiviral response against multiple viruses both in vitro and in vivo . Therefore, BBAs represent very promising drug compounds for this newly discovered antiviral mechanism by targeting the NPC1-STING interface via cholesterol-mediated immunometabolism, which in turn disrupts the virus life cycle and boosts antiviral immunity.},

  abstract     = {Reaction mechanism studies typically involve the characterization of products, and intermediates are often characterized by (sub)millisecond techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, while femto/attosecond spectroscopies are used to elucidate the evolution of transition states and electron dynamics. However, due to the lack of detection techniques in the microsecond to nanosecond range, as well as the emergent complexity with increasing scale, most of the proposed intermediates have not yet been detected, which significantly hinders reaction optimization. Here, we present such a nanosecond-scale real-time single-molecule electrical monitoring technique. Using this technique, a series of hidden intermediates in an example Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction were directly observed, allowing the visualization of the reaction pathways, clarification of the two proposed proton transfer pathways, and quantitative description of their contributions to the turnover. Moreover, the emergent complexity of the catalysis, including the catalysis oscillation effect and the proton quantum tunneling effect, is further unveiled. Finally, this useful yet low-yield reaction was successfully catalyzed by the application of an electric field, leading to a high turnover frequency (∼5000 s −1 at a 1 V bias voltage). This new paradigm of mechanistic study and reaction optimization shows potential application in scalable synthesis by integrated single-molecule electronic devices on chip.},

Technological progress has led to the creation of comprehensive reference maps of proteomes, identification of over 90% of human protein-coding genes, and detailed cellular and molecular landscapes within organs. Proteomics has significantly advanced health monitoring and disease surveillance by developing aging models, predicting disease risks with superior protein risk scores, identifying biomarkers for early conditions like dementia, and securing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for multiple cancer biomarkers. By providing deeper insights into the proteome's complexity and dynamics, proteomics is revolutionizing our understanding, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, firmly establishing itself as a cornerstone of precision medicine.},

Here, we introduce Wastewater Analysis and Tracking for Epidemiological Recognition: Necessary Early Warning System (WATER NEWS)—a field clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats–diagnostic approach designed for robust and cost-effective pathogen detection in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). WATER NEWS combined a one-pot assay, an optimized reporter probe, on-site nucleic acid extraction, an improved freeze-drying process and a user-friendly, low-cost, battery-operated device, thereby overcoming the limitations of field-deployable wastewater surveillance. In evaluations across 25 WWTPs in 10 Chinese cities, WATER NEWS achieved sensitivities exceeding 90% and specificities of 100% in SARS-CoV-2 detection from the influent and effluent samples of WWTPs. Notably, the system consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 presence within 20 days at a local WWTP. Economic analysis reveals that our approach achieved a 6.5-fold cost reduction compared with clinical testing and costs nearly half that of traditional wastewater surveillance methods, making it a viable and sustainable option for wastewater surveillance.},

  abstract     = {Although deep-sea macroalgae sinking as a carbon sequestration strategy remains controversial, natural sinking of massive macroalgae frequently occurs in coastal oceans. In the Yellow Sea, millions of tons of the macroalga Ulva prolifera sink to the seafloor annually following green tides, yet their ultimate fate and carbon sequestration potential remain poorly understood. Microbial communities play a crucial role in decomposing organic matter and determining the fate of sunken macroalgae. Our 2-year simulated microbial degradation of U. prolifera revealed that approximately 38% of the carbon in sunken macroalgal biomass was ultimately sequestered in various forms. Of this retained carbon, 10% was transformed into dissolved inorganic bicarbonate ions, enhancing seawater alkalinity and contributing to inorganic carbon storage. Meanwhile, 28% was transformed into recalcitrant dissolved/particulate organic carbon and algal detritus, consisting of degradation-resistant compounds rich in humic-like substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and highly aromatic compounds. Metagenomic analysis showed that these transformations were driven by a coordinated microbial succession from r-strategists to K-strategists, mediated by a microbial carbon pump and a ‘microbially driven alkalinity pump’. Our findings suggest that large-scale sinking of U. prolifera holds substantial potential for long-term ocean carbon sequestration, contributing to stable carbon pools in both organic and inorganic forms.},

  abstract     = {Relay catalysis integrates multiple catalytic reactions to efficiently transform intermediates and enhance conversion and selectivity. However, designing these pathways and multifunctional catalysts is often lengthy and costly, heavily relying on in-depth literature analysis by experienced researchers. To address this, we developed an approach that combines a knowledge graph (KG) and large language models (LLMs) to automatically recommend multistep catalytic reaction pathways. Our method involves using an LLM-assisted workflow for data acquisition and organization, followed by the construction of a detailed catalysis knowledge graph (Cat-KG). After querying the Cat-KG, promising relay catalysis pathways are identified by applying scoring rules informed by expertise in relay catalysis. The LLM then transforms the structured pathways and reaction condition data into readable chemical equations and descriptions for chemists. This step integrates catalysis knowledge from the Cat-KG and helps avoid LLM-induced hallucinations by using reliable information. The method efficiently recommended relay catalysis pathways for ethylene, ethanol, 2,5-furandicarboxylate and other targets within minutes, identifying pathways consistent with reported ones while using different reaction conditions, validating its effectiveness. Thus, this strategy can extrapolate known and novel relay catalysis pathways, showcasing its potential for application in pathway selection.},

  abstract     = {The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe 2 , is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors in which electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe 2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0−11) surface termination of UTe 2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the centre of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state that exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ∼30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a -axis) of UTe 2 . Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe 2 , the asymmetric d I /d V spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviours of UTe 2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in a magnetic field.},

Herein, cyclic thioether 1,3-dithiane is reported as a novel electrolyte additive for fabricating ultra-stable lithium-metal batteries. Through the preferential decomposition of 1,3-dithiane additive and PF 6 − anion ions, robust inorganic-rich electrode interphases could be generated at both the anode and the cathode, which is conducive to enhanced kinetics and structural stability of the electrode interface, endowing alleviated active lithium loss and dendrite-free lithium deposition. Moreover, 1,3-dithiane would react with lithium alkylide to reduce the organic component in solid–electrolyte interphases and improve the ability of solvents to resist nucleophilic attack. Consequently, the assembled Li//LiFePO 4 full cells with 2.0 wt% of the 1,3-dithiane-containing electrolyte exhibit a significantly improved capacity retention of 83.6% after 3300 cycles at a current rate of 1.0 C, which highlights that the 1,3-dithiane additive could induce a long-lifespan lithium-metal battery.},

Herein, we report the development of antibody-γδ T cell conjugates for enhanced tumor therapy. By evaluating different biomolecules residing on the cell surface, sialic acids—the terminal sugars of various cell-surface glycans—are identified as the optimum site for anchoring antibodies onto γδ T cells via metabolic glycan labeling with unnatural sugars containing a bioorthogonal functional group. A programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-specific nanobody (αPD-L1) is conjugated onto γδ T cells via click chemistry and the resulting αPD-L1-γδ T cells exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity towards PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines, patient-derived primary cancer cells, and xenografted tumors in living mice. Mechanistically, αPD-L1-γδ T cells target cancer cells and tumors via binding to PD-L1 and induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, αPD-L1-γδ T cells remodel the tumor microenvironment to be immune-active, at least partially through the recruitment and activation of CD8 + T cells via the CCR5/CCL5 axis.

Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations substantiated the structure–activity relationship of the molecules, the excited-state energy dissipation pathways and the impact of intramolecular motions on photophysical properties, while elucidating the mechanism of the AIE phenomenon.

Using –OH surface coverage as a key indicator for assessing the extent of surface reactions, simulation is used to optimize the baffle number and shape. The optimal baffle design reduced surface film non-uniformity on the object surface from 35.46% to 5.75%, shortened the purge time from 12.8 to 9.7 s, and increased precursor utilization by 7%. Ideal Al 2 O 3 films exhibited a fluorinated plasma etching rate of 1.11 nm min −1 , five times stronger than non-ideal films (5.19 nm min −1 ), indicating superior plasma etching resistance.},

Perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs) have garnered significant attention due to their tunable bandgaps, high output voltage etc. Long-term stability is the most critical hurdle for the commercialization of PIPVs and is under intense market scrutiny. The stability of self-assembled monolayers in inverted PIPVs plays a pivotal role in determining device stability. In this work, we employ an interlocking self-assembled monolayer strategy that enhances device stability by improving film coverage. Optimized devices achieve a record indoor photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of 42.01% under 1000 lx illumination. Furthermore, in the accelerated aging stability test simulating a day/night cycle with light intensity fluctuating from 2000 to 0 lx, the projected T90 lifespan of the final target device approaches 6000 h. Ultimately, the PIPV module, through the integration of integrated circuits, achieved continuous and reliable operation of an electronic price tag.},

Here, we report that giant UMR occurs also in single-layer magnetic metals and exhibits high-order contributions and a universal sum rule, which agree well with the physics origin of the recently proposed two-vector magnetoresistance that simply considers electron scattering by the magnetization vector and interfacial electric field, without the need for any relevance to the spin/orbital current or crystalline symmetry. Revisiting of the literature data reveals that the most representative data that were used to claim spin Hall magnetoresistance or other magnetoresistances related or unrelated to spin current can be understood unifiedly by using the two-vector MR theory. Experimental and theoretical results against spin-current-related magnetoresistances, but not two-vector magnetoresistance, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Achieving sub-ångström resolution has long been restricted to sophisticated aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM). Recent advances in computational super-resolution techniques, such as deconvolution and electron ptychography, have enabled uncorrected STEM to achieve sub-ångström resolution without the need for delicate aberration correctors. However, these methods have strict requirements for sample thickness and thus have yet to be widely implemented. In this study, we introduce SARDiffuse—a deep-learning diffusion model designed to enhance spatial resolution and correct the noise level of uncorrected STEM images. Trained with experimental AC-STEM data, SARDiffuse has the capability to restore high-frequency information of STEM images, enabling sub-ångström resolution in an uncorrected microscope. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model on representative materials, including silicon, strontium titanate and gallium nitride, achieving substantial improvements (<1 Å) in spatial resolution. Detailed statistical analysis confirms that SARDiffuse reliably preserves atomic positions, demonstrating that it is a powerful tool for high-precision material characterization. Furthermore, SARDiffuse effectively mitigates spherical-aberration-induced artifacts, outperforming current methods in artifact correction. Meanwhile, the background information of images, such as thickness variation or carbon contamination distribution, is also preserved. This work highlights the potential of deep learning to realize sub-ångström-resolution imaging in the uncorrected electron microscope, offering a cost-effective alternative to delicate AC-STEM when imaging conventional single crystals.},

  abstract     = {The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays a central role in the oxidation of methane and many other reduced gases in the Earth's atmosphere. The inter-annual changes of global mean OH concentrations are poorly constrained, posing challenges to understanding annual methane budgets. Here, we use observations of multiple atmospheric species to investigate the anomaly of global OH concentration in 2020. We develop a new method to infer the zonal distribution of OH concentrations from satellite carbon monoxide (CO) observations. This method finds that the global OH concentration reduced by 4.0% ± 0.9% in 2020 relative to 2018–2019 and that the reduction occurred in both Northern (2.4% ± 1.2%) and Southern (5.7% ± 1.2%) Hemispheres. This result is also consistent with our analysis of methane and methyl chloroform observations. Atmospheric chemistry simulations suggest that the OH reduction in the Northern Hemisphere is primarily explained by reduced reactive nitrogen emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns and in the Southern Hemisphere partly by enhanced reactive carbon emissions from extreme Australian fires, hence resulting in distinct chemical mechanisms for OH reduction in the two hemispheres. This contrast is further supported by opposite anomalies in hemispheric tropospheric ozone observed by satellite. Our results highlight the critical role of both anthropogenic and natural perturbations in reduced atmospheric oxidation and rapid methane increases in 2020. This has important implications for future scenarios, given the projected decrease in anthropogenic emissions and increase in fire emissions.},

  abstract     = {Determining the composition, formation mechanisms and stability of the Hadean continental crust is essential for understanding the early geological history of Earth. Detrital zircons, largely from Jack Hills of Western Australia, provide the dominant direct records for the nature of continental crust during the Hadean eon and its formation processes. Although isotope and trace element compositions of these zircons are extensively determined, the major and trace element compositions of their host rocks and corresponding parental magmas remain largely debated, making the nature and evolution of the early Earth's crust ambiguous. Here, based on the comprehensive datasets for global magmatic zircons and their host rocks, we have developed machine learning models to reconstruct multiple major and trace element concentrations of the parental magmas from which Jack Hills zircons grew. The results show that the Hadean continental crust had SiO₂ contents ranging from 58 to 78 wt% with K₂O/Na₂O and Sr/Y ratios in the range of 0.1–1.2, and 1–103, respectively. It was generally not andesitic in lithochemistry, but rather felsic and dominated by low- to medium-pressure tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG) and potassic granites. These rocks would be derived from partial melting of low- and high-potassium mafic proto-crust, respectively, with the latter also incorporating contributions from tonalite. The lack of high-pressure TTGs does not preclude their formation at convergent plate margins, but suggests that the Hadean felsic crust would originate from the collisionally thickened rather than the deeply subducted oceanic crust. Therefore, the formation of continental crust on the Hadean Earth can be explained by the operation of convergent tectonics, outlining a petrogenetic model for Archean TTG rocks.},

  abstract     = {Inland waters (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) serve as important regulators of global climate change and carbon (C) cycling. China's inland water systems significantly regulate regional C budgets. However, our understanding of the long-term spatiotemporal patterns and underlying mechanisms of dissolved carbon (DC) storages and fluxes in inland waters remains limited. This study examined lake and reservoir DC storage and river DC flux, quantifying their changes in China over the past three decades. We found that inland water DC stocks in China increased from 96 Tg C in the 1990s to 142 Tg C in the 2010s while DC river flux did not significantly change (13.2 ± 0.4 Tg C/yr). Findings also showed that a combination of climate change, anthropogenic disturbance, and water chemistry collectively drove inland water DC dynamics. River DC was more directly driven by climate and anthropogenic factors (>50%) while lakes and reservoirs were more directly influenced by water chemistry (>70%). Additionally, climate factors can explain changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations via water chemistry factors (i.e. electrical conductivity (EC) and pH), while, collectively, climate and the nutrient status can typically explain changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. This study emphasizes the important role that inland water plays in the global C balance and underscores the necessity of considering it in future C budgets.},

  abstract     = {Nickel (Ni)-based single crystalline superalloys are the most important high-temperature service metallic materials for aircraft engine blades. These alloys’ microstructures and mechanical properties must remain stable under high temperature and stress conditions for long periods of time. Rhenium (Re) has been the most effective alloying element, which serves as a guide to distinguish the third-generation Ni-based single crystalline superalloys. However, the Re-alloying effect seems to have been exhausted in terms of further improving superalloy creep lives, although the continuous demand for longer creep lives at high temperatures persists. This study uses the mixing enthalpy alloying route by combining negative enthalpy (N-enthalpy) alloying and positive enthalpy (P-enthalpy) alloying strategies to explore a new alloying paradigm in which the Os element is uniquely selected. The P-enthalpy effect of osmium (Os) with Ni leads to the segregation of Os elements along the γ/γ′ interface, which, in turn, yields a small-size γ′ phase and narrower γ channels by the P-enthalpy-produced interface effect and size effect. The N-enthalpy effect of Os with chromium (Cr) and other alloying elements further synchronizes the formation of local chemical ordering in the γ phase channel. These synergistic interface and size effects, together with local chemical ordering, increase the stability of the microstructure and the resistance of the dislocation movement. With these, the creep life of the Os N-enthalpy alloying superalloys approaches 1273 h under 760°C/800 MPa conditions, which is almost six times more than that of the base alloy, setting a high record among all existing metals and alloys. These findings highlight the mixing enthalpy alloying paradigm of designing new materials with excellent high-temperature performance.},

Mg₃(Sb, Bi)₂ and MgAgSb, with their excellent thermoelectric performance near room temperature, have emerged as cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to Bi₂Te₃-based materials. However, the development of high-performance Mg-based thermoelectric devices faces significant challenges due to the inherent high chemical reactivity and volatility of Mg elements, coupled with the phase transition-induced degradation of thermoelectric properties in MgAgSb, which collectively led to poor interfacial contacts and device integration. In this study, a Mg-based thermoelectric device consisting of n-type Mg₃(Sb, Bi)₂ and p-type MgAgSb has been fabricated with Mg₂Ni as the unified contact layer for both materials. The Ni-Sn transient liquid-phase (TLP) low-temperature bonding technology has been employed for the integration of the thermoelectric device. In addition, thermal aging and cycling tests confirmed the long-term stability of the Mg₂Ni/TE contact interfaces and the Ni-Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) joints. Notably, the device with segmented n-type legs achieves an exceptional conversion efficiency of ∼10.8% at a temperature difference of 300 K.

Collocating the functions of these units into a single device for in-display neuromorphic computing (IDNC) shows great promise in overcoming these challenges. Herein, we report an all-in-one electrically programmable IDNC (EP-IDNC) device that leverages the electrochromism of organic semiconductors. The electrochromism empowers the EP-IDNC device with synaptic and neural behaviors (e.g. multi-terminal operability, multi-level weight update, spatiotemporal information encoding), as well as the capability to visually display computing results through color changes.

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric materials are advanced functional semiconductors for the forthcoming era of energy conversion. The development in this field critically depends on the understanding of their band structures. However, many analyses rely on the parabolic band model that oversimplifies the realistic electron behavior. Such simplification leads to significant deviations in the predicted behavior of electrical transport properties due to the non-local characteristics of the Seebeck coefficient and the Lorenz number. This study introduces a nonparabolicity factor ξ , which quantitatively measures the deviations from parabolic dispersion in semiconductor band structures and can also directly predict the thermoelectric performance change induced by the band nonparabolicity. Notably, our results reveal that the influence of band nonparabolicity is significant when estimating the Lorenz number. We have formulated a universal ξ modified solution for the Lorenz number, which can effectively correct the non-physical lattice thermal conductivity derived from the typical parabolic band model in various representative thermoelectric semiconductors, establishing a basis for further insights into the underlying mechanisms of electrical and thermal transport.},

  abstract     = {Molecular catalysts facilitate electrochemical conversion by changing their oxidation states to transfer electrons. However, this redox-mediated mechanism features stepwise electron transfer and substrate activation in separate elementary steps, thereby resulting in an inherent loss in efficiency. Here, we synthesize a two-dimensional (2D) iron phthalocyanine (FePc) material and uncover its non-mediated electron transfer behavior in electrocatalysis, which overcomes the conventional redox-mediated limitation in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway that molecular catalysts face. The 2D geometry enables the FePc molecules to be positioned within the electrochemical double layer, enabling electrons to directly transfer to oxygen reactants, prior to the Fe(II/III) redox. This functions in a manner akin to a metal catalyst thereby opening a redox-decoupled ORR mechanism. As a result, the reported 2D FePc molecular catalyst exhibits unprecedented ORR half-wave potential at 0.945 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, achieving efficient application in zinc-air batteries and H 2 /O 2 fuel cells. These findings open new possibilities in voltage efficient, redox-decoupled molecular catalysis that integrates strengths of molecules and materials in one synergistic system.},

It also delivers exceptional stereocontrol (up to 93% ee for quaternary stereocenters) and enables advanced allylic transformations within a green framework through additional synergistic catalysis.

  abstract     = {Complex disease progression typically involves sudden and non-linear transitions accompanied by devastating effects. Uncovering such critical states or pre-disease stages and discovering dynamic network biomarkers (signaling molecules) is vital for both comprehending disease progression and preventing or delaying disease deterioration. However, the detection of critical points using high-dimensional limited sample data or single-cell data proves notably challenging, as traditional statistical approaches often fail to deliver accurate results. In this study, based on optimal transport theory and Gaussian graphical models, we present an innovative computational framework, the sample-perturbed Gaussian graphical model (sPGGM), designed to analyze disease progression and identify pre-disease stages at the specific sample/cell level. Specifically, by employing population-level optimal transport and Gaussian graphical models, the proposed sPGGM effectively characterizes dynamic differences between the baseline distribution and the perturbed distribution relative to the specific case sample, thus enabling the identification of pre-disease stages and the discovery of signaling molecules during disease progression. The reliability and effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by conducting a simulated dataset and evaluating various data types, including four single-cell datasets, influenza infection data, and six distinct bulk tumour datasets. In comparison with existing single-sample methods, our proposed method exhibits improved capability in pinpointing critical point or pre-disease stages. Moreover, the effectiveness of computational results is highlighted through the analysis of the functional roles of signaling molecules.},

Large-scale historical biogeographic analyses of 851 terrestrial vertebrate species and their relatives (totaling 4862 species) reveal that multiple evolutionary pathways formed this biodiversity hotspot. Whereas in situ speciation dominates in amphibians and non-avian reptiles, near-equal in situ speciation and colonization occurs in mammals, and colonization happens primarily in birds. HDM are a ‘cradle’ for neo-endemics and a ‘sink’ receiving surrounding biotas, mostly (>30%) coming from the Indo-Malay region. Orogenesis and monsoon intensification triggered in situ speciation initiated in the early Oligocene and peaking around 7–8 Ma. Analyses of different taxonomic groups reveal contrasting evolutionary processes and how major geo-climatic events override taxon-specific attributes. Results highlight the need to incorporate taxon-specific traits into future conservation planning to effectively address the unique needs and challenges of different groups.},

We report an observation of polarization-encoded QKD using a room-temperature telecom SPS based on a GaN defect. A field test over 3.5 km of deployed fiber with 4.0-dB loss yielded a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 5.0% and a secure key rate of 585.9 bps. Further testing in a 32.5-km fiber spool (attenuation of 11.2 dB), which exhibited substantially lower polarization mode dispersion, yielded a QBER of 3.2% and a secure key rate of 50.4 bps.

Exploring the pathogenesis and especially the heterogenicity features of long COVID subgroups is of paramount importance for understanding its etiology. In this study, through integrative multi-omics analyses encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, long COVID patients exhibited overall elevated MAPK pathway activation, while patients who have recovered from long COVID showed down-regulation of this response. Long COVID heterogenicity is described by multi-omics distinct signatures for each subgroup. The Multisystemic (MULTI) symptom subgroup is characterized by enhanced glycerophospholipid and ether lipid metabolism, Neurological (NEU) by augmented glycoprotein synthesis metabolism, Cardio cerebral (CACRB) by increased pyruvate metabolism and suppressed macrophage polarization, Musculoskeletal + Systemic (MSK + SYST) by elevated glycerophospholipid metabolism, and Cardiopulmonary (CAPM) by inhibited NF-κB signaling pathways. ABHD17A, CSNK1D, PSME4 and SYVN1 were general long COVID combination biomarkers, while CRH (MULTI), FPGT (NEU), CBX6 (CACRB) and RBBP4 (CAPM) were selected as serum-specific subgroup proteins.

  abstract     = {For energy storage applications involving sulfur redox reactions, uniformly dispersed metal sites in sulfur hosts serve as an effective approach to facilitate electron transfer during charge and discharge cycles. In this study, we exploited a facile method to construct transitional single-atom catalysts to overcome the kinetic limitations for electron transportation in room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries. By the synergistic effect of polysulfide adsorption and p–d orbital hybridization between catalysts and intermediates, electron-donating and electron-capturing capabilities of different atomic sites towards sulfur redox reactions are systematically revealed. Remarkably, atomic Mn–N 4 active moiety structures possess abundant unfilled antibonding orbitals, promoting p–d hybridization and leading to superior sulfur conversion reactions. This work establishes a design paradigm for single-atom catalysts in metal–sulfur batteries by linking atomic-scale electronic features to macroscopic performance. This atomic-level engineering strategy paves the way for high-energy-density room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries, with potential extensions to other multivalent sulfur-based energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Macroevolutionary forces, such as rare catastrophes, have repeatedly disrupted and reset the evolutionary trajectories of Earth's major organismal groups. The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K/Pg) extinction event, approximately 66 Ma, resulted in the demise of ∼75% of all species at the time, yet despite its magnitude, many major organismal lineages successfully passed through this mass extinction. The evolutionary origins of modern birds (crown-group Aves) remain a subject of substantial debate, as they are often thought to have undergone their primary diversification following the K/Pg boundary. In this review, we summarize the various approaches that have been applied to understanding the timing of avian diversification. We examine the inferred divergence times derived from modern phylogenomic studies based on datasets comprising 50 to over 300 whole genomes. Additionally, we evaluate the factors contributing to the continued discrepancies in divergence time estimates. Furthermore, we discuss significant new fossil discoveries from the Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous periods that reshape our understanding of key evolutionary events in early avian diversification. Taken together, the paleontological evidence increasingly supports a Cretaceous origin for many extant bird lineages, with the major burst of ordinal diversification likely occurring prior to the K/Pg boundary—concurrent with the early radiations of flowering plants, pollinating insects, mammals, fishes and other groups that characterized the Cretaceous Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution.},

  abstract     = {Aluminum metal batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium batteries for large-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity, cost efficiency and improved safety features. However, a significant challenge lies in the polycrystalline surface nature of aluminum foil anodes, which can result in uneven aluminum deposition and increase the risk of a short circuit during cycling. Here we report a selective facet-etching method to construct a 3D porous aluminum anode (3D-Al) featuring near-single exposed (220) plane on the surface, enabling dendrite-free behavior and ultra-long cycling for aluminum batteries. The chemical etching mechanism is elucidated to showcase selective removal of the (111) and (200) planes, while preserving (220), which induces directional aluminum plating along the (220) plane. Further, the resulting 3D-Al anode possesses abundant pores and cavities, which serve as preferential sites for aluminum deposition, alleviating volume expansion and effectively inhibiting dendrite growth. The assembled 3D-Al||graphite battery displays excellent rate capability and an ultralong lifespan over 13 000 cycles at a high rate of 10.0 A g −1 . This work provides a facile yet effective strategy for suppressing aluminum dendrite formation and establishes a new avenue for advancing high-performance aluminum batteries.},

However, limited electrode options, especially cathodes, stably perform in acidic electrolytes and many of them show large voltage decreases along with the depth of discharge. Herein, an all-phosphate configuration is proposed to open up an avenue for a promising category of metal phosphate electrodes. Fe 2+/3+ and Mn 2+/3+ are investigated, for the first time, as example redox couples of phosphates for anode and cathode, respectively. The dynamic electronic and structural variations during the proton (de)-insertion process are captured using in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In-situ distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis reveals that the insufficient charge transfer hinders the performance, which is optimized by forming a phosphate-carbon composite. An NH 4 MnPO 4 ·H 2 O-carbon composite presents a capacity of 121 mAh g −1 with flat voltage profiles and excellent high-rate performance at 150 A g −1 .

These limitations significantly hinder their capacity to meet the exponentially growing demand for energy storage solutions.

Such technological advancements are crucial for enabling next-generation energy storage and advancing global carbon neutrality objectives.

  abstract     = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a significant component of airborne particles that impacts air quality, health, and climate globally. Aqueous-phase reactions contribute substantially to SOA mass. However, this process is primarily treated as occurring in submicron particles that contain water, or within cloud droplets in state-of-the-art models. Here, we challenged this conventional view by showing that >50% of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), predominantly SOA, is found in supermicron particles during dust events downwind of Saharan and Asian dust sources. Even on non-dust days, supermicron WSOC contributes 25%–51% of total WSOC. Microscopic analyses revealed that organic matter was only detected on aged dust containing a calcium nitrate coating, which contains water at typical ambient relative humidity conditions. This suggests that it is the water-containing nitrate coating that facilitates aqueous-phase SOA formation. By incorporating the reactive uptake of glyoxal, a key precursor of SOA, into a global model, we significantly improved the model's performance in reproducing supermicron particle contributions to total WSOC observed in the field. Using this improved model, aqueous-phase SOA formed on dust particles over the land contributes to 16% of total SOA and 28% of total aqueous-phase SOA, with levels reaching up to 67% and 74% across the ‘dust belt’, respectively. These results underscore the important role of aqueous-phase reactions in aged nitrate-containing dust in SOA formation, which should be incorporated into global models to quantify their potential implications for air quality, health, and climate.},

Among them, iron-based aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are a compelling choice for future energy storage systems due to their excellent safety, cost-effectiveness and scalability. However, the advancement of various types of iron-based ARFBs is hindered by several critical challenges, including hydrogen evolution, inferior reversibility of metal deposition and stripping, and undesirable dendrite formation in hybrid flow systems with metal plating/stripping on the negative electrode. Additionally, all-soluble iron-based ARFBs face limitations in redox species solubility and electrolyte stability. To address these issues, various strategies have been developed, such as modifications to electrolytes, electrodes and separators, as well as flow stack optimization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of iron-based ARFBs, categorizing them into dissolution-deposition and all-soluble flow battery systems. It highlights recent advancements in the field and explores future prospects, focusing on four key areas: materials innovation and mechanistic understanding; flow battery system design and engineering; new electrochemistry explorations; and interdisciplinary strategies.

However, they still face challenges such as low anodic stability limits and poor interfacial compatibility with high-voltage cathode active materials. Here, we present a series of fluorine-doped argyrodite sulfide SSEs, Li 5.5 PS 4.5 Cl 1.5–x F x (LPSCl 1.5–x F x ) (0 < x ≤ 1.5), toward high-voltage LiCoO 2 (LCO)-based ASSLBs, via the in situ formation of a stable fluorine-containing passivating interphase on the cathode active materials surface. Notably, fluorine incorporation significantly raises the practical oxidation limit of LPSCl 1.5 from 2.4 to 3.5 V for LPSClF 0.5 , while maintaining a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 3.3 mS cm –1 . This enhancement is attributed to increased lithium-ion disorder and fluorine's high electronegativity. The ASSLBs, fabricated by directly assembling an LPSClF 0.5 SSE with an uncoated commercial LCO cathode, demonstrate stable cycling with low polarization voltage at 4.3 V (vs. Li + /Li), achieving 92.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 0.2 C. Remarkably, even under a 4.6 V high-voltage condition, our battery maintains 96.2% capacity retention over 300 cycles, attributed to the in situ formation of a stable fluorine-containing cathode–electrolyte interphase on the LCO surface. When coupled with a lithium metal anode, Li|LPSClF 0.5 |LCO ASSLB achieved stable cycling at 4.6 V and delivered 137 mAh g –1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. Significantly, the Si|LPSCl 1.5 |LPSClF 0.5 |LCO ASSLB, cycled at an ultra-high mass loading LCO of 203.8 mg cm –2 , exhibits an exceptional areal capacity of 25.7 mAh cm –2 , demonstrating immense potential of LPSClF 0.5 SSE for practical high-energy ASSLBs.},

Yet, the muscle–bone dynamic alterations under intermittent hypoxia (IH) remain unclear, primarily due to the lack of suitable microphysiological models. Herein, we developed a novel musculoskeletal organoids-on-chip (MSK OoC), advancing an integrated study of muscle–bone biochemical communication and personalized interventional strategies. Within this MSK OoC, muscle organoids (MOs) replicate in vivo micro-architecture, while bone organoids mimic both the formation and remodeling processes. Utilizing MSK OoC, we discovered that IH-induced muscle pathology suppressed osteogenesis but stimulated osteoclastogenesis. The mitochondria protein Sirt3 in muscle played a pivotal role in regulating bone metabolism via myokine Cxcl5. Besides, mitochondria-targeting sequence-mediated Sirt3 overexpression in MOs effectively reversed bone deterioration. To validate mitochondria-targeted therapeutics, a Janus silica nano-vehicle was adopted to deliver resveratrol upon MSK OoC, effectively rescuing the pathological muscle–bone dysfunction. This study highlights the potential of the MSK OoC platform for investigating interorgan communication and developing precise nanomedicine therapies.},

  abstract     = {The demand for deep human–machine fusion propels the development of artificial neurons. However, emulating the neuronal spiking in aqueous environments remains challenging. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently shown promise in neuromorphic engineering compatible with aqueous operation. Here, we report a MOF neuron with real neurotransmitter—dopamine (DA)—tunable spikes for the first time. Based on the DA mediation, some sophisticated neuronal functions, including integration-and-firing, synaptic facilitation-induced spike broadening and DA-tunable spiking number and width, were mimicked. DA-mediated spikes in this MOF neuron were further implemented to exquisitely control peripheral equipment. This work introduces the concept of a MOF neuron interfaced with a real neurotransmitter in fluids, providing a new perspective for artificial neuron development.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing molecular bridges presents a promising means to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, concurrently bridging the perovskite absorber and its two adjacent interfaces remains a significant challenge that is yet to be achieved. Here, we construct dual molecular bridges at perovskite heterointerfaces, enabled by a self-organizing additive of 4-fluoro-phenethylammonium formate (4-F-PEAFa) and a synthesized hole transporter of [2-(7H-dibenzo[c, g]carbazol-7-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (DBZ-2PACz). The molecular bridges spanning two interfaces lead to the formation of an ‘integral carrier transport pathway’, mitigating both non-radiative recombination and charge-transport losses in the fabricated PSC devices. We thus achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.0% (25.6% certified) in inverted PSCs, accompanied by an exceptionally high fill factor of 0.87 (maximum 0.88 from the certified devices, 97% of its Shockley–Queisser limit) and a low ideality factor of 1.06. The unencapsulated devices retain 96% of their PCEs after aging at 85°C for 2200 h and 90% after maximum power point tracking at an elevated temperature of 50°C for 973 h.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-quality electrical contact at metal/organic semiconductor interfaces is crucial for unlocking the full potential of single-crystal organic thin-film transistors (SC OTFTs). However, the delicate nature of organic single-crystalline films (OSCFs) and the harsh metal deposition process often introduce trap states at the interface, limiting SC-OTFT performance. Here, we present a transparent electrical contact concept that leverages the in situ spontaneous reaction of fluorinated thiol molecules with the electrode, enhancing the buried metal/OSCF contacts. This method significantly lowers the Schottky barrier height by 73.3% and mitigates the Fermi-level pinning effect, resulting in over a 16-fold reduction in contact resistance. As a result, 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene ( ⁠ C 8 -BTBT) OTFTs achieve a high average reliable mobility ( ⁠ μ r ⁠ ) of 13.2 cm 2 V − 1 s − 1 and a reliability factor up to 89%, surpassing previously reported values. Device simulations indicate that the concentration of tail and deep states is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of free states contributing to charge transport, suggesting near-ideal trap-free charge transport. These findings position our molecular contact upgrading method as a promising technology for advancing organic electronics.},

This system utilizes vision sensors featuring an Al 2 O 3 /two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (2D PVK) heterostructural dielectric and MoS 2 /black phosphorus (BP)/MoS 2 heterostructural channel, which exhibits persistent nonvolatility and fully light-tunable positive and negative photoresponses when exposed to 1064 nm and 532 nm light, respectively. Notably, when combined with edge extraction circuit design, our vision system achieves all-day visual perception with a 99.0% recognition accuracy for driving scenario information.

  abstract     = {Lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) oxides are regarded as one of the most promising cathode materials for next-generation batteries. However, their poor rate capability and performance degradation during cycling present significant challenges for practical applications. Understanding how to optimize their microscopic structures during synthesis may provide critical insights for enhancing their performance. In this work, we investigated the structural evolution during the solid-state sintering of Li 1.2 Ni 0.2 Mn 0.6 O 2 from Li-/Mn-/Ni-carbonate precursors. Combining X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, we observed the nucleation of a nanoscaled solid-solution phase at 550°C, accompanied by secondary phases of spinel-like, layered and rock salt. At 800°C, a relatively pure solid-solution phase R3̅m is formed. Notably, we uncovered, for the first time, a phase transition from a solid-solution structure to a chemically separated two-phase structure when annealing the sample from 850°C to 900°C. Atomic resolution scanning-TEM (STEM) imaging clearly distinguished the C2/m phase from the R3̅m phase, separated by a coherent grain boundary, as confirmed by using STEM–energy-dispersion spectroscopy mapping. Our calculations indicate that the diffusion of Ni²⁺ induced by high-temperature activation plays a significant role in facilitating the phase separation. The relatively large chemically separated two-phase structure is expected to exhibit different performance characteristics compared with the previously reported nanosized two-phase structures, providing a new foundation for further improving high-energy-density LMR cathodes.},

The product selectivity of the ORR is strongly correlated with the nature of the catalyst. We report herein that alkali-metal cations (AM + ) can steer the product selectivity of the ORR catalysed on a molecular model catalyst with Co–N 4 sites. The electron-transfer number of the ORR increases with Li + ≈ Na + < K + < Rb + < Cs + . A series of electrochemical measurements reveal the 2e − +2e − ORR pathway in large AM + electrolytes at neutral pH. In situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy resolves the formation of high-contrast species in the cobalt octaethylporphine (CoOEP) monolayer on Au(111) in large AM + electrolytes when the ORR occurs. The high-contrast species is assigned to the HO 2 − , as the 2e − ORR product, adsorbed on CoOEP. Combined electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy, electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that large AM + can stabilize HO 2 − on CoOEP and promote its further reduction, which accounts for the AM + -dependent selectivity of the ORR. Revealing the unrecognized effect of AM + on ORR selectivity opens up new avenues for modulating the distribution of ORR products by adjusting the electrolyte composition.},

The Q -weighted mode density considers mode density, resonant frequencies, radiative loss and intrinsic loss of multiple resonant modes, providing a comprehensive approach to governing broadband absorption properties. By optimizing the number of resonant modes and managing intrinsic losses, our approach achieves an intensive Q -weighted mode density across an ultrawide bandwidth, enabling ultrabroadband absorption with high efficiency.

  abstract     = {The Jurassic Period was characterized by the dominance of dinosaurs and the rise of early mammals, with the Yanliao Biota (∼167–157 Ma) in East Asia notable for its exceptional fossil preservation and diverse life forms. However, the drivers of the flourishing of the Yanliao Biota remain unclear. Here, we reconstruct the palaeoclimate and habitat characteristics of the Yanliao Biota by using sedimentary facies analysis, organic carbon-isotope data, palynological records, source weathering trends and climate simulations from the Community Earth System Model CESM 1.2.2. The studied sedimentary successions are well constrained to the Middle Jurassic based on carbon-isotope stratigraphic correlation and published tuff zircon U–Pb ages. Our findings reveal a regional climate shift in the late Bathonian, transitioning from wet to sub-humid conditions, as evidenced by an increase in gymnosperm pollen, a marked decline in coal seams and reduced weathering intensity. Sedimentological evidence further supports a synchronous facies change from ever-wet fluvial-delta systems to seasonally active alluvial plains. This climate shift aligns with simulation results and coincides temporally with the initial flourishing of the Yanliao Biota. We propose that this shift, associated with lithospheric extension in the Yanliao region, increased landscape heterogeneity and habitat diversity, fostering biological evolution through ecological isolation and allopatric speciation, ultimately driving the diversification of the Yanliao Biota.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries hold promise as a compelling alternative to current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost and the natural abundance of sulfur. However, the practical realization of Li–S batteries has been plagued by the longstanding trade-off issue between polysulfide shuttle suppression and Li⁺ transport. Here, we report an ion channel-gated covalent organic framework (COF) as an ionic diode membrane strategy to address this conflicting requirement. By tuning the chemical structure of tethered anions, the resulting COF features 1D anionic channels with optimized charge delocalization and pore size. The bulky anions enhance Li⁺ dissociation and conduction while effectively repelling polysulfides dissolved from S cathodes. Additionally, the COF ionic diode mitigates self-discharge and inhibits parasitic reactions. Consequently, Li–S cells assembled with the COF ionic diode improve charge/discharge capacities and cycle life under constrained operating conditions.},

Yet, how losses in forest biodiversity affect soil N 2 O fluxes remains poorly understood. Here, we combined a global tree diversity–forest soil N 2 O data set, including 201 paired comparable observations from global forests, with a three-year field survey of in-situ flux data gathered from a long-term plant diversity field experiment. Our analyses reveal that tree diversity has a significant negative effect on soil N 2 O emissions, primarily driven by a decrease in N 2 O production associated with denitrification. More specifically, we showed that reductions in N 2 O emissions with tree diversity can be attributed to a decrease in the availability of soil inorganic nitrogen. Predictive modeling further shows that compared to forests with a single tree species, forests with two tree species can reduce global forest N 2 O emissions by 10.39%, while those with 24 tree species achieve the maximum mitigation effect, reducing emissions by 56.30%. Taken together, our work highlights the contribution of tree diversity for mitigating N 2 O emissions, highlighting the importance of accounting for biodiversity when reforesting old forests and supporting new afforestation processes.},

  abstract     = {The mechanisms of ultrafast laser-induced demagnetization of ferromagnets have been among the most heavily debated topics in ultrafast magnetism from the very beginning of the field. Here, we demonstrate that the timescale and the efficiency of ultrafast demagnetization of two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe 3 GeTe 2 , excited by femtosecond laser pulses, can be efficiently accelerated by an external magnetic field. With a 1 T magnetic field at Curie temperature ( T C ) = 210 K femtosecond laser excitation causes demagnetization of the ferromagnet by 79% within 22.2 ps, while the application of the field at 7 T can suppress the demagnetization efficiency down to 52% and accelerate the process so that it is completed within 9.9 ps. We also reveal that the efficiency and the timescale can be varied in a similar way by changing the temperature of the sample, and the magneto-effect is more pronounced in the middle temperature region (90 to 210 K). Based on these observations we propose a thermodynamic explanation of the findings within the frames of a three-temperature model and without the involvement of any peculiarities to the electronic structure of van der Waals materials. Hence, our work emphasizes that controlling ultrafast demagnetization with the help of an applied magnetic field must be a general phenomenon, which is not limited to van der Waals materials, and thus must also be observed in other magnets.},

  abstract     = {Methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas (AOG) wells are significant but poorly quantified, contributing to uncertainties in global greenhouse gas inventories and hindering progress toward net-zero emission targets. In fact, the actual level of methane emissions from AOG wells worldwide and the geological characteristics of the wells remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a resource-type-specific, comprehensive inventory of methane emissions from 4.5 million AOG wells across 127 countries as of 2022, including detailed well-level data for 420 000 wells (9% of the total). We estimate global methane emissions from AOG wells at 0.4 Mt in 2022. Historical cumulative emissions are estimated at 11.2–12.6 Mt, of which 90% originate from unplugged wells. Over the period 2023–50, methane emissions from the AOG wells included in our inventory are projected to be 9.9 Mt in the absence of any decarbonization intervention (slightly higher than Spain's annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2019). Plugging abandoned wells is critical to reducing emissions, with potential mitigation of 53%–61% over 2023–50. High-emitting wells—particularly those tied to major oil and gas producers—should be prioritized. This study provides refined estimates of methane emissions and possible mitigation pathways for global AOG wells at well/country levels that have been overlooked in global greenhouse gas emissions inventories.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic dissociation equilibrium of phosphate in living organisms plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance necessary for sustaining life. In the field of metal clusters, [H 3− x PO 4 ] x − ( x = 1–3) anions also serve as effective templates for constructing silver clusters, with their innate structural flexibility bringing tremendous promise for structural regulation. However, current understanding of the effects of phosphate balance on the dynamic assembly of high-nuclearity silver clusters (metal atom number > 100) remains limited. In this study, we first demonstrate that different forms of phosphates (orthophosphate, hydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate) can controllably provide tetrahedral PO 4 3− oxyanions in the basic environment, thereby directing the structural evolution of silver clusters. A multilayered, rosette-shaped 104-nuclei silver nanocluster ( Ag104a ) is successfully isolated by utilizing Na 3 PO 4 /Na 2 HPO 4 as the PO 4 3− source. This unique structure features a silver-containing (PO 4 )@Ag 4 @(PO 4 ) 12 template layer, enveloped by an outer Ag 100 shell composed of an Ag 72 garland and two Ag 14 units. Notably, Ag104a represents the silver alkynyl cluster with the highest number of encapsulated tetrahedral anions to date. In contrast, using NaH 2 PO 4 results in the formation of a different co-crystallized silver cluster: Ag104b·Ag108a . Time-dependent 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance analysis on the reaction solution reflected the different release rates of PO 4 3− anions, which can affect the assembly of silver clusters. This work not only makes a significant advancement in the structural regulation of high-nuclearity silver clusters by phosphates, but also offers valuable insights into the intricate interplay between phosphate balance and the dynamic assembly of silver clusters.},

Current prediction approaches are limited by oversimplified physical models, regionally focused databases, and retrospective statistical methods, which impede timely and accurate hazard assessments. To overcome these constraints, we developed the first comprehensive global database of ∼400 000 landslides associated with 38 of the most catastrophic earthquakes over the past 50 years. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed advanced deep-learning models that predict the probability of landsliding for any earthquake worldwide with an average spatial accuracy of ∼82% in less than a minute, without relying on prior local knowledge. Our framework enables swift disaster evaluation during the critical early hours following an earthquake while also enhancing pre-event hazard planning.

The weakly asymmetric topological surface states ensure that the spin currents in this system do not cancel out while facilitating high spin-to-charge conversion efficiency through spin-moment locking, thus unprecedentedly enabling SOT switching within a single layer. In experiments, we demonstrate a low critical current density of 7.3 × 10 5 A/cm 2 for switching in epitaxial MnSb 2 Te 4 thin films, alongside a substantial SOT efficiency of ∼41 at 6 K, consistent with micromagnetic simulations. Additionally, the development of in-situ epitaxial heterostructures of MnSb 2 Te 4 /FeTe 0.9 allows for the extraction of an exchange-bias-induced effective field, thereby enabling field-free SOT switching within these heterostructures.},

Herein, by regulating the coordination shell of boron (B) surrounding the Ni central atom, we have achieved the transformation of the reduction product from CO to CH 4 . In situ techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that B coordination in the second shell of the Ni–N–C motifs (Ni–N 4 –B/C) facilitates CO formation whereas incorporating B into the first shell (Ni–N 3 B 1 /C) significantly tunes the electronic structure of the Ni atoms, leading to electron delocalization, which enhances the *CO intermediate adsorption strength and makes CH 4 the dominant product. This study marks the experimental realization of electrochemical CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion at isolated Ni sites and underscores the importance of local coordination environment regulation in steering the reaction pathways of single-atom catalysts.},

We found that infant marmosets emit most types of adult calls and engage in turn-taking as early as in P1. In addition, parent-reared infants emitted more antiphonal phee calls than hand-reared marmosets in W10. Call transitions in parent-reared W10 animals mainly occurred between phee calls or from phee calls to other call types. In contrast, P1 and hand-reared W10 marmosets displayed call transitions among various types of calls. These findings suggest that the antiphony in marmosets emerges on P1 but remains immature, and the antiphony skills can be improved by development environments, especially by the vocal feedback from parents.},

  abstract     = {On January 28, 2025, 24 humanoid robots from Unitree Ltd. performed alongside human dancers on the Spring Festival Gala of China Central Television. This performance captivated tens of millions of viewers and sparked widespread discussion across China. As Elon Musk ambitiously unveiled Tesla's plans for intelligent robots and various humanoid robot prototypes began appearing on the streets of major cities, embodied intelligence has emerged as the new frontier in science and technology. But what do terms like ‘end-to-end embodied large model’ and ‘general intelligent robot’ truly mean? Is the scientific foundation of embodied intelligence robust? How far can the embodied intelligence industry, particularly the intelligent robot sector, progress? Will ‘one robot per household’ become a reality within a few years, fundamentally transforming human production and lifestyle? In a timely panel discussion chaired by Professor Han Ding of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, seven leading researchers in embodied intelligence and robotics gathered to explore these questions. They delved into the scientific basis, technical roadmap, current developments, and major challenges in the field.

  abstract     = {Understanding anode failure mechanisms in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is crucial for their use in energy storage, as the anode directly affects battery stability and electrolyte selection. Unfortunately, post-mortem methods reveal failure outcomes but often miss dynamic progressions, obscuring cause-and-effect relationships in failure evolution. Leveraging domain knowledge informed machine learning and a 4-year dataset of over 18 000 cycles and 12 million data points, from cells cycled to failure, we uncovered a correlation between initial lithium plating/stripping behavior and subsequent anode changes, enabling the identification of early indicators for distinct failure types. Our model accurately predicts failure types using only the first two cycles, less than 2% of the data, demonstrating the effectiveness of initial curve features as electrochemical fingerprints. Key electrochemical fingerprints describing lithium microstructure and its interphase with the electrolyte are validated to be critical to kinetics and reversibility degradation. Specifically, the fingerprints influence the formation of ineffective interphase regions (lacking intimate contact with the lithium metal) and inactive lithium, which in turn lengthen charge carrier (lithium-ion and electron) transport paths, leading to poorer kinetics and reversibility. The fingerprints and model generalize well across typical published electrolyte systems with low misidentification, demonstrating versatility and practicality. Broadly, this study using a pre-mortem prediction method deepens understanding of lithium metal anode failure mechanisms by uncovering the root causes of kinetics and reversibility degradation from fingerprints hidden in initial cycles instead of a post-mortem manner, facilitating the rapid assessment of battery reliability and development of electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in quantum polarization theory have propelled the exploration of topological insulators (TIs) into the realm of higher-order systems, leading to the study of the celebrated two-dimensional (2D) quadrupole and 3D octupole TIs. Traditionally, these topological phases have been associated with the toroidal topology of the conventional Brillouin zone. This paper reports the discovery of a novel octupole topological insulating phase protected by a 3D momentum-space nonsymmorphic group emerging within the framework of the Brillouin 3D real projective space ( ⁠ RP 3 ⁠ ). We theoretically propose the model and its corresponding topological invariant, experimentally construct this insulator within a topological circuit framework and capture the octupole insulating phase as a localized impedance peak at the circuit’s corner. Furthermore, our RP 3 circuit stands out as a pioneering 3D model to simultaneously exhibit both intrinsic, termination-independent symmetry-protected topological phases and extrinsic, termination-dependent surface-obstructed topological phases within the symmetry-protected topological phases. Our results broaden the topological landscape and provide insights into the band theory within the manifold of the Brillouin RP 3 space.},

  abstract     = {As we enter the big data and artificial intelligence (AI) era, integrating security and communication over optical fiber has become a critical challenge. This urgency is driven by the need to protect vast amounts of sensitive data, ensuring privacy security across global high-capacity optical networks. Traditional secure communication methods often struggle to maintain high-capacity transmission performance while providing robust security. Here we propose an integrated encryption and communication (IEAC) framework, designed to maximize mutual information (MI) for legal users while minimizing it for potential eavesdroppers. Enabled by end-to-end deep learning, this holistic framework trains a random number-selected geometric constellation shaping scheme to optimize encryption processes and transmission quality simultaneously. The IEAC experiment system achieves a groundbreaking single-channel transmission rate of 1 Terabit per second (Tb/s) over a 1200-km fiber link, employing a 26-channel, 3.9 THz bandwidth, full C-band wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) configuration. The MI for eavesdroppers is under 0.2 bit per symbol where the regular value is near 4.0, ensuring secure transmission. The IEAC scheme offers a scalable, promising solution to meet the escalating demand for high-throughput, secure data transmission in the face of advancing big data and AI computational technologies.},

  abstract     = {Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships have been extensively studied, particularly within the primary layers of producers in terrestrial ecosystems. In multilayer ecosystems such as forests, the contribution of diversity in the secondary layer, i.e. shrubs, to ecosystem functioning is still largely unknown. Here we used 11-year growth data from a forest biodiversity experiment with factorially crossed manipulations of tree and shrub species richness to assess their effects on forest productivity. We found that shrub species richness had positive effects on tree and total woody biomass (sum of tree and shrub biomass), with effect sizes similar in magnitude to those of tree species richness: increasing tree or shrub species richness from two to eight promoted tree biomass by 73.1% or 53.9% and total woody biomass by 46.7% or 37.1%, respectively. The positive effects of tree or shrub species richness on tree and total woody biomass became larger over time. Shrub biomass was reduced by tree species richness. The effects of tree and shrub species richness can be partially explained by their increased functional diversity. Our study provides the first evidence that understory diversity can significantly increase forest productivity and should not be neglected in forest restoration to promote ecosystem functioning.},

Traditional prelithiation methods, such as using lithium naphthalenide (Li-Naph), are limited by the low lithiation potential of crystalline silicon, making them less effective for commercial applications. This study demonstrates that amorphous silicon anodes, with a higher lithiation potential, can be effectively prelithiated using Li-Naph. This prelithiation process also forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase, which significantly enhances the anode's cycling stability and overall battery performance. The prelithiated silicon anodes achieved a remarkable ICE improvement from 74.8% to 97.2% in full-cell tests. Furthermore, 27 mAh pouch cells exhibited excellent long-cycle stability and low-temperature performance, retaining 90.1% of their capacity after 800 cycles at 1 C. These findings highlight the potential for scalable prelithiation methods and open new avenues for advancing silicon anode technology in next-generation batteries.},

  abstract     = {Fe-N-C catalysts have emerged as a promising substitute for the expensive Pt/C to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, conventional Fe-N 4 active sites, which generally feature a low-spin configuration, strongly adsorb oxygen intermediates and necessitate structural optimization of the active sites for improved performance. Herein, graphitic nitrogen (N GC ) adjacent to the Fe-N 4 centers is straightforwardly introduced to modulate the spin state of Fe-N-C catalysts after elucidating the influence of nitrogen species on the Fe-N 4 sites. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the adjacent N GC can effectively regulate the spin state of the active Fe sites, which enables electron filling from Fe to the anti-bonding π* orbital of oxygen species and optimizes the *OH desorption for accelerated ORR. Inspired by this, such catalysts are cost-effectively prepared by a rational combination of electrospinning and controlled thermal annealing using inexpensive precursors. The optimal catalyst shows superior ORR activity to the benchmark Pt/C, and excellent durability, with a minor voltage decay of 11 mV after 10 000 cycles. The spin-state-promoted performance enhancement is confirmed by a series of in-situ characterizations. The remarkable performance of the optimized catalyst is further confirmed in Zn-air batteries (ZABs) with a peak power density of 225 mW cm −2 . Moreover, quasi-solid ZABs using this catalyst realize excellent performance even under bending conditions and successfully power electronic devices, including a mobile phone and an electronic watch. This work correlates the spin state of catalysts and oxygen reduction performance, providing an alternative strategy for regulating the performance of electrocatalysts as well as promoting their application in wearable electronics.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered to be the next generation of high-specific-energy storage devices. To improve the practical specific energy, LOBs typically require thick cathode electrodes to achieve higher areal capacity. However, due to the inefficient O 2 diffusion within the electrolyte-flooded thick cathodes, the practical discharge capacity of LOBs is significantly lower than their ultra-high theoretical value. Herein, we propose a strategy to solve the problem of limited O 2 diffusion in the thick cathodes of LOBs by applying an O 2 -enriched localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE). With a thick cathode (10 mg cm −2 ), LOBs based on this O 2 -enriched LHCE deliver impressive discharge capacities of 50.4, 27.1 and 20.3 mAh cm −2 at current densities of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mA cm −2 , respectively. The discharge product Li 2 O 2 is homogeneously distributed within the thick cathode due to the enhanced O 2 diffusion conferred by the O 2 -enriched LHCE, indicating that the product storage space of the thick cathode is more efficiently utilized. Besides, the O 2 -enriched LHCE-based LOBs derive a stable solid electrolyte interphase to protect the Li anode from O 2 corrosion. Additionally, a pioneering primary Li-O 2 pouch cell with the O 2 -enriched LHCE achieves an exceptional specific energy of 860.6 Wh kg −1 (based on the total pouch cell weight), providing a promising technical pathway for the practical application of LOBs.},

This non-flow battery relies on the collaboration of the reversible stripping/plating process of Zn metal and the halogen-participating zincation reactions. However, the corrosion of Zn metal and the shuttling of the halogen species result in serious capacity decay, posing challenges to their reversibility and lifespan. Moreover, the instability of high-valence halides hinders the implementation of multi-electron reactions in AZHBs. This review elaborates on the fundamentals, challenges and recent progress in AZHBs, highlighting the significance of the electrolyte design that is aimed at synchronous optimization for both the halogen cathode and the Zn anode in AZHBs. We discuss the design principles and protocols, along with concerns in the effective testing and evaluation of synchronous electrolytes. Possible approaches towards synchronous electrolytes are proposed—namely, biphasic electrolytes, gradient hydrogel electrolytes and ionic liquid electrolytes.

  abstract     = {Visible light emission exceeding purely thermal radiation has been imaged at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unexplained. Here, we show that visible light can be produced from geothermal infrared radiation via nonlinear frequency-doubling up-conversion in sulfide minerals that are abundant in hydrothermal vents. Chalcopyrite exhibits significant second harmonic generation, which is further amplified under high pressure, yielding a 400–700 nm photon flux three orders of magnitude greater than blackbody emission. When exposed to 1064 nm of irradiation, chalcopyrite induces fluorescence responses in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 at 656 and 685 nm, suggesting that the up-converted 532 nm light is absorbed by phycobilisomes and transferred to photosystem II. Metagenomic analysis reveals a strong correlation between cyanobacteria and high-temperature, chalcopyrite-rich vents. Similar up-conversion processes have also been observed in other sulfide minerals, emitting wavelengths covering the entire visible spectrum. These findings unveil a novel mineral-mediated photonic mechanism that generates biologically relevant visible light at hydrothermal vents, which can be harnessed by oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria in Earth's deep biosphere and possibly beyond.},

  abstract     = {Achieving stable cycling of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) at high voltages presents a significant challenge due to interfacial instability and uneven lithium-ion transport, leading to dendrite formation and cathode degradation. Constructing a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) that facilitates fast and uniform ion transport is crucial for enhancing the stability of electrode structures. However, current research mainly focuses on interfacial instability while neglecting uneven ion transport, which is even more critical. In this study, we develop a novel electrolyte system, PAFE, by incorporating aluminum ethoxide (Al(EtO) 3 ), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), and pentafluorocyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) into a carbonate-based electrolyte. Al(EtO) 3 serves as a crosslinking agent, facilitating the formation of a three-dimensional polymer network that promotes the uniform deposition of inorganic components such as LiF, Li 3 N, Li 3 P and Al 2 O 3 within the SEI and cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI). These uniform interphases lower the activation energy for lithium-ion transport, thereby ensuring consistent ion flow and reducing internal stress within the electrodes. As a result, Li||LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) cells with PAFE exhibit exceptional cycling stability, retaining 80% capacity over 140 cycles at a high cut-off voltage of 4.7 V. Furthermore, 1 Ah pouch cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, highlighting the potential of this electrolyte system for practical high-energy-density LMB applications.},

  abstract     = {Hot electrons are ubiquitous in diverse physical and chemical processes, since they are involved in the energy transfer of elementary processes such as adsorption, diffusion and desorption of reactants. However, hot electrons have short lifetimes (∼few fs) and small mean free paths (∼<10 nm), which are inherently difficult to detect via conventional in situ pumping techniques. Here, we designed a spectrally tunable photoexcitation desorption analyser, a tool for tracking hot-electron generation, which enables mechanistic studies of hot-electron generation and transfer in single-atom alloy antennas in real time under flow conditions by a variety of molecular probes (CO, CO 2 and various hydrocarbons). Long-lived hot electrons arise because electrons with discrete energy levels spaced by several hundred meV in individual atoms cannot relax to form phonons. Furthermore, we utilize the hot electrons generated by single-atom alloy antenna-modified photocatalysts under illumination to produce green syngas from carbon dioxide and water, achieving an efficiency one order of magnitude higher than traditional powder photocatalysis. Our discovery provides an unprecedented perspective for the detection of hot-electron generation and has implications for future advancements in nanophotonics.},

This paper describes an automated review-generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring user domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, our method demonstrated two aspects: first, generating comprehensive reviews from 343 articles spanning 35 topics; and, second, evaluating data-mining capabilities by using 1041 articles for experimental catalyst property analysis. Through multilayered quality control, we effectively mitigated the hallucinations of LLMs, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity, while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to <0.5% with 95% confidence. The released software application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature-recommendation efficiency while facilitating broader scientific explorations.},

  abstract     = {Liquid water was abundant on Mars during the Noachian and Hesperian periods but vanished as the planet transitioned into the cold, dry environment we see today. It is hypothesized that much of this water was either lost to space or stored in the crust. However, the extent of the water reservoir within the crust remains poorly constrained due to a lack of observational evidence. Here, we invert the shear wave velocity structure of the upper crust, identifying a significant low-velocity layer at the base, between depths of 5.4 and 8 km. This zone is interpreted as a high-porosity, water-saturated layer, and is estimated to hold a liquid water volume of 520–780 m of global equivalent layer (GEL). This estimate aligns well with the remaining liquid water volume of 710–920 m GEL, after accounting for water loss to space, crustal hydration and modern water inventory.},

Here, we report evidence of a TRS-protected subband at oxygen vacancy-free LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces. This subband causes a low-field quantum oscillation with anomalous characteristics: exceptionally light electron mass, aperiodicity, and susceptibility to magnetic fields. All findings align with a Rashba model in which TRS-protected transport occurs along quasi-1D ferroelastic domain walls, which possess a Dirac band topology and a giant Rashba spin-orbit coupling, two orders stronger than the 2D interface. Our results deepen the understanding of SrTiO 3 -based electron systems, unveiling an appealing new platform for quantum engineering.},

Here, we first present a comfortable, autonomous and integrated iontophoretic biosensing textile system that features an on-demand stimulation skin-interfaced sweat-induction unit. The textile system uses skin-interface stabilized iontophoretic hydrogel electrodes that enhance interface conformability and optimize interface impedance, eliminating the need for high-current stimulation in conventional iontophoresis. By combining biosensing fibers with a stabilized transduction layer design, we show that the resultant biosensing textile system continuously collects multibiomarker data, including glucose, lactate, uric acid and pH levels, for up to 6 hours. This system holds promise for advancing wearable electronics in personalized healthcare, clinical monitoring and remote diagnostics with superior user-friendliness and versatility.},

  abstract     = {Independently modulating the transmittance of solar spectra, specifically within the visible and near-infrared light ranges, presents a significant prospect for windows that can effectively manage lighting and energy consumption in both buildings and electrical-vehicles. Electrochromic devices, capable of regulating the transmittance of visible and near-infrared light in response to external electrical stimuli, are considered as one of the ideal candidates for smart windows. However, electrochromic devices typically suffer from single-mode control (i.e. simultaneously varying the visible and near-infrared light), slow response and inadequate long-term durability. In this paper, we demonstrate that TT-Nb₂O₅ enables independent modulation of visible and near-infrared light and possesses rapid switching kinetics and exceptional cycling stability, i.e. no observed degradation of optical modulation after more than 10 000 cycles. The dual band modulation is attributed to a combination of progressive splitting and downward shift of Nb 3 d conduction bands and rise of Fermi level as ion insertion proceeds. The open framework of the crystal structures accounts for the exceptional cycling stability. Simulation results based on assembled smart windows indicate a potential cooling energy saving of 160 GJ without compromising the outdoor view, or 225 GJ for a complete blocking of visible and near-infrared light can be achieved in hot climate zones.},

  abstract     = {Two major Early Paleozoic orogens exist in East China, the North Qinling–North Tongbai and Wuyi–Yunkai orogens, which used to be regarded as two independent systems controlled by distinct plate tectonic processes. The North Qinling–North Tongbai orogen consists predominantly of subduction- and collision-related rock assemblages, whereas the Wuyi–Yunkai orogen is made up chiefly of collision-related foreland fold-thrust systems. It is demonstrated that the two seemingly unrelated orogens are actually two components of an immense single orogen that is here named the Fuxi–Nüwa orogen. We stitch together a complete picture of the Fuxi–Nüwa orogen based on a holistic treatment of Early Paleozoic tectonics in East China. It is surmised that the Fuxi–Nüwa orogen was created by initial continental promontory–intraoceanic arc point collision and final complete collision of the North China block with West Cathaysia. The orogen was then torn apart in the Carboniferous, with the Wuyi–Yunkai orogen gradually moving away along a crustal-scale sinistral shear zone. Our proposed tectonic panorama offers satisfactory explanations for many perplexing questions that have plagued geologists for decades, such as the tectonic driver for the Kwangsian orogeny in West Cathaysia, mechanisms for ultra-high-pressure metamorphism and exhumation of the eclogized continental rocks in the North Qinling, simultaneousness of Silurian high-flux magmatism in the North Qinling–North Tongbai and Wuyi–Yunkai orogens, broad absence of Silurian–Early Devonian strata, and causes for Mid–Late Devonian marine inundation over West Cathaysia. Discovery and restoration of the Fuxi–Nüwa orogen will reshape our understanding of tectonic evolution of the Proto-Tethyan regimes, and necessitate reassessment of potentials of oil-gas resources in East China.},

  abstract     = {Operando measurement of expansion force has become an effective way of monitoring physical-chemical events in lithium-ion batteries, of which the conventional optical means is limited by material fragility, structural incompatibility and system complexity. The utilization of flexible sensors can potentially address these challenges; however, their functionality and stability are restricted within hours in corrosive environments. Here, an in-situ unified iontronic sensing mechanism, derived from the super-capacitive electrode/electrolyte interface, is developed for expansion-force measurement in highly corrosive electrolyte environments. Specifically, it leverages the structural and material similarities between batteries and iontronic sensors to create a unified assessing device, utilizing only existing materials to produce in-situ detection. Consequently, the intelligence-incorporated architecture exhibits exceptional stability for continuous measurements over one month, enabling 400 charging/discharging cycles in a battery lifespan. Therefore, the unified iontronic sensing device, which has long-term on-board monitoring of expansion forces, offers an accurate and effective solution for the aging evaluation and safety pre-warning of lithium-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {The sluggish reaction kinetics in current Li-O 2 batteries (LOBs) hinder the efficient nucleation and decomposition of insulating Li 2 O 2 on catalyst surfaces. Therefore, developing effective strategies to regulate Li 2 O 2 growth and elucidating the catalytic mechanism are essential for unlocking the full potential of LOB technology. Herein, a spin-polarized Co-based catalyst exhibits a significant reversible magnetization change (9.5 emu g −1 ) during the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The strong overlap between the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals modulates the Co 3d orbital occupancy, enhancing spin-electron filling and thereby facilitating rapid O 2 adsorption and an efficient two-electron transfer process in the initial oxygen reduction reaction step. This optimized electronic structure also promotes the desorption of LiO 2 intermediates, guiding their disproportionation reactions and enabling Li 2 O 2 growth via a solution-mediated pathway. Furthermore, the spin-flip effect induced by the internal magnetic field suppresses singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) formation, effectively mitigating side reactions. As a result, the LOBs demonstrate a remarkably high specific capacity (18 429.6 mAh g −1 ), excellent rate performance and enhanced cycling stability. These findings offer valuable insights into Li 2 O 2 nucleation mechanisms on high-performance catalysts and provide new design principles for next-generation LOB technologies.},

The above limitations are recognized as a critical problem in energy science and have severely hindered the development of modern electronics. Herein, we explore the potential of utilizing the transition of inner-shell electrons for energy conversion. Flexible Atomic Code on the radiative recombination of highly charged xenon ions with free electrons shows a radiative power output of 2.35 × 10 5 W⋅L −1 and an energy release of 8.65 × 10 7 Wh⋅kg −1 under specific ion and electron density conditions. This finding suggests a promising strategy to discover new energy technologies with extremely high power and energy densities in the future.},

Pyrope garnet is the dominant mineral in basaltic slabs from the crust to the topmost lower mantle, but its water-storage capacity remains controversial owing to the difficulty in growing high-quality single crystals for precise water-content analysis. Here, we systematically investigate the water solubility in pure single crystals of synthetic pyrope garnet at pressures of 5–25 GPa and temperatures of 1100–1900 K by using large-volume presses and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Our results indicate that pyrope garnet can contain up to 2000 wt. ppm H 2 O with a strong dependence on pressure and temperature in the transition zone and topmost lower mantle. Therefore, pyrope garnet may serve as a vital water carrier and reservoir in the deep mantle, offering new insights into water cycling up to the topmost lower mantle.},

By electrically trapping and integrating a single nanodiamond onto a glass nanopipette, we achieve its 3D manipulation within a single live cell. This enables the first nanoscale controlled live cell quantum sensing of multiphysiology signals under native conditions, providing direct insight into localized intracellular activities. Our observations reveal a spatial heterogeneity in temperature over different sites within a single cell, indicative of local activity-induced heat production. Furthermore, temporally resolved relaxation measurements effectively capture the intracellular free-radical-mediated local electro-magnetic noise dynamics. We find a number of unexpected fluctuation phenomena of electromagnetic noise that may directly represent different types of intracellular free radical generation dynamics. Live cell quantum multiphysiology bridges the gap between high-physical-sensitivity-quantum sensing with high-spatiotemporal-resolution live cell measurements, opening up a new avenue for accessing cellular function with unprecedented capabilities.},

Anode-free configuration raises great opportunities for maximizing the cell-level energy density of batteries. However, high energy density of low-temperature anode-free batteries is still plagued by the lack of competent electrolytes with combined high compatibility towards metal anode and stability at high voltages. Herein, we report a high-energy-density anode-free Na battery at low temperatures via electrolyte association-dissociation equilibrium regulation. The optimized equilibrium facilitates the desolvation process and the formation of inorganic-rich anode/cathode-electrolyte interphases, thus simultaneously promoting low-temperature kinetics and high-voltage stability of the battery. Consequently, a high Coulombic efficiency (99.90%) of Na plating/stripping and a wide electrochemical stability window of electrolyte (>4.3 V) at −40°C are achieved. The anode-free Al@C||NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 pouch cell delivers a record-high energy density of 204 Wh kg −1 entire cell at −40°C among the reported low-temperature rechargeable batteries.

  abstract     = {Clouds and surface albedo significantly affect the energy balance on Earth. With the snow/ice melting in the Arctic, an understanding of how this impacts short-wave cloud radiative effects (CRE) remains a critical, yet poorly understood, question. We analysed snow/ice coverage (SIC) changes and their impact on the CRE in the Arctic from the past to the present and to future scenarios. From 2000 to 2020, the SIC decreased by –0.058/decade, leading to CRE changes (∆CRE) at the top of the atmosphere and surface by –1.25 ± 0.49 and –0.21 ± 0.20 W/m²/decade, with an average reduction in the sea ice melting rate ( ⁠ Δ R ⁠ ) of 3.45 cm/year. The sea ice coverage and the CRE remained relatively stable from 1850 to 1915, followed by dramatic declines in both sea ice coverage and CRE under both 245 and 585 shared socio-economic pathways post-2015. The snow/ice loss amplifies the cloud-induced short-wave cooling effect, partly slowing further melting yet not preventing overall snow/ice loss.},

  abstract     = {Ionic aggregates are among the most common forms of matter, yet the investigation of their molecular motion is often constrained by the instability of isolated anions and cations, as well as the lack of real-time monitoring techniques. This study presents a zwitterionic strategy that integrates both cations and anions into one fluorescent organic framework, forming a zwitterionic molecule. The zwitterionic strategy simplifies the intricate cation–anion systems that are typically found in conventional inorganic salts and imparts them with fluorescent properties, facilitating real-time tracking of ionic-interaction-induced molecular motion within ionic aggregates. Specifically, a blue shift in the fluorescence wavelength signified changes in aggregate states due to intermolecular motion, whereas a decrease in intensity was linked to intramolecular-motion-caused conformational changes. This spontaneous molecular motion enabled dynamic switching of the excited state energy-decay pathway, leading to switchable color–light responses. Overall, the zwitterionic strategy offers a novel framework for exploring the properties and behaviors of molecules in ionic aggregates.},

Here, we present a polycrystal approach based on domain wall engineering to configure multi-band dispersion in a synthetic hybrid dimension by utilizing orientation freedom. As a prototype, we demonstrate that an all-dielectric platform for hybrid topological polycrystalline photonic integrated circuits can support up to eight edge channels and four corner modes via pseudospin-valley Hall effect, empowering controllable directionality of multi-frequency and spinful channels with highly localized performance. Our findings reveal a photonic architecture that significantly advances the on-chip integration of topological photonics, offering valuable potential for future information processing technologies across optical and microwave frequencies.},

However, the use of planar tunneling junctions to characterize Andreev bound states associated with unconventional superconductivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report tunneling spectroscopy studies of normal-metal/superconductor planar junctions, leveraging the newly discovered LaAlO 3 /KTaO 3 (111) superconducting interface. We observe distinct spectroscopic behaviors for weak and strong tunneling barriers, controlled by the thickness of the LaAlO 3 : when the barrier is weak, the metallic contact couples strongly with the interface superconductor, resulting in pronounced double peaks within the superconducting gap; when the barrier is strong, the in-gap peaks diminish and a softened full superconducting gap profile emerges. These observations, supported by theoretical calculations, pinpoint the presence of contact-induced Andreev bound states in planar junctions. This not only reveals the possibility of p -wave superconductivity at the LaAlO 3 /KTaO 3 interface but also offers a universal approach to identifying the most sought-after superconducting states.},

  abstract     = {Motile cilia are critical for diverse cellular activities, affecting the survival and development of most eukaryotic organisms. Central microtubules (MTs), which are located in the lumen of ciliary axonemes, are non-centrosomal MTs that are crucial for motile cilia beating. However, the formation mechanism of central MTs remains elusive. Here, by using a Drosophila model, we identify Ccdc13 as a novel regulator for the assembly of central MTs. We show that Ccdc13 localizes along the central MTs and is essential for its formation in sperm flagella, with its deletion consequently affecting the sperm motility and the fertility of male flies. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Ccdc13 directly interacts with Spef1, acting upstream of Spef1 to regulate central MT elongation. Remarkably, we demonstrated that the role of Ccdc13 in ciliary central MT formation is conserved in mammals. Ccdc13 deficiency in mice leads to the loss of central MTs in motile ependymal cilia, resulting in abnormal cilia motility and hydrocephalus. Our results mark the discovery of Ccdc13 as a novel regulator for ciliary central MT assembly and reveal that the Ccdc13–Spef1 complex is an evolutionarily conserved module that is critical for central MT formation in motile cilia of both flies and mammals.},

The lunar farside samples returned by the Chang’e-6 mission show differences in terms of space weathering features compared to nearside samples. The studied farside samples lack vapor deposition layers found on the nearside and exhibit thinner amorphized layers, lower solar flare track densities, reduced number densities of nano phase metallic iron (npFe 0 ) and larger npFe 0 grain sizes. These findings suggest that the solar wind plays a dominant role in space weathering on the Chang'e-6 sampling site, surpassing micrometeorite impacts. This could provide critical sample-based evidence of the lunar space environment's dichotomy, enhancing our understanding of how solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts shape the lunar surface, even over short exposure periods.},

The diagnostic processes of epilepsy are often hindered by the transient and unpredictable nature of seizures.

By employing deep learning techniques, including domain adaptation and knowledge distillation, our framework aligns cross-species and cross-modality EEG signals to enhance the detection capability beyond traditional within-species and within-modality models. Experiments on multiple surfaces and intracranial EEG datasets of humans and canines demonstrated substantial improvements in detection accuracy, achieving over 90% AUC scores for cross-species and cross-modality seizure detection with extremely limited labeled data from the target species/modality. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous data from different species and modalities to improve EEG-based seizure detection performance. This is a pilot study that provides insights into the challenges and potential of multi-species and multi-modality data integration, offering an effective solution for future work to collect huge EEG data to train large brain models.},

Inspired by the biological concept of pluripotency, here we report a pluripotent drone that can further ‘differentiate’ into a series of drones with different functions to perform a variety of challenging tasks. To realize this concept, we propose a method of reprogrammable dynamic soft self-healing chemical growth (R-growth), by which the pluripotent drone can grow specific ‘organs’ to achieve corresponding functions, and after completing the corresponding tasks, these ‘organs’ can be retracted. Furthermore, these ‘organs’ are able to respond to possible damage through rapid self-healing (∼3.2 s, >1000 times faster than the self-healing of existing similar membranes). R-growth is large-scale (>1.5 m), fast (0.15 m/s), lightweight (∼5 g, 1/20 the weight of traditional micro air pumps), self-contained and free-wheeling. This method can be applied to various existing drones to significantly extend their functions and to enable an unprecedented range of tasks. This work realizes the growth, retraction, and switching of drone ‘organs’ with any function, while such ability of macro robots or humans, to date, only exists in science fiction movies.},

We use a paradigm—the transitional click train—to probe the intricacies of temporal merging within the auditory cortex. The protocol underscores a robust change response in an adapted auditory cortex upon introducing a perceptual switch between distinct pitches. Our findings delineate four pivotal determinants that modulate this change response: train duration, inter-click interval (ICI) length, ICI contrast and train regularity. Comparative analyses between the auditory cortex and the medial geniculate body underscore a cortical origin for this temporal merging, diverging from traditional thalamic inputs. Furthermore, the clinical potential of the change response is explored, demonstrating its promise as a biomarker in anesthesia monitoring and psychiatric conditions. Collectively, this research elucidates the neuronal underpinnings of temporal integration in auditory perception, provides initial evidence for the neuronal mechanisms underlying pitch perception with click trains and introduces a potent paradigm with vast clinical implications.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advancements in the study of metal halide perovskites worldwide, the large-scale industrialization of related optoelectronic devices faces ongoing challenges related to efficiency, long-term stability, and environmental and human toxicity. Self-assembled molecules (SAMs) have recently emerged as crucial strategies for enhancing device performance and stability, particularly by mitigating interface-related challenges. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the multifaceted roles of SAMs in enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite optoelectronic devices. We begin by introducing the evolution of SAMs, their unique physicochemical properties and implemented applications in optoelectronic devices. Subsequently, we delve into the diverse beneficial effects of SAMs in perovskite devices and elucidate the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms responsible for these performance enhancements. Finally, we critically analyze the current challenges associated with the rational design and implementation of SAMs in perovskite devices and conclude by outlining promising future research directions.},

Observing the rapid advancement of 3D carbons subsequent to the breakthroughs in 2D graphene, this paper reviews the recent progress in constructing carbon crystals by summarizing the structural design and specifically highlighting the preparation using template carbonization, organic synthesis, high-pressure processing and charge injection.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) hold significant promise for energy storage due to their unique advantages and characteristics. However, their development is hindered by the lack of decomposition resistance and cycle stability over long periods. In this study, we synthesized naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives with zwitterions in their side chains via the atmospheric pressure method, namely (CBu) 2 NDI and (SPr) 2 NDI . The electrostatic repulsion between (CBu) 2 NDI precisely regulates π-π stacking into a parallel-staggered pattern. The synergistic zwitterions strategy effectively mitigates the positive charge of N + in (CBu) 2 NDI compared with (NPr) 2 NDI and dex-NDI; this not only enhances the aromaticity of the naphthalene diimide core but also inhibits the side chain decomposition caused by the S N 2 nucleophilic attack of hydroxyl ions (OH − ) on the C=O. The calculation of the single point energy proves that during the charging processes of (CBu) 2 NDI , the K + will be close to the naphthalene core to form dimers or monomers with lower energy configurations under electrostatic attraction. (CBu) 2 NDI achieved a water solubility up to 1.49 M, which can be paired with K 4 Fe(CN) 6 under two-electron transfer with total electrolyte costs as low as $6.58 Ah −1 . The 0.1 M battery maintains full capacity after 5070 cycles. Furthermore, the battery delivers an impressive 100% capacity retention under 2 M e − during 220 cycles.},

However, their electricity generation is often limited by the low thermal concentration or unstable temperature gradients in practical applications. Herein, we rationally designed an organic radical-activable charge-transfer (CT) cocrystal based on the open-shell radical electron acceptor of 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic dianhydride. The open-shell radical contributes to the strong near-infrared absorption and nonradiative recombination, resulting in a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.2% for the prepared CT cocrystal. Furthermore, the photothermal ink containing the radical-activable CT cocrystal and the transparent resin was successfully coated onto a thermoelectric generator as a cost-effective light absorber, facilely forming a high-performance STEG. Notably, the prepared STEG output a voltage of 143 mV under 1 sun irradiation, demonstrating real-time photodetection capability. We anticipate the potential applications of these cocrystals in self-powered optoelectronics, such as a non-contact and long-distance information converters.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have emerged as a groundbreaking candidate for future integrated circuits due to their tunable band structures, atomically sharp interfaces and seamless compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies. Despite their promise, existing synthesis methods, such as mechanical transfer and vapor-phase conversion, struggle to achieve the high-quality, scalable production for practical applications. In response to these longstanding challenges, our study unveils for the first time the direct epitaxial growth of wafer-scale 2D vdW heterostructures (MoS 2 /SnS 2 ⁠ ) with exceptional quality and uniformity. This achievement is made possible through fundamentally enhancing the adsorption interactions between intermediates and the underlying material. The heterostructures display pristine, defect-free interfaces, consistent crystal orientation and wafer-level thickness uniformity. The Raman peak shifts of MoS 2 and SnS 2 are constrained to below 0.5 cm − 1 across the entire wafer, with intensity deviations maintained within an impressive 2%, and thickness uniformity surpassing 99.5%. Owing to their exceptional crystallinity and interface quality, the heterostructures demonstrate extraordinary electron and hole transfer capabilities, showcasing a prominent rectification effect and an astounding responsivity of 6.28 × 10 3 A/W, averaged from 30 devices. Our study signifies a pivotal advancement for the integration of 2D materials into semiconductor technologies, paving the way for next-generation integrated circuits.},

This study develops sonopiezoelectric-effect-mediated on-demand reactive-oxygen-species release by incorporating piezoelectric barium titanate modified with gold nanoparticles and a thermally responsive dual-network tough hydrogel dressing with a physical network structure based on ureidopyrimidinone-modified gelatin crosslinked by multiple hydrogen bonds, and with a chemical network structure based on N-isopropylacrylamide and methacryloyl gelatin formed via radical polymerization. This hydrogel exhibits temperature-sensitive softening, on-demand thermal contraction performance, high mechanical strength, good tissue adhesion, outstanding piezoelectricity, tunable sonopiezoelectric behavior, regulatable photothermal properties and desirable biocompatibility. The tunable sonopiezoelectric effect enables the hydrogel to eliminate wound bacteria in the short term, and effectively promote human fibroblast proliferation and migration over the long term. The hydrogel dressing actively contracts to close wound edges and further promotes the healing of MRSA-infected skin defects in the neck of mice by promoting fibroblast migration, enhancing collagen deposition and facilitating angiogenesis via up-regulating the FAK and AKT signaling pathways, providing a novel design strategy for developing dressings targeting chronic joint-skin wounds.},

In this theory, thermodynamic competitive equilibrium between cation-solvent interaction and cation-anion interaction, and between enthalpy and entropy, are two key points determining solute dissolution and formation of various solvation structures. Using this thermodynamic competitive equilibrium theory, the essential principle of all the recently developed electrolyte systems such as high concentration electrolyte, localized high concentration electrolyte, weak solvated electrolyte, anion coordination electrolyte and high-entropy electrolytes can be perfectly explained. We hope that this theory can help accelerate the development of electrolyte study, and enlighten the emergence of advanced electrolytes with unique solvation structures and attractive properties.},

  abstract     = {Advanced structural materials are often required to exhibit a combination of light weight, high strength and superior toughness. Biomimetic strategies hold promise for achieving these seemingly conflicting mechanical properties simultaneously. However, current biomimetic structural materials lack active fire-warning and passive flame-retardant functionalities, which poses risks for their application in fire-prone scenarios. Herein, we present a nacre-mimetic alumina–cyanate resin composite (NAC) that has a combination of mechanical robustness with thermochromic and flame-retardant properties. Through controlled atomic doping, chromium atoms are incorporated into alumina microplatelets, forming solid-solution assembly units that exhibit reversible thermochromism and a solid-solution-strengthening effect. The bioinspired ‘brick-and-mortar’ structure endows the NAC with high strength (∼290.1 MPa) and fracture toughness (∼11.1 MPa m 1/2 ). Coupled with a machine-learning-based image-recognition system, the NAC leverages its thermochromic properties to deliver a rapid fire warning within 9 s at 250°C, which is significantly faster than traditional electronic fire alarms. Its layered structure effectively impedes oxygen flow, achieving an oxygen-limiting index of 50%, and thus ensuring excellent flame-retardant performance. This design delays the combustion peak and reduces the heat-release value, thereby enhancing the flame-retardant performance. This work demonstrates the effective integration of a structural and functional design for active early fire warning and passive flame retardancy, paving the way for structural materials in advanced fire-warning systems in challenging environments.},

  abstract     = {The environmental occurrence of anthropogenic chemicals—especially persistent micropollutants of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—raises pressing concerns for global drinking-water safety. Adsorption is an effective technology for removing PFAS but is limited by unsatisfactory adsorption capacity and efficiency. We report a strategy to attach polyamine adlayers to graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets that produces highly charged and monodispersed 2D adsorbents of a GO nanosheet sandwiched between two 1-nm-thick polyamine adlayers. This adsorbent has a high adsorption capacity for PFAS of ∼3070 mg/g—tens of times greater than that of GO and commercial activated carbon. It also provides almost instant adsorption of a variety of PFAS and reaches 57%–95% of its equilibrium capacity in a minute and removes ∼100% of PFAS from contaminated water sources within a few minutes, transforming real-life PFAS-contaminated water into safe drinking water. Experiment and theory show that the planar nature of the 2D adsorbent combined with its abundant surface adsorption sites that electrostatically attract the polar groups of the PFAS, and hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions with their non-polar groups, account for its ultra-high adsorption capacity and rapid removal efficiency. We also show that regeneration of the adsorbents removes the adsorbed PFAS and allows subsequent destruction, demonstrating a closed-loop treatment solution for micropollutant contamination.},

It is, however, a challenging task to achieve the higher precision on practical systems. This is mainly due to difficulties in engineering nonclassical states and performing nontrivial measurements on the system, especially when the number of particles is large. Here we propose a variational scheme with the Loschmidt echo for quantum metrology. By utilizing hardware-efficient ansatzes in the design of variational quantum circuits, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the probe state can be extracted from the experimentally measured Loschmidt echo in a scalable manner. This QFI is then used to guide the online optimization of the preparation of the probe state. We experimentally implement the scheme on an ensemble of 10-spin quantum processors and achieve a 12.4-dB enhancement of the measurement precision over the uncorrelated states, which is close to the theoretical limit. The scheme can also be employed on various other noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, which provides a promising protocol to demonstrate quantum advantages.},

  abstract     = {Side-chain fluorination can enhance the backbone organization and carrier mobility of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) but it often reduces their photovoltage due to the resulting deeper-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. Herein, we present a strategy to regulate the LUMO levels of two NFAs, MC9F5 and MC7F5, by repositioning the highly electronegative –C 2 F 5 moieties on the side chains. This approach mitigates the impact of fluorination on the energy levels, thereby improving the photovoltage and overall device performance. By incorporating 10,10,11,11,11-pentafluoro-2-(8,8,9,9,9-pentafluorononyl)undecyl side chains, the –C 2 F 5 moieties are positioned away from the conjugated backbone of MC9F5, resulting in an elevated LUMO level compared with MC7F5, which features 8,8,9,9,9-pentafluoro-2-(6,6,7,7,7-pentafluoroheptyl)nonyl side chains. This modification reduces both the charge generation and the non-radiative energy losses in the MC9F5-based devices. The MC9F5-based small-area and minimodule devices achieve efficiencies of 18.02% and 15.66%, respectively, which are among the highest values reported for acceptor–donor–acceptor-type NFAs.

Real-time monitoring of internal temperature distribution is necessary to ensure safe operation and enhance cell performance. However, current methods lack dimensionality, precision, and timeliness, hindering the detection of uneven lithium deposition and localized temperature variations that drive capacity fade and safety risks. Here, we develop an operando spatiotemporal super-resolution thermal monitoring system capable of real-time, super-resolution temperature mapping across the lithium anode with a record-high spatial resolution of 1820 points cm − ², and a temporal resolution of 1 frame per 3 seconds. Utilizing optical frequency-domain reflectometry, an Archimedean spiral fiber configuration, and super-resolution algorithms, we capture critical thermal variations and identify hotspots during cycling. To improve thermal uniformity and reduce safety risks, we apply protective strategies, including pyramid patterning, copper mesh and polylactic acid. Cells with these measures, as monitored by our system, show reduced average temperatures, delayed capacity degradation and fewer hotspots. This innovative monitoring approach not only integrates cutting-edge optical technology with energy storage diagnostics but also establishes a robust framework for assessing thermal management strategies, thus significantly advancing the safety and energy density of lithium metal batteries for sustainable energy applications.},

  abstract     = {Earth’s magnetic field history can provide insight into why life was able to originate and evolve on our planet, and how habitability has been maintained. The magnetism of minute magnetic inclusions in zircons indicates that the geomagnetic field is at least 4.2 billion years old, corresponding with genetic estimates for the age of the last universal common ancestor. The early establishment of the field would have provided shielding from solar and cosmic radiation, fostering environments for life to develop. The field was also likely important for preserving Earth’s water, essential for life as we know it. Between 3.9 and ca. 3.4 billion years ago, zircon magnetism suggests latitudinal stasis of different ancestral terrains, and stagnant lid tectonics. These data also indicate that the solid Earth was stable with respect to the spin axis, consistent with the absence of plate tectonic driving forces. Moreover, these data point to the existence of low-latitude continental nuclei with equable climate locales that could have supported early life. Near the end of the Precambrian (0.591 to 0.565 billion years ago), the dynamo nearly collapsed, but growth of the inner core during earliest Cambrian times renewed the magnetic field and shielding, helping to prevent drying of the planet. Before this renewal, the ultra-weak magnetic shielding may have had an unexpected effect on evolution. The extremely weak field could have allowed enhanced hydrogen escape to space, leading to increased oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans. In this way, Earth’s magnetic field may have assisted the radiation of the macroscopic and mobile animals of the Ediacara fauna. Whether the Ediacara fauna are genetically related to modern life is a matter of debate, but if so, magnetospheric control on atmospheric composition may have led to an acceleration in evolution that ultimately resulted in the emergence of intelligent life.},

Crystalline porous frameworks (CPFs), including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), have demonstrated considerable promise as efficient adsorbents for deep purification processes. However, their microcrystalline nature often limits their practicality for industrial-scale applications. In this study, we present a facile and scalable structuring strategy to shape 17 CPFs into 34 hydrophilic and hydrophobic microbead composites using poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-sodium alginate and polyether sulfone (PES) as co-polymers, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, the beads were employed for the sequestration of ReO 4 − (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99 TcO 4 − ) from contaminated tap water and simulated Hanford low-activity waste (LAW). Notably, they achieved one of the highest levels of purification in treating pre-treated LAW streams, allowing purification of drinking water to nearly 5000 times their own weight under continuous flow conditions. The purified water contained only 0.026 ppb of Tc (calculated from Re), meeting both WHO (0.159 ppb) and U.S. EPA (0.053 ppb) drinking water standards. Furthermore, the beads can be conveniently and rapidly regenerated through cycling. This study provides a universal structuring strategy of CPF beads for deep purification of nuclear wastewater.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges display significant variations in axial magmatism and tectonics. Yet, the processes governing mantle melting and melt transport remain a subject of ongoing debate. A key limitation has been the lack of contrasting observations of mantle melting beneath axial segment centers versus segment ends, particularly through electromagnetic methods, which are highly sensitive to partial molten mantle. Here, we present the first one-dimensional magnetotelluric observation conducted along the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean. Our findings reveal prominent low-resistivity zones at depths of 20–45 km beneath segment centers, which are indicative of shallow melting zones. We propose that the robust magma supply and associated repeated magma intrusions lead to a thin thermal lithosphere and associated shallow mantle melting. In contrast, such electrical resistivity anomalies are absent at comparable depths beneath the magma-poor deep valley, where the electrical lithosphere extends to depths of >50 km. The extremely thick lithosphere restricts mantle melting to greater depths and facilitates melt migration toward adjacent segment centers. Our study highlights the critical role of highly variable lithospheric thickness in regulating melting depth and focusing melt flow along ultraslow-spreading ridges. We propose that the significant variation in lithospheric thickness and the associated focused melting result in the recently observed highly variable crustal thickness along the Gakkel Ridge.},

Here, we utilize the hybridization between graphene and diamond surfaces to directly deplete surface unpaired electron spins, thereby achieving roughly two-fold enhancement in coherence. Through the combination of electron spin resonance spectra and first-principle calculations, we explain that this phenomenon arises from a significant reduction in electron spin density on the diamond surface due to interface electron orbital hybridization. Our research presents a new approach for solid-state quantum sensors to reach the desired sensitivity level and offers a new pathway for future studies on material interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Pyrovanadates are considered a promising host material for the reversible intercalation of highly charged Ca 2+ ions due to their favorable layered structure and the presence of rich interstitial confined species. However, in calcium-ion battery (CIB) systems, the diffusion kinetics of the Ca²⁺ ions are slower, and the electrostatic interactions are stronger (compared to Li + ), which limits the effectiveness of pyrovanadate's structural advantages. In this study, we employ an allelic reconfiguration strategy to develop novel solid-solution phase pyrovanadate materials, specifically Zn 3-x Cu х (OH) 2 V 2 O 7 ·2H 2 O (x = 0, 1, 1.5). By incorporating ‘twin’ isotopic Cu elements from the adjacent ds -block, we activate redox reactions at non-vanadium metal sites through the modulation of electronic properties. As a result, a pronounced plateau zone during the discharge/charge process is observed. Using theoretical simulations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have clarified the mechanism by which the solid solution enhances the interlayered confinement of species such as lattice water and hydroxide radicals, improving structural stability and facilitating the diffusion of highly charged Ca 2+ ions. This approach effectively addresses the issue of layer shrinkage, which typically arises from the intense Coulombic interaction between the carrier and the host. When assembled with an active carbon anode, coin-cell CIB devices can operate steadily at a charge rate of 100 mA g -1 for over 1000 reversible cycles. This demonstrates the potential of innovative solid-solution design strategies to create Coulombic-force-resistant host materials for future multivalent metal-ion battery technologies, including CIB systems.},

The development of effective methods to guarantee the safety of frequent human activities in high-altitude locations is therefore needed. Pre-acclimatization at sea level is an effective approach to mitigate subsequent altitude sickness for rapid ascent, which offers a viable substitute to on-site acclimatization, minimizes the associated risks that are linked to prolonged exposure in high-altitude environments and can be personalized to individual hypoxic responses. Another critical aspect to prevent long-term physical damage is personalized health management at high altitudes, which is enabled by the emerging technologies of wearable sensors, the Internet of Medical Things and artificial intelligence. In this review, we outline the progress in pre-acclimatization and high-altitude health management, as well as the understanding of physiological mechanisms under hypoxia, highlighting the important role that is played by wearable sensors and physiological closed-loop control systems in developing intelligent personalized solutions.

Morphological comparison between various species of sinosauropterygids from the Early Cretaceous of Northeast China, combined with the phylogenetic results, suggests that at least three distinct hunting strategies were present among coeval species.

  abstract     = {Photoswitchable catalysis enables the non-invasive regulation of light-to-chemical energy conversion, in which catalysts with wavelength-dependent photoexcitation behaviors are typically required. However, for semiconductors, the ultrafast hot-excited-species cooling, depicted as Kasha's rule, tends to induce the accumulation of photoinduced species on the lowest excited states, which brings about a detrimental effect on achieving photoswitchable catalysis. Herein, by taking polymeric carbon nitride as an example, we demonstrate photoswitchable molecular-oxygen activation that is achieved by incorporating carbonyl groups into the matrix: in the range of 300–400 nm, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen are identified as the dominant reactive oxygen species under high- and low-energy excitations, respectively. Photoluminescence and ultrafast transient absorption measurements confirm the breakdown of Kasha's rule in carbonylated carbon nitride in which the obstructed relaxation of hot excited species leads to nontrivial wavelength-dependent photophysical properties. This anti-Kasha behavior is also attributed to carbonyl-induced spin–orbit coupling in which the mixing of singlet and triplet states would lead to robust leaps/relaxations between these states, which in turn affect the cooling process of hot photoinduced species. This work deepens the understanding of modulating hot-excited-species relaxation for gaining versatile semiconductor-based photocatalysis.},

However, the spatial-temporal evolution of the HTP, especially that of the Paleogene Central Tibetan Valley (CTV), remains hotly debated. In this study, through radiometric geochronology, plant assemblages, oxygen and clumped isotope paleoaltimetries, we reconstruct the uplift history of the east-west-oriented Luolong Basin in eastern Tibet. Results show that the Luolong Basin was at 0.6 (+0.2/−0.4) km at ca. 54–46 Ma, then rose to 2.9 ± 0.9 km at ca. 44 Ma. The newly discovered Luolong Flora indicates the Eocene CTV extending into eastern Tibet, and that the valley was higher in the east, sloping to the west, inferring a westward progressive rise of the valley floor. Integrated evidence from paleomagnetism, magmatism and seismic tomography suggests that the birth of the near modern plateau is attributed to the stepwise delamination (drip) of the subducted Lhasa lithosphere from east to west.},

While cell competition eliminates suboptimal cells to ensure tissue integrity across various tissues, neuronal competition specifically sculpts neural networks to establish precise circuits for sensory, motor and cognitive functions. However, our understanding of cell competition across diverse neural cell types in both developmental and pathological contexts remains limited. Here, we review recent advances on the phenomenon, and mechanisms and potential functions of neural cell competition (NCC), ranging from neural progenitors, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to microglia. Physiological NCC governs cellular survival, proliferation, arborization, organization, function and territorial colonization, whereas dysregulated NCC may cause neurodevelopmental disorders, accelerate aging, exacerbate neurodegenerative diseases and drive brain tumor progression.

Here, we show that the Pacific Ocean could store climate anomalies within the subtropical recirculation gyre for a decadal duration, providing a ‘seeding’ link between the AMO and the PDO. The AMO-induced multidecadal temperature anomalies in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean are subducted into the thermocline and sequestered in the North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water. These temperature anomalies propagate along the recirculation gyre and eventually rejoin the Kuroshio one decade later. Once re-emerged in the Kuroshio–Oyashio Extension region, the anomalies may engage with local air–sea feedback, triggering the PDO. Our findings demonstrate that the mode water could provide a much-needed ocean memory for the prediction of multidecadal variability.},

However, the limited X-ray excited luminescence (XEL) property of organic scintillators affects their application. To date, the main approaches for improving the XEL property of organic scintillators have focused on introducing heavy atoms to increase the absorbance of X-rays and establishing new luminescence pathways, such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), to increase the exciton utilization efficiency. Even so, the XEL property of organic scintillators is not ideal compared with that of commercial inorganic scintillators. In this work, a highly stable charge separation (CS) state trap was introduced into the design of an organic scintillator. Combined with a unique thermally activated delayed phosphorescence (TADP) process, highly efficient capture and conversion of high-energy carriers are realized. As a result, the exciton generation efficiency dramatically increases, with an ultrahigh XEL intensity, and X-ray afterglow imaging at room temperature is achieved for the first time.

  abstract     = {Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has grown rapidly to track real-time blood glucose levels and trends with improved sensor accuracy. The ease of use and wide availability of CGM will facilitate safe and effective decision making for diabetes management. Here, we developed an attention-based deep learning model, CGMformer, pretrained on a well-controlled and diverse corpus of CGM data to represent individual's intrinsic metabolic state and enable clinical applications. During pretraining, CGMformer encodes glucose dynamics including glucose level, fluctuation, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia into latent space with self-supervised learning. It shows generalizability in imputing glucose value across five external datasets with different populations and metabolic states (MAE = 3.7 mg/dL). We then fine-tuned CGMformer towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks in the screening of diabetes and its complications using task-specific data, which demonstrated a consistently boosted predictive accuracy over direct fine-tuning on a single task (AUROC = 0.914 for type 2 diabetes (T2D) screening and 0.741 for complication screening). By learning an intrinsic representation of an individual's glucose dynamics, CGMformer classifies non-diabetic individuals into six clusters with elevated T2D risks, and identifies a specific cluster with lean body-shape but high risk of glucose metabolism disorders, which is overlooked by traditional glucose measurements. Furthermore, CGMformer achieves high accuracy in predicting an individual's postprandial glucose response with dietary modelling (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.763) and helps personalized dietary recommendations. Overall, CGMformer pretrains a transformer neural network architecture to learn an intrinsic representation by borrowing information from a large amount of daily glucose profiles, and demonstrates predictive capabilities fine-tuned towards a broad range of downstream applications, holding promise for the early warning of T2D and recommendations for lifestyle modification in diabetes management.},

  abstract     = {Unraveling complex cell-type-composition and gene-expression patterns at the cellular spatial resolution is crucial for understanding intricate cell functions in the brain. In this study, we developed Deep Neural Network-based Spatial Cell Typing (DSCT)—an innovative framework for spatial cell typing within spatial transcriptomic data sets. This approach utilizes a synergistic integration of an enhanced gene-selection strategy and a lightweight deep neural network for data training, offering a more rapid and accurate solution for the analysis of spatial transcriptomic data. Based on comprehensive analysis, DSCT achieved exceptional accuracy in cell-type identification across various brain regions, species and spatial transcriptomic platforms. It also performed well in mapping finer cell types, thereby showcasing its versatility and adaptability across diverse data sets. Strikingly, DSCT exhibited high efficiency and remarkable processing speed, with fewer computational resource demands. As such, this novel approach opens new avenues for exploring the spatial organization of cell types and gene-expression patterns, advancing our understanding of biological functions and pathologies within the nervous system.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskites have attracted substantial attention recently. However, the strong lattice distortion effects in these materials have led to debates regarding the nature of charge carriers. While the behavior of carriers in bulk three-dimensional materials is well-documented, the characteristics of carriers in two-dimensional perovskites remain less well understood. In this study, we provide direct and clear evidence of small polaron formation through transient spectroscopic analysis of deformation potential and dynamic lattice screening. Coherent acoustic phonon wave signals reveal a strong coupling between carriers and lattice degrees of freedom, leading to small polaron formation and a spin lifetime enhancement of up to 10-fold. Utilizing optical Kerr spectroscopy and theoretical modeling, we observed a notably long polarization response time at room temperature, attributed to lattice distortion and small polarons approximately two-unit cells in size. Temperature-dependent coherent phonon dynamics and X-ray diffraction further confirmed the presence of small polarons. This discovery underscores the significance of the cooperative interplay between exciton dynamics and the small polaron field, particularly in influencing the Coulomb exchange interaction of excitons.},

With radically different interpretations of its structure, it has been assigned to almost all major jawless and jawed vertebrate groups. Here we report a new and older species of Palaeospondylus from the Early Devonian of Australia (c. 400 Ma), investigated using high-resolution computed tomography. Its 3D-preserved braincase demonstrates a combination of primitive gnathostome features including an anteriorly positioned transverse cranial fissure of uncertain homology, a large dorsal fontanelle and a small hypophysial fossa. Contrary to recent interpretations of P. gunni , the new braincase shows that Palaeospondylus lacks both a postorbital process and an intracranial joint. Our new Australian species extends the history of Palaeospondylus back some 10 million years prior to its occurrence in Scotland. The newly identified neurocranial characters have been coded into a phylogenetic analysis that places Palaeospondylus as a sister group of the Chondrichthyes, but some neurocranial characters could indicate a phylogenetic position within the gnathostome stem group.},

However, the current pool of identified EML materials remains limited, exclusively comprising purely inorganic substances. This study delves into the investigation of the EML properties of a zero-dimensional (0D) organic-inorganic metal halide denoted as [C 19 H 18 P] 2 MnBr 4 (where C 19 H 18 P + signifies methyl triphenyl phosphonium). Notably, [C 19 H 18 P] 2 MnBr 4 manifests two distinct polymorphs, with the piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric polymorphs exhibiting thermodynamic and kinetic stability, respectively. Despite both compounds showing bright greenish luminescence, only the piezoelectric phase exhibits desirable EML behavior. The EML in this context is distinguished by its high intensity, strong fatigue resistance and prompt self-recovery. The underlying mechanism of EML in the piezoelectric polymorph can be explained by the piezoelectric effect and the stress-induced energy band tilting. Calorimetric and piezoelectric experiments reveal the self-recoverable EML arises from the relaxation of the stress-induced kinetically stable non-piezoelectric to the thermodynamically favored piezoelectric phase. This work paves a new pathway in the exploration of self-recoverable EML materials in the realm of hybrid organic-inorganic crystals.},

Zero-dimensional organic-inorganic metal halide (0D-OIMH) materials have demonstrated remarkable potential in diverse applications owing to their captivating optoelectronic characteristics. However, the electronic structure and spin-configuration of the frequently observed dual-peak emission in these materials remains a subject of intensive debate. In this study, we employ low-temperature magneto-optical measurements to investigate the excited state structure of a representative 0D-OIMH, namely (Bmpip) 2 SnBr 4 . The spin-configurations of the dark and bright states are clearly elucidated by measuring the magneto-polarization of the emissions. Our results reveal that the high-energy peak arises from bright excited states within a higher energy band, whilst the low-energy peak originates from a combination of triplet-bright states and singlet-dark states. These findings provide an unambiguous understanding of the exciton structures of the distinctive 0D-OIMHs.},

  abstract     = {Metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are a promising technology for energy-efficient and cost-effective lighting and displays, thanks to their tunable color emission, high brightness, color purity and low-temperature fabrication. However, the mixed ionic-electronic conductivity of perovskite materials presents unique challenges, as ionic defects can redistribute under operation, affecting the energy landscape and charge recombination mechanisms. Our drift-diffusion simulations establish a connection between the transient electroluminescence (TrEL) signals of PeLEDs under pulsed operation and the influence of mobile ions. We find that the TrEL plateau value’s dependence on the duty cycle and end-of-pulse overshoot can be explained by the time-varying distribution of ionic defects. The inclusion of mobile ions is crucial to understand the TrEL response. Moreover, the simulations highlight injection barriers at the perovskite/charge-transport layer interfaces, such as is the case for the hole transport layer in our example, as a significant source of non-radiative charge recombination. These findings contribute to the understanding of transient ionic processes in perovskite-based devices.},

Despite progress, significant gaps remain, including large uncertainties due to model limitations and inconsistent driving data, insufficient assessments of integrated global warming potential (GWP) under long-term land-use and climate changes, the lack of freshwater emission inventories, and the need for more observations, refined prior sectoral contributions, and novel methods like isotopic signature applications in machine-learning and inversion techniques. This review offers a new perspective by compiling a new CH₄ and N₂O inventory and evaluating their integrated GWP for 1980–2020, developed using multi-model approaches to assess climate and land-use impacts. The review underscores the importance of CH₄ and N₂O sources and sinks, offering recommendations to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce emissions.},

After describing the fundamental principles and methodologies of the technique, we synthesize recent progress in estimating China's CO₂ and CH₄ budgets through atmospheric inversion, and compare these estimates with national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory (NGHGI) reports. The inverted estimates for China's total CO 2 and CH 4 emissions amount to 8.35 ± 1.39 Pg CO 2 a −1 and 60.8 ± 5.9 Tg CH 4 a −1 , respectively, in the last decade, which are in general consistent with NGHGIs. However, large uncertainties in spatial and temporal disaggregation of national budgets hinder the effectiveness of the method in verifying China's GHG budgets and improving NGHGI estimates. These uncertainties are largely driven by differences in inversion models, observational coverage and methodological assumptions. We recommend improving observational networks, conducting model intercomparison exercises and refining inversion methods to better support China's GHG reporting and future climate goals.},

  abstract     = {Thermal-stiffening hydrogels exhibit a dramatic soft-to-stiff transition upon heating, making them ideal candidates for temperature-triggered self-protection and shape memory applications. However, their practical use is still hampered by a slow recovery process (generally >30 min) during cooling, attributed to sluggish mass diffusion and delayed phase dissolution. Herein, we present a high-entropy phase separation design to significantly accelerate the recovery dynamics of these materials. We demonstrate this concept using a thermal-stiffening poly(calcium acrylate)-based copolymer hydrogel by incorporating hydrophilic units. Mechanistically, the hydrophilic units disrupt the dense packing of thermal-stiffening clusters, creating a high-entropy topological structure with a low energy barrier for rapid mass diffusion. This approach retains the impressive thermal-stiffening response with a 760-fold increase in storage modulus, while dramatically reducing the characteristic recovery time to merely 28 s. We anticipate this high-entropy strategy to be broadly applicable in designing modulus-adaptive materials with fast switching dynamics.},

Here, we show that the solvated H 2 O can be effectively minimized by an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) consisting of highly nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon (NC) and perfluorosulfonic acid polymer (Nafion). Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that NC raises the Fermi level of the composite SEI and activates the non-coordinating charge transfer from the SEI to [Zn(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ , which leads to ultrafast desolvation of hydrated Zn-ions in the outer Helmholtz layer; while the Nafion framework ensures selective transport channels for Zn ions. Remarkably, the derived NC-Nafion@Zn symmetric cell exhibits a long lifespan (3400 h, 1 mA cm –2 ; 2000 h, 5 mA cm –2 ); moreover, the NC-Nafion@Zn//Mn 4 O 3 -carbon nanotubes full battery delivers ultralong cycling stability of 9300 cycles at 2 A g –1 with a high retention of 91.3%.},

  abstract     = {National greenhouse gas (GHG) budget, including CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O has increasingly become a topic of concern in international climate governance. China is paying increasing attention to reducing GHG emissions and increasing land sinks to effectively mitigate climate change. Accurate estimates of GHG fluxes are crucial for monitoring progress toward mitigating GHG emissions in China. This study used comprehensive methods, including emission factor methods, process-based models, atmospheric inversions, and data-driven models, to estimate the long-term trends of GHG sources and sinks from all anthropogenic and natural sectors in China's mainland during 2000–2023, and produced an up-to-date China GHG Budget dataset (CNGHG). The total gross emissions of the three GHGs show a 3-fold increase from 5.0 (95% CI: 4.9–5.1) Gt CO 2 -eq yr −1 (in 2000) to 14.3 (95% CI: 13.8–14.8) Gt CO 2 -eq yr −1 (in 2023). CO 2 emissions represented 81.8% of the GHG emissions in 2023, while 12.7% and 5.5% were for CH 4 and N 2 O, respectively. As the largest CO 2 source, the energy sector contributed 87.4% CO 2 emissions. In contrast, the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector was the largest sector of CH 4 and N 2 O, representing 50.1% and 66.3% emissions, respectively. Moreover, China's terrestrial ecosystems serve as a net CO 2 sink (1.0 Gt CO 2 yr −1 , 95% CI: 0.2–1.9 Gt CO 2 yr −1 ) during 2012 to 2021, equivalent to an average of 14.3% of fossil CO 2 emissions. Our GHG emission estimates showed a general consistency with national GHG inventories, with gridded and sector-specific estimates of GHG fluxes over China, providing the basis for curtailing GHG emissions for each region and sector.},

Here, we develop a vdW confined space assisted hydrogenation method to produce AH-Gr. The confined space between graphene and the substrate aggregates hydrogen radicals, making the bottom-side of graphene more prone to hydrogenation. The dense and homogeneous confined spaces between adjacent vdW crystals promote rapid and uniform distribution of carbon-hydrogen (C−H) bonds. The hydrogen-to-carbon atomic (H/C) ratios can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting the permeated proton dose. All AH-Gr, regardless of H/C ratios, remain vacancy-free. The spatial distributions of C−H bonds significantly influence the electrical and magnetic properties of AH-Gr. Asymmetric hydrogenation transforms graphene from a semi-metal to a semiconductor, suppresses the quantum Hall effect, and reduces the phase coherence length. This study provides new insights into the preparation and characteristics of hydrogenated graphene, broadening the applications of vdW confined space.},

  abstract     = {Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation of information technologies, e.g. storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an artificial intelligence (AI) search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors and insulators, confirmed by first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g. the anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect and topological property. It is worth noting that we discovered four i -wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.},

The weakly solvated electrolytes show weak ion–dipole interaction and promote rapid desolvation but are faced with sluggish ion-transport kinetics, thus inducing high overpotential and Li-dendrite formation. Herein, by applying methyl propionate as a weakly coordinated cosolvent, a loose solvation shell that is regulated by anion–solvent interaction enables weakened Li + –anion interaction while maintaining adequate anion participation, featuring a facilitated bulk ion-transport route via anion dissociation, originally achieving a high ionic conductivity of 17.74 mS cm −1 in weakly solvated electrolytes at 25°C. Consequently, this advanced electrolyte design markedly mitigates concentration polarization and regulates uniform Li deposition, and thus the hybrid anode achieves 99.8% average coulombic efficiency within 1500 cycles at 4C and improved cycling stability at a low N/P ratio of 0.5, making a breakthrough in alkali-metal-ion batteries.},

However, DSE faces challenges such as slow reaction kinetics, impurities, the competing chlorine evolution reaction at the anode, and membrane fouling, making it more complex than freshwater electrolysis. Therefore, developing catalysts with excellent stability under corrosion and fulfilling activity is vital to the advancement of DSE. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with excellent tunability, high selectivity and high active sites demonstrate considerable potential for use in the electrolysis of seawater. In this review, we present the anodic and cathodic reaction mechanisms that occur during seawater cracking. Subsequently, to meet the challenges of DSE, rational strategies for modulating SACs are explored, including axial ligand engineering, carrier effects and protective layer coverage. Then, the application of in-situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations to SACs is discussed with the aim of elucidating the intrinsic factors responsible for their efficient electrocatalysis. Finally, the process of scaling up monoatomic catalysts for the electrolysis of seawater is described, and some prospective insights are provided.},

This leads to a structural genome database (SGD) approach for the intelligent design of mechanical metamaterials. Using the SGD approach, metamaterials exhibiting the Hashin–Shtrikman upper bound of bulk modulus, auxetic behavior and the unimodal property have been created, with design efficiency improved by 3–4 orders of magnitude. Additionally, transfer learning and a small amount of training data allow the SGD to predict non-local behaviors beyond a unit cell, such as optimized unit cells with critical buckling strength enhanced by nearly 200% and a bandgap metamaterial with a relative bandgap width of 51%. Experimentally validated optimized metamaterials demonstrate auxetic behavior and superior buckling resistance. The proposed SGD approach holds promise for the advanced design of multi-scale and multi-physics systems.},

These hydrogel coatings adhere to the liquid-metal surface, forming a cohesive network through hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid groups and siloxane linkages from silanol groups. This synergy of physical and chemical interactions enables hydrogel coatings with exceptional stretchability, fracture energy and interfacial bonding to liquid metals. Consequently, the hydrogel-coated containment capsule of magnetic liquid metal exhibits remarkable resilience to cyclic compression, enduring strains of ≤85%, while also withstanding impacts from heights of >14 m. Moreover, the containment capsules demonstrate large deformation capabilities, dexterous locomotion and wireless heating under the control of static and alternating magnetic fields. They showcase the capability for remote thermal ablation operations on ex vivo porcine stomachs and in vivo rabbit models.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture emerges as a prominent contributor to CH 4 and N 2 O emissions in China. However, estimates of these two non-CO 2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) remain poorly constrained, hindering a precise understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Here, we established a consistent estimation framework that integrates emission-factor approach, data-driven models and process-based biogeochemical models, to identify the magnitudes, spatial variations, and long-term trends of agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions in China's mainland from 1980 to 2023. Over the study period, the average total agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions amounted to 722.5 ± 102.3 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 , with livestock CH 4 , cropland CH 4 , cropland N 2 O and livestock N 2 O contributing 41% (297.4 ± 64.3 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), 31% (225.0 ± 69.6 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), 18% (130.6 ± 9.4 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ) and 10% (69.4 ± 20.2 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), respectively. Approximately 70% of these emissions were concentrated in the eastern region beyond the Hu Line, with emission hotspots identified in South-central China, East China, and the Sichuan Basin. Our analysis revealed three distinct temporal stages of total emissions during the study period: rapid growth (1980–late 1990s), slow growth (late 1990s–middle 2010s), and a stabilization stage (since the middle 2010s). These stages reflect the evolving trajectory of agriculture in China, from the expansion of agricultural yields, to the transformation of agricultural practices, and ultimately the pursuit of sustainable development. However, the temporal trajectory of emissions varied significantly across different regions, highlighting divergent levels of agricultural development. This study presents a comprehensive, gridded, and consistent estimate of agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions in China, offering valuable insights for policymakers to develop tailored strategies that adapt to local conditions, enabling effective emission reduction measures.},

However, a crucial aspect in accomplishing this is to comprehend the magnetic exchange interactions between unpaired π- and d-electrons, a topic that has been seldom addressed. In this study, we focus on magnetic π-d exchange interactions between open-shell NGs and a magnetic coordination center of Fe or Co by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We synthesize two sets of NG-metal coordination complexes on a Au(111) substrate, secured by coordination bonds of carboxyl acid-Fe (Co). Through analysis of the excitation spectra, we observe a characteristic exchange coupling of 9 meV (5 meV) between the unpaired π-electron and the Fe (Co) d-shell electrons. Our experimental findings are qualitatively in agreement with multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations. This work provides evidence that a substantial magnetic exchange coupling can be achieved and engineered in metal-organic coordination systems, paving the way for designing and customizing extended radical metal-organic frameworks with precisely tailored magnetic properties.},

In various downstream tasks, FMs have consistently achieved noteworthy results, demonstrating high levels of accuracy in representing biological entities.

By regulating the intersystem crossing and reversed intersystem crossing features of the D-A system, D-A MOFs could reveal highly tunable triplet-exciton generation. Via the synergy of the enhanced electron transfer properties and the effective energy transfer to ground-state O 2 , the optimized D-A MOF ( C1 ) could reveal remarkable activity toward 1 O 2 generation under appropriate irradiation, which is fully proven by the highly efficient oxidation and detoxification of mustard simulant 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide into 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (conversion and selectivity >99% within 15 min). Moreover, the application of C1 for the photocatalytic oxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid to artemisinin results in the highest selectivity and yield (selectivity 88% and conversion >99% at 25°C) among all reported homo- or heterogeneous PCs.},

We report here seismic velocity variations around the Anninghe fault zone in southwest China based on seismic interferometry techniques. We observed that tidal forces significantly impact velocity changes within the fault fracture zone, inducing periodic changes in seismic velocity on diurnal, semidiurnal and monthly scales. Moreover, the response to Earth tides is notably more pronounced in the fault fracture zone compared to other areas. This can be attributed to tidal forces affecting the opening and closing of cracks in the subsurface medium. Due to the higher density of fractures within the fault fracture zone, it becomes more sensitive to tidal forces. Our findings underscore the crucial role of tidal forces in perturbing stress within the fault zone during periods when earthquakes have not occurred.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of programmable metasurfaces has yielded many exciting electromagnetic (EM) phenomena and applications in both communities of physical and information sciences. Programmable metasurfaces, also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces or intelligent reflecting surfaces in wireless communications, have played important roles in enhancing signal coverage and transmission quality, and in building an artificially controlled communication environment. However, most of the realistic implementations are designed in the sub-6G band with a small array scale and 1-bit phase control ability, making the performance improvement not marvelous compared with the traditional solutions. Here, we propose a large-scale 2-bit millimeter-wave programmable metasurface to build an integrated smart base station framework for 6G communications. The meta-array is composed of 30 × 30 meta-elements, each with two embedded positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes. A dish-cone antenna is integrated with the metasurface to serve as the feeding source. A control board is designed to autonomously switch the working states of all of the 1800 PIN diodes based on a field-programmable gate array, enabling the individual adjustment of the EM responses of all meta-elements in the array. Through the deliberate arrangement of phase distribution on the surface, the array can undergo reconfiguration to achieve the desired EM functionalities. We take the programmable metasurface as the core to assist a millimeter-wave base station and validate its good performance for wireless communications in a realistic indoor scenario. Subsequently, we build a four-stream wireless communication scenario using four 30 × 30 arrays and demonstrate smart multi-user information transmissions with different positions. This work provides great potential for programmable metasurfaces to aid the development of novel and intelligent millimeter-wave base stations, offering valuable insights for advancing next-generation mobile communications.},

However, the formation of metal dendrites remains a critical challenge, compromising both safety and operational stability. For zinc-based batteries (ZBs), traditional methods to suppress dendrite growth have shown limited success and often entail performance compromise. Here, we propose a novel strategy termed dendrite rearrangement that leverages the electrochemical self-discharge process to controllably address the dendrite issues. By temporarily increasing the input voltage within a single cycle, this strategy resets the cell stability without precipitating undesirable side reactions during normal operation. This pioneering technique extends operational lifespans to over three times their original duration, facilitating 80 000 cycles for Zn-ion hybrid capacitors and 3000 hours for Zn symmetrical cells. Even in scaled-up pouch cells, Ah-level symmetrical cells demonstrate a cumulative capacity nearing 200 000 mAh, significantly surpassing those of reported metal symmetrical cells. Additionally, the electrolytic Zn–MnO 2 battery demonstrates a high capacity approaching 10 Ah, setting a new benchmark among reported ZB devices. These results mark a significant advancement towards resolving dendrite-related issues in metal anode batteries, paving the way for their sustainable development and potential commercialization.},

By compensating for the CSS's high dynamic rotation rate using a built-in piezoelectric mirror, spatial interference fringes in the interferometer are successfully obtained. Then, the optimized ratio of the Raman laser's angles is derived, the coefficients of the piezoelectric mirror are self-calibrated in orbit, and various systemic effects are corrected. We achieve a rotation measurement resolution of 50 μrad/s for a single shot and 17 μrad/s for an average number of 32.

  abstract     = {Magnetometry plays an important role in exploring the deep sea, which is one of the Earth’s final unknown frontiers. However, the complexity of the marine environment and the limitations of conventional magnetometers restrict its in-depth application. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond offers a potential solution to encompass and transcend conventional ocean magnetometers. Its unique advantages, such as precise vector measurement and tolerance to extreme environments, make it well suited for deep-sea applications like navigation. This work introduces the first deep-sea quantum vector magnetometer based on NV centers. The performance of this magnetometer is effectively validated by a series of field tests on the manned submersible Shenhai Yongshi during a cruise in the South China Sea, including an experimental underwater navigation using the diamond quantum sensor as a magnetic compass. This successful deep-sea application marks a milestone for transforming this promising solid-state spin quantum system into a practical sensor for real-world marine applications.},

The shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic has dissipated; social activities and domestic travels have largely returned to normal; and they enjoyed the unity and enthusiasm of the Paris Olympic Games together with the whole world. However, there is a lingering thought in everyone’s mind that there may be ‘a next pandemic’ coming sometime in the future. ‘Be prepared for danger in times of peace’ is a wisdom that never goes out of style. National Science Review (NSR) conducted an interview in September 2024 with Prof. George Fu Gao, the former Director General of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a top scientist in pathogenic microbiology and immunology. In this interview, Gao talked about the possibilities of ‘the next pandemic’ from a scientific perspective, and calls on the world to maintain openness, sharing and collaboration in research and action related to global health .},

  abstract     = {The primate amygdala serves to evaluate the emotional content of sensory inputs and modulate emotional and social behaviors; it modulates cognitive, multisensory and autonomic circuits predominantly via the basal, lateral and central nuclei, respectively. Recent evidence has suggested the mesoscale (millimeter-scale) nature of intra-amygdala functional organization. However, the connectivity patterns by which these mesoscale regions interact with brainwide networks remain unclear. Using infrared neural stimulation of single mesoscale sites coupled with mapping in ultrahigh field 7-T functional magnetic resonance imaging, we have discovered that these mesoscale sites exert influence over a surprisingly extensive scope of the brain. Our findings strongly indicate that mesoscale sites within the amygdala modulate brainwide networks through a ‘one-to-many’ (integral) way. Meanwhile, these connections exhibit a point-to-point (focal) topography. Our work provides new insights into the functional architecture underlying emotional and social behavioral networks, thereby opening up possibilities for individualized modulation of psychological disorders.},

  abstract     = {Information encryption based on DNA data archiving, referred to as DNA encryption, has been advocated for decades and has become highly appealing owing to its remarkable advantages, e.g. high storage capacity, complexity and programmability. Early DNA encryption schemes primarily leveraged the natural four-letter genetic alphabet for data storage, with message-storing DNA sequences easily decrypted by routine DNA sequencing, which is consequently vulnerable to attack and faces severe security challenges. Here, an unnatural base pair (UBP), dNaM-dTPT3, was introduced into the message and/or index DNA sequences, which can be stored either in vitro or in vivo ; this approach achieved the bioorthogonal encryption of ‘secret’ messages, where message DNAs could be selectively, faithfully and readily retrieved or read exclusively in the presence of unnatural bases. Furthermore, a separative computational algorithm, named IM-Codec, was developed to encrypt the data into a ‘key sequence’ and an ‘information sequence’ through UBP insertion. Finally, a UBP-based multilevel DNA encryption approach was developed and validated for data encryption and decryption. The employment of the UBP expanded genetic system for data encryption should provide valuable solutions for archiving highly confidential data and thus usher in a new era of DNA encryption.},

In this study, we developed a VR-based eye movement desensitization and reprocessing extinction training program tailored for mice. We found that this VR treatment during cocaine extinction prevents reinstatement by suppressing the hyperactivation of glutamatergic excitatory neurons in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SCi CaMKIIα ) during exposure to environmental cues. Additionally, SCi CaMKIIα neurons innervate tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC TH ). Environmental cues trigger stronger phasic activation of LC TH neurons through this SCi CaMKIIα →LC TH projection, leading to increased dopamine release onto the dorsal CA3 (dCA3) region, thereby facilitating reinstatement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VR treatment effectively inhibits the neural circuitry involving SCi CaMKIIα →LC TH →dCA3 in response to environmental cues, thus preventing cocaine reinstatement. Our findings suggest that VR treatment may represent a promising strategy for achieving drug abstinence.},

By obtaining one of the largest datasets of EBV genomes across the world, we found that EBV had an evolutionary history matching the out-of-Africa migration of humans. Within the high-risk subtype from southern China, we identified a rapidly expanding clonal strain originating from a recombination event between EBV strains from northern and southern Chinese around 4000 years ago, followed by strong Darwinian evolution with a fitness advantage of 4%. The clonal strain has almost doubled the risk for NPC compared to the high-risk subtype and explained around 66% of the NPCs, representing the highest risk factor for NPC identified so far. Taken together, we unraveled a strong co-evolution history between EBV and humans where human migration and admixture triggered subsequent recombination and expansion of a highly advantageous EBV strain, leading to a cancer epidemic in southern China.},

However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), to enhance oxidation power by three to four orders of magnitude beyond conventional pulsed laser deposition and oxide molecular beam epitaxy, while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of the designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by using laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates—especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO 2 layers that possess distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of the high-temperature superconductor. GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.},

  abstract     = {The features of intrinsic porosity and fluidity endow porous liquids (PLs) with unique properties and performance but the preparation of PLs remains challenging due to the difficulty in liquefying and keeping porous features at the same time. Herein, we develop a stepwise surface functionalization and ion exchange strategy to achieve a rare example of flexible covalent organic framework (COF)-based PL (COF-PLs). By coating the outer surface of the judiciously selected three-dimensional flexible COF-301 with an imidazolium salt corona, followed by liquefaction using the anion canopy potassium poly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (PEGS) via electrostatic interactions, a flexible PL, COF-301-PL, can be obtained. Theoretical calculations and CO 2 adsorption experiments reveal that the cavities of COF-301-PL undergo dynamic adjustments in response to changes in CO 2 pressure. The dynamic expansion effect can not only provide additional gas adsorption capacity (7.04 mmol/g at 40 bar) but also facilitate the mass transfer of gas molecules during the catalytic process. Consequently, COF-301-PL exhibits superior catalytic efficiency for the conversion of CO 2 into cyclic carbonate by a factor of 24 and 17 compared to those of PEGS and COF-301 solid counterpart, respectively. The optimization of substrate adsorption and mass transfer conditions consequently improves the overall efficiency of catalytic reactions.

  abstract     = {Developing gas sensors that can simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of a single-type gas remains a significant challenge. Herein we demonstrate cobalt (Co) single atoms with an unconventional dynamically changing coordination structure that could be used as NH 3 -sensing material with superior sensitivity and selectivity. According to the steric effect of 2-methylimidazole (2MI) molecules and carbonyl groups on graphene, the Co single atom is evolved into a bidentate coordinated structure (Co-2MI-G). In-situ characterization and theoretical simulation reveal that the sensing mechanism of Co-2MI-G is the specific chemical adsorption between unsaturated coordinated Co single atoms and NH 3 molecules, causing a reversible switching of coordination number from 2 to 4, a valence state transfer from Co 2+ to Co 3+ of Co single atoms, and a band-gap width from 0.14 eV to 0.50 eV. Consequently, the Co-2MI-G-based gas sensor presents a sensing response of 67.598% for 1 ppm NH 3 and a limit of detection of 2.67 ppb, at least 1.8 times higher than that of state-of-the-art NH 3 sensors, together with robust stability and reproducibility. This work provides an innovative perspective on utilizing single atoms for ultra-selective gas sensing by coordination regulation.},

  abstract     = {The longevity of cratons usually implies that the entire cratonic lithosphere remained unchanged over billions of years, which is traditionally attributed to their intrinsically buoyant and strong lithospheric roots. By reviewing relevant studies and recent observational constraints, we show that the present cratonic roots are notably denser than the ambient mantle, with the compositional buoyancy offsetting only one-fifth of the negative thermal buoyancy. In addition, the presence of a weak mid-lithospheric discontinuity could decouple the upper and lower lithosphere upon perturbation, allowing delamination of the lower portion, while most of the delaminated lithosphere would eventually relaminate to the base of the lithosphere after sufficient warming inside the convective mantle. This process generates enduring (>100 Myr) and prominent (>1 km) surface uplifts within continents, a mechanism more compatible with data, especially those reflecting lithospheric deformation, than the model of all continents climbing up a steady region of dynamic uplift. Subsequent lithospheric cooling gradually draws the surface down to below sea level, where the lithospheric mantle density reaches a maximum upon formation of the next supercontinent. We argue that such cratonic deformation has happened repeatedly over supercontinent cycles since the Neoproterozoic and has largely shaped the properties of the present cratonic lithosphere. A few new research directions are also suggested.},

Juvenile hormone (JH) is produced in the corpora allata (CA) and acts as a gonadotrophic hormone in most insects. Using transcriptomic, biochemical, molecular, and genetic analyses, here we investigated the underlying mechanism of how inter-organelle communication dynamically orchestrates JH biosynthesis and female reproduction in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana . The extracellular stimuli insulin and allatostatin act through their membrane receptors and antagonistically regulate RyR-mediated Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in CA cells. Ca 2+ -activated CaMKII stimulates energy metabolism in the mitochondria partially via SLC25A6 , and induces the expression of JH biosynthetic genes HMGR , Jhamt , and Cyp15a1 through activating transcription factor CREB, which recruits CBP for histone acetylation in the nucleus. Additionally, mitochondria interact with CREB-CBP through mitonuclear communication to regulate JH biosynthesis. From the perspective of inter-organelle communication, this comprehensive study significantly advanced our understanding of hormone biosynthesis and reproductive biology in insects.},

  abstract     = {Fluorochemicals are a rapidly expanding class of materials used in a variety of fields including pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, agrochemicals, refrigerants, and in particular, alkali metal ion batteries. However, achieving one-step synthesis of pure fluorophosphate compounds in a well-controlled manner remains a formidable challenge due to the volatilization of fluorine during the heat treatment process. One feasible method is to cleave the C–F bond in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) during synthesis to create a fluorine-rich atmosphere and strongly reducing environment. However, the inert nature of the C–F bond in PTFE presents a significant obstacle, as it is the strongest single bond in organic compounds. To address this predicament, we propose a fluorine-compensating strategy that involves cleavage of the C–F bonds by nucleophilic S N 2-type reactions of Brønsted base (ammonia) enabling fluorine compensation. The decomposed products (NH 2 · and C·) also result in the formation of micropores (via NH 3 escape) and in-situ carbon coating (via C· polymerization). The resultant cathode delivers a superior potassium storage capability including high rate performance and capacity retention. This contribution not only overcomes the obstacles associated with the inert C–F bond in fluororesin, but also represents a significant step forward in the development of fluorine-containing compounds.},

However, the inherent rigidity and crystalline nature of SMAs often embrittle the polymer donor films in the constructed bulk heterojunction structure. To address this challenge, we improved the stretchability of the blend films by designing and synthesizing a tethered giant tetrameric acceptor (GTA) with increased molecular weight that promotes entanglement of individual SMA units. The key to this design is using tetraphenylmethane as the linking core to create a three-dimensional and high C 2 symmetry structure, which successfully regulates their aggregation and relaxation behavior. With GTA as the acceptor, its blend films with polymer donor PM6 exhibit significantly improved stretchability, with nearly a 150% increase in crack onset strain value compared to PM6:Y6. Moreover, the PSCs achieve an increased efficiency of up to 18.71% and demonstrate outstanding photostability, maintaining >90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after operating for over 1000 hours. Our findings demonstrate that by specifically designing three-dimensional tethered SMAs and aligning their molecular weights more closely with those of polymer counterparts, we can achieve enhanced stretchability without compromising morphological stability or device efficiency.},

Here, we used daily MODIS satellite observations from 2003 to 2022 to analyze algal bloom trends in 1956 large freshwater lakes worldwide. Among these lakes, 620 have experienced algal bloom events in over half of the years during the past two decades, with an upward trend in bloom frequency observed in 504 lakes. This trend is particularly prominent in subtropical regions and has become most pronounced after 2015. The global median annual bloom frequency has significantly increased at a rate of +1.8%/yr over the past two decades, showing a significant correlation with air temperatures ( r 2 = 0.43, P < 0.05). Furthermore, in 44.8% of the bloom-affected lakes, we observed a strong correlation between air temperature and bloom frequency. Our study helps clarify the factors contributing to the global expansion of algal blooms and emphasizes the urgent need to recognize and address this growing environmental challenge within the context of climate warming.},

Here, cubic-phase α-MoC 1−x nanoparticles were incorporated into a carbon matrix and coupled with cobalt phthalocyanine molecules (α-MoC 1−x –CoPc@C) for the co-reduction of CO 2 and H 2 O, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency for CO close to 100%. Through a combination of in-situ spectroscopies, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical simulations, it is demonstrated that α-MoC 1−x nanoparticles and CoPc molecules with optimized local configuration serve as the active centers for H 2 O activation and CO 2 reduction, respectively. The interfacial water molecules were rearranged, forming a dense hydrogen bond network on the catalyst surface. This optimized microenvironment at the electrode–electrolyte interface synergistically enhanced water dissociation, accelerated proton transfer, and improved the overall performance of CO 2 RR.},

Herein, we report a tandem electro-thermal synthesis pathway that addresses these challenges in producing OPCs (III) from P 4 . The process begins with an electrooxidation step that generates a stable trivalent phosphorus transfer reagent, then thermochemically converted into various high-value OPCs (III). Utilizing hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the nucleophile and optimizing a tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI)–4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)-adduct catalytic system, we developed an efficient electrophilic phosphorus transfer reagent via electrosynthesis. The adduct facilitates the oxidation of P 4 and enhances the nucleophilicity of HFIP, thereby improving the electrooxidation process. This approach supports high current density, scales up to the hundred-gram level without yield loss, and remains compatible with fluctuating green electricity.},

By utilizing a combination of station observations and the latest CMIP6 simulations, here we show that DSSR had a global consistent decline during 1959–2014, with comparable contributions from greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols. The role of GHGs is even more important in the satellite period. The contribution from GHGs comes through rising temperature, which reduces the DSSR by increasing water vapor but is partly offset by reduced cloud. Future changes of DSSR are heavily dependent on climate change scenarios, which can be predicted well by global mean surface temperature (GMST) and aerosol concentrations. The sharp aerosol reduction and weak temperature rise in the SSP245/SSP126 scenarios will limit or stop the long-term decline of DSSR thus leading to a brighter future.},

  abstract     = {Natural nacre that consists of brittle minerals and weak organics exhibits a high fracture toughness while retaining a high strength. The exceptional mechanical performance of nacre is attributed to its hierarchical structure like a ‘brick-and-mortar’ structure, which has inspired the development of tough ceramic-based composites. However, the practical applications of biomimetic structural ceramics are hindered by limited material size, fabrication efficiency and flexibility of being molded into various shapes. We herein report the fabrication of nacre-like ceramic-metal composites based on deformable alumina microspheres coated with nickel salt. Green bodies are produced by assembling the composite microspheres in molds with different shapes. During the hot-pressing sintering of the green bodies, the microspheres are flattened into platelets under pressure and fill up the entire space without visible voids. The aligned platelets are separated by nickel that is reduced from the nickel salt on their surface, constituting a typical ‘brick-and-mortar’ structure. By tuning the microsphere sizes, the microstructures of the composites can be optimized to obtain a high flexural strength (386 MPa at room temperature and 286.86 MPa at 600°C) and a high fracture toughness (12.76 MPa·m 1/2 at room temperature and 12.99 MPa·m 1/2 at 600°C) simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Fracture-based interfacial breakage has shown promise in efficiently removing ice accretion. Here, intrigued by the response of human skin to stress-induced deformation, we present a strategy to design tough-skin de-icing surfaces (TSDSs) that actively manipulate crack-induced ice-substrate interfacial breakage during ice removal. This design leverages the surface instability of thin films to generate extensive wrinkling at the ice-substrate interface, which serves as crack initiation sites. We demonstrate efficient ice shedding by creating wrinkles at two length scales: macro-wrinkles for actively initiating the cracks at the rim of the ice and micro-wrinkles for further promoting the stress concentration at the ice-substrate interface. The TSDS ( τ < 10 kPa) displays excellent durability and weather resistance, achieving a large-area ice-self-shedding effect solely through gravity. The universality of the proposed mechanism is verified on multiple materials and potential applications. This design concept offers valuable insights into the creation of durable de-icing materials with enhanced ice-shedding properties.},

The temporal trends of PM emissions follow Kuznets curves, with 1995 as the peak year when the gross domestic product per capita was only US$1023, showing a late-mover advantage. The fractions of PM 2.5 : PM 2.5–10 : PM >10 and BC : OC : non-carbonaceous-PM 2.5 from various sectors varied following different trajectories. The mass fractions of PM 2.5 : PM 2.5–10 : PM >10 from iron–steel production industries changed from 21% : 12% : 67% in 1960 to 50% : 13% : 37% in 2019, showing a decrease in PM size. The fractions of BC were linearly correlated with PM 2.5 , whereas the dependence of OC on PM 2.5 differed before and after 1995, owing to changes in residential emissions. Various factors influencing the changes in size and carbonaceous fraction were explored. The major factors were the promotion of dust-removal capacity and the transition in residential energy from solid fuels to emission-free fuels, which increased the fractions of fine PM and carbonaceous fraction.},

  abstract     = {Osteosarcoma (OS), a highly aggressive bone tumor, presents significant challenges in terms of effective treatment. We identified that cellular autophagy was impaired within OS by comparing clinical OS samples through bioinformatic analyses and further validated the inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy in OS at the transcriptomic level. Based on this finding, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a dual functional metal nanoplatform (MnS x ) to facilitate a transition from the protective effect of low-level autophagy in OS to the killing effect of high-level autophagy in OS. MnS x facilitated intracellular H 2 S generation via endocytosis, leading to the S-sulfhydration of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) and subsequent promotion of mitochondrial autophagy in vitro . Additionally, MnS x activated the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, further enhancing the cellular autophagic response and accelerating tumor cell death. Moreover, it was demonstrated in vivo that MnS x , on the one hand, mediated the activation of tumor autophagy by USP8 via intracellular H 2 S, while Mn 2+ promoted the maturation of dendritic cells, activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and contributed to tumor eradication. Such tumor killing could be suppressed by the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. Importantly, synergistic combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors showed promise for achieving complete remission of OS. This study highlights the potential of MnS x as a dual-functional therapeutic platform for OS treatment and offers novel directions for future research in this field.},

The resulting SNGMs effectively address the trade-off between water permeability and ion selectivity in conventional desalination membranes, delivering a water permeability of ∼ 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of commercial membranes, while maintaining a comparable ion rejection ratio (>95% for NaCl).

  abstract     = {Ultrathin lithium (Li) metal wires with tunable capacities have great promise for precise prelithiation of fiber anodes and high-energy-density Li-based fiber batteries. However, the application of Li metal in fiber batteries faces great challenges due to its mechanical fragility and the resulting limited micro-dimension manufacturing capability. These challenges impede the production of ultrathin Li wires with adjustable Li contents to match the capacities of Li-based fiber batteries. Herein, silver-plated aramid yarns (Ag/AYs) are employed to load Li metal for producing ultrathin Li wires. The bundled structure of Ag/AYs leads to the adjustable volume of oriented voids within the fibers, thus resulting in accurately tunable capacities (0.0048–2.4 mAh cm −1 ) and diameters (20–534 μm) of Li wires. Such thin Li wires are used to precisely compensate for Li loss during the formation cycle of the fiber graphite anodes, thereby improving the initial Coulombic efficiency from ∼88% to ∼100%. Additionally, when employed as anodes, these Li wires enabled the fiber batteries to exhibit exceptional cycling stability for 150 cycles under a relatively low negative/positive ratio of 2.06, while achieving a high energy density of 139.822 Wh kg −1 based on the total mass of the battery.},

  abstract     = {Isoprene is a key reactive organic gas involved in organic aerosol formation. While biogenic isoprene from terrestrial plants has been extensively studied and is recognized as a major contributor to secondary organic aerosol (SOA), high levels of observed SOA, especially in winter, cannot be fully explained by biogenic isoprene alone. In this study, we developed a comprehensive bottom-up emission inventory for isoprene, incorporating both biogenic and combustion sources and modeling their contributions to SOA in China from 2000 to 2016. Combustion-related isoprene emissions from open biomass burning and residential fuel combustion were estimated at 52.0 (39.1–65.7) Gg in 2000, declining to 14.8 (10.6–19.0) Gg by 2016. Open biomass burning contributes ∼40% of combustion-related isoprene emissions. Though, annually, combustion-related isoprene emissions were much smaller than the biogenic emissions, they did account for 32%–80% of total isoprene emissions in many north and west provinces in the colder months in 2016, and were even higher during the early 2000s owing to more biofuel-burning emissions. Model simulation results indicated that combustion-related isoprene could contribute 25%–40% of winter SOA in northern regions. Wintertime isoprene-derived SOA levels declined since 2000, corresponding with decreased combustion-related isoprene emissions; however, the extent of this decline varied regionally due to the influence of other precursors like nitrogen oxides (NOx). In the northeast region with high NOx levels, while combustion-related isoprene emissions decreased by >80% from 2000 to 2016, isoprene-derived SOA declined by only ∼20%. These findings highlight the previously underappreciated contributions of combustion-related isoprene to observed high wintertime isoprene-derived SOA levels.},

Here, we report the first extracellular pH ( e pH)-driven DNA nanodevice for use in antimetastatic treatment in vivo by manipulating heterogeneous receptors on the tumor cell surface. This DNA nanodevice was constructed by partially locking tumorigenic receptor-specific aptamers with two i-motifs. Acidic extracellular pH induced dynamic allosteric reassembly within the nanodevice. The restructured nanodevice enabled oligomerization of c-Met and transferrin receptor, which inhibited tumor metastasis by blocking the hepatic growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling pathway. A suppressive efficacy of 86.25% was verified in an early hepatocarcinoma-pulmonary-metastasis mouse model. Such impressive antimetastatic efficacy suggests an efficient paradigm for developing adaptive antimetastatic therapeutics.},

By improving the ion–ion interaction between cation and anion, weakly coordinated molecules can enter the Na + solvation shell, thereby promoting more adjustable and advantageous interfacial chemistry.

In this study, we successfully established a p-n junction composed of atomic-level Pt-doped CeO 2 and 2D metalloporphyrins metal-organic framework nanosheets (Pt-CeO 2 /CuTCPP(Fe)), which enables the realization of photoelectric enhancement by regulating the interfacial Fe–O bond and optimizing the built-in electric field. Atomic-level Pt doping in CeO 2 leads to an increased density of oxygen vacancies and lattice mutation, which induces a transition in interfacial Fe–O bonds from adsorbed oxygen (Fe–O A ) to lattice oxygen (Fe–O L ). This transition changes the interfacial charge flow pathway from Fe–O A –Ce to Fe–O L , effectively reducing the carrier transport distance along the atomic-level charge transport highway. This results in a 2.5-fold enhancement in photoelectric performance compared with the CeO 2 /CuTCPP(Fe). Furthermore, leveraging the peroxidase-like activity of the p-n junction, we employed this functional heterojunction interface to develop a photoelectrochemical immunoassay for the sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigens.},

  abstract     = {The design of zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials is urgently required as dimension-stable components in widespread modern high-precision technologies. Local chemical order has been of great importance in engineering advanced inorganic materials, but its role in optimizing the ZTE is often overlooked. Herein, we propose local composition heterogeneity for developing superior ZTE via a nonstoichiometric strategy. A remarkably low coefficient of thermal expansion of α a = +1.07 × 10 −6 K −1 is achieved from 3 to 440 K in a quaternary Zr-Nb-Fe-Co pyrochlore magnet, which is the widest temperature range among known cubic ZTE metals. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction and magnetization measurements reveal that all the Bragg peaks split as resulting from two cubic phases with different magnetic orders. Scanning transmission electron microscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that such phase separation intimately derives from excess Co dopant preferentially clustering on the Fe pyrochlore-lattice (16 d ) and simultaneously yielding an antisite Fe on Zr/Nb sublattice (8 a ). The Co content in pyrochlore-lattice has weaker exchange interactions than that of Fe, but the antisite Fe introduces extra positive exchange interactions between 8 a and 16 d sites. Local composition fluctuation of Co and Fe thus affects the interplanar ferromagnetic order of pyrochlore-lattice and balances the normal phonon effect successively on heating. Superior corrosion resistance to both acid and alkaline conditions merits potential applications of the present ZTE metal.},

The testis, however, remains mysterious, without a clear understanding of its circadian functions. Our time-series transcriptome analysis reveals more than 1000 rhythmically expressed genes in the zebrafish and mouse testes, respectively. Canonical circadian clock genes are rhythmically expressed in Sertoli cells and regulate retinoic acid (RA) production, which is also evidenced by their co-expression with RA synthesis genes in single Sertoli cells. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations and temporal desynchronization revealed that the circadian clock-regulated RA signaling synchronizes spermatogonial differentiation via zbtb16a and promotes fertilization via izumo1 in zebrafish. Our findings indicate that the testicular circadian clock contributes to reproduction in a cell-specific manner through RA signaling, highlighting circadian roles in male fertility.},

Understanding and tracking EMT could improve cancer therapy by intervening in metastasis. Current approaches for investigating and detecting the EMT process often utilize traditional molecular biology techniques like immunohistochemistry, mass spectrometry and sequencing. These approaches have provided valuable insights into understanding signaling pathways and identifying biomarkers. Liquid biopsy analysis using advanced nanotechnologies allows the longitudinal tracking of EMT in patients to become feasible. This review article offers a molecular overview of EMT, summarizes current EMT models used in cancer research, and reviews both traditional techniques and emerging nanotechnologies employed in recent EMT studies. Additionally, we discuss the limitations and prospects of applying nanotechnologies in EMT research. By evaluating this rapidly emerging field, we propose strategies to facilitate the clinical translation of nanotechnologies for early detection and monitoring of EMT.},

In tandem with time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements and first-principles calculations, we further elucidate the origin of the spin currents—a laser-enhanced proximity effect manifested as a laser-induced reduction of interlayer distance and enhanced electron exchange interactions, which causes transient spin polarization in the heterostructure. Our findings present an innovative, magnetic-element-free route for generating ultrafast spin currents within the 2D limit, underscoring the significant potential of laser THz emission spectroscopy in investigating laser-induced extraordinary spin dynamics.},

Here, taking the kinetically controlled growth of Co(OH) 2 as a model system (where polyhedra with UCN refers to 4-coordinated tetrahedra), by combining in situ pH measurement and in situ ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, we tracked Co 2+ tetrahedral intercalation/deintercalation with varying OH − concentrations, discovering that the initial Co 2+ tetrahedral intercalation into the Co(OH) 2 lattice is inevitable and its retention is influenced by the effective OH − concentration, challenging previous beliefs about the formation of Co(OH) 2 and potentially other hydroxides. More importantly, an understanding of the intercalation mechanism would significantly contribute to optimization of the synthesis conditions of hydroxides with tunable coordination environments, which hold significant application potential, as evidenced by a proof-of-concept application in the oxygen evolution reaction.},

However, they have been primarily limited to capturing partial information of the three parameters, tailored to specific optical fields, which poses challenges when addressing arbitrary field distributions and achieving three-parameter imaging. In this study, we introduce an MS-based approach for single-shot optical imaging that simultaneously captures all three parameters of optical fields with arbitrary intensity, phase and polarization distributions.

Besides hyper-accreting black holes, rapidly spinning and highly magnetized neutron stars, known as millisecond magnetars, have been suggested to power both long and short GRBs. The presence of a magnetar engine following compact star mergers is of particular interest as it would provide essential constraints on the poorly understood equation of state for neutron stars. Indirect indications of a magnetar engine in these merger sources have been observed in the form of plateau features present in the X-ray afterglow light curves of some short GRBs. Additionally, some X-ray transients lacking gamma-ray bursts have been identified as potential magnetar candidates originating from compact star mergers. Nevertheless, smoking-gun evidence is still lacking for a magnetar engine in short GRBs, and associated theoretical challenges have been raised. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the broad-band prompt emission data of the peculiar, very bright GRB 230307A. Despite its apparently long duration, the prompt emission and host galaxy properties are consistent with a compact star merger origin, as suggested by its association with a kilonova. Intriguingly, an extended X-ray emission component shows up as the |$\gamma$| -ray emission dies out, signifying the likely emergence of a magnetar central engine. We also identify an achromatic temporal break in the high-energy band during the prompt emission phase, which was never observed in previous bursts and reveals a narrow jet with a half opening angle of |$\sim\! 3.4^\circ (R_{\rm GRB}/10^{15}{\rm cm})^{-1/2}$|⁠ , where |$R_{\rm GRB}$| is the GRB prompt emission radius.},

Here, we demonstrate a p-bit constructed by a manganite nanowire that shows exceptionally high stability. The p-bit contains an electronic domain that fluctuates between metallic (low-resistance) and insulating (high-resistance) states near its transition temperature. The probability for the two states can be directly controlled by nano-ampere electrical current. Under extensive operations, the standard error of its probability values is <1.3%. Simulations show that our operationally stable p-bit plays a key role in achieving correct inference in a Bayesian network by strongly suppressing the relative error, displaying the potential for superior computing performance.

Despite the widespread recognition that these compounds serve as cues for herbivorous insects to locate their preferred host plants, their effects on insect mating behavior are less understood. Here, we show that male oriental fruit flies ( Bactrocera dorsalis ) are highly attracted to the host plant volatile compound methyl eugenol (ME), which enhances the attractiveness of male leks to females. To elucidate the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon, we identify the olfactory receptor BdorOR94b1 responsible for detecting ME. Genetic disruption of BdorOR94b1 leads to a complete abolition of both physiological and behavioral responses to ME. Additionally, we confirm that, through digestion, male flies convert ME to (E)-coniferyl alcohol, a compound that enhances the attractiveness of their leks to females. This increased attractiveness allows females to select optimal mates, thereby enhancing their reproductive success. The impairment of ME detection significantly diminishes the mating advantage within the leks, as males are unable to locate and utilize ME effectively. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism through which plant volatile compounds regulate the mating behavior of the economically important oriental fruit fly and provide new insights into the general ecology of insect–plant interactions.},

Bat flies—obligate blood-feeding ectoparasites of bats—are known carriers of diverse viruses. Here, we conducted a de novo assembly of a chromosome-level genome for the bat fly species Phthiridium sp. Comparative genomic analysis unveiled genes associated with specialized traits, such as the loss of eyes and wings, as well as elongated legs, which have adapted to parasitism on the dense fur of bats. Utilizing small RNA sequencing, we identified a spectrum of known and previously unclassified viruses in bat flies. Notably, experimental evidence indicated that bat flies can also feed on mammalian hosts other than bats, suggesting the potential for the spillover of bat-borne viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated the role of the bat fly's RNA interference pathway in influencing the diversity and evolution of viruses. In summary, this study not only presents a new genome catalog to unveil the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning bat fly parasitism, but also provides a novel research system that can be used to investigate the mechanisms of cross-species transmission of bat-borne viruses and the co-evolution of bats and viruses.},

Chilo (C.) suppressalis , commonly known as the rice stem borer, is a highly destructive pest that crucially harms rice production. The lack of natural population genomics data has hindered a more thorough understanding of its climate adaptation, particularly the genetic basis underlying adaptive traits. To overcome this obstacle, our study employed completely resequenced genomes of 384 individuals to explore the population structure, demographic history, and gene flow of C. suppressalis in China. This study observed that its gene flow occurred asymmetrically, moving from central populations to peripheral populations. Using genome-wide selection scans and genotype-environment association studies, we identified potential loci that may be associated with climatic adaptation. The most robust signal was found to be associated with cold tolerance, linked to a homeobox gene, goosecoid ( GSC ), whose expression level was significantly different in low and high latitudes. Moreover, downregulating the expression of this gene by RNAi enhances its cold tolerance phenotypes. Our findings have uncovered and delved into the genetic foundation of the ability of C. suppressalis to adapt to its environment.

Associated plant material included the cheirolepidiaceans Protopodocarpoxylon, Brachyphyllum and Classostrobus , plus Classopoli s pollen, suggesting a forested temporary swamp habitat with ferns, tree ferns, water ferns, tall araucarian and ginkgoacean trees and shrubs. (Sub)tropic lateritic soil with vegetation debris underwent incomplete microbial decomposition in an anoxic water environment of peat swamp development.

However, this linear relationship with a uniform EF 5r is poorly constrained, which impedes the N 2 O estimation and mitigation. Our meta-analysis discovered a universal N 2 O emission baseline (EF 5r = k/[NO 3 − ], k = 0.02) for natural rivers. Anthropogenic impacts caused an overall increase in baselines and the emergence of hotspots, which constitute two typical patterns of anthropogenic sources. The k values of agricultural and urban rivers increased to 0.09 and 0.05, respectively, with 11% and 14% of points becoming N 2 O hotspots. Priority control of organic and NH 4 + pollution could eliminate hotspots and reduce emissions by 51.6% and 63.7%, respectively. Further restoration of baseline emissions on nitrate removal is a long-term challenge considering population growth and declining unit benefits (ΔN-N 2 O/N-NO 3 − ). The discovery of EF lines emphasized the importance of targeting hotspots and managing baseline emissions sustainably to balance social and environmental benefits.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables us to explore heterogeneity within a cell population and identify rare cell types, thereby improving our design of targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we use a pan-cancer and pan-tissue single-cell transcriptional landscape to reveal heterogeneous expression patterns within malignant cells, precancerous cells, as well as cancer-associated stromal and endothelial cells. We introduce a deep learning framework named Shennong for in silico screening of anticancer drugs for targeting each of the landscape cell clusters. Utilizing Shennong, we could predict individual cell responses to pharmacologic compounds, evaluate drug candidates’ tissue damaging effects, and investigate their corresponding action mechanisms. Prioritized compounds in Shennong's prediction results include FDA-approved drugs currently undergoing clinical trials for new indications, as well as drug candidates reporting anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, the tissue damaging effect prediction aligns with documented injuries and terminated discovery events. This robust and explainable framework has the potential to accelerate the drug discovery process and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of drug screening.},

Guided by the lattice plainification strategy, we introduce trace amounts of Cu into n-type Bi 2 (Te, Se) 3 (BTS) to occupy Bi vacancies, thereby simultaneously weakening defect scattering and modulating the electronic bands. Meanwhile, the interstitial Cu can bond with the BTS matrix to form extra electron transport pathways. The multiple occupations of Cu substantially boost carrier mobility and electrical performance. Consequently, the BTS + 0.2%Cu achieves a room-temperature ZT of ∼1.3 with an average ZT ave of ∼1.2 at 300–523 K. Moreover, the kilogram-scale ingot designed for mass production also exhibits high uniformity. Finally, we fabricate a full-scale device that achieves an excellent conversion efficiency of ∼6.4% and a high cooling Δ T max of ∼70.1 K, both of which outperform commercial devices.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale mapping of surface coarse particulate matter (PM 10 ) concentration remains a key focus for air quality monitoring. Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD)-based data fusion approaches decouple the non-linear AOD–PM 10 relationship, enabling high-resolution PM 10 data acquisition, but are limited by spatial incompleteness and the absence of nighttime data. Here, a gridded visibility-based real-time surface PM 10 retrieval (RT-SPMR) framework for China is introduced, addressing the gap in seamless hourly PM 10 data within the 24-hour cycle. This framework utilizes multisource data inputs and dynamically updated machine-learning models to produce 6.25-km gridded 24-hour PM 10 data. Cross-validation showed that the RT-SPMR model's daily retrieval accuracy surpassed prior studies. Additionally, through rolling iterative validation experiments, the model exhibited strong generalization capability and stability, demonstrating its suitability for operational deployment. Taking a record-breaking dust storm as an example, the model proved effective in tracking the fine-scale evolution of the dust intrusion process, especially in under-observed areas. Consequently, the operational RT-SPMR framework provides comprehensive real-time capability for monitoring PM 10 pollution in China, and has the potential to improve the accuracy of dust storm forecasting models by enhancing the PM 10 initial field.},

  abstract     = {High-voltage lithium-metal batteries (HVLMBs) are appealing candidates for next-generation high-energy rechargeable batteries, but their practical applications are still limited by the severe capacity degradation, attributed to the poor interfacial stability and compatibility between the electrode and the electrolyte. In this work, a 2D conjugated phthalocyanine framework (CPF) containing single atoms (SAs) of cobalt (CoSAs-CPF) is developed as a novel artificial solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) in which a large amount of charge is transferred to the CPF skeleton due to the Lewis acid activity of the Co metal sites and the strong electron-absorbing property of the cyano group (−CN), greatly enhancing the adsorption of the Li + and regulating the Li + distribution toward dendrite-free LMBs, which are superior to most of the reported SEI membranes. As a result, the Li||Li symmetrical cell with CoSAs-CPF-modified Li anodes (CoSAs-CPF@Li) exhibits a low polarization with an area capacity of 1.0 mAh cm −2 over 3500 h. The LiFePO 4 (LFP) ||CoSAs-CPF@Li (LFP: 20 mg cm −2 ) delivers an ultra-long cycling life of ≤1000 cycles with a high capacity retention of 98.6%. Remarkably, the high-voltage LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 ||Li@CoSAs-CPF (NCM811: 10 mg cm −2 ) demonstrates a long cycling life of >800 cycles with a high capacity retention of 80%. Meanwhile, in situ ultrasonic transmission technology confirms the admirable ability of artificial CoSAs-CPF SEI to stabilize the Li-anode interface in pouch cells during cycling. Remarkably, the NCM811||Li@CoSAs-CPF pouch cell exhibits an energy density of 421 Wh kg −1 and keeps 130 cycles with a low electrolyte/capacity ratio of 2.5 g Ah −1 . The strategy of constructing the CoSAs-CPF-reinforced Li anode provides a promising direction for high-energy-density HVLMBs with long cycling stability.},

Here, we introduce a novel principle-based framework for predicting global warming from climate mean states that is based solely on carbon-dioxide-increasing scenarios without running climate models and relying on statistical trend analysis. By applying this framework to the climate mean state of 1980–2000, we accurately capture the subsequent global warming (0.403 K predicted versus 0.414 K observed) and polar warming amplification patterns. Our predictions from climate mean states of individual models not only exhibit a high map-correlation skill that is comparable to that of individual Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models for the observed warming, but also capture the temporal pace of their warming under the 1% annual CO 2 -increasing scenario. This work provides the first principle-based confirmation that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary cause of the observed global warming from 1980–2000 to 2000–2020, independently of climate models and statistical analysis.},

With multiple delay feedback designed in this single neuron, our OCNS is able to convert one input feature vector/state into one-dimensional time-series/sequence, which is theoretically ensured to fully represent the states of the observed dynamical system. Leveraging the spatiotemporal information transformation, the OCNS shows excellent and robust performance in forecasting tasks, in particular for short-term high-dimensional systems. The results collectively demonstrate that the proposed OCNS with a single core neuron offers insights into constructing deep learning frameworks with a small model, presenting substantial potential as a new way for achieving efficient deep learning.},

Atomically precise metal cluster materials are ideal model catalysts for investigating the C–N coupling issues. Here we synthesize two atomically precise bimetallic clusters, Ag 14 Pd(PTFE) 6 (TPP) 8 and Ag 13 Au 5 (PTFE) 10 (DPPP) 4 , both with icosahedral cores and similar ligands. We demonstrate that both clusters have good performance for electrocatalytic urea synthesis, with the production rates at the maximum Faradaic efficiency of 143.3 and 82.3 mg h −1 g cat −1 , respectively. Bimetallic structures can induce charge polarization at the active sites of metal clusters, thereby influencing the selectivity. In mechanistic investigations, we propose that *NOH and *COOH are the rate-limiting steps for the reduction of nitrate and CO 2 , respectively, and that the key intermediates formed thereafter can significantly affect the C–N coupling process. This approach offers a deep understanding into C–N coupling through the utilization of atomically precise metal clusters.},

  abstract     = {Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) enable fast and selective ion transport and the partition of electrode reactions, playing an important role in the fields of precise ion separation, renewable energy storage and conversion, and clean energy production. Traditional IEMs form ion channels at the nanometer-scale via the assembly of flexible polymeric chains, which are trapped in the permeability/conductivity and selectivity trade-off dilemma due to a high swelling propensity. New-generation IEMs have shown great potential to break this intrinsic limitation by using microporous framework channels for ion transport under a confinement regime. In this Review, we first describe the fundamental principles of ion transport in charged channels from nanometer to sub-nanometer scale. Then, we focus on the construction of new-generation IEMs and highlight the microporous confinement effects from sub-2-nm to sub-1-nm and further to ultra-micropores. The enhanced ion transport properties brought by the intense size sieving and channel interaction are elucidated, and the corresponding applications including lithium separation, flow battery, water electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis are introduced. Finally, we prospect the future development of new-generation IEMs with respect to the intricate microstructure observation, in-situ ion transport visualization, and large-scale membrane fabrication.},

  abstract     = {In-situ fabricated polyether electrolytes have been regarded as one of the most promising solid electrolyte systems. Nevertheless, they cannot match high-voltage cathodes over 4.3 V due to their poor oxidative stability. Herein, we propose an effective local charge homogenization strategy based on the triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) crosslinker, achieving ultra-high-voltage electrochemical stability of polyether electrolytes (viz. PTIDOL) at cutoff voltages up to 4.7 V. The introduction of TGIC optimizes the Li + solvation environment, thereby homogenizing the charge distribution at ether oxygen (EO) sites, resulting in significantly enhanced oxidative stability of the polyether main chain. Consequently, the Li|PTIDOL|LiNi 0.6 Co 0.2 Mn 0.2 O 2 (NCM622) cell achieves long-term operation at an ultra-high cutoff voltage with a capacity retention of 81.8% after 400 cycles, one of the best results reported for polyether electrolytes to date. This work provides significant insights for the development of polyether electrolytes with high-voltage tolerance and the advancement of high-energy-density batteries.},

  abstract     = {Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), featuring high tumorigenicity and invasiveness, are one of the critical factors leading to the failure of clinical cancer treatment such as metastasis and recurrence. However, current strategies suffer from the low stemness-inhibiting efficacy on CSCs by conventional molecular agents and the poor lethal effects against bulk tumor cells. Here we engineer a coordination nanomedicine by 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DHT) complexing zinc ions (Zn 2+ ) as a double-effect nanodisrupter of tumor iron (Fe) and redox homeostasis for catalysis-boosted tumor therapy with stemness inhibition. Taking advantage of the much higher binding force of DHT toward Fe 3+ , this nanomedicine can specifically chelate endogenous Fe 3+ into its nanostructure and release Zn 2+ , and the in situ formed hexacoordinated Fe-DHT conformation is of much enhanced reducibility in order to promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tumors. The nanomedicine-mediated Fe depletion and ROS generation collectively induce CSC differentiation via downregulating the Wnt signaling and inducing forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) activation, respectively. Notably, the combined tumor-selective ROS generation and Zn 2+ -induced antioxidation dysfunction potently trigger intratumoral oxidative damage leading to both cellular apoptosis and ferroptosis. This nanomedicine, capable of synchronously treating CSCs and bulk tumor cells, has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit the growth, postoperative recurrence and metastasis of orthotopic triple-negative breast tumors in vivo , offering an encouraging candidate of cancer therapeutic agents for treating CSCs-enriched malignancy.},

Here, a general intercalated rule for the effect of self-intercalation ratio on atomic arrangements is revealed. Then, the controllable synthesis of a series of Fe-intercalated 2D materials is realized. Scanning transmission electron microscopy illustrates that their intercalation structures undergo disordered/ordered/half-ordered/ordered transformation, which confirms the intercalated rule and proposes a new structure termed half-ordered intercalation. Notably, their magnetic and electrical properties can be significantly modulated by intercalation. Orderly intercalated nanoflakes possess room-temperature magnetism with composition-regulated magnetic domains. Moreover, Fe 1.5 Se 2 and Fe 1.6 Se 2 are scarce half-metallic materials showing different magneto-resistance behaviors. This work would guide the design and synthesis of new intercalated materials, and deepen the understanding of the relationship between structure and properties.},

Here we present a comprehensive dataset of geochronological, geochemical and structural data on recently discovered en-echelon dykes representing the incipient development of strike-slip faulting from the Lunpola basin in central Tibet. Our results provide evidence for mantle-derived, bimodal magmatism linked to lithospheric-scale strike-slip faulting at 35–32 Ma, and demonstrate that the central Tibet strike-slip faults are at least 20 Ma older than previously estimated (15–8 Ma). We suggest that these faults were originally connected with the lithospheric-scale Jiali and Ailao Shan-Red River shear zones exposed farther east, forming part of a straight, 2500–3000 km-long lithospheric shear zone that favored mantle upwelling and magmatic intrusion coeval with substantial uplift (1.5–2 km) of the central Tibet valley in the early Oligocene.},

  abstract     = {The design and fabrication of high-performance electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing materials are essential in developing electronic communication technology for defense and civilian applications. These materials function by interacting with EMWs, creating various effects such as polarization relaxation, magnetic resonance, and magnetic hysteresis in order to absorb EMWs. Significant progress has been made to improve the dimensional performance of such materials, emphasizing the ‘thin, light, broad, and strong’ functional specifications. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are characterized by high surface area, low density, and unique electromagnetic properties, providing promising solutions to address some of the challenges in facilitating multiple reflections and wideband resonances, which are crucial for effective EMW attenuation. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in exploring 1D structures for enhancing EMW absorption and their controllability. The design and fabrication of nanofibers, nanowires, and other 1D nanostructures are highlighted. The advantages of 1D nanomaterials in EMW absorption are also described. Challenges and future directions are discussed, focusing on developing new design concepts and fabrication methods for achieving high-performance and lightweight EMW absorbers and enhancing fundamental understanding of EMW absorption mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Excessive temperatures during grain filling can compromise endosperm starch biosynthesis and decrease grain quality and yield in rice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these remain unclear. Here, we show that heat shock protein OsHsp40-1 interacts with and elevates the ATPase activity of OsHsp70-2 in rice. OsHsp40-1 also interacts with the key starch biosynthetic enzymes OsGBSSI and OsPPDKB and thereby enhances their stability and activity, which is essential for maintaining rice quality and grain yield under moderate high-temperature (HT) conditions. Overexpression of OsHsp70-2 and OsHsp40-1 in rice significantly improved grain quality and yield at HT. Furthermore, a haplotype analysis identified favorable alleles of OsHsp70-2 and OsHsp40-1 , which could be used for improving thermotolerance in rice. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which the OsHsp70-2–OsHsp40-1 module ameliorates the effects of HT on starch biosynthesis, providing a new strategy for genetic improvement of rice quality and yield under HT conditions.},

However, thermochromic windows that maintain high T Vis while modulating T NIR and ε MIR simultaneously are highly desirable but still challenging. Here, we develop a thermochromic smart window based on a two-way shape memory polymer to enable reversible transformation and achieve T NIR modulation of 44.0% and ε MIR modulation of 76.5% while maintaining high T Vis (>50%). Compared to traditional windows based on silica glass, this device shows 4°C lower temperature in summer daytime, 2°C higher in winter daytime, and 1°C higher in spring nighttime. It is expected that our device can achieve greater annual energy savings in comparison with commercial glass anywhere in the world and promote the progress of thermochromic windows for energy-efficient buildings.},

Flexible neural probes offer superior long-term recording capabilities over traditional rigid probes. This study introduces a parylene-based serpentine electrode probe for stable, long-term neural monitoring. Inspired by the flexibility and morphology of snakes, the serpentine design of the probe ensures stable anchorage within the brain tissue during subject movement. The probe features a hydrophilic surface and is combined with a biodegradable silk fibroin–polyethylene glycol coating, significantly enhancing biocompatibility and mitigating inflammatory responses. In vivo experiments demonstrate that these probes enable stable, high-quality neural recordings for >8 months. The probes are also used to investigate the neural bases of epilepsy-induced cognitive deficits. By analysing place-cell dynamics in mice pre- and post-epileptic events, we identified the correlation between impaired spatial encoding and the observed cognitive deficits in epileptic mice.

However, molecule-level knowledge of structural rearrangements during chemical processes remains a great challenge. Here, we couple infrared spectroscopy as a non-invasive method to probe molecular transformations, with a machine-learned protocol to immediately map the spectroscopic fingerprints to atomistic structures. From the theoretical perspective, we demonstrate it here with the example of C–C coupling in catalytic reactions, elucidating various structural conformations along dynamic trajectories. Within the transferable application to the specific CO–CO dimerization reaction, the structural and energetic variations of the critical chemical species could be identified via infrared spectroscopy.

Moreover, intravital phosphorescence imaging by using an RTP probe enables the monitoring of viscosity variations in inflammatory mice, demonstrating a significantly improved signal-to-background ratio compared with fluorescence imaging.

By synthesizing findings from in-situ warming experiments, this review elucidates the mechanisms underlying the impacts of experimental warming on carbon cycle dynamics within these ecosystems. Generally, alterations in vegetation structure and prolonged growing season favor strategies for enhanced ecosystem carbon sequestration under warming conditions. Whilst warming modifies soil microbial communities and their carbon-related functions, its effects on soil carbon release fall behind the increased vegetation carbon uptake. Despite the fact that no significant accumulation of soil carbon stock has been detected upon warming, notable changes in its fractions indicate potential shifts in carbon stability. Future studies should prioritize deep soil carbon dynamics, the interactions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles under warming scenarios, and the underlying biological mechanisms behind these responses. Furthermore, the integration of long-term warming experiments with Earth system models is essential for reducing the uncertainties of model predictions regarding future carbon-climate feedback in these climate-sensitive ecosystems.},

Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [ α /Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These findings support the notion that J0731+3717 was originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of ‘seven nines’. We find that such a high-velocity star ( ⁠ V e j = 548 − 5 + 6 km s − 1 ⁠ ) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ( ⁠ ≥ 100 M ⊙ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.},

Here we report the observation of a striped surface charge order coexisting with superconductivity and its interaction with the MBS in the topological superconductor 2M-WS 2 , using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By applying an out-of-plane magnetic field, we observe that MBSs are absent in vortices in the region with stripe order. This is in contrast to adjacent underlaying layers without charge order, where vortex-bound MBSs are observed. Via theoretical simulations, we show that the surface stripe order does not destroy the bulk topology, but it can effectively modify the spatial distribution of MBSs, i.e. it pushes them downward, away from the 2M-WS 2 surface. Our findings demonstrate that the interplay of charge order and topological superconductivity can potentially be used to tune the positions of MBSs, and to explore new states of matter.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are solution-processable semiconductor nanocrystals with favorable optoelectronic characteristics, one of which is their multi-excitonic behavior that enables broadband polychromatic light generation and amplification from monodisperse QDs. However, the practicality of this has been limited by the difficulty in achieving spatial separation and patterning of different colors as well as the high pumping intensity required to excite the multi-excitonic states. Here, we have addressed these issues by integrating monodisperse QDs in multi-excitonic states into a specially designed cavity, in which the QDs exhibit an anisotropic polychromatic emission (APE) characteristic that allows for tuning the emission from green to red by shifting the observation direction from perpendicular to lateral. Subsequently, the APE threshold under 300-ps pulsed excitation has been reduced from 32 to 21 μJ cm −2 by optimizing the cavity structure. Based on the manipulation of multi-excitonic emission and angle-dependent wavelength selectivity of the developed cavity, we have fabricated a full-color micro-pixel array with a pixel size as small as 23 μm by combining cavity-integrated monodisperse QDs and blue backlight. Furthermore, the threshold of APE under quasi-continuous-wave pumping was as low as 5 W cm −2 , indicating its compatibility with commercial LEDs and/or laser diodes. Since APE arises from the multi-excitonic behavior of QDs that supports optical gain, its unprecedentedly low threshold suggests the feasibility of the diode-pumped colloidal QD laser. This work demonstrates a novel method of manipulating the QDs’ optical properties beyond controlling their size, composition or structure, and reveals great potential for achieving full-color emission using monodisperse QDs.},

  abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extra-galactic sources with unknown physical mechanisms. They emit millisecond-duration radio pulses with isotropic equivalent energy of |$10^{36}$| – |$10^{41}$| ergs. This corresponds to a brightness temperature of FRB emission typically reaching the level of |$10^{36}$| K, but can be as high as above |$10^{40}$| K for sub-microsecond timescale structures, suggesting the presence of underlying coherent relativistic radiation mechanisms. Polarization carries key information to understand the physical origin of FRBs, with linear polarization usually tracing the geometric configuration of magnetic fields and circular polarization probing both intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects. Here we show that the repeating source FRB 20201124A emits |$90.9\%\pm 1.1\%$| circularly polarized radio pulses. Such a high degree of circular polarization was unexpected in theory and unprecedented in observation in the case of FRBs, since such a high degree of circular polarization was only common among solar or Jovian radio activities, attributed to the sub-relativistic electrons. We note that there is no obvious correlation between the degree of circular polarization and burst fluence. Besides the high degree of circular polarization, we also detected a rapid swing and orthogonal jump in the position angle of linear polarization. The detection of high-degree circular polarization in FRB 20201124A, together with its linear polarization properties that show orthogonal modes, place strong constraints on FRB physical mechanisms, calling for an interplay between magnetospheric radiation and propagation effects in shaping the observed FRB radiation.},

  abstract     = {Defining metabolic health is critical for the earlier reversing of metabolic dysfunction and disease, and fasting-based diagnosis may not adequately assess an individual's metabolic adaptivity under stress. We constructed a novel Health State Map (HSM) comprising a Health Phenotype Score (HPS) with fasting features alone and a Homeostatic Resilience Score (HRS) with five time-point features only ( t = 30, 60, 90, 180, 240 min) following a standardized mixed macronutrient tolerance test (MMTT). Among 111 Chinese adults, when the same set of fasting and post-MMTT data as for the HSM was used, the mixed-score was highly correlated with the HPS. The HRS was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome prevalence, independently of the HPS (OR [95% CI]: 0.41 [0.18, 0.92]) and the mixed-score (0.34 [0.15, 0.69]). Moreover, the HRS could discriminate metabolic characteristics unseparated by the HPS and the mixed-score. Participants with higher HRSs had better metabolic traits than those with lower HRSs. Large interpersonal variations were also evidenced by evaluating postprandial homeostatic resiliencies for glucose, lipids and amino acids when participants had similar overall HRSs. Additionally, the HRS was positively associated with physical activity level and specific gut microbiome structure. Collectively, our HSM model might offer a novel approach to precisely define an individual's metabolic health and nutritional capacity.},

  abstract     = {China's pursuit of carbon neutrality targets hinges on a profound shift towards low-carbon energy, primarily reliant on intermittent and variable, yet crucial, solar and wind power sources. In particular, low-solar-low-wind (LSLW) compound extremes present a critical yet largely ignored threat to the reliability of renewable electricity generation. While existing studies have largely evaluated the impacts of average climate-induced changes in renewable energy resources, comprehensive analyses of the compound extremes and, particularly, the underpinning dynamic mechanisms remain scarce. Here we show the dynamic evolution of compound LSLW extremes and their underlying mechanisms across China via coupling multi-model simulations with diagnostic analysis. Our results unveil a strong topographic dependence in the frequency of compound LSLW extremes, with a national average frequency of 16.4 (10th–90th percentile interval ranges from 5.3 to 32.6) days/yr, when renewable energy resources in eastern China are particularly compromised (∼80% lower than that under an average climate). We reveal a striking increase in the frequency of LSLW extremes, ranging from 12.4% under SSP126 to 60.2% under SSP370, primarily driven by both renewable energy resource declines and increasingly heavily-tailed distributions, resulting from weakened meridional temperature (pressure) gradient, increased frequency of extremely dense cloud cover and additional distinctive influence of increased aerosols under SSP370. Our study underscores the urgency of preparing for significantly heightened occurrences of LSLW events in a warmer future, emphasizing that such climate-induced compound LSLW extreme changes are not simply by chance, but rather projectable, thereby underscoring the need for proactive adaptation strategies. Such insights are crucial for countries navigating a similar transition towards renewable energy.},

  abstract     = {The intentional manipulation of carrier characteristics serves as a fundamental principle underlying various energy-related and optoelectronic semiconductor technologies. However, achieving switchable and reversible control of the polarity within a single material to design optimized devices remains a significant challenge. Herein, we successfully achieved dramatic reversible p–n switching during the semiconductor‒semiconductor phase transition in BiI 3 via pressure, accompanied by a substantial improvement in their photoelectric properties. Carrier polarity flipping was monitored by measuring the photocurrent dominated by the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect in a zero-bias two-terminal device. Accompanying the p–n transition, a switch between positive and negative photocurrents was observed in BiI 3 , providing a feasible method to determine the conduction type of materials via photoelectric measurements. Furthermore, the combined effects of the photoconductivity and PTE mechanism improved the photoresponse and extended the detection bandwidth to encompass the optical communication waveband (1650 nm) under an external bias. The remarkable photoelectric properties were attributed to the enhanced energy band dispersion and increased charge density of BiI 3 under pressure. These findings highlight the effective and flexible modulation of carrier properties through pressure engineering and provide a foundation for designing and implementing multifunctional logic circuits and optoelectronic devices.},

One is the ‘surface peak’ in monsoon-controlled regions and the other is the ‘subsurface peak’ in westerly-controlled regions. The former is attributed to the combined effects of increasing anthropogenic emissions and climate-induced changes in the cryosphere and wetland hydrology in the last 100−150 years. The climate changes in westerly-controlled regions in the last 50−70 years led to a fluctuation in hydrology and Hg peak in the sediment subsurface. The increase in legacy Hg input from soil erosion has largely enhanced the Hg accumulation rate in wetlands since the 1950s, especially in the proglacial wetlands. We highlight that accelerated glacier melting and permafrost thawing caused by global warming have altered geomorphology and hydrology, and affected Hg transport and accumulation in wetlands.},

To solve this dilemma, we introduce optical interference patterns as the visual representation of tactile information for flexible tactile sensors. We propose a novel tactile perception method and its corresponding sensor, combining structural colors from flexible blazed gratings with deep learning. The richer structural colors and finer data processing foster the tactile estimation performance. The proposed sensor has an overall normal force magnitude accuracy of 6 mN, a planar resolution of 79 μm and a contact-depth resolution of 25 μm. This work presents a promising tactile method that combines wave optics, soft materials and machine learning. It performs well in tactile measurement, and can be expanded into multiple sensing fields.},

Using this tool, we experimentally identify a waterborne polyurethane/potassium iodide ionogel with a Seebeck coefficient of 41.39 mV/K. Furthermore, interpretable analysis reveals that the number of rotatable bonds and the octanol-water partition coefficient of ions negatively affect Seebeck coefficients, which is corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations.

Here, we report that zinc finger protein ZCCHC8—a key component of the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex that is involved in ribonucleic acid (RNA) surveillance—is required for TE silencing during spermatogenesis. Loss of ZCCHC8 results in delayed meiotic progression and reduced production of round spermatids (RS). We observed that young long-interspersed nuclear element (LINE1, L1) subfamilies that are targeted by ZCCHC8 were upregulated in both spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) and pachytene spermatocytes (PS) of Zcchc8 null testes. Further study found that a reduced H3K9me3 modification in SSC and elevated H3 lysine 4 trimethylation in the PS of Zcchc8 KO mice occurred upon young L1, especially L1Md_A, which may have contributed to impairment of the chromatin condensation from PS to RS during spermatogenesis.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous catalysts for parahydrogen-induced polarization (HET-PHIP) would be useful for producing highly sensitive contrasting agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the liquid phase, as they can be removed by simple filtration. Although homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts are highly efficient for PHIP, their sensitivity decreases when anchored on porous supports due to slow substrate diffusion to the active sites and rapid depolarization within the channels. To address this challenge, we explored 2D metal-organic layers (MOLs) as supports for active Rh complexes with diverse phosphine ligands and tunable hydrogenation activities, taking advantage of the accessible active sites and chemical adaptability of the MOLs. By adjusting the electronic properties of phosphines, TPP-MOL-Rh-dppb (TPP = tris(4-carboxylphenyl)phosphine), featuring a κ 2 -connected di(phosphine) ligand, generated hyperpolarized styrene achieving an over-2400-fold signal enhancement and a polarization level of 20% for 1 H in methanol- d 4 solution. The TPP-MOL-Rh-dppb effectively inherited the high efficiency and pairwise addition of its homogenous catalyst while maintaining the heterogeneity of MOLs. This work demonstrates the potential of 2D phosphine-functionalized MOLs as heterogeneous solid support for HET-PHIP.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy, a monumental advancement in antitumor therapy, still yields limited clinical benefits owing to its unguaranteed efficacy and safety. Therapeutic systems derived from cellular, bacterial and viral sources possess inherent properties that are conducive to antitumor immunotherapy. However, crude biomimetic systems have restricted functionality and may produce undesired toxicity. With advances in biotechnology, various toolkits are available to add or subtract certain properties of living organisms to create flexible therapeutic platforms. This review elaborates on the creation of bioengineered systems, via gene editing, synthetic biology and surface engineering, to enhance immunotherapy. The modifying strategies of the systems are discussed, including equipment for navigation and recognition systems to improve therapeutic precision, the introduction of controllable components to control the duration and intensity of treatment, the addition of immunomodulatory components to amplify immune activation, and the removal of toxicity factors to ensure biosafety. Finally, we summarize the advantages of bioengineered immunotherapeutic systems and possible directions for their clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {In the face of advancements in microrobotics, intelligent control and precision medicine, artificial muscle actuation systems must meet demands for precise control, high stability, environmental adaptability and high integration miniaturization. Carbon materials, being lightweight, strong and highly conductive and flexible, show great potential for artificial muscles. Inspired by the butterfly's proboscis, we have developed a carbon-based artificial muscle, hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne muscle (HsGDY-M), fabricated efficiently using an emerging hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) film with an asymmetrical surface structure. This muscle features reversible, rapid and continuously adjustable deformation capabilities similar to the butterfly's proboscis, triggered by the conversion of carbon bonds. The size of the HsGDY-M can be tuned by changing the HsGDY film width from ∼1 cm to 100 μm. Our research demonstrates HsGDY-M's stability and adaptability, maintaining performance at temperatures as low as −25°C. This artificial muscle was successfully integrated into a robotic mechanical arm, allowing it to swiftly adjust its posture and lift objects up to 11 times its own weight. Its beneficial responsiveness is transferable, enabling the transformation of ‘inert’ objects like copper foil into actuators via surface bonding. Because of its super sensitive and rapid deformation, HsGDY-M was applied to create a real-time tracking system for human finger bending movements, achieving real-time simulation and large-hand-to-small-hand control. Our study indicates that HsGDY-M holds significant promise for advancing smart robotics and precision medicine.},

Here, we report a universal approach for the in situ building of an electrode/electrolyte interphase (EEI) layer on both the cathode and the anode through the self-polymerization of electrolyte additives. In an exemplified Zn||V 2 O 5 ·nH 2 O cell, we reveal that the glutamate additive undergoes radical-initiated electro-polymerization on the cathode and polycondensation on the anode, yielding polyglutamic acid-dominated EEI layers on both electrodes. These EEI layers effectively mitigate undesired interfacial side reactions while enhancing reaction kinetics, enabling Zn||V 2 O 5 ·nH 2 O cells to achieve a high capacity of 387 mAh g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 and maintain >96.3% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 1 A g −1 . Moreover, this interphase-forming additive exhibits broad applicability to varied cathode materials, encompassing VS 2 , VS 4 , VO 2 , α-MnO 2 , β-MnO 2 and δ-MnO 2 .

  abstract     = {Constructing 3D functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with both robust linkage and planar macrocycle building blocks still remains a challenge due to the difficulty in adjusting both the crystallinity and the dominant 2D structures. In addition, it is also challenging to selectively convert inert C(sp 3 )–H bonds into value-added chemicals. Herein, robust 3D COFs, USTB-28–M (M=Co, Ni, Cu), have been polymerized from the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of D 3h -symmetric 2,3,6,7,14,15-hexahydroxyltriptycene with D 4h -symmetric hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (MPcF 16 ) under solvothermal conditions. These chemically stable dioxin-linked COFs show isostructural tbo topology made up of three kinds of polyhedron subunits, exhibiting high Brunauer−Emmett−Teller surface areas of ≤1477 m 2 g −1 . In particular, the multiple polyhedron subunits in USTB-28–M could trap N -hydroxyphthalimide at their corners for easily forming stable phthalimide- N -oxyl radicals under visible-light irradiation. The generated radicals efficiently promote the aerobic oxidation of alkyl benzenes with an inert C(sp 3 )–H bond into various ketones. Among the three investigated COFs, the USTB-28–Co radical initiator exhibits the best photocatalytic oxidation activity, converting ethylbenzene into acetophenone with a turnover frequency of 63 h −1 , which is much higher than those of the monomer CoPcF 16 (8 h −1 ) and 2D dioxin-linked counterparts (13 h −1 ). This is due to the much prolonged lifetime of the excited state for USTB-28–Co based on the femtosecond transient absorption result. The present work not only presents 3D functional COFs with robust connection and permanent porosity, but also illustrates the uniqueness of porous structures of 3D COFs for high-performance photocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {The Mpox virus (MPXV) has emerged as a formidable orthopoxvirus, posing an immense challenge to global public health. An understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of MPXV infection, replication and immune evasion will benefit the development of novel antiviral strategies. Despite the involvement of G-quadruplexes (G4s) in modulating the infection and replication processes of multiple viruses, their roles in the MPXV life cycle remain largely unknown. Here, we found a highly conservative and stable G4 in MPXV that acts as a positive regulatory element for viral immunodominant protein expression. Furthermore, by screening 42 optically pure chiral metal complexes, we identified the Λ enantiomer of a pair of chiral helical compounds that can selectively target mRNA G4 and enhance expression of the 39-kDa core protein encoded by the MPXV A5L gene. Mechanistically, RNA G4-specific helicase DHX36 inhibits A5L protein expression by unwinding G4s. In contrast, MH3 Λ enhanced mRNA stability by specifically targeting G4 structures and subsequently increased protein expression. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of the 39-kDa core protein in activating immune responses and facilitating virion maturation, modulation of MPXV G4 folding by MH3 Λ exhibited inhibitory effects on MPXV replication through enhancing the immune response. Our findings underscore the critical involvement of G4 in the MPXV life cycle and offer potential avenues for developing antiviral drugs that target G4.},

  abstract     = {The incorporation of polymeric insulators has led to notable achievements in the field of organic semiconductors. By altering the blending concentration, polymeric insulators exhibit extensive capabilities in regulating molecular configuration, film crystallinity, and mitigation of defect states. However, current research suggests that the improvement in such physical properties is primarily attributed to the enhancement of thin film morphology, an outcome that seems to be an inevitable consequence of incorporating insulators. Herein, we report a general and completely new effect of polymeric insulators in organic semiconductors: the insulator-donor electron wavefunction coupling effect. Such insulators can couple with donor polymers to reduce the energy barrier level and facilitate intramolecular electron transport. Besides the morphological effects, we observed that this coupling effect is another mechanism that can significantly enhance electron mobility (up to 100 times) through the incorporation of polymeric insulators in a series of donor systems. With this effect, we proposed a polymeric insulator blending approach to fabricate state-of-the-art pseudo-bilayer organic solar cells, and the PM6/L8-BO device exhibits a high efficiency of 19.50% (certificated 19.18%) with an improved interfacial electron transport property. This work not only offers a novel perspective on the quantum effect of polymeric insulators in organic semiconductors, but also presents a simple yet effective method for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells.},

The Arctic and Antarctic areas together exert enormous influence on the climate of the whole planet, as they contain 87% of its fresh water, 90% of its ice and snow, 90% of its permafrost and 69% of its glaciers. However, our lack of understanding of changes in the polar regions, such as melting ice sheets, results in major uncertainties in our estimates and predictions with regard to rising sea levels and other effects of climate change. For example, as the Arctic region is warming up two to four times faster than the global average, Eurasia now experiences colder winters.

Climate impacts arising from these changes enhance drought conditions and reduce food production in the affected regions. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of HC changes is critical to anticipating the resultant climate risks. First, we demonstrate that robust future HC changes in boreal winter, and the uncertainty in their future projections, are both largely related to sea surface temperature (SST) warming. Next, we investigate the impact of anthropogenic regional ocean warming on the future HC. Accordingly, we conduct a large ensemble of individual ocean basin perturbation experiments at 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C warming thresholds (as in the Paris Agreement). These experiments highlight (i) the leading role of tropical Indian Ocean warming in HC changes and (ii) inter-model differences in tropical Pacific warming as a source of uncertainty in HC projections.},

  abstract     = {Serpentinites play a crucial role in mass transport and volatile recycling in subduction zones, yet the mechanism for their contribution to the formation of arc magma remains elusive. Here, we investigate this issue by examining the magnesium (Mg) and boron (B) isotope compositions of volcanic rocks and forearc serpentinites from the South Sandwich Island arc. The volcanic rocks display δ 26 Mg values ranging from −0.25‰ to −0.06‰ and δ 11 B values ranging from +9.6‰ to +16.5‰, while the forearc serpentinites exhibit δ 26 Mg values of −0.21‰ to −0.02‰ and δ 11 B values of +5.2‰ to +9.8‰. Given the substantial contrast in both Mg and B contents between mantle rocks and fluids, the combined heavy Mg–B isotope compositions of volcanic rocks pose a challenge to traditional arc formation models, i.e. flux melting of depleted subarc mantle metasomatized by slab-derived fluids. Although an alternative model involving flux melting of dehydrated serpentinites can partly account for the heavy Mg isotope compositions of arc magmas, it is difficult to simultaneously explain the B isotope and trace-element compositions. Instead, these distinct compositions can be adequately explained by partial melting of a serpentinite-dominated mélange beneath the volcanic arc. Given that arc magmas exhibiting coupled heavy Mg–B isotope compositions are increasingly reported, we propose that serpentinite-mélange melting represents an effective and geochemically self-consistent mechanism for transferring signatures of subducted slabs to the overlying mantle source. This process can be significant in subduction zones with prominent forearc mantle erosion or those involving considerable amounts of slab-hosted serpentinite.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-14 (C-14) has been a major contributor to the human radioactive exposure dose, as it is released into the environment from the nuclear industry in larger quantities compared to other radionuclides. This most abundant nuclide enters the biosphere as organically bound C-14 (OBC-14), posing a potential threat to public health. Yet, it remains unknown how this relatively low radiotoxic nuclide induces health risks via chemical effects, such as isotope effect. By establishing a trophic transfer model involving algae ( Scenedesmus obliquus ), daphnia ( Daphnia magna ) and zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), we demonstrate that rapid incorporation and transformation of inorganic C-14 by algae into OBC-14 facilitates the blending of C-14 into the biomolecules of zebrafish. We find that internalized C-14 is persistently retained in the brain of zebrafish, affecting DNA methylation and causing alterations in neuropathology. Global isotope tracing metabolomics with C-14 exposure further reveals the involvement of C-14 in various critical metabolic pathways, including one-carbon metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. We thus characterize the kinetic isotope effects for 12 C/ 14 C in the key reactions of these metabolic pathways through kinetic experiments and density functional theory computations, showing that the isotopic substitution of carbon in biochemicals regulates metabolism by disrupting reaction ratios via isotope effects. Our results suggest that inorganic C-14 discharged by the nuclear industry can be biotransformed into OBC-14 to impact metabolism via isotope effects, providing new insights into understanding the health risk of C-14, which is traditionally considered as a low radiotoxic nuclide.},

  abstract     = {Lattice thermal conductivity ( κ l ) is of great importance in basic sciences and in energy conversion applications. However, low- κ l crystalline materials have only been obtained from heavy elements, which typically exhibit poor stability and possible toxicity. Thus, low- κ l materials composed of light elements should be explored. Herein, light elements with hierarchical structures in a simple square-net lattice as well as a small discrepancy in atomic mass and radius exhibit low κ l . The hierarchical structure exhibits various chemical bonds and asymmetric geometry of building units, resulting in flat phonon branches and strong phonon–phonon interactions similar to those observed in heavy-element materials. These phenomena generate a large phonon anharmonicity, which is the prerequisite for achieving extremely low κ l . For example, KCu 4 Se 3 exhibits an extremely low κ l of 0.12 W/(m·K) at 573 K, which is lower than that of most heavy-element materials. These findings can reshape our fundamental understanding of thermal transport properties of materials and advance the design of low- κ l solids comprising light elements.},

  abstract     = {The long-term preservation of large volumes of infrequently accessed cold data poses challenges to the storage community. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is considered a promising solution due to its inherent physical stability and significant storage density. The information density and decoding sequence coverage are two important metrics that influence the efficiency of DNA data storage. In this study, we propose a novel coding scheme called the DNA palette code, which is suitable for cold data, especially time-series archival datasets. These datasets are not frequently accessed, but require reliable long-term storage for retrospective research. The DNA palette code employs unordered combinations of index-free oligonucleotides to represent binary information. It can achieve high net information density encoding and lossless decoding with low sequencing coverage. When sequencing reads are corrupted, it can still effectively recover partial information, preventing the complete failure of file retrieval. The in vitro testing of clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data storage, as well as simulation validations using large-scale public MRI datasets (10 GB), planetary science datasets and meteorological datasets, demonstrates the advantages of our coding scheme, including high net information density, low decoding sequence coverage and wide applicability.},

The lower the NETD, the better the sensor can register small temperature differences. In this work, we proposed a strategy to achieve a high temperature resolution using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) with ultra-high sensitivity. We deduced the model for calculating the NETD of a photon-counting-type detector and applied it to our SNSPD-based set-up. Experimentally, we obtained an NETD as low as 0.65 mK, which is limited by the background radiation of the environment, and the required infrared radiation power is calculated to be <1 pW. Furthermore, the intrinsic NETD of this SNSPD is estimated to be <0.1 mK. This work demonstrated a sub-mK temperature resolution when using the SNSPD, paving the way for future remote infrared thermal imaging with high temperature resolution.},

However, challenges persist in achieving high crystal quality and lattice-matching heterostructures due to composition tuning and bandgap issues on substrates with differing crystal structures and high lattice mismatches. Consequently, research is increasingly focused on scalable InGaN nanowire µLEDs representing a transformative advancement in display technology, particularly for next-generation applications such as virtual/augmented reality and high-speed optical interconnects.

Here, we incorporated recent neuroscientific findings of self-inhibiting autapse and neuron heterogeneity for innovating a spiking neural network (SNN) with enhanced learning and memorizing capacities. A bi-level programming paradigm was formulated to respectively learn neuron-level biophysical variables and network-level synapse weights for nested heterogeneous learning. We successfully demonstrated that our biologically inspired neuron model could reproduce neural statistics at both individual and group levels, contributing to the effective decoding of brain–computer interface data. Furthermore, the heterogeneous SNN showed higher accuracy (1%–10% improvement), superior efficiency (maximal 17.83-fold reduction in energy) and lower latency (maximal 5-fold improvement) in performing several AI tasks. For the first time, we benchmarked SNN for conducting cell type identification from scRNA-seq data. The proposed model correctly identified very rare cell types associated with severe brain diseases where typical SNNs failed.},

  abstract     = {In closed systems, the celebrated Lieb–Schultz–Mattis (LSM) theorem states that a one-dimensional locally interacting half-integer spin chain with translation and spin rotation symmetries cannot have a non-degenerate gapped ground state. However, the applicability of this theorem is diminished when the system interacts with a bath and loses its energy conservation. In this letter, we propose that the LSM theorem can be revived in the entanglement Hamiltonian when the coupling to the bath renders the system short-range correlated. Specifically, we argue that the entanglement spectrum cannot have a non-degenerate minimum, isolated by a gap from other states. We further support the results with numerical examples where a spin- 1 / 2 system is coupled to another spin- 3 / 2 chain serving as the bath. Compared with the original LSM theorem that primarily addresses UV–IR correspondence, our findings reveal that the UV data and topological constraints also play a pivotal role in shaping the entanglement in open quantum many-body systems.},

Thus, it is crucial to develop a framework to identify emergent phenomena and capture emergent dynamics at the macro-level using available data. Inspired by the theory of causal emergence (CE), this paper introduces a machine learning framework to learn macro-dynamics in an emergent latent space and quantify the degree of CE. The framework maximizes effective information, resulting in a macro-dynamics model with enhanced causal effects. Experimental results on simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It quantifies degrees of CE effectively under various conditions and reveals distinct influences of different noise types. It can learn a one-dimensional coarse-grained macro-state from functional magnetic resonance imaging data to represent complex neural activities during movie clip viewing. Furthermore, improved generalization to different test environments is observed across all simulation data.},
