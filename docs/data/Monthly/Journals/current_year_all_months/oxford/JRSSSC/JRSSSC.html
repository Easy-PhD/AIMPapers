A multivariate spatial statistical model is developed to jointly analyse high-resolution remote sensing data and coarse-resolution climate model outputs. With a basis function representation, the resulting model can achieve efficient computation and describe potentially nonstationary spatial dependence. We implement our method to produce downscaled sea surface temperature projections over the Great Barrier Reef region from CMIP6 Earth system models. Compared with the state of the art, our method reduces the mean squared predictive error substantially and produces a predictive distribution enabling holistic uncertainty quantification analyses.},

While the LC model is effective in capturing mortality trends, it may not always be able to account for large, unexpected jumps in mortality rates caused by pandemics or wars. Existing models allow either for transient jumps with an effect of one period only or persistent jumps. However, there is no literature on estimating mortality time series with jumps having an effect over a small number of periods, as is typically observed in pandemics. The Bayesian approach allows to quantify the uncertainty around the parameter estimates. Empirical data from the COVID-19 pandemic show the superiority of the proposed approach, compared with models with a transitory shock effect.},

  abstract     = {Many studies suggest that searching for parking is associated with significant direct and indirect costs. Therefore, it is appealing to reduce the time that car drivers spend on finding an available parking spot, especially in urban areas where the space for all road users is limited. The prediction of on-street parking spot occupancy can provide drivers with guidance on where clear parking spaces are likely to be found. This field of research has gained more and more attention in the last decade through the increasing availability of real-time parking spot occupancy data. In this paper, we pursue a statistical approach for the prediction of parking spot occupancy, where we make use of time-to-event models and semi-Markov process theory. The latter involves the employment of Laplace transformations as well as their inversion, which is an ambitious numerical task. We apply our methodology to data from the City of Melbourne in Australia. Our main result is that the semi-Markov model outperforms a Markov model in terms of both true negative rate and true positive rate while this is essentially achieved by respecting the current duration that a parking space already spends in its initial state.},

  abstract     = {Combining data from various sources empowers researchers to explore innovative questions, for example those raised by conducting healthcare monitoring studies. However, the lack of a unique identifier often poses challenges. Record linkage procedures determine whether pairs of observations collected on different occasions belong to the same individual using partially identifying variables (e.g. birth year, postal code). Existing methodologies typically involve a compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy. Traditional approaches simplify this task by condensing information, yet they neglect dependencies among linkage decisions and disregard the one-to-one relationship required to establish coherent links. Modern approaches offer a comprehensive representation of the data generation process, at the expense of computational overhead and reduced flexibility. We propose a flexible method, that adapts to varying data complexities, addressing registration errors and accommodating changes of the identifying information over time. Our approach balances accuracy and scalability, estimating the linkage using a Stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm on a latent variable model. We illustrate the ability of our methodology to connect observations using large real data applications and demonstrate the robustness of our model to the linking variables quality in a simulation study. The proposed algorithm FlexRL is implemented and available in an open source R package.},

In this research, our primary objective is to develop a clustering framework to handle compound extreme events within gridded climate data across Europe. Specifically, we intend to identify subregions that display asymptotic independence between precipitation and wind speed extremes, meaning that occurrences of extreme rain and wind speed in one subregion do not affect those in the other. To achieve this, we utilize daily precipitation sums and daily maximum wind speed data derived from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset spanning from 1979 to 2022. Our approach hinges on a tuning parameter and the application of a divergence measure to spotlight disparities in extremal dependence structures without relying on specific parametric assumptions. We propose a data-driven approach to determine the tuning parameter. This enables us to generate clusters that are spatially concentrated, which can provide more insightful information about the regional distribution of compound precipitation and wind speed extremes. The proposed method is able to extract valuable information about extreme compound events while also significantly reducing the size of the dataset within reasonable computational timeframes.},

This model is applied to two main meteorological data sources in the Philippines. The data fusion approach assumes that different data sources are imperfect representations of a common underlying process. Observations from weather stations follow a classical error model, while numerical weather forecasts involve both a constant multiplicative bias and an additive bias, which is spatially structured and time-varying. To perform inference, we use a Bayesian model averaging technique combined with integrated nested Laplace approximation. The model’s performance is evaluated through a simulation study, where it consistently results in better predictions and more accurate parameter estimates than models using only weather stations data or regression calibration, particularly in cases of sparse observational data. In the meteorological data application, the proposed data fusion model also outperforms these benchmark approaches, as demonstrated by leave-group-out cross-validation.},

  abstract     = {The D-vine copula-based quantile regression (DVQR) is a powerful tool for weather forecasting, as it is able to select informative predictor variables from a large set and takes account of nonlinear relationships among them. However, DVQR shows in its current form a lack in adaptively modelling strongly varying effects among variables, such as temporal and/or spatial effects. Consequently, we propose an extension of the current DVQR, where we specify the parameters of the bivariate copulas in the D-vine copula through Kendall’s τ to which additional covariates are linked. The parameterization of the correlation parameter allows generalized additive models (GAMs) to incorporate, e.g. linear, nonlinear, and spatial effects as well as interactions. The new method is called GAM-DVQR, and its performance is illustrated in a case study on postprocessing 2 m surface temperature ensemble weather forecasts. We investigate constant as well as time-dependent Kendall’s τ correlation models. The results indicate that the GAM-DVQR models are able to identify time-dependent correlations and significantly outperform state-of-the-art postprocessing methods. Furthermore, the introduced temporal parameterization allows a more economical and faster model estimation in comparison to DVQR using a sliding training window. To complement this article, we provide an R -package for our method called gamvinereg .},

  abstract     = {Statistical models are an essential tool to model, forecast, and understand the hydrological processes in watersheds. In particular, the understanding of time lags associated with the delay between rainfall occurrence and subsequent changes in streamflow is of high practical importance. Since water can take a variety of flow paths to generate streamflow, a series of distinct runoff pulses may combine to create the observed streamflow time series. Current state-of-the-art models are not able to sufficiently confront the problem complexity with interpretable parametrization, thus preventing novel insights about the dynamics of distinct flow paths from being formed. The proposed Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model targets this problem by combining the concept of multiple windows sliding along the time axis with multiple linear regression. The window kernels, which indicate the weights applied to different time lags, are implemented via Gaussian-shaped kernels. As a result, straightforward process inference can be achieved since each window can represent one flow path. Experiments on simulated and real-world scenarios underline that the proposed model achieves accurate parameter estimates and competitive predictive performance, while fostering explainable and interpretable hydrological modelling.},

In urban environments, these new data have the potential to allow for high-resolution and high-frequency forecasts, and thereby to provide an assessment of population exposure at neighbourhood level. The complex spatio-temporal structure of these data, however, requires new flexible methods that are also able to provide timely forecasts. In this work, we propose a novel method that first provides forecasts with a reservoir computing approach, an echo-state network, adjusts the forecast with a transformer network with attention mechanism and then merges the echo-state and transformer forecast into a combined network. The stochastic nature of the method allows for a fast and more accurate forecast then individual predictors as well as standard statistical methods. Simulation and application to San Francisco air pollution show how the proposed method is able to produce high-resolution urban maps of air quality. Additionally, we show how these forecasts can be used to provide neighbour-level exposure assessment using population data, a task that would not be achievable with sparse government-sponsored air quality networks.},

  abstract     = {Soil moisture dynamics provide an indicator of soil health that scientists model via drydown curves. The typical modelling process requires the soil moisture time series to be manually separated into drydown segments and then exponential decay models are fitted to them independently. Sensor development in recent years means that experiments that were previously conducted over a few field campaigns can now be scaled to months or years at a higher sampling rate. To better meet the challenge of increasing data size, this paper proposes a novel changepoint-based approach to automatically identify structural changes in the soil drying process and simultaneously estimate the drydown parameters that are of interest to soil scientists. A simulation study is carried out to demonstrate the performance of the method in detecting changes and retrieving model parameters. Practical aspects of the method such as adding covariates and penalty learning are discussed. The method is applied to hourly soil moisture time series from the National Ecological Observatory Network data portal to investigate the temporal dynamics of soil moisture drydown. We recover known relationships previously identified manually, alongside delivering new insights into the temporal variability across soil types and locations.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamics of climate variables is critical for sectors like energy and environmental monitoring. This study addresses the pressing need for accurate mapping of environmental variables in national or regional monitoring networks, a challenge exacerbated by skewed data and large gaps. While this may not be immediately apparent, managing skewness across multiple data sources introduces additional complexities, as conventional transformation methods often fail to effectively normalize the data or preserve inter-dataset relationships. Furthermore, the literature highlights that interpolation uncertainty is closely linked to the interpolation distance, making the handling of large gaps particularly problematic. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel data fusion approach: the warped multifidelity Gaussian process. This method predicts time-series data from multiple sources with varying reliability and resolution, while effectively addressing skewness and demonstrating partial independence from interpolation distance. Through extensive simulation experiments, we explore both the strengths and limitations of the method. Additionally, as a case study, we apply warped multifidelity Gaussian process (WMFGP) to wind speed data from the Agenzia regionale per la protezione ambientale (ARPA) Lombardia network, a regional environmental agency in Italy. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of WMFGP in filling large gaps in wind speed data, providing more accurate predictions that are essential for air quality forecasting, network maintenance.},

  abstract     = {Irregular longitudinal data with informative visit times arise when patients’ visits are partly driven by concurrent disease outcomes. However, existing methods such as inverse intensity weighting (IIW), often overlook or have not adequately assessed the influence of informative visit times on estimation and inference. Based on novel balancing weights estimators, we propose a new sensitivity analysis approach to addressing informative visit times within the IIW framework. The balancing weights are obtained by balancing observed history variable distributions over time and including a selection function with specified sensitivity parameters to characterize the additional influence of the concurrent outcome on the visit process. A calibration procedure is proposed to anchor the range of the sensitivity parameters to the amount of variation in the visit process that could be additionally explained by the concurrent outcome given the observed history and time. Simulations demonstrate that our balancing weights estimators outperform existing weighted estimators for robustness and efficiency. We provide an R Markdown tutorial of the proposed methods and apply them to analyse data from a clinic-based cohort of psoriatic arthritis.},

In the present work, we are interested in comparing physical activity measurements using two different accelerometers. However, a potential issue arises with the popular Bland–Altman analysis, as it assumes that differences between measurements are identically distributed across all observational units. In the case of the physical activity measurements, agreement might depend on sex, height, weight, or age of the person wearing the accelerometers, among others. To capture this potential dependency, we introduce the concept of conditional method agreement, which defines subgroups with heterogeneous agreement in dependence of covariates. We propose several tree-based models that can detect such a dependency and incorporate it into the model by splitting the data into subgroups, showing that the agreement of the activity measurements is conditional on the participant’s age. Simulation studies also showed that all models were able to detect subgroups with high accuracy as the sample size increased. We call the proposed modelling approach conditional method agreement trees and make them publicly available through the R package coat .},

We propose that temporal deformation occurs smoothly relative to that in the original region. To incorporate this idea, we employ state space models to model dynamic deformation. Generalizing this class of models based on spatial deformation was driven by the need to model monthly average temperature data in the southern region of Brazil. The distinctive traits of this region, characterized by plateaus and mountain ranges and close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, provide notable geographic diversity. This diversity, in addition to different meteorological phenomena over time, may influence the spatial correlation function. The model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian approach, which requires the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to approximate the posterior distributions of parameters. The model is applied to 15 years of monthly average temperature data from the southern region of Brazil. The primary result of this analysis reveals a significant improvement in temperature modelling when the proposed model is used compared with that when versions that employ static deformation are used.},

The spatial distribution of precipitation occurrences is modelled with four competing models, while the spatial distribution of nonzero extreme precipitation intensities are modelled with a latent Gaussian version of the spatial conditional extremes model. Nonzero precipitation marginal distributions are modelled using latent Gaussian models with gamma and generalized Pareto likelihoods. Fast inference is achieved using integrated nested Laplace approximations. We model and simulate spatial precipitation extremes in Central Norway, using 13 years of hourly radar data with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km 2 ⁠ , over an area of size 6,461 km 2 ⁠ , to describe the behaviour of extreme precipitation over a small drainage area.

This paper proposes a Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework to jointly estimate wastewater viral signals and their derivatives, while accounting for common features and limitations of wastewater data. Our framework uses differentiable Gaussian processes to model both a common viral trend and deviations at individual stations. Specifically, the common trend is modelled as an Integrated Wiener Process and station-specific signals are smoothed assuming a Matérn covariance function of order 1.5. We demonstrate the framework’s utility by modelling SARS-CoV-2 concentrations across Canada and London, UK, as well as pepper mild mottle virus-normalized respiratory syncytial virus concentrations in Central California. Our results show that this framework reliably estimates both the signal and its derivative in retrospective and surveillance contexts, and show that inference of the signal’s average rates of change is sensitive to the differentiability of the modelling process.},

We provide a framework for statistical analysis of treatment effect modification and develop methods for testing for treatment effect modification and estimating individualized predictors of treatment differences in the CO trial with limited sample size. Numerical assessments showed that the efficiency of the proposed CO analysis was substantially higher than the standard analysis based on parallel-group comparison in these analyses. Application to the diabetes trial showed that markers based on gene expression in peripheral blood cells before pharmacological treatment significantly modified the effect of the treatment on the response and that marker-based predictors produced two subgroups of patients for whom different treatments should be recommended.},

This paper extends Poisson auto-regression to incorporate spatio-temporal dependence and characterize the local dynamics by borrowing information from adjacent areas. Adopted in a fully Bayesian framework and implemented through a novel sparse-matrix representation in Stan, the model has been validated through a simulation study. We use it to analyse the weekly COVID-19 cases in the English local authority districts and verify some of the epidemic-driving factors. The model detects substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity and enables the formalization of novel model-based investigation methods for assessing additional aspects of disease epidemiology.},

  abstract     = {To comprehensively evaluate a public policy intervention, researchers must consider the effects of the policy not just on the implementing region, but also nearby, indirectly affected regions. For example, an excise tax on sweetened beverages in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was shown to not only be associated with a decrease in volume sales of taxed beverages in Philadelphia, but also an increase in sales in nontaxed bordering counties. The latter association may be explained by cross-border shopping behaviours of Philadelphia residents and indicate a causal effect of the tax on nearby regions, which may drastically offset the total effect of the intervention. In this paper, we adapt doubly robust difference-in-differences methodology to estimate distinct causal effects on the implementing and neighbouring control regions when they are geographically separable and data exists from an unaffected control region. Our approach adjusts for potential confounding in quasi-experimental evaluations and relaxes standard assumptions on model specification while accounting for geographically separable interference, repeated observations, spatial correlation, and unknown effect heterogeneity. We apply these methods to evaluate the effect of the Philadelphia beverage tax on taxed beverage sales in 231 Philadelphia and bordering county stores. We also use our methods to explore effect heterogeneity across geographical features.},

Our model targets acqua alta events, i.e. the exceedances of flooding limits, addressing the prevalent zero counts within the dataset through a fitted zero-inflated Poisson distribution. The data’s dynamics are attributed to a discrete set of hidden environmental risk states, evolving through time following a (nonhomogeneous) hidden semi-Markov chain. Furthermore, we extend the conventional hidden semi-Markov approach by introducing regression-dependent state-specific duration parameters, enhancing the model’s adaptability and precision in capturing real-world complexities. Our methodology hinges on the maximum-likelihood estimation, directly optimizing the log-likelihood function to infer the model’s parameters. Through the definition of this novel hidden semi-Markov model, we aim to offer a complete understanding of the intricate interplay between weather states, environmental variables, and the observed marine count data, thus contributing to a nuanced analysis of the Venice lagoon’s data.},

The disease reproduction number, R t ⁠ , quantifies transmissibility and is central to evaluating these interventions. This article discusses hierarchical stochastic epidemic models with piece-wise constant R t ⁠ , suitable for capturing distinct epidemic phases and estimating disease magnitude. The timing and scale of R t changes are inferred from data, while the number of phases is allowed to vary. The model uses Poisson point processes and Dirichlet process components to learn the number of phases, providing insight into epidemic dynamics. We test the models on synthetic data and apply them to freely available data from the UK, Greece, California, and New York. We estimate the true number of infections and R t and independently validate this approach via a large seroprevalence study. The results show that key disease characteristics can be derived from publicly available data without imposing strong assumptions.},

Specifically, we propose a novel Bayesian model for inferring about the intensity of observations in the joint tail over time, and for assessing if two stochastic processes are asymptotically dependent. To model the intensity of observations exceeding a high threshold, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric approach that defines a prior on the space of what we define as Extremal Dependence Intensity functions. In addition, a parametric prior is set on the coefficient of tail dependence. An extensive battery of experiments on simulated data show that the proposed method are able to recover the true targets in a variety of scenarios. An application of the proposed methodology to a set of big tech stocks—known as FAANG (Meta’s F acebook, A pple, A mazon, N etflix and Alphabet’s G oogle)—sheds light on some interesting features on the dynamics of their combined losses over time.},

The link-tracing design, combined with homophily, the tendency for people to connect to others with whom they share characteristics, induces similarity between linked individuals. This dependence inflates the Type 1 error of conventional statistical methods (e.g. t -tests, regression, etc.). A semiparametric randomization test for bivariate association was developed to test for association between two categorical variables. We directly extend this work and propose a semiparametric randomization test for relationships between two variables, when one or both are continuous.

  abstract     = {Peatlands account for 10% of UK land area, 80% of which are degraded to some degree, emitting carbon at a similar magnitude to oil refineries or landfill sites. A lack of tools for rapid and reliable assessment of peatland condition has limited monitoring of vast areas of peatland and prevented targeting areas urgently needing action to halt further degradation. Measured using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), peatland surface motion is highly indicative of peatland condition, largely driven by the eco-hydrological change in the peatland causing swelling and shrinking of the peat substrate. The computational intensity of recent methods using InSAR time series to capture the annual functional structure of peatland surface motion becomes increasingly challenging as the sample size increases. Instead, we utilize the behaviour of the entire peatland surface motion time series using object oriented data analysis to assess peatland condition. Bayesian cluster analysis based on the functional structure of the surface motion time series finds areas indicative of soft/wet peatlands, drier/shrubby peatlands, and thin/modified peatlands. The posterior distribution of the assigned peatland types enables the scale of peatland degradation to be assessed, which will guide future cost-effective decisions for peatland restoration.},

This difficulty is even more pertinent in the context of personalized dose-finding, where patient characteristics are used to identify tailored optimal dose combinations. To overcome these challenges, we propose the use of Bayesian optimization for finding optimal dose combinations in standard (one size fits all) and personalized multi-agent dose-finding trials. Bayesian optimization is a method for estimating the global optima of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. The objective function is approximated by a surrogate model, commonly a Gaussian process, paired with a sequential design strategy to select the next point via an acquisition function. This work is motivated by an industry-sponsored problem, where the focus is on optimizing a dual-agent therapy in a setting featuring minimal toxicity. To compare the performance of the standard and personalized methods under this setting, simulation studies are performed for a variety of scenarios. Our study concludes that taking a personalized approach is highly beneficial in the presence of heterogeneity.},

In multi-trait fine mapping, we are interested in identifying the causal variants for multiple related traits. Existing multivariate variable selection methods for fine mapping select variables for all responses without considering the possible heterogeneity across different responses. Here, we develop a novel multivariate Bayesian variable selection method for multi-trait fine mapping to select causal variants from a large number of grouped SNPs that target at multiple correlated and possibly heterogeneous traits. Our new method is featured by its selection at multiple levels, incorporation of prior biological knowledge to guide selection and identification of best subset of traits the variants target at. We showed the advantage of our method over existing methods via comprehensive simulations that mimic typical fine-mapping settings and a real-world fine-mapping example in UK Biobank, where we identified critical causal variants potentially targeting at different subsets of addictive behaviours and risk factors.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the changing nature of the frequency, magnitude, and spatial extent of extreme temperatures in Ireland from 1942 to 2020. We develop an extreme value model that captures spatial and temporal nonstationarity in extreme daily maximum temperature data. We model the tails of the marginal variables using the generalized Pareto distribution and the spatial dependence of extreme events by a semiparametric Brown–Resnick r -Pareto process, with parameters of each model allowed to change over time. We use weather station observations for modelling extreme events since data from climate models (not conditioned on observational data) can oversmooth these events and have trends determined by the specific climate model configuration. However, climate models do provide valuable information about the detailed physiography over Ireland and the associated climate response. We propose novel methods which exploit the climate model data to overcome issues linked to the sparse and biased sampling of the observations. Our analysis identifies a temporal change in the marginal behaviour of extreme temperature events over the study domain, which is much larger than the change in mean temperature levels over this time window. We illustrate how these characteristics result in increased spatial coverage of the events that exceed critical temperatures.},

  abstract     = {To deliver on the promise of 5G, network providers and application developers need to understand the factors impacting millimetre wave (mmWave) 5G throughput. Missing data, however, pose significant challenges for modelling throughput. Even in controlled settings, signal strength data may be only intermittently observed when a device’s connection is weak, leading to missing predictor values in model training. In addition, users may choose not to share their data once the model is deployed, meaning that key predictors may be missing when we want to predict throughput for their devices. To address these challenges, we introduce boosted additive model for data with missing observation (BAMMO), a novel additive model estimator obtained via a componentwise boosting algorithm that naturally incorporates data with missing values in model fitting. We validate BAMMO’s approach to handling missing data by comparing it with competing methods on real 5G network data with a high proportion of missing values and in simulations, finding that it delivers more accurate predictions and takes less time to compute. To identify key predictors of mmWave 5G throughput, we develop a novel extension of sparsity oriented importance learning for BAMMO, giving us a measure of variable importance based on the entire boosting solution path rather than a single selected model.},

Particle number size distribution (PNSD) is the most accessible data to identify these sources, which provides information on the PM sizes. Here, we propose a new functional factor model for PNSD, which allows to disentangle PM into sources and contributions while considering the complex dependencies of the data across different sizes and periods. Through a simulation study, we show that this method is able to identify sources correctly, and we use it to analyse hourly PNSD data collected in London for 7 years, finding 6 well-defined sources. Our proposed methodology is fast, accurate, and reproducible.},

  abstract     = {The aim of dynamic prediction is to provide individualized risk predictions over time, which are updated as new data become available. In pursuit of constructing a dynamic prediction model for a progressive eye disorder, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we propose a time-dependent Cox survival neural network (tdCoxSNN) to predict its progression using longitudinal fundus images. tdCoxSNN builds upon the time-dependent Cox model by utilizing a neural network to capture the nonlinear effect of time-dependent covariates on the survival outcome. Moreover, by concurrently integrating a convolutional neural network with the survival network, tdCoxSNN can directly take longitudinal images as input. We evaluate and compare our proposed method with joint modelling and landmarking approaches through extensive simulations. We applied the proposed approach to two real datasets. One is a large AMD study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, in which more than 50,000 fundus images were captured over a period of 12 years for more than 4,000 participants. Another is a public dataset of the primary biliary cirrhosis disease, where multiple laboratory tests were longitudinally collected to predict the time-to-liver transplant. Our approach demonstrates commendable predictive performance in both simulation studies and the analysis of the two real datasets.},

  abstract     = {A nonhomogeneous hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to segment bivariate time series of wind and wave directions according to a finite number of latent regimes and, simultaneously, estimate the influence of time-varying covariates on the process’ survival under each regime. The model is a mixture of toroidal densities, whose parameters depend on the evolution of a semi-Markov chain, which is in turn modulated by time-varying covariates. It includes nonhomogeneous hidden Markov models and hidden semi-Markov models as special cases. Parameter estimates are obtained using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that relies on an efficient augmentation of the latent process. Fitted on a time series of wind and wave directions recorded in the Adriatic Sea, the model offers a clear-cut description of sea state dynamics in terms of latent regimes and captures the influence of time-varying weather conditions on the duration of such regimes.},

  abstract     = {Logistic regression models lead to a bias of the odds ratio (OR) as estimated using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method, when there are few study participants at the binary outcome and factor levels. Although Bayesian methods are frequently applied to reduce this sparse data bias, the specification of the prior distribution for regression coefficients is the most controversial feature. We propose a nonarbitrary and empirical method to determine the prior mean for regression coefficients in Bayesian logistic regression analysis for sparse data. The proposed prior mean is calculated as the difference between the observed log OR and the quasi-expectation of log OR, and is interpreted as a shrinkage statistic of the ML estimate. Further, for easy and fast inference, the proposed method applies to Bayesian logistic regression with the normal prior and the log- F prior via data augmentation. Simulation results indicate that the OR bias based on the proposed method is consistently smaller than that based on the ML method. The OR bias estimated using the proposed method is generally smaller than that based on the mean prior of zero for the regression coefficient. We apply the proposed methods to 2 real data sets.},

  abstract     = {In linear regression, the coefficients are simple to estimate using the least squares method with a known design matrix for the observed measurements. However, real-world applications may encounter complications such as an unknown design matrix and complex-valued parameters. The design matrix can be estimated from prior information but can potentially cause an inverse problem when multiplying by the transpose as it is generally ill-conditioned. This can be combat by adding regularizers to the model but does not always mitigate the issues. Here, we propose our Bayesian approach to a complex-valued latent variable linear model with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) image reconstruction. The complex-valued linear model and our Bayesian model are evaluated through extensive simulations and applied to experimental fMRI data.},

  abstract     = {Survival is poor for patients with metastatic cancer, and it is vital to examine new biomarkers that can improve patient prognostication and identify those who would benefit from more aggressive therapy. In metastatic prostate cancer, 2 new assays have become available: one that quantifies the number of cancer cells circulating in the peripheral blood, and the other a marker of the aggressiveness of the disease. It is critical to determine the magnitude of the effect of these biomarkers on the discrimination of a model-based risk score. To do so, most analysts frequently consider the discrimination of 2 separate survival models: one that includes both the new and standard factors and a second that includes the standard factors alone. However, this analysis is ultimately incorrect for many of the scale-transformation models ubiquitous in survival, as the reduced model is misspecified if the full model is specified correctly. To circumvent this issue, we developed a projection-based approach to estimate the impact of the 2 prostate cancer biomarkers. The results indicate that the new biomarkers can influence model discrimination and justify their inclusion in the risk model; however, the hunt remains for an applicable model to risk-stratify patients with metastatic prostate cancer.},

The model provides probabilistic estimates of component drivers of regional RSL change via the combination of a univariate spline capturing a common regional signal over time, random slopes and intercepts capturing site-specific (local), long-term linear trends and a spatial–temporal spline capturing residual, non-linear, local variations. Proxy and instrumental records of RSL and corresponding measurement errors inform the model and a noisy-input method accounts for proxy temporal uncertainties. Results highlight the decomposition of regional RSL changes over 3,000 years along North America’s Atlantic coast. The physical process glacial isostatic adjustment prevailed before 1800 CE, with anthropogenic forcing dominating after 1900 CE.},

A common nonstationarity in GVA data, such as the ABML series, is its increase in variance over time due to inflation. Transformed or inflation-adjusted series can still be challenging for classical stationarity-assuming forecasters. We adopt a different approach that works directly with the GVA series by advancing recent forecasting methods for locally stationary time series. Our approach results in more accurate and reliable forecasts, and continues to work well even when the ABML series becomes highly variable during the COVID pandemic.},

We developed a mixture of Dirichlet process models to distinguish between patient-specific and shared spatial patterns across multiple patients to provide insight into consistent response patterns essential for developing personalized treatment procedures. The Metropolis–Hastings within Gibbs sampler of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was developed for estimation. The model was used to analyse the TMS data of 3 healthy subjects. The study revealed that the primary motor cortex of the hand consistently emerges as a promising region for eliciting optimal responses. This area serves as a key target for brain mapping using TMS to identify cortical hotspots. However, the excitability patterns in this region can vary significantly among patients.},
