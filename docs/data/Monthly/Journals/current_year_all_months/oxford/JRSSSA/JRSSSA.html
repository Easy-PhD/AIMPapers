  abstract     = {South Korea’s educational system has faced criticism for its lack of focus on critical thinking and creativity, resulting in high levels of stress and anxiety among students. As part of the government’s effort to improve the educational system, the innovation school system was introduced in 2009, which aims to develop students’ creativity as well as their non-cognitive skills. To better understand the differences between innovation and regular school systems in South Korea, we propose a novel method that combines the latent space item response model with the Neyman–Scott point process model. Our method accounts for the heterogeneity of items and students, captures relationships between respondents and items, and identifies item and student clusters that can provide a comprehensive understanding of students’ behaviours/perceptions on non-cognitive outcomes. Our analysis reveals that students in the innovation school system show a higher sense of citizenship, while those in the regular school system tend to associate confidence in appearance with social ability. A comparison with exploratory item factor analysis highlights our method’s advantages in terms of uncertainty quantification of the clustering process and more detailed and nuanced clustering results. Our method is made available to an existing R package, lsirm12pl.},

  abstract     = {The advent of the information age has revolutionized data collection and has led to a rapid expansion of available data sources. Methods of data integration are indispensable when a question of interest cannot be addressed using a single data source. Record linkage (RL) is at the forefront of such data integration efforts. Incentives for sharing linked data for secondary analysis have prompted the need for methodology accounting for possible errors at the RL stage. Mismatch error is a common consequence resulting from the use of nonunique or noisy identifiers at that stage. In this paper, we present a framework to enable valid postlinkage inference in the secondary analysis setting in which only the linked file is given. The proposed framework covers a variety of statistical models and can flexibly incorporate information about the underlying RL process. We propose a mixture model for linked records whose two components reflect distributions conditional on match status, i.e. correct or false match. Regarding inference, we develop a method based on composite likelihood and the expectation-maximization algorithm that is implemented in the R package pldamixture . Extensive simulations and case studies involving contemporary RL applications corroborate the effectiveness of our framework.},

  abstract     = {With the precipitous decline in response rates, researchers and pollsters have been left with highly nonrepresentative samples, relying on constructed weights to make these samples representative of the desired target population. Though practitioners employ valuable expert knowledge to choose what variables X must be adjusted for, they rarely defend particular functional forms relating these variables to the response process or the outcome. Unfortunately, commonly used calibration weights—which make the weighted mean of X in the sample equal that of the population—only ensure correct adjustment when the portion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear functions of X are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency, we describe kernel balancing for population weighting ( kpop ). This approach replaces the design matrix X with a kernel matrix, K encoding high-order information about X ⁠ . Weights are then found to make the weighted average row of K among sampled units approximately equal to that of the target population. This produces good calibration on a wide range of smooth functions of X , without relying on the user to decide which X or what functions of them to include. We describe the method and illustrate it by application to polling data from the 2016 US presidential election.},

Unlike most SES assessment models proposed in the literature, the hierarchical nature of this model enables the use of census observations at the household level without needing to aggregate any information a priori . Therefore, it better accommodates the variability of the SES between census tracts and the number of households per area. The proposed model is used in the estimation of a socio-economic index using 10% of the 2010 Ghana census in the Greater Accra Metropolitan area. Out of the 20 observed variables, the number of people per room, access to water piping and flushable toilets differentiated high and low SES areas the best.},

  abstract     = {Disease surveillance data are used for monitoring and understanding disease burden, which provides valuable information in allocating health programme resources. Statistical methods play an important role in estimating disease burden since disease surveillance systems are prone to undercounting. This paper is motivated by the challenge of estimating mortality associated with respiratory infections (e.g. influenza and COVID-19) that are not ascertained from death certificates. We propose a Bayesian spatial–temporal model incorporating measures of infection activity to estimate excess deaths. Particularly, the inclusion of time-varying coefficients allows us to better characterize associations between infection activity and mortality counts time series. Software to implement this method is available in the R package NBRegAD . Applying our modelling framework to weekly state-wide COVID-19 data in the US from 8 March 2020 to 3 July 2022, we identified temporal and spatial differences in excess deaths between different age groups. We estimated the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the US to be 1,168,481 (95% CI: 1,148,953 1,187,187) compared to the 1,022,147 from using only death certificate information. The analysis also suggests that the most severe undercounting was in the 18–49 years age group with an estimated underascertainment rate of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.25).},

From trial design perspective, operating characteristics including Type I error and power are particularly important and are assessed in our realistic simulation studies representing a variety of practical scenarios. Our proposed weighting estimators achieve significant power gain, while maintaining Type I error close to the nominal value of 0.05.

  abstract     = {Experiments studying get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts estimate causal effects of various mobilization efforts on voter turnout. However, there is often substantial noncompliance in these studies. A usual approach is to use an instrumental variable (IV) analysis to estimate impacts for compliers, here being those actually contacted by the investigators. Unfortunately, popular IV estimators can be unstable in studies with a small fraction of compliers. We explore poststratifying the data (e.g. taking a weighted average of IV estimates within each stratum) using variables that predict complier status (and, potentially, the outcome) to mitigate this. We present the benefits of poststratification in terms of bias, variance, and improved standard error estimates, and provide a finite-sample asymptotic variance formula. We also compare the performance of different IV approaches and discuss the advantages of our design-based poststratification approach over incorporating compliance-predictive covariates into the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator. In the end, we show that covariates predictive of compliance can increase precision, but only if one is willing to make a bias-variance trade-off by down-weighting or dropping strata with few compliers. By contrast, standard approaches such as 2SLS fail to use such information. We finally examine the benefits of our approach in two GOTV applications.},

  abstract     = {Paired comparison models are used for analysing data that involves pairwise comparisons among a set of objects. When the outcomes of the pairwise comparisons have no ties, the paired comparison models can be generalized as a class of binary response models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their corresponding areas under the curves are commonly used as performance metrics to evaluate the discriminating ability of binary response models. Despite their individual wide range of usage and their close connection to binary response models, ROC analysis to our knowledge has never been extended to paired comparison models since the problem of using different objects as the reference in paired comparison models prevents traditional ROC approach from generating unambiguous and interpretable curves. We focus on addressing this problem by proposing two novel methods to construct ROC curves for paired comparison data which provide interpretable statistics and maintain desired asymptotic properties. The methods are then applied and analysed on head-to-head professional sports competition data.},

  abstract     = {Citizen science mobilizes many observers and gathers huge datasets but often without strict sampling protocols, resulting in observation biases due to heterogeneous sampling effort, which can lead to biased predictions. We develop a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model for bias-corrected estimation of arrival dates of the first migratory bird individuals at their breeding sites. Higher sampling effort could be correlated with earlier observed dates. We implement data fusion of two citizen-science datasets with fundamentally different protocols (Breeding Bird Survey, eBird) and obtain posterior distributions of the latent process, which contains four spatial components endowed with Gaussian process priors: species niche; sampling effort; position and scale parameters of annual first arrival date. The data layer consists of four response variables: counts of observed eBird locations (Poisson); presence–absence at observed eBird locations (Binomial); BBS occurrence counts (Poisson); first arrival dates (generalized extreme-value). We devise a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme and check by simulation that the latent process components are identifiable. We apply our model to several migratory bird species in the northeastern US for 2001–2021 and find that the sampling effort significantly modulates the observed first arrival dates. We exploit this relationship to effectively bias-correct predictions of the true first arrivals.},

As citizen science data often feature unequal sampling efforts across a spatial domain, prediction sets constructed with indirect methods that share information across counties may be used to improve precision. In this article, we present a nonparametric framework to obtain precise prediction sets for a multinomial random sample based on indirect information that maintain frequentist coverage for each county. We detail a simple algorithm to obtain prediction sets for each county using indirect information where the computation time does not depend on the sample size and scales nicely with the number of species considered. The indirect information may be estimated by a proposed empirical Bayes procedure based on information from auxiliary data. Our approach makes inference for under-sampled counties more precise, while maintaining area-specific frequentist validity for each county. Our method is used to provide a useful description of avian species abundance in North Carolina, USA based on citizen science data from the eBird database.},

  abstract     = {The global decline of biodiversity, driven by habitat degradation and climate breakdown, is a significant concern. Accurate measures of change are crucial to provide reliable evidence of species’ population changes. Meanwhile citizen science data have witnessed a remarkable expansion in both quantity and sources and serve as the foundation for assessing species’ status. The growing data reservoir presents opportunities for novel and improved inference but often comes with computational costs: computational efficiency is paramount, especially as regular analysis updates are necessary. Building upon recent research, we present illustrations of computationally efficient methods for fitting new models, applied to three major citizen science data sets for butterflies. We extend a method for modelling abundance changes of seasonal organisms, firstly to accommodate multiple years of count data efficiently, and secondly for application to counts from a snapshot mass-participation survey. We also present a variational inference approach for fitting occupancy models efficiently to opportunistic citizen science data. The continuous growth of citizen science data offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of how species respond to anthropogenic pressures. Efficient techniques in fitting new models are vital for accurately assessing species’ status, supporting policy-making, setting measurable targets, and enabling effective conservation efforts.},

  abstract     = {The development of appropriate statistical models has lagged behind the ambitions of empirical studies analysing large scientific networks—systems of publications connected by citations and authorship. Extant research typically focuses on either paper citation networks or author collaboration networks. However, these networks involve both direct relationships, as well as broader dependencies between references linked by multiple citation paths. In this work, we extend recently developed relational hyperevent models to analyse networks characterized by complex dependencies across multiple network modes. We introduce new covariates to represent theoretically relevant and empirically plausible mixed-mode network configurations. This model specification allows testing hypotheses that recognize the polyadic nature of publication data, while accounting for multiple dependencies linking authors and references of current and prior papers. We implement the model using open-source software to analyse publicly available data on a large scientific network. Our findings reveal a tendency for subsets of papers to be cocited, indicating that the impact of these papers may be partly due to endogenous network processes. More broadly, the analysis shows that models accounting for both the hyperedge structure of publication events and the interconnections between authors and references significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms driving scientific production and impact.},

  abstract     = {With historic misses in the 2016 and 2020 US Presidential elections, interest in measuring polling errors has increased. The most common method for measuring directional errors and non-sampling excess variability during a postmortem for an election is by assessing the difference between the poll result and election result for polls conducted within a few days of the day of the election. Analysing such polling error data is notoriously difficult with typical models being extremely sensitive to the time between the poll and the election. We leverage hidden Markov models traditionally used for election forecasting to flexibly capture time-varying preferences and treat the election result as a peek at the typically hidden Markovian process. Our results are much less sensitive to the choice of time window, avoid conflating shifting preferences with polling error, and are more interpretable despite a highly flexible model. We demonstrate these results with data on polls from the 2004 through 2020 US Presidential elections and 1992 through 2020 US Senate elections, concluding that previously reported estimates of bias in Presidential elections were too extreme by 10%, estimated bias in Senatorial elections was too extreme by 25%, and excess variability estimates were also too large.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disease that starts from mild cognitive impairment and may eventually lead to irreversible memory loss. It is imperative to explore the risk factors associated with the conversion time to AD that is usually right-censored. Classical statistical models like mean regression and Cox models fail to quantify the impact of risk factors across different quantiles of a response distribution, and previous research has primarily focused on modelling a single functional covariate, possibly overlooking the interdependence among multiple functional covariates and other crucial features of the distribution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multivariate functional censored quantile regression model based on dynamic power transformations, which relaxes the global linear assumption and provides more robustness and flexibility. Uniform consistency and weak convergence of the quantile process are established. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches. Real data analysis shows the importance of both left and right hippocampal radial distance curves for predicting the conversion time to AD at different quantile levels.},

We reviewed the conceptual coherence and statistical requirements, focusing on three main steps: correlation analysis at different levels, comparison of the implemented weights, and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Based on the results, we have highlighted features that have improved the statistical requirements of the forthcoming UK Health Index.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the public/private-sector supply of contraceptive methods within countries is vital for effective and sustainable family-planning delivery. However, many low- and middle-income countries quantify contraceptive supply using out-of-date Demographic Health Surveys. As an alternative, we propose using a Bayesian, hierarchical, penalized-spline model, with survey input, to produce annual estimates and projections of contraceptive supply-share outcomes. Our approach shares information across countries, accounts for survey observational errors and produces probabilistic projections informed by past changes in supply shares, as well as correlations between supply-share changes across different contraceptive methods. Results may be used to evaluate family-planning program effectiveness and stability.},

  abstract     = {Nonpharmaceutical policy interventions (NPIs) are intended to reduce population mobility in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. This paper evaluates their effect on population mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. State space models are applied to estimate the time-varying effects of NPI stringency on weekly pedestrian counts from location-based sensors installed before the pandemic. Different models are developed that evaluate compliance with NPIs over time, identify the most effective NPI, and identify regional differences. An efficient parsimonious alternative is proposed for the multivariate Seemingly Unrelated Time Series Equation model if full covariance matrices are of full rank. Kalman filter estimates of the regression coefficients show that NPI stringency initially had a negative effect on population mobility. The effect weakened during the pandemic, suggesting a reduced willingness to comply with regulations. Four of nine NPIs were identified as the most effective. The multivariate model confirmed the findings across federal states. This paper highlights how combining new data sources, routinely collected administrative data, and sound methodology fosters modern policy evaluation.},

This article investigates the applicability of multinomial tree models recently suggested in the literature under a fixed-effects formulation for assessing the accuracy of binary classification tools, where the study specific disease prevalences are taken into account. The model proposed in this article extends previous results to a hierarchical structure accounting for the variability between the studies included in the meta-analysis. Interestingly, by exploiting the parameter separability of the complete likelihood function, the resulting hierarchical multinomial tree model is shown to coincide, in its interest parameter component, with the well-known bivariate random-effects model under an exact within-study distribution for the number of true positives and true negatives subjects. The proposal is in line with a latent-trait approach, where inference follows a frequentist point of view. The applicability of the proposed model and its performance with respect to its fixed-effects counterpart and to the approximate bivariate random-effects model based on normality assumptions commonly used in the literature is evaluated in a series of simulation studies. Methods are applied to a real meta-analysis about the accuracy of the confusion assessment method as delirium screening tool.},

  abstract     = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may suffer from limited scope. In particular, samples may be unrepresentative: some RCTs over- or under-sample individuals with certain characteristics compared to the target population, for which one wants conclusions on treatment effectiveness. Re-weighting trial individuals to match the target population can improve the treatment effect estimation. In this work, we establish the expressions of the bias and variance of such re-weighting procedures—also called inverse propensity of sampling weighting (IPSW)—in presence of categorical covariates for any sample size. Such results allow us to compare the theoretical performance of different versions of IPSW estimates. Besides, our results show how the performance (bias, variance, and quadratic risk) of IPSW estimates depends on the two sample sizes (RCT and target population). A by-product of our work is the proof of consistency of IPSW estimates. In addition, we analyse how including covariates that are not necessary for identifiability of the causal effect may impact the asymptotic variance. Including covariates that are shifted between the two samples but not treatment-effect modifiers increases the variance while non-shifted but treatment-effect modifiers do not. We illustrate all the takeaways in a didactic example, and on a semi-synthetic simulation inspired from critical care medicine.},

As an alternative, we use electronic health records from the Vancouver Island Health Authority, British Columbia, Canada from 2013 to 2022 to identify adults contending with homelessness based on their self-reported housing status. We estimate the annual population size of this population using a flexible open-population capture–recapture model that takes into account (1) the age and gender structure of the population, including aging across detection occasions, (2) annual recruitment into the population, (3) behavioural-response, and (4) apparent survival in the population, including emigration and incorporating known deaths. With this model, we demonstrate how to perform model selection for the inclusion of covariates. We then compare our estimates of annual population size with reported point-in-time counts of homeless populations on Vancouver Island over the same time period, and find that using data extracts from electronic health records gives comparable estimates. We find similarly comparable results using only a subset of interaction data, when using only ER interactions, suggesting that even if cross-continuum data is not available, reasonable estimates of population size can still be found using our method.},

Compared to existing approaches, our model relies more on empirical information than strong structural forms, permitting inference with relatively few assumptions of cumulative infections. We also incorporate a range of political, economic, and social covariates to richly parameterize the relationship between epidemic spread and human behaviour. To show the utility of the model, we provide robust estimates of total infections that account for biases in COVID-19 cases and tests counts in the U.S. from March to July of 2020, a period of time when accurate data about the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was of limited availability. In addition, we can show how sociopolitical factors like the Black Lives Matter protests and support for President Donald Trump are associated with the spread of the virus via changes in fear of the virus and cell phone mobility.

Our study examines vaccine fatigue in the COVID-19 vaccination programme in Scotland. We model the attrition rates across multiple doses with a hierarchical binomial logistic regression model with correlated age- and area-specific random effects with conditional autoregressive priors, where inference uses integrated nested Laplace approximations. We find attrition rates smoothly decrease with increasing age, are much higher for the third dose than the second, and are generally higher for males than females.},

  abstract     = {Studies intended to estimate the effect of a treatment, like randomized trials, may not be sampled from the desired target population. To correct for this discrepancy, estimates can be transported to the target population. Methods for transporting between populations are often premised on a positivity assumption, such that all relevant covariate patterns in one population are also present in the other. However, eligibility criteria, particularly in the case of trials, can result in violations of positivity when transporting to external populations. To address nonpositivity, a synthesis of statistical and mathematical models can be considered. This approach integrates multiple data sources (e.g. trials, observational, pharmacokinetic studies) to estimate treatment effects, leveraging mathematical models to handle positivity violations. This approach was previously demonstrated for positivity violations by a single binary covariate. Here, we extend the synthesis approach for positivity violations with a continuous covariate. For estimation, two novel augmented inverse probability weighting estimators are proposed. Both estimators are contrasted with other common approaches for addressing nonpositivity. Empirical performance is compared via Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the competing approaches are illustrated with an example in the context of two-drug vs. one-drug antiretroviral therapy on CD4 T cell counts among women with HIV.},

This model can be employed, for instance, to forecast air pollution levels through the integration of point data from monitoring stations and areal data derived from satellite imagery. However, if the data present preferential sampling, that is, if the observed point locations are not independent of the underlying spatial process, the inference obtained from models that ignore such a dependence structure may not be valid. In this paper, we present a Bayesian spatial model for the fusion of point and areal data that takes into account preferential sampling. Fast Bayesian inference is performed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation and the stochastic partial differential equation approaches. The performance of the model is assessed using simulated data in a range of scenarios and sampling strategies that can appear in real settings. The model is also applied to predict air pollution in the USA.},

However, most existing cancer risk models incorporate data from epidemiologic studies, which usually cannot represent the target population. While population-based health surveys are ideal for making inference to the target population, they typically do not collect time-to-cancer incidence data. Instead, time-to-cancer specific mortality is often readily available on surveys via linkage to vital statistics. We develop calibrated pseudoweighting methods that integrate individual-level data from a cohort and a survey, and summary statistics of cancer incidence from national cancer registries. By leveraging individual-level cancer mortality data in the survey, the proposed methods impute time-to-cancer incidence for survey sample individuals and use survey calibration with auxiliary variables of influence functions generated from Cox regression to improve robustness and efficiency of the inverse-propensity pseudoweighting method in estimating pure risks. We develop a lung cancer incidence pure risk model from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial using our proposed methods by integrating data from the National Health Interview Survey and cancer registries.},

Integration can be challenging when the current model includes new covariates, leading to potential model misspecification. We present and evaluate seven existing and novel model integration techniques, which employ both likelihood constraints and Bayesian informative priors. Using a simulation study of logistic regression, we quantify how efficiency—assessed by bias and variance—changes with the sample sizes of both historical and current studies and in response to violations to transportability assumptions. We also apply these methods to a case study in which the goal is to use novel predictors to update a risk prediction model for in-hospital mortality among pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Our simulation study and case study suggest that (i) when historical sample size is small, accounting for this statistical uncertainty is more efficient; (ii) all methods lose efficiency when there exist differences between the historical and current data-generating mechanisms; (iii) additional shrinkage to zero can improve efficiency in higher-dimensional settings but at the cost of bias in estimation.},
