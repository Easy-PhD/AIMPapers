  abstract     = {Recent years have seen increasing efforts to forecast infectious disease burdens, with a primary goal being to help public health workers make informed policy decisions. However, there has been only limited discussion of how predominant forecast evaluation metrics might indicate the success of policies based in part on those forecasts. We explore one possible tether between forecasts and policy: the allocation of limited medical resources so as to minimize unmet need. We use probabilistic forecasts of disease burden in each of several regions to determine optimal resource allocations, and then we score forecasts according to how much unmet need their associated allocations would have allowed. We illustrate with forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S., and we find that the forecast skill ranking given by this allocation scoring rule can vary substantially from the ranking given by the weighted interval score. We see this as evidence that the allocation scoring rule detects forecast value that is missed by traditional accuracy measures and that the general strategy of designing scoring rules that are directly linked to policy performance is a promising direction for epidemic forecast evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Societies are intricate systems comprising interdependent social actors interconnected through diverse relationships. It has long been recognized that reciprocity and triadic closure are two fundamental components of this interdependence, and have as such been included in social network models. However, computational limitations and modelling complexity have meant that reciprodicity and triadic closure statistics included in such models have necessarily been simplified. Using novel computational and modelling approaches in relational event analysis, the aim of this paper is to explore a spectrum of endogenous network effect definitions, ranging from straightforward binary variables to complex, temporal functions accounting for the diminishing relevance of past events. Through simulation studies and real-world dataset analyses, it highlights the importance of comprehensively considering temporal dynamics and subtle assumptions in defining network effects. Neglecting these aspects can lead to significant pitfalls in the analysis. Fundamentally, the paper highlights the time-varying nature of reciprocity and triadic closure effects evident in empirical datasets. While exponential decay functions sometimes capture their temporal structure, more complex continuous functions of time often describe the intricate structure of both effects more precisely.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring influenza activity is a key task of public health agencies worldwide. Intensity thresholds serve to retrospectively classify season peak intensity and to compare current influenza activity to past peak values. The resulting classifications into low, medium, high, or very high intensity inform national-level risk assessment and planning. Moreover, they feed into international summary reports. Two common thresholding approaches, recommended in dedicated WHO guidelines, are the moving epidemic method (MEM) and the WHO method. In both approaches, thresholds correspond to quantiles of a normal distribution fitted to a set of historical observations. While an extensive literature on applications of these methods exists, their statistical properties have not been assessed systematically. In this article, we study them analytically and in a simulation study based on re-sampling of French influenza surveillance data. Moreover, extensions to account for small sample sizes and secular trends are described. Under the default settings, both the MEM and WHO method on average classify more seasons than intended as high or very high intensity. Combining characteristics of both and adding a small-sample correction, better-calibrated thresholds can be achieved. Even these, however, have modest sensitivity and positive predictive values. This concerns especially thresholds for very high intensity.},

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the U.S., which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood haematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukaemia and lymphoma.},

  abstract     = {Given the global displacement crisis, the integration of refugees has emerged as a critical policy issue for many host countries. A key challenge involves supporting refugees in learning the language of their host country. While several European nations have instituted publicly funded language training for asylum seekers and refugees soon after their arrival, evidence on the efficacy of these early language programmes in promoting economic integration remains limited. This study examines the impact of a pioneering, large-scale ad hoc programme introduced by German policymakers, which provided basic language training to over 230,000 refugees arriving in 2015–2016. Utilizing register data on the population of asylum seekers and exploiting a cut-off date in programme eligibility, we assess the programme’s effectiveness using a regression discontinuity design. Our findings reveal no discernible effect on refugee employment over the subsequent 2 years. To explore whether language programmes are generally ineffective during refugee crises, we contrast these results with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting, yet smaller-scale programme. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, we find that this programme considerably increased refugee employment. These contrasting findings offer important insights for policymakers on designing effective language training programmes for refugees.},

A direct result from the proposed model is that it leads to a novel out-of-time validation test for aggregated default and delinquency rates. The motivation for the model comes from an analysis of a time series of aggregated US credit card delinquencies, for which the Poisson or binomial distribution cannot be used. The proposed model can also be employed to analyse a time series of the average default probability of a portfolio.},

Our goal is to assess racial disparities in outcomes after EGS treatment using administrative data. We also seek to understand the extent to which differences are attributable to patient-level risk factors vs. hospital-level factors, as well as to the decision to operate on EGS patients. To do so, we develop a class of linear weighting estimators that reweight White patients to have a similar distribution of baseline characteristics to Black patients. This framework nests many common approaches, including matching and linear regression, but offers important advantages over these methods in terms of controlling imbalance between groups, minimizing extrapolation, and reducing computation time. Applying this approach to the claims data, we find that disparities estimates that adjust for the admitting hospital are substantially smaller than estimates that adjust for patient baseline characteristics only, suggesting that hospital-specific factors are important drivers of racial disparities in EGS outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Lombardy, the first region in Italy to be hit by COVID-19 and one of the first in Western countries, was in the spotlight during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 due to its high mortality rates. Simple regional comparisons are, however, hampered by potentially unobservable variables affecting mortality, such as the virus spread. To address this ‘unobserved heterogeneity’ concern, we adopt a Difference in Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design (DiD-GRDD), which compares 2020 vs. 2017–2019 excess mortality in Lombardy’s municipalities close to the administrative borders with neighbouring municipalities in other regions. Our study documents a one to two percentage point higher excess mortality in Lombardy limited to the oldest age group (81+). An exploratory mediation analysis points to the management of nursing homes during the pandemic as a possible critical factor explaining higher mortality in Lombardy.},

  abstract     = {Mobile testing services provide opportunities for active surveillance of infectious diseases for hard-to-reach and/or high-risk individuals who do not know their disease status. Identifying as many infected individuals as possible is important for mitigating disease transmission. Recently, multi-armed bandit sampling approaches have been adapted and applied in this setting to maximize the cumulative number of positive tests collected over time. However, these algorithms have not considered the possibility of variability in the number of tests administered across testing sites. What impact this variability has on the ability of these approaches to maximize yield is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigate this question by extending existing sampling frameworks to directly account for variability in testing volume while also maintaining the computational tractability of the previous methods. Through a simulation study based on human immunodeficiency virus infection characteristics in the Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) as well as an application to COVID-19 testing data in Connecticut, we find improved long- and short-term performances of the new methods compared to several existing approaches. Based on these findings and the ease of computation, we recommend use of the newly developed methods for active surveillance of infectious diseases when variability in testing volume may be present.},

  abstract     = {Comparative effectiveness research frequently employs the instrumental variable design since randomized trials can be infeasible. In this study, we investigate treatments for emergency cholecystitis—inflammation of the gallbladder. A standard treatment for cholecystitis is surgical removal of the gallbladder, while alternative non-surgical treatments include managed care and pharmaceutical options. We use an instrument for operative care: the surgeon’s tendency to operate. Standard instrumental variable estimation methods, however, often rely on parametric models that are prone to bias from model misspecification. Thus, we outline instrumental variable methods based on the doubly robust machine learning framework. These methods enable us to employ machine learning techniques, delivering consistent estimates, and permitting valid inference on various estimands. We use these methods to estimate the primary target estimand in an instrumental variable design. Additionally, we expand these methods to develop new estimators for heterogeneous causal effects, profiling principal strata, and sensitivity analyses for a key instrumental variable assumption. We conduct a simulation to identify scenarios where more flexible estimation methods outperform standard methods. Our findings indicate that operative care is generally more effective for cholecystitis patients, although the benefits of surgery can be less pronounced for key patient subgroups.},

  abstract     = {Exposure to fine particulate matter ( ⁠ PM 2.5 ⁠ ) poses significant health risks and characterizing the shape of the relationship between PM 2.5 and health outcomes has crucial policy implications. Although various statistical methods exist to estimate this exposure–response curve (ERC), few studies have compared their performance under plausible data-generating scenarios. This study compares seven commonly used ERC estimators across 72 exposure–response and confounding scenarios via simulation. Additionally, we apply these methods to estimate the ERC between long-term PM 2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality using data from over 68 million Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. Our simulation indicates that regression methods not placed within a causal inference framework are unsuitable when anticipating heterogeneous exposure effects. Under the setting of a large sample size and unknown ERC functional form, we recommend utilizing causal inference methods that allow for nonlinear ERCs. In our data application, we observe a nonlinear relationship between annual average PM 2.5 and all-cause mortality in the Medicare population, with a sharp increase in relative mortality at low PM 2.5 concentrations. Our findings suggest that stricter limits on PM 2.5 could avert numerous premature deaths. To facilitate the utilization of our results, we provide publicly available, reproducible code on Github for every step of the analysis.},

  abstract     = {South Korea’s educational system has faced criticism for its lack of focus on critical thinking and creativity, resulting in high levels of stress and anxiety among students. As part of the government’s effort to improve the educational system, the innovation school system was introduced in 2009, which aims to develop students’ creativity as well as their non-cognitive skills. To better understand the differences between innovation and regular school systems in South Korea, we propose a novel method that combines the latent space item response model with the Neyman–Scott point process model. Our method accounts for the heterogeneity of items and students, captures relationships between respondents and items, and identifies item and student clusters that can provide a comprehensive understanding of students’ behaviours/perceptions on non-cognitive outcomes. Our analysis reveals that students in the innovation school system show a higher sense of citizenship, while those in the regular school system tend to associate confidence in appearance with social ability. A comparison with exploratory item factor analysis highlights our method’s advantages in terms of uncertainty quantification of the clustering process and more detailed and nuanced clustering results. Our method is made available to an existing R package, lsirm12pl.},

We find that people at lower risk could be recommended an optimal risk-assessment interval of 5 years or more. Time-varying risk factors are required to discriminate between more frequent schedules for high-risk people.},

  abstract     = {The advent of the information age has revolutionized data collection and has led to a rapid expansion of available data sources. Methods of data integration are indispensable when a question of interest cannot be addressed using a single data source. Record linkage (RL) is at the forefront of such data integration efforts. Incentives for sharing linked data for secondary analysis have prompted the need for methodology accounting for possible errors at the RL stage. Mismatch error is a common consequence resulting from the use of nonunique or noisy identifiers at that stage. In this paper, we present a framework to enable valid postlinkage inference in the secondary analysis setting in which only the linked file is given. The proposed framework covers a variety of statistical models and can flexibly incorporate information about the underlying RL process. We propose a mixture model for linked records whose two components reflect distributions conditional on match status, i.e. correct or false match. Regarding inference, we develop a method based on composite likelihood and the expectation-maximization algorithm that is implemented in the R package pldamixture . Extensive simulations and case studies involving contemporary RL applications corroborate the effectiveness of our framework.},

  abstract     = {With the precipitous decline in response rates, researchers and pollsters have been left with highly nonrepresentative samples, relying on constructed weights to make these samples representative of the desired target population. Though practitioners employ valuable expert knowledge to choose what variables X must be adjusted for, they rarely defend particular functional forms relating these variables to the response process or the outcome. Unfortunately, commonly used calibration weights—which make the weighted mean of X in the sample equal that of the population—only ensure correct adjustment when the portion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear functions of X are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency, we describe kernel balancing for population weighting ( kpop ). This approach replaces the design matrix X with a kernel matrix, K encoding high-order information about X ⁠ . Weights are then found to make the weighted average row of K among sampled units approximately equal to that of the target population. This produces good calibration on a wide range of smooth functions of X , without relying on the user to decide which X or what functions of them to include. We describe the method and illustrate it by application to polling data from the 2016 US presidential election.},

Unlike most SES assessment models proposed in the literature, the hierarchical nature of this model enables the use of census observations at the household level without needing to aggregate any information a priori . Therefore, it better accommodates the variability of the SES between census tracts and the number of households per area. The proposed model is used in the estimation of a socio-economic index using 10% of the 2010 Ghana census in the Greater Accra Metropolitan area. Out of the 20 observed variables, the number of people per room, access to water piping and flushable toilets differentiated high and low SES areas the best.},

  abstract     = {Disease surveillance data are used for monitoring and understanding disease burden, which provides valuable information in allocating health programme resources. Statistical methods play an important role in estimating disease burden since disease surveillance systems are prone to undercounting. This paper is motivated by the challenge of estimating mortality associated with respiratory infections (e.g. influenza and COVID-19) that are not ascertained from death certificates. We propose a Bayesian spatial–temporal model incorporating measures of infection activity to estimate excess deaths. Particularly, the inclusion of time-varying coefficients allows us to better characterize associations between infection activity and mortality counts time series. Software to implement this method is available in the R package NBRegAD . Applying our modelling framework to weekly state-wide COVID-19 data in the US from 8 March 2020 to 3 July 2022, we identified temporal and spatial differences in excess deaths between different age groups. We estimated the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the US to be 1,168,481 (95% CI: 1,148,953 1,187,187) compared to the 1,022,147 from using only death certificate information. The analysis also suggests that the most severe undercounting was in the 18–49 years age group with an estimated underascertainment rate of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.25).},

To this end, we propose novel weighting estimators grounded in the causal inference framework. As an alternative framework, Bayesian methods are also discussed. From trial design perspective, operating characteristics including Type I error and power are particularly important and are assessed in our realistic simulation studies representing a variety of practical scenarios. Our proposed weighting estimators achieve significant power gain, while maintaining Type I error close to the nominal value of 0.05. An empirical application of the methods is demonstrated through a Phase III clinical trial in rare disease.},

  abstract     = {Experiments studying get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts estimate causal effects of various mobilization efforts on voter turnout. However, there is often substantial noncompliance in these studies. A usual approach is to use an instrumental variable (IV) analysis to estimate impacts for compliers, here being those actually contacted by the investigators. Unfortunately, popular IV estimators can be unstable in studies with a small fraction of compliers. We explore poststratifying the data (e.g. taking a weighted average of IV estimates within each stratum) using variables that predict complier status (and, potentially, the outcome) to mitigate this. We present the benefits of poststratification in terms of bias, variance, and improved standard error estimates, and provide a finite-sample asymptotic variance formula. We also compare the performance of different IV approaches and discuss the advantages of our design-based poststratification approach over incorporating compliance-predictive covariates into the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator. In the end, we show that covariates predictive of compliance can increase precision, but only if one is willing to make a bias-variance trade-off by down-weighting or dropping strata with few compliers. By contrast, standard approaches such as 2SLS fail to use such information. We finally examine the benefits of our approach in two GOTV applications.},

When the outcomes of the pairwise comparisons have no ties, the paired comparison models can be generalized as a class of binary response models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their corresponding areas under the curves are commonly used as performance metrics to evaluate the discriminating ability of binary response models. Despite their individual wide range of usage and their close connection to binary response models, ROC analysis to our knowledge has never been extended to paired comparison models since the problem of using different objects as the reference in paired comparison models prevents traditional ROC approach from generating unambiguous and interpretable curves. We focus on addressing this problem by proposing two novel methods to construct ROC curves for paired comparison data which provide interpretable statistics and maintain desired asymptotic properties. The methods are then applied and analysed on head-to-head professional sports competition data.},

  abstract     = {Citizen science mobilizes many observers and gathers huge datasets but often without strict sampling protocols, resulting in observation biases due to heterogeneous sampling effort, which can lead to biased predictions. We develop a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical model for bias-corrected estimation of arrival dates of the first migratory bird individuals at their breeding sites. Higher sampling effort could be correlated with earlier observed dates. We implement data fusion of two citizen-science datasets with fundamentally different protocols (Breeding Bird Survey, eBird) and obtain posterior distributions of the latent process, which contains four spatial components endowed with Gaussian process priors: species niche; sampling effort; position and scale parameters of annual first arrival date. The data layer consists of four response variables: counts of observed eBird locations (Poisson); presence–absence at observed eBird locations (Binomial); BBS occurrence counts (Poisson); first arrival dates (generalized extreme-value). We devise a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme and check by simulation that the latent process components are identifiable. We apply our model to several migratory bird species in the northeastern US for 2001–2021 and find that the sampling effort significantly modulates the observed first arrival dates. We exploit this relationship to effectively bias-correct predictions of the true first arrivals.},

  abstract     = {Citizen science databases that consist of volunteer-led sampling efforts of species communities are relied on as essential sources of data in ecology. Summarizing such data across counties with frequentist-valid prediction sets for each county provides an interpretable comparison across counties of varying size or composition. As citizen science data often feature unequal sampling efforts across a spatial domain, prediction sets constructed with indirect methods that share information across counties may be used to improve precision. In this article, we present a nonparametric framework to obtain precise prediction sets for a multinomial random sample based on indirect information that maintain frequentist coverage for each county. We detail a simple algorithm to obtain prediction sets for each county using indirect information where the computation time does not depend on the sample size and scales nicely with the number of species considered. The indirect information may be estimated by a proposed empirical Bayes procedure based on information from auxiliary data. Our approach makes inference for under-sampled counties more precise, while maintaining area-specific frequentist validity for each county. Our method is used to provide a useful description of avian species abundance in North Carolina, USA based on citizen science data from the eBird database.},

  abstract     = {The global decline of biodiversity, driven by habitat degradation and climate breakdown, is a significant concern. Accurate measures of change are crucial to provide reliable evidence of species’ population changes. Meanwhile citizen science data have witnessed a remarkable expansion in both quantity and sources and serve as the foundation for assessing species’ status. The growing data reservoir presents opportunities for novel and improved inference but often comes with computational costs: computational efficiency is paramount, especially as regular analysis updates are necessary. Building upon recent research, we present illustrations of computationally efficient methods for fitting new models, applied to three major citizen science data sets for butterflies. We extend a method for modelling abundance changes of seasonal organisms, firstly to accommodate multiple years of count data efficiently, and secondly for application to counts from a snapshot mass-participation survey. We also present a variational inference approach for fitting occupancy models efficiently to opportunistic citizen science data. The continuous growth of citizen science data offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of how species respond to anthropogenic pressures. Efficient techniques in fitting new models are vital for accurately assessing species’ status, supporting policy-making, setting measurable targets, and enabling effective conservation efforts.},

  abstract     = {The development of appropriate statistical models has lagged behind the ambitions of empirical studies analysing large scientific networks—systems of publications connected by citations and authorship. Extant research typically focuses on either paper citation networks or author collaboration networks. However, these networks involve both direct relationships, as well as broader dependencies between references linked by multiple citation paths. In this work, we extend recently developed relational hyperevent models to analyse networks characterized by complex dependencies across multiple network modes. We introduce new covariates to represent theoretically relevant and empirically plausible mixed-mode network configurations. This model specification allows testing hypotheses that recognize the polyadic nature of publication data, while accounting for multiple dependencies linking authors and references of current and prior papers. We implement the model using open-source software to analyse publicly available data on a large scientific network. Our findings reveal a tendency for subsets of papers to be cocited, indicating that the impact of these papers may be partly due to endogenous network processes. More broadly, the analysis shows that models accounting for both the hyperedge structure of publication events and the interconnections between authors and references significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms driving scientific production and impact.},

  abstract     = {With historic misses in the 2016 and 2020 US Presidential elections, interest in measuring polling errors has increased. The most common method for measuring directional errors and non-sampling excess variability during a postmortem for an election is by assessing the difference between the poll result and election result for polls conducted within a few days of the day of the election. Analysing such polling error data is notoriously difficult with typical models being extremely sensitive to the time between the poll and the election. We leverage hidden Markov models traditionally used for election forecasting to flexibly capture time-varying preferences and treat the election result as a peek at the typically hidden Markovian process. Our results are much less sensitive to the choice of time window, avoid conflating shifting preferences with polling error, and are more interpretable despite a highly flexible model. We demonstrate these results with data on polls from the 2004 through 2020 US Presidential elections and 1992 through 2020 US Senate elections, concluding that previously reported estimates of bias in Presidential elections were too extreme by 10%, estimated bias in Senatorial elections was too extreme by 25%, and excess variability estimates were also too large.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disease that starts from mild cognitive impairment and may eventually lead to irreversible memory loss. It is imperative to explore the risk factors associated with the conversion time to AD that is usually right-censored. Classical statistical models like mean regression and Cox models fail to quantify the impact of risk factors across different quantiles of a response distribution, and previous research has primarily focused on modelling a single functional covariate, possibly overlooking the interdependence among multiple functional covariates and other crucial features of the distribution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multivariate functional censored quantile regression model based on dynamic power transformations, which relaxes the global linear assumption and provides more robustness and flexibility. Uniform consistency and weak convergence of the quantile process are established. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches. Real data analysis shows the importance of both left and right hippocampal radial distance curves for predicting the conversion time to AD at different quantile levels.},

State space models are applied to estimate the time-varying effects of NPI stringency on weekly pedestrian counts from location-based sensors installed before the pandemic. Different models are developed that evaluate compliance with NPIs over time, identify the most effective NPI, and identify regional differences. An efficient parsimonious alternative is proposed for the multivariate Seemingly Unrelated Time Series Equation model if full covariance matrices are of full rank. Kalman filter estimates of the regression coefficients show that NPI stringency initially had a negative effect on population mobility. The effect weakened during the pandemic, suggesting a reduced willingness to comply with regulations. Four of nine NPIs were identified as the most effective. The multivariate model confirmed the findings across federal states.

This article investigates the applicability of multinomial tree models recently suggested in the literature under a fixed-effects formulation for assessing the accuracy of binary classification tools, where the study specific disease prevalences are taken into account. The model proposed in this article extends previous results to a hierarchical structure accounting for the variability between the studies included in the meta-analysis. Interestingly, by exploiting the parameter separability of the complete likelihood function, the resulting hierarchical multinomial tree model is shown to coincide, in its interest parameter component, with the well-known bivariate random-effects model under an exact within-study distribution for the number of true positives and true negatives subjects. The proposal is in line with a latent-trait approach, where inference follows a frequentist point of view. The applicability of the proposed model and its performance with respect to its fixed-effects counterpart and to the approximate bivariate random-effects model based on normality assumptions commonly used in the literature is evaluated in a series of simulation studies. Methods are applied to a real meta-analysis about the accuracy of the confusion assessment method as delirium screening tool.},

  abstract     = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may suffer from limited scope. In particular, samples may be unrepresentative: some RCTs over- or under-sample individuals with certain characteristics compared to the target population, for which one wants conclusions on treatment effectiveness. Re-weighting trial individuals to match the target population can improve the treatment effect estimation. In this work, we establish the expressions of the bias and variance of such re-weighting procedures—also called inverse propensity of sampling weighting (IPSW)—in presence of categorical covariates for any sample size. Such results allow us to compare the theoretical performance of different versions of IPSW estimates. Besides, our results show how the performance (bias, variance, and quadratic risk) of IPSW estimates depends on the two sample sizes (RCT and target population). A by-product of our work is the proof of consistency of IPSW estimates. In addition, we analyse how including covariates that are not necessary for identifiability of the causal effect may impact the asymptotic variance. Including covariates that are shifted between the two samples but not treatment-effect modifiers increases the variance while non-shifted but treatment-effect modifiers do not. We illustrate all the takeaways in a didactic example, and on a semi-synthetic simulation inspired from critical care medicine.},

  abstract     = {The majority of attempts to enumerate the homeless population rely on point-in-time or shelter counts, which can be costly and inaccurate. As an alternative, we use electronic health records from the Vancouver Island Health Authority, British Columbia, Canada from 2013 to 2022 to identify adults contending with homelessness based on their self-reported housing status. We estimate the annual population size of this population using a flexible open-population capture–recapture model that takes into account (1) the age and gender structure of the population, including aging across detection occasions, (2) annual recruitment into the population, (3) behavioural-response, and (4) apparent survival in the population, including emigration and incorporating known deaths. With this model, we demonstrate how to perform model selection for the inclusion of covariates. We then compare our estimates of annual population size with reported point-in-time counts of homeless populations on Vancouver Island over the same time period, and find that using data extracts from electronic health records gives comparable estimates. We find similarly comparable results using only a subset of interaction data, when using only ER interactions, suggesting that even if cross-continuum data is not available, reasonable estimates of population size can still be found using our method.},

  abstract     = {We present an original approach for measuring infections as a latent variable and making use of serological and expert surveys to provide ground truth identification during the early pandemic period. Compared to existing approaches, our model relies more on empirical information than strong structural forms, permitting inference with relatively few assumptions of cumulative infections. We also incorporate a range of political, economic, and social covariates to richly parameterize the relationship between epidemic spread and human behaviour. To show the utility of the model, we provide robust estimates of total infections that account for biases in COVID-19 cases and tests counts in the U.S. from March to July of 2020, a period of time when accurate data about the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was of limited availability. In addition, we can show how sociopolitical factors like the Black Lives Matter protests and support for President Donald Trump are associated with the spread of the virus via changes in fear of the virus and cell phone mobility.

In 1958, the philosopher Karl Popper published what he called a paradox that purported to show the foolishness of subjectivist Bayesian inference. In correspondence, Jimmie Savage pointed out what he considered an error in his reasoning, but Popper was unmoved and did not change his example when he reprinted it. It is argued that Popper did not acknowledge that the new subjectivists reasoned with distributions, not simply expected values. Excerpts from Jimmie Savage’s correspondence at the time with Popper and with Allen Wallis highlight the issues involved at this time when Bayesian statisticians were seeking general acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Studies intended to estimate the effect of a treatment, like randomized trials, may not be sampled from the desired target population. To correct for this discrepancy, estimates can be transported to the target population. Methods for transporting between populations are often premised on a positivity assumption, such that all relevant covariate patterns in one population are also present in the other. However, eligibility criteria, particularly in the case of trials, can result in violations of positivity when transporting to external populations. To address nonpositivity, a synthesis of statistical and mathematical models can be considered. This approach integrates multiple data sources (e.g. trials, observational, pharmacokinetic studies) to estimate treatment effects, leveraging mathematical models to handle positivity violations. This approach was previously demonstrated for positivity violations by a single binary covariate. Here, we extend the synthesis approach for positivity violations with a continuous covariate. For estimation, two novel augmented inverse probability weighting estimators are proposed. Both estimators are contrasted with other common approaches for addressing nonpositivity. Empirical performance is compared via Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the competing approaches are illustrated with an example in the context of two-drug vs. one-drug antiretroviral therapy on CD4 T cell counts among women with HIV.},

  abstract     = {Spatially misaligned data can be fused by using a Bayesian melding model that assumes that underlying all observations there is a spatially continuous Gaussian random field. This model can be employed, for instance, to forecast air pollution levels through the integration of point data from monitoring stations and areal data derived from satellite imagery. However, if the data present preferential sampling, that is, if the observed point locations are not independent of the underlying spatial process, the inference obtained from models that ignore such a dependence structure may not be valid. In this paper, we present a Bayesian spatial model for the fusion of point and areal data that takes into account preferential sampling. Fast Bayesian inference is performed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation and the stochastic partial differential equation approaches. The performance of the model is assessed using simulated data in a range of scenarios and sampling strategies that can appear in real settings. The model is also applied to predict air pollution in the USA.},

  abstract     = {Accurate cancer risk estimation is crucial to clinical decision-making, such as identifying high-risk people for screening. However, most existing cancer risk models incorporate data from epidemiologic studies, which usually cannot represent the target population. While population-based health surveys are ideal for making inference to the target population, they typically do not collect time-to-cancer incidence data. Instead, time-to-cancer specific mortality is often readily available on surveys via linkage to vital statistics. We develop calibrated pseudoweighting methods that integrate individual-level data from a cohort and a survey, and summary statistics of cancer incidence from national cancer registries. By leveraging individual-level cancer mortality data in the survey, the proposed methods impute time-to-cancer incidence for survey sample individuals and use survey calibration with auxiliary variables of influence functions generated from Cox regression to improve robustness and efficiency of the inverse-propensity pseudoweighting method in estimating pure risks. We develop a lung cancer incidence pure risk model from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial using our proposed methods by integrating data from the National Health Interview Survey and cancer registries.},

We show how latent variable models can be used for estimating employment proportions in the Italian regions using survey and administrative data, taking into account the deficiencies in the corresponding measurement process and the longitudinal structure of the data. To this purpose, we adopt a mixture of hidden Markov models, a longitudinal extension of latent class analysis; in the model specification, we consider covariates and unobserved heterogeneity of the latent process among the units of the population. The mixture of hidden Markov model is used to evaluate the accuracy of the available administrative sources, to define their use in the statistical production, and to produce statistics on employment status at both regional and national levels of aggregation of the entire population.},

However, fine resolution geography can be beneficial for characterizing neighbourhoods, especially for relatively rare populations such as immigrants. One way to obtain such information is to link survey records to records in auxiliary databases that include residential addresses by matching on variables common to both files. We present an approach based on probabilistic record linkage that enables matching survey participants in the Chinese Immigrants in Raleigh–Durham Study to records from InfoUSA, an information provider of residential records. The two files use different Chinese name romanization practices, which we address through a novel and generalizable strategy for constructing records’ pairwise comparison vectors for romanized names. Using a fully Bayesian record linkage model, we characterize the geospatial distribution of Chinese immigrants in the Raleigh–Durham area of North Carolina.},

We linked three sources of administrative data on individuals engaging in opiate and/or crack cocaine use (OCU) community treatment; arrests, prison, or probation; and drug-related deaths. We used probabilistic linkage to increase the number of matching records and capture-recapture analysis to estimate the unknown number of individuals not observed in any source. We fitted random effects models to data stratified by source, local authority (LA) area, age, sex, drug type, and injecting. Two-way interactions between sources and explanatory variables were included as fixed effects. We included random effects at the LA level, with random intercepts and random coefficients. The total count of opiate and/ or crack cocaine use in the financial year 2018/19 was estimated at 336,531 [95% confidence interval (CI): 311,932-360,845], corresponding to 9.44 (95% CI: 8.75-10.12) per 1,000 population in England. Three-quarters were men, and the estimate of people currently injecting drugs was 67,715 (95% CI: 64,769-70,526).

Integration can be challenging when the current model includes new covariates, leading to potential model misspecification. We present and evaluate seven existing and novel model integration techniques, which employ both likelihood constraints and Bayesian informative priors. Using a simulation study of logistic regression, we quantify how efficiency—assessed by bias and variance—changes with the sample sizes of both historical and current studies and in response to violations to transportability assumptions. We also apply these methods to a case study in which the goal is to use novel predictors to update a risk prediction model for in-hospital mortality among pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Our simulation study and case study suggest that (i) when historical sample size is small, accounting for this statistical uncertainty is more efficient; (ii) all methods lose efficiency when there exist differences between the historical and current data-generating mechanisms; (iii) additional shrinkage to zero can improve efficiency in higher-dimensional settings but at the cost of bias in estimation.},

The proposed method used a probability sample to reduce the selection bias of estimates obtained from the nonprobability sample in the context of small area estimation and integrated nonprobability and probability samples using a double robust estimator that combined (i) propensity weighting to improve the representativeness of the nonprobability sample and (ii) a statistical model to predict the units that were not in the nonprobability sample. A bootstrap procedure for estimating variance was also proposed. To validate the proposed method, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Results showed that the proposed method allowed the correction of bias from the nonprobability sample while maintaining a good level of estimate reliability.},
