  abstract     = {Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) results from insufficient blood flow to the intestines, leading to tissue necrosis with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is often delayed because of nonspecific symptoms that mimic common gastrointestinal conditions. Current diagnostic methods, such as computed tomography and mesenteric angiography, are complex, costly, and invasive, highlighting the need for a rapid, accessible, and minimally invasive alternative. Here, we present FIREFLI (finding ischemia via reflectance of light), a bioinspired, ingestible capsule designed for luminance-based diagnosis of AMI. Upon ingestion, the device activates in the small intestine’s pH environment, emitting pulses from three radially spaced white light-emitting diodes and measuring reflected light across 10 wavelengths. FIREFLI then computes a tissue luminance biomarker, which outperforms color-change biomarkers because of superior intrasubject consistency. The diagnosis is processed onboard and wirelessly transmitted to an external mobile device. In vivo studies in swine ( n = 9) demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 90%, with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 85%. By providing a noninvasive, real-time diagnostic solution, FIREFLI has the potential to facilitate earlier detection and treatment of AMI, ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

Although bioinspired, tunable optical systems have advanced adaptability and performance, challenges remain in achieving biocompatibility, robust yet flexible construction, and specialized multifunctionality. Here, we present a photoresponsive hydrogel soft lens (PHySL) that combines optical tunability, an all-solid configuration, and high resolution. PHySL leverages a dynamic hydrogel actuator that autonomously harnesses optical energy, enabling substantial focal tuning through all-optical control. Beyond mimicking biological vision, the system achieves advanced functionalities, including focus control, wavefront engineering, and optical steering by responding to spatiotemporal light stimuli. PHySL highlights the potential of optically powered soft robotics applied in soft vision systems, autonomous soft robots, adaptive medical devices, and next-generation wearable systems.},

  abstract     = {Brains evolve within specific sensory and physical environments, yet neuroscience has traditionally focused on studying neural circuits in isolation. Understanding of their function requires integrative brain-body testing in realistic contexts. To investigate the neural and biomechanical mechanisms of sensorimotor transformations, we constructed realistic neuromechanical simulations (simZFish) of the zebrafish optomotor response, a visual stabilization behavior. By computationally reproducing the body mechanics, physical body-water interactions, hydrodynamics, visual environments, and experimentally derived neural network architectures, we closely replicated the behavior of real larval zebrafish. Through systematic manipulation of physiological and circuit connectivity features, impossible in biological experiments, we demonstrate how embodiment shapes neural activity, circuit architecture, and behavior. Changing lens properties and retinal connectivity revealed why the lower posterior visual field drives optimal optomotor responses in the simZFish, explaining receptive field properties observed in real zebrafish. When challenged with novel visual stimuli, the simZFish predicted previously unknown neuronal response types, which we identified via two-photon calcium imaging in the live brains of real zebrafish and incorporated to update the simZFish neural network. In virtual rivers, the simZFish performed rheotaxis autonomously by using current-induced optic flow patterns as navigational cues, compensating for the simulated water flow. Last, experiments with a physical robot (ZBot) validated the role of embodied sensorimotor circuits in maintaining position in a real river with complex fluid dynamics and visual environments. By iterating between simulations, behavioral observations, neural imaging, and robotic testing, we demonstrate the power of integrative approaches to investigating sensorimotor processing, providing insights into embodied neural circuit functions.},

However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a dynamic tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible and tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter-scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. The use of projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate optically driven displays with up to 1511 addressable pixels, several times more pixels than prior tactile displays attaining comparable performance. Perceptual studies confirm that these displays can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical and versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive interventions performed inside brain vessels with the synergistic use of microcatheters pushed over guidewires have revolutionized the way aneurysms, strokes, arteriovenous malformations, brain tumors, and other cerebrovascular conditions are being treated. However, a substantial portion of the brain vasculature remains inaccessible because the conventional catheterization technique based on transmitting forces from the proximal to the distal end of the instruments imposes stringent constraints on their diameter and stiffness. Here, we overcame this mechanical barrier by microengineering ultraminiaturized magnetic microcatheters in the form of an inflatable flat tube, making them ultraflexible and capable of harnessing the kinetic energy of blood flow for endovascular navigation. We introduce a compact and versatile magnetic steering platform that is compatible with conventional biplane fluoroscope imaging and demonstrate safe and effortless navigation and tracking of hard-to-reach, distal, tortuous arteries that are as small as 180 micrometers in diameter with a curvature radius as small as 0.69 millimeters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superselective infusion of contrast and embolic liquid agents, all in a porcine model. These results pave the way to reach, diagnose, and treat currently inaccessible distal arteries that may be at risk of bleeding or feeding a tumor. Our endovascular technology can also be used to selectively target tissues for drug or gene delivery from within the arteries, not only in the central and peripheral nervous systems but also in almost any other organ system, with improved accuracy, speed, and safety.},

  abstract     = {DNA origami nanorobots allow for the rational design of nanomachines that respond to environmental stimuli with preprogrammed tasks. To date, this mostly is achieved by constructing two-state switches that, upon activation, change their conformation, resulting in the performance of an operation. Their applicability is often limited to a single, specific stimulus-output combination because of their intrinsic properties as two-state systems only. This makes expanding them further challenging. Here, we addressed this limitation by introducing reconfigurable DNA origami arrays as networks of coupled two-state systems. This universal design strategy enables the integration of various operational units into any two-state system within the nanorobot, allowing it to process multiple stimuli, compute responses using multilevel Boolean logic, and execute a range of operations with controlled order, timing, and spatial position. We anticipate that this strategy will be instrumental in further developing DNA origami nanorobots for applications in various technological fields.},

In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent miniature systems capable of wireless sensing and manipulation hold considerable promise for advancing biomedical applications. However, the development of these systems has been substantially hindered by sensing-actuation incompatibility at small scales. To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature. Demonstrations in rabbit and porcine models show the potential for robotic feedback control, accurate drug dosing, and in situ physiological monitoring, paving the way for real-world applications of intelligent miniature machines.},

  abstract     = {Dynamics models that predict the effects of physical interactions are essential for planning and control in robotic manipulation. Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic locomotion of legged robots is a critical yet challenging topic in expanding the operational range of mobile robots. It requires precise planning when possible footholds are sparse, robustness against uncertainties and disturbances, and generalizability across diverse terrains. Although traditional model-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle with real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to such uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable areas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by combining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the inherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged locomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of learning-based controllers, this paper proposes an attention-based map encoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network learns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot dynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains. We synthesized behaviors that exhibited robustness against uncertainties while enabling precise and agile traversal of sparse terrains. In addition, our method offers a way to interpret the topographical perception of a neural network. We have trained two controllers for a 12-degrees-of-freedom quadrupedal robot and a 23-degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot and tested the resulting controllers in the real world under various challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios, including ones unseen during training.},

However, surface area has limited the natural powering, communication, functional integration, and self-assembly of smart mass-fabricated modular robotic devices at small scales. We demonstrate the integrated self-folding and self-rolling of functionalized patterned interior and exterior membrane surfaces resulting in programmable, self-assembling, intercommunicating, and self-locomoting micromodules (smartlets ≤ 1 cubic millimeter) with interior chambers for onboard buoyancy control. The microrobotic divers, with 360° solar harvesting rolls, functioned with sufficient ambient power for communication and programmed locomotion in water via electrolysis. The interior folding faces carried rigid microcomponents, including silicon chiplets (Si chiplets) as microprocessors and micro–light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for communication. The exterior faces were able to engage in specific patterned docking interactions between smartlets. The heterogeneous integration is mass producible and affordable through two-dimensional (2D)–automated lithography and microchiplet bump-bonding processes, here shown to be compatible with subsequent autonomous 3D folding and rolling. The robotic modules functioned in natural aqueous environments, and the technology was analyzed as scalable down to microscopic dimensions. Selectively addressed communication with individual smartlets was enhanced via frequency-specific optical signals and enabled precise control, allowing each smartlet to be activated independently within a collective system. The work remodels modular microrobotics closer to the surface-rich modular autonomy of biological cells and provides an economical platform for microscopic applications.},

The latter involves full-body engagement and extensive contact with various body parts beyond just the hands, where the compliance of our skin and muscles plays a crucial role in increasing contact stability and mitigating uncertainty. For robots, synthesizing these contact-rich behaviors has fundamental challenges because of the rapidly growing combinatorics inherent to this amount of contact, making explicit reasoning about all contact interactions intractable. We explore the use of example-guided reinforcement learning to generate robust whole-body skills for the manipulation of large and unwieldy objects. Our method’s effectiveness is demonstrated on Toyota Research Institute’s Punyo robot, a humanoid upper body with highly deformable, pressure-sensing skin. Training was conducted in simulation with only a single example motion per object manipulation task, and policies were easily transferred to hardware owing to domain randomization and the robot’s compliance. The resulting agent can manipulate various everyday objects, such as a water jug and large boxes, in a similar fashion to the example motion. In addition, we show blind dexterous whole-body manipulation, relying solely on proprioceptive and tactile feedback without object pose tracking. Our analysis highlights the critical role of compliance in facilitating whole-body manipulation with humanoid robots.},

  abstract     = {Robotic manipulation remains one of the most difficult challenges in robotics, with approaches ranging from classical model-based control to modern imitation learning. Although these methods have enabled substantial progress, they often require extensive manual design, struggle with performance, and demand large-scale data collection. These limitations hinder their real-world deployment at scale, where reliability, speed, and robustness are essential. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful alternative by enabling robots to autonomously acquire complex manipulation skills through interaction. However, realizing the full potential of RL in the real world remains challenging because of issues of sample efficiency and safety. We present a human-in-the-loop, vision-based RL system that achieved strong performance on a wide range of dexterous manipulation tasks, including precise assembly, dynamic manipulation, and dual-arm coordination. These tasks reflect realistic industrial tolerances, with small but critical variations in initial object placements that demand sophisticated reactive control. Our method integrates demonstrations, human corrections, sample-efficient RL algorithms, and system-level design to directly learn RL policies in the real world. Within 1 to 2.5 hours of real-world training, our approach outperformed other baselines by improving task success by 2×, achieving near-perfect success rates, and executing 1.8× faster on average. Through extensive experiments and analysis, our results suggest that RL can learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope that this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.},

  abstract     = {Exploration of lava caves on the surface of planetary bodies near Earth is of high importance for scientific research and space exploration. The natural shielding that these caves offer against radiation and small meteorites makes them well suited for preserving exobiological signatures and protecting human-made facilities. The use of a robot team arises as the safest and most cost-efficient way to explore extraterrestrial lava caves because they are difficult to access. Although the approach has been demonstrated in similar scenarios on Earth, its adaptation to space conditions needs further research. Here, we define a lava cave exploration mission concept, including four mission phases that are performed by a heterogeneous team of three robots equipped with the required hardware and software. This mission concept was validated in a relevant scenario, a lava cave on Lanzarote island (Spain), where the team of robots was able to build a three-dimensional model of the surrounding area and skylight, introducing a scout rover through rappelling and exploring the inner part of the cave. The results obtained demonstrate the proposed mission concept’s feasibility, including three next-generation planetary exploration rovers that were coordinated to obtain meaningful information about the lava cave’s external and internal morphology.},

  abstract     = {Bronchial foreign body aspiration is a life-threatening condition with a high incidence across diverse populations, requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment. However, the limited availability of skilled practitioners and advanced medical equipment in community clinics and underdeveloped regions underscores the broader challenges in emergency care. Here, we present a cost-effective robotic bronchoscope capable of computed tomography (CT)–free, artificial intelligence (AI)–driven foreign body search and doctor-collaborated removal over long distances via fifth-generation (5G) communication. The system is built around a low-cost (<5000 USD), portable (<2 kilograms) bronchoscope robotic platform equipped with a 3.3-millimeter-diameter catheter and 1-millimeter biopsy forceps designed for safe pulmonary search and foreign body removal. Our AI algorithm, which integrates classical data structures with modern machine learning techniques, enables thorough CT-free lung coverage. The tree structure is leveraged to memorize a compact exploration process and guide the decision-making. Both virtual and physical simulations demonstrate the system’s effective autonomous foreign body search, minimizing bronchial wall contact to reduce patient discomfort. In a remote procedure, a physician in Hangzhou successfully retrieved a foreign body from a live pig located 1500 kilometers away in Chengdu using 5G communication, highlighting effective collaboration of AI, robotics, and human experts. We anticipate that this 5G-enabled, low-cost, AI expert–collaborated robotic platform has notable potential to reduce medical disparities, enhance emergency care, improve patient outcomes, decrease physician workload, and streamline medical procedures through the automation of routine tasks.},

  abstract     = {Research on autonomous surgery has largely focused on simple task automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical applications demand dexterous manipulation over extended durations and robust generalization to the inherent variability of human tissue. These challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or conventional end-to-end learning strategies. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical framework for performing dexterous, long-horizon surgical steps. Our approach uses a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for generating low-level trajectories. The high-level planner plans in language space, generating task-level or corrective instructions that guide the robot through the long-horizon steps and help recover from errors made by the low-level policy. We validated our framework through ex vivo experiments on cholecystectomy, a commonly practiced minimally invasive procedure, and conducted ablation studies to evaluate key components of the system. Our method achieves a 100% success rate across eight different ex vivo gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. The hierarchical approach improved the policy’s ability to recover from suboptimal states that are inevitable in the highly dynamic environment of realistic surgical applications. This work demonstrates step-level autonomy in a surgical procedure, marking a milestone toward clinical deployment of autonomous surgical systems.},

  abstract     = {Surgical robots capable of autonomously performing various tasks could enhance efficiency and augment human productivity in addressing clinical needs. Although current solutions have automated specific actions within defined contexts, they are challenging to generalize across diverse environments in general surgery. Embodied intelligence enables general-purpose robot learning with applications for daily tasks, yet its application in the medical domain remains limited. We introduced an open-source surgical embodied intelligence simulator for an interactive environment to develop reinforcement learning methods for minimally invasive surgical robots. Using such embodied artificial intelligence, this study further addresses surgical task automation, enabling zero-shot transfer of simulation-trained policies to real-world scenarios. The proposed method encompasses visual parsing, a perceptual regressor, policy learning, and a visual servoing controller, forming a paradigm that combines the advantages of data-driven policy and classic controller. The visual parsing uses stereo depth estimation and image segmentation with a visual foundation model to handle complex scenes. Experiments demonstrated autonomy in seven game-based skill training tasks on the da Vinci Research Kit, with a proof-of-concept study on haptic-assisted skill training as a practical application. Moreover, we conducted automation of five surgical assistive tasks with the Sentire surgical system on ex vivo animal tissues with various scenes, object sizes, instrument types, and illuminations. The learned policies were also validated in a live-animal trial for three tasks in dynamic in vivo surgical environments. We hope this open-source infrastructure, coupled with a general-purpose learning paradigm, will inspire and facilitate future research on embodied intelligence toward autonomous surgical robots.},

  abstract     = {Precision agriculture aims to increase crop yield while reducing the use of harmful chemicals, such as pesticides and excess fertilizer, using minimal, tailored interventions. However, these strategies are limited by factors such as sensor quality, which typically relies on visual plant expression, and the manual, destructive nature of many nonvisual measurement methods, including the Scholander pressure bomb. By automating more intimate interactions with foliage in vivo, it would be possible to inject chemical and biological probes that reveal more phenotypes—such as water stress in response to varying environmental conditions and visible gene expression to measure the success of gene engineering applications. To address this, we developed a soft robotic leaf gripper and stamping-injection method to improve foliar delivery of nanoscale synthetic and biological probes. This allows for nondestructive, in situ, multispecies applications. We used two probes: Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the RUBY gene as a reporter system for plant transformation and nanoparticle hydrogels for measuring leaf water potential (ψ). Our hourglass-shaped design enabled the gripper to exert higher forces with reduced radial expansion compared with conventional designs, achieving an injection success rate above 91%. Studies on sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.) and cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) showed that our method achieved an average 12-fold increase in infiltration areas, with substantially less leaf damage—3.6% in sunflower and none in cotton—compared with the needle-free syringe method. Enabling long periods of successful in vivo phenotyping on both species after precise and safe foliar delivery underscores the potential of the leaf gripper for robotic plant bioengineering.},

  abstract     = {Although the field of wearable robotic exoskeletons is rapidly expanding, there are several barriers to entry that discourage many from pursuing research in this area, ultimately hindering growth. Chief among these is the lengthy and costly development process to get an exoskeleton from conception to implementation and the necessity for a broad set of expertise. In addition, many exoskeletons are designed for a specific utility and are confined to the laboratory environment, limiting the flexibility of the designed system to adapt to answer new questions and explore new domains. To address these barriers, we present OpenExo, an open-source modular untethered exoskeleton framework that provides access to all aspects of the design process, including software, electronics, hardware, and control schemes. To demonstrate the utility of this exoskeleton framework, we performed benchtop and experimental validation testing with the system across multiple configurations, including hip-only incline assistance, ankle-only indoor and outdoor assistance, hip-and-ankle load carriage assistance, and elbow-only weightlifting assistance. All aspects of the software architecture, electrical components, hip and Bowden-cable transmission designs, and control schemes are freely available for other researchers to access, use, and modify when looking to address research questions in the field of wearable exoskeletons. Our hope is that OpenExo will accelerate the development and testing of new exoskeleton designs and control schemes while simultaneously encouraging others, including those who would have been turned away from entering the field, to explore new and unique research questions.},

  abstract     = {Microrobotic techniques are promising for treating biofilm infections located deep within the human body. However, the presence of highly viscous pus presents a formidable biological barrier, severely restricting targeted and minimally invasive treatments. In addition, conventional antibacterial agents exhibit limited payload integration with microrobotic systems, further compromising therapeutic efficiency. In this study, we propose a photocatalytic microrobot through a magnetically guided, optical fiber–assisted therapeutic platform specifically designed to treat bacterial infections in deep mucosal cavities. The microrobots comprising copper (Cu) single atom–doped bismuth oxoiodide (BiOI), termed CBMRs, can be guided and tracked by real-time x-ray imaging. Under external magnetic actuation, the illuminated region from the magnetically guided optical fiber synchronously follows the CBMR swarm, enabling effective antibacterial action at targeted infection sites. Upon continuous visible-light irradiation, the resultant photothermal effect substantially reduces the viscosity of pus on inflamed mucosal tissues, enhancing the penetration capability of the CBMR swarm by more than threefold compared with baseline conditions. Concurrently, atomic-level design of CBMRs facilitates robust generation of reactive oxygen species, enabling efficient biofilm disruption and reductions in bacterial viability. We validated the effectiveness of this integrated optical fiber–assisted microrobotic platform in a rabbit sinusitis model in vivo, demonstrating its potential for clinically relevant infection therapy.},

  abstract     = {Despite the devastating effects of pressure ulcers (PUs), little is understood about how they can be prevented using alternating-pressure (AP) mattresses. Such mattresses typically aim to minimize the pressures imparted while alternating between different states of pressure to prevent areas of tissue from being persistently occluded of blood flow. In this work, we built an actuator bed to study AP approaches and learned that AP mattresses should aim to increase—not decrease—peak pressures to a certain extent if such areas are to be minimized for effectively preventing PUs. In addition, we learned that such mattresses should aim to increase the difference between their loading and off-loading pressures. We identified optimal parameters from the study and used them to design an AP mattress made of compliant mechanisms that markedly reduce areas of persistent occlusion by exhibiting relatively high peak pressures that are periodically alternated with substantially lower off-loading pressures. The mattress’s performance was characterized and compared against a standard foam pad in its flat and raised configurations. The load required to actuate the mattress from one of its stable states of pressure to the other was also measured.},

Unlike robots, humans excel at pathfinding because of their superior spatial awareness and their ability to leverage experience. Inspired by these observations, we designed a neural network to simulate the intuitive pathfinding abilities of humans, integrating global environmental information and previous experiences to identify feasible pathways. Experiments demonstrated that, unlike traditional algorithms whose efficiency deteriorates in complex settings, the proposed method maintains stable computational performance. To further enhance motion quality, we introduce a numerically stable spatiotemporal trajectory optimizer with a unique bilayer polynomial trajectory representation in flat space. This optimization leverages differential flatness to enhance efficiency and fundamentally eliminates singularities in the original problem, thereby robustly converging to continuous and feasible motion even in complex maneuvering scenarios. Our hierarchical motion planner, validated through large-scale maze experiments, combines front-end path planning with back-end trajectory refinement, achieving robust and efficient navigation. We anticipate that our planner will advance stable navigation for robots in complex environments, thereby propelling the progress of robotic autonomy.},

Visual place recognition, a critical component for navigation, is often hampered by the high resource demands of conventional systems, making them unsuitable for small-scale robotic platforms, which still require accurate long-endurance localization. Although neuromorphic approaches offer potential for greater efficiency, real-time edge deployment remains constrained by the complexity of biorealistic networks. To overcome this challenge, fusion of hardware and algorithms is critical when using this specialized computing paradigm. Here, we demonstrate a neuromorphic localization system that performs competitive place recognition in up to 8 kilometers of traversal using models as small as 180 kilobytes with 44,000 parameters while consuming less than 8% of the energy required by conventional methods. Our system, locational encoding with neuromorphic systems (LENS), integrates spiking neural networks, an event-based dynamic vision sensor, and a neuromorphic processor within a single SynSense Speck chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient localization on a hexapod robot. When compared with a benchmark place recognition method, sum of absolute differences, LENS performs comparably in overall precision. LENS represents an accurate fully neuromorphic localization system capable of large-scale, on-device deployment for energy-efficient robotic place recognition.

  abstract     = {Force-sensing capabilities are essential for robot manipulation systems. However, commonly used wrist-mounted force/torque sensors are heavy, fragile, and expensive, and tactile sensors require adding fragile circuitry to the robot fingers while only providing force information local to the contact. Here, we present a vision-based contact force estimator that serves as a more cost-effective and easier-to-implement alternative to existing force sensors by leveraging deformations of compliant hands upon contacts when compliant hands are in use. Our approach uses an estimator that visually observes a specialized compliant robot hand (available open source with easy fabrication through 3D printing) and predicts the contact force on the basis of its elastic deformation upon external forces. Because using wrist-mounted cameras to observe the gripper is common for robot manipulation systems, our method can obtain additional force information provided that the gripper is compliant. We optimized our compliant hand to minimize friction and avoid singularities in finger configurations, and we introduced memory to the estimator to combat the partial observability of the contact forces from the remaining friction and hysteresis. In addition, the estimator was made robust to background distractions and finger occlusions using vision foundation models to segment out the fingers. Although it is less accurate and slower than commercial force/torque sensors, we experimentally demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of our estimator (achieving between 0.2 newton and 0.4 newton error) and its utility during a variety of manipulation tasks using the gripper in the presence of noisy backgrounds and occlusions.},

Artificial technologies using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) can emulate these biological functions but present numerous challenges in fabrication, delamination due to soft-rigid interfaces, and electrical interference. To address these difficulties, we present a single-layer multimodal sensory skin made using only a highly sensitive hydrogel membrane. Using electrical impedance tomography techniques, we accessed up to 863,040 conductive pathways across the membrane, allowing us to identify at least six distinct types of multimodal stimuli, including human touch, damage, multipoint insulated presses, and local heating. Through comprehensive physical testing, we demonstrate that the highly redundant and coupled sensory information from these pathways can be structured using data-driven techniques, selecting which pathways should be monitored for efficient multimodal perception. To demonstrate our approach’s versatility, we cast the hydrogel into the shape and size of an adult human hand. Using our information structuring strategy, we demonstrate the hand’s ability to predict environmental conditions, localize human touch, and generate proprioceptive data. Our framework addresses the challenge of physically extracting meaningful information in multimodal soft sensing, opening new directions for the information-led design of single-layer skins in sensitive systems.},

Across the paleontological record and animal kingdom, we see a wide range of alternative hand and actuation designs. Understanding the morphological design space and the resulting emergent behaviors can not only aid our understanding of dexterous manipulation and its evolution but also assist with design optimization, achieving and ultimately surpassing human capabilities. Exploration of hand embodiment has, to date, been limited by challenges of accessibility in customizable hands in the real world and by the reality gap in simulation of complex interactions. We introduce an open parametric design that integrates techniques for simplified customization, fabrication, and control with design features to maximize behavioral diversity. Nonlinear rolling joints, anatomical tendon routing, and a low–degree-of-freedom modulating actuation system enable rapid production of single-piece 3D-printable hands without compromising dexterous behaviors. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the low-level behavior range and stability of the design, showing variable stiffness over two orders of magnitude. In addition, we fabricated three hand designs: human, mirrored human with two thumbs, and aye-aye hands. Manipulation tests evaluated the variation in each hand’s proficiency at handling diverse objects and demonstrated emergent behaviors unique to each design. Overall, we introduce diverse designs for robotic hands, provide a design space to compare and contrast different hand morphologies and structural configurations, and share a practical and open-source design for investigating embodied manipulation.},

  abstract     = {High-speed legged navigation in discrete and geometrically complex environments is a challenging task because of the high–degree-of-freedom dynamics and long-horizon, nonconvex nature of the optimization problem. In this work, we propose a hierarchical navigation pipeline for legged robots that can traverse such environments at high speed. The proposed pipeline consists of a planner and tracker module. The planner module finds physically feasible foothold plans by sampling-based optimization with fast sequential filtering using heuristics and a neural network. Subsequently, rollouts are performed in a physics simulation to identify the best foothold plan regarding the engineered cost function and to confirm its physical consistency. This hierarchical planning module is computationally efficient and physically accurate at the same time. The tracker aims to accurately step on the target footholds from the planning module. During the training stage, the foothold target distribution is given by a generative model that is trained competitively with the tracker. This process ensures that the tracker is trained in an environment with the desired difficulty. The resulting tracker can overcome terrains that are more difficult than what the previous methods could manage. We demonstrated our approach using Raibo, our in-house dynamic quadruped robot.

To realize autonomous physical intelligence (API) capable of self-regulated sensing, decision-making, and actuation, a promising approach is creating nonlinear time-lag feedback embedded within materials, where a constant stimulus elicits delayed responses to enable autonomous motion. This Review explores such feedback mechanisms, traces the evolution of physically intelligent robots, outlines strategies for embedding API in soft robots under diverse environments, and further discusses challenges and future directions beyond simple locomotion.},

Here, we take inspiration from the hierarchical intelligence of the octopus and demonstrate how, by exploiting the fluidic energy and information capacity of simple suction cups, soft computational elements, and soft actuators, we can mimic key aspects of the neuromuscular structure of the octopus in soft robotic systems. The presented suction intelligence works at two levels: By coupling suction flow with local fluidic circuitry, soft robots can achieve octopus-like low-level embodied intelligence, including gently grasping delicate objects, adaptive curling, and encapsulating objects of unknown geometries, and by decoding the pressure response from a suction cup, robots can achieve multimodal high-level perception, including contact detection, classification of an environmental medium and surface roughness, and prediction of an interactive pulling force. As in octopuses, suction intelligence executes most of its computation within lower-level local fluidic circuitries, and minimum information is transmitted to the high-level decision-making of the “brain.” This development provides insights into octopus-inspired machine intelligence through low-cost, simple, and easy-to-integrate methods. The presented suction intelligence can be readily integrated into fluidic-driven soft robots to enhance their intelligence and reduce their computational requirement and can be applied widely, from industrial object handling and robotic manufacturing to robot-assisted harvesting and interventional health care.},

  abstract     = {Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is a high-priority target for space exploration because of its potential to harbor life. A landed mission concept to collect and analyze samples for signs of life was developed over the past decade. Operationally, a critical challenge for such a mission is that the surface environment at the spatial scale of the lander is not well known, requiring that such a mission be capable of acquiring samples in a wide range of surface conditions. Furthermore, the 85.2-hour orbit of Europa around Jupiter limits direct-to-Earth communications to half the orbital period. Last, power constraints and charged-particle irradiation could limit the lifetime of such a mission to several months. This article describes an effort to develop sampling hardware and autonomous software to enable such a Europa surface mission. This multiyear effort leveraged development across multiple simulation and test-bed venues, culminating in a field campaign on the Matanuska Glacier, Alaska, USA, where a cross-disciplinary team demonstrated autonomous end-to-end sampling activities with representative lander hardware.},

  abstract     = {Revealing the evolved mechanisms that give rise to collective behavior is a central objective in the study of cellular and organismal systems. In addition, understanding the algorithmic basis of social interactions in a causal and quantitative way offers an important foundation for subsequently quantifying social deficits. Here, with virtual reality technology, we used virtual robot fish to reverse engineer the sensory-motor control of social response during schooling in a vertebrate model: juvenile zebrafish ( Danio rerio ). In addition to providing a highly controlled means to understand how zebrafish translate visual input into movement decisions, networking our systems allowed real fish to swim and interact together in the same virtual world. Thus, we were able to directly test models of social interactions in situ. A key feature of social response is shown to be single- and multitarget-oriented pursuit. This is based on an egocentric representation of the positional information of conspecifics and is highly robust to incomplete sensory input. We demonstrated, including with a Turing test and a scalability test for pursuit behavior, that all key features of this behavior are accounted for by individuals following a simple experimentally derived proportional derivative control law, which we termed “BioPD.” Because target pursuit is key to effective control of autonomous vehicles, we evaluated—as a proof of principle—the potential use of this simple evolved control law for human-engineered systems. In doing so, we found close-to-optimal pursuit performance in autonomous vehicle (terrestrial, airborne, and watercraft) pursuit while requiring limited system-specific tuning or optimization.},

  abstract     = {Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) exhibit a bending-elastic instability, or kink, before becoming airborne, a feature previously hypothesized but not substantiated to enhance jumping performance. Here, we provide the evidence that this kink is crucial for improving launch performance. We demonstrate that EPNs actively modulate their aspect ratio, forming a liquid-latched α-shaped loop over a slow timescale O (1 second), and then rapidly open it O (10 microseconds), achieving heights of 20 body lengths and generating power of ∼10 4 watts per kilogram. Using a bioinspired physical model [termed the soft jumping model (SoftJM)], we explored the mechanisms and implications of this kink. EPNs control their takeoff direction by adjusting their head position and center of mass, a mechanism verified through phase maps of jump directions in numerical simulations and SoftJM experiments. Our findings reveal that the reversible kink instability at the point of highest curvature on the ventral side enhances energy storage using the nematode’s limited muscular force. We investigated the effect of the aspect ratio on kink instability and jumping performance using SoftJM and quantified EPN cuticle stiffness with atomic force microscopy measurements, comparing these findings with those of Caenorhabditis elegans . This investigation led to a stiffness-modified SoftJM design with a carbon fiber backbone, achieving jumps of ∼25 body lengths. Our study reveals how harnessing kink instabilities, a typical failure mode, enables bidirectional jumping in soft robots on complex substrates like sand, offering an approach for designing limbless robots for controlled jumping, locomotion, and even planetary exploration.},

Landing behaviors of insects are diverse, with some using more controlled flight approaches to landing, whereas others dampen collision impacts with parts of their bodies. The landing approaches of real insects inspired our current work, where we present a combined mechanical and control approach to achieving safe and accurate landings for flapping-wing microaerial vehicles. For the mechanical approach to landing, we took inspiration from the legs of the crane fly, designing lossy compliant legs that maximize energy dissipation during surface collisions. We explored three features in the compliant leg design: leg stance, number of joints, and joint placement. For the control approach to landing, the challenge lies in overcoming the aerodynamic ground effect near the surface. Leveraging the compliant leg design during impact, we designed the preimpact behavior, drawing inspiration from insect landing trajectories, to increase landing success. The proposed controlled landing sequence includes an initial acceleration from hovering, followed by deceleration toward the target, ending with a nonzero impact velocity, similar to what is observed in insects. Last, using an insect-scale flapping-wing aerial microrobot platform (Harvard RoboBee), we verified the controlled, safe, and accurate landing on natural terrain.},

As such, this study introduces a comprehensive system that enables drones to generate and execute sophisticated aerobatic maneuvers in complex environments with dense obstacle distributions. A universal representation is proposed, succinctly capturing flight as a series of discrete aerobatic intentions. These intentions consist of topology and attitude changes, which can be combined in various ways to describe intricate flight maneuvers. A spatial-temporal joint optimization trajectory planner is also introduced to generate dynamically feasible trajectories that are as smooth as possible and devoid of collisions. In addition, we investigate unique yaw sensitivity issues in aerobatic flight and identify the inherent influence of differential flatness singularities on yaw rotations while avoiding associated dynamics issues. A series of ablation studies confirmed the necessity of these spatial-temporal joint optimization and yaw compensation strategies. Additional simulations and physical experiments validated the stability and feasibility of our proposed system for improving uncrewed aerial flight. The proposed system enables drones to autonomously achieve flight performance usually reserved for professional pilots, unlocking boundless potential for aerobatic flight evolution in uncrewed aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Torque and continuous rotation are fundamental methods of actuation and manipulation in rigid robots. Soft robot arms use soft materials and structures to mimic the passive compliance of biological arms that bend and extend. This use of compliance prevents soft arms from continuously transmitting and exerting torques to interact with their environment. Here, we show how relying on patterning structures instead of inherent material properties allows soft robotic arms to remain compliant while continuously transmitting torque to their environment. We demonstrate a soft robotic arm made from a pair of mechanical metamaterials that act as compliant constant-velocity joints. The joints are up to 52 times stiffer in torsion than bending and can bend up to 45°. This robot arm continuously transmits torque while remaining flexible in all other directions. The arm’s mechanical design achieves high motion repeatability (0.4 millimeters and 0.1°) when tracking trajectories. We then trained a neural network to learn the inverse kinematics, enabling us to program the arm to complete tasks that are challenging for existing soft robots, such as installing light bulbs, fastening bolts, and turning valves. The arm’s passive compliance makes it safe around humans and provides a source of mechanical intelligence, enabling it to adapt to misalignment when manipulating objects. This work will bridge the gap between hard and soft robotics with applications in human assistance, warehouse automation, and extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic fields enable remote manipulation of objects and are ideal for medical applications because they pass through human tissue harmlessly. This capability is promising for surgical robots, allowing navigation deeper into the human anatomy and accessing organs beyond the reach of current technologies. However, magnetic manipulation is typically limited to a maximum two–degrees-of-freedom orientation, restricting complex motions, especially those including rolling around the main axis of the magnetic robot. To address this challenge, we introduce a robot design inspired by embodied intelligence and the unique geometry of developable rollers, leveraging the oloid shape. The oloid, with its axial asymmetry and sinusoidal motion, facilitates rolling when precisely controlled by an external magnetic field. We present a versatile closed-loop control model to ensure precise magnetic manipulation of an oloid-shaped robot. This capability was validated in endoluminal applications through the integration of a 28-megahertz micro-ultrasound array to perform virtual biopsies, noninvasive real-time histological imaging. Extensive in vitro and in vivo tests using a porcine model showed the robot’s ability to execute sweeping motions, identify lesions, and generate detailed three-dimensional scans of gastrointestinal subsurface tissue. This research not only restores a critical movement capability to magnetic medical robots but also enables additional clinical applications deep within the human body.},

  abstract     = {Locomotors traversing arboreal environments must often leap across large gaps to land on small-diameter supports. Balancing these dynamic landings is challenging because of high incident momentum, restricted foothold options, and reduced capacity to produce reaction torques on narrow supports. We hypothesized that leg length control to enhance branch reaction control authority would markedly expand the range of successful landing conditions, drawing on the same powerful leg actuation required for leaping. Exploring this balance strategy, the monopedal robot Salto-1P demonstrates branch-to-branch leaps, including some upright balanced landings, despite negligible grasping torque. We also compared this landing strategy with the landings of squirrels, which similarly lack the grip strength found in other arboreal species. We demonstrate that greater radial force control reduces the inertial body torque and/or grasping torque at the support required to balance a given landing. Adding simple radial force balance control strategies to conventional balance controllers greatly expands potential landing conditions, increasing the range of initial angular momentum that can be balanced by 230 and 470% across ranges of landing angles for low-order models of the robot and squirrel, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Research on miniature deep-sea robots is an emerging field focused on the development of deployable, compact devices capable of interacting with the unique environments and organisms of the deep ocean. In this study, we present a design strategy for a centimeter-scale deep-sea soft actuator, weighing 16 grams, that incorporates bistable chiral metamaterials and tube-sealed shape memory alloys. According to our design, the increased modulus induced by the hydrostatic pressure was used to achieve a higher snapping velocity of the bistable chiral unit, thus lifting the actuator’s performance. We showed that the actuator can produce undistorted cyclic motions at various depths in the deep sea. Subsequently, we developed an untethered miniature deep-sea robot that is capable of multimodal locomotion by repurposing its legs and fins. To validate the robot’s performance, this miniature robot was deployed from deep-sea crewed submersibles, performing swimming, gliding, morphing, and crawling in the Haima Cold Seep (1380-meter depth) and the Mariana Trench (10,600-meter depth); it was then retrieved by the submersible fully intact. The actuation module design enabled the robot to perform comparably in the Haima Cold Seep and laboratory aquarium conditions (atmospheric pressure). Additionally, we developed a wearable soft gripper based on the same metamaterial design strategy to facilitate safe deep-sea operations, ranging from soft-specimen collection to heavy-object manipulation (~3400-meter depth). This study offers design insights into creating next-generation miniature deep-sea actuators and robots, paving the way for future exploration and interaction with deep-sea ecosystems.},

This neuroprosthesis is device agnostic and designed for seamless implementation by nonexpert users. Preliminary evaluations in participants with paralysis showed that the neuroprosthesis enabled well-organized patterns of muscle activity during robot-assisted walking and cycling. A proof-of-concept study suggested that robot-assisted rehabilitation augmented by the neuroprosthesis promoted sustained neurological improvements. Moreover, the neuroprosthesis augmented recreational walking and cycling activities outdoors. Future clinical trials will have to confirm these findings in a broader population.},

  abstract     = {Operating in the brain for deep-seated tumors or surgical targets for epilepsy is technically demanding and normally requires a large craniotomy with its attendant risk and morbidity. Neuroendoscopic surgery has the potential to reduce risk and morbidity by permitting surgical access through a small incision with burr hole and a narrow corridor through the brain. However, current endoscopic neurosurgical tools are straight and rigid and lack dexterity, hindering their adoption for neuroendoscopic procedures. We propose a class of robotic neurosurgical tools that have magnetically actuated wristed end effectors small enough to fit through a neuroendoscope working channel. The tools were less than 3.2 millimeters in overall diameter and contained embedded permanent magnets that allowed wireless actuation with magnetic fields. Three magnetic tools are presented: a two–degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) wristed gripper, a one-DoF pivoting scalpel, and a one-DoF twisted string–actuated forceps. This work evaluated the feasibility of these tools for completing minimally invasive neurosurgical resection and cutting tasks. Experimental tests on a silicone brain phantom showed that the tools could reach the ventricle area for simulated tumor removal and access a section of the corpus callosotomy for a simulated tissue-severing procedure in epilepsy treatment. Integration of the magnetic end effectors with a concentric tube robot as a hybrid steerable surgical robotic system enabled in vivo experiments on piglets. These experiments show that wireless magnetic tools could perform essential neurosurgical tasks, including gripping, cutting, and biopsy on living brain tissue, suggesting their potential for clinical applications.},

This study explores the potential of social robots as conversational catalysts in human-human dyadic interaction, focusing on enhancing high-quality, reciprocal conversations between parents and children during dialogic coreading activities. With the increasing prevalence of social robots in homes and the recognized importance of parent-child exchanges for children’s developmental milestones, this work presents a comprehensive empirical investigation involving more than 70 parent-child dyads over a period of 1 to 2 months. We examined the effects of three robot interaction styles—a passive robot listener, an active robot with a fixed behavior strategy, and an active robot with a strategy-switching mechanism—on parent-child conversational dynamics. Our findings reveal that a robot’s active participation enhances the quality of parent-child dialogic conversations. The influence of robot facilitation varied on the basis of parental English proficiency. Strategy-switching robots provided greater benefits to non–native English–speaking families, whereas dyads with native English–speaking parents benefited more from fixed-strategy robots. Overall, this study highlights the promise of social robots that empower parents in fostering their children’s dialogic development—a contrast with the prevalent design of educational robots that primarily target children. It provides critical insights into the equitable, nuanced design of long-term family-robot interactions at home, especially in supporting diverse family backgrounds.},

To overcome these challenges, here, we demonstrate how machine learning–directed optimization (ML-DO) can be used to inform the design of a biohybrid robot, outperforming other nonlinear optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization, in the selection of high-performance geometries. We show how this approach can be used to maximize the thrust generated by a tissue-engineered mobuliform miniray. This results in devices that can swim at the millimeter scale while more closely preserving natural locomotive scaling laws.

  abstract     = {Cultured muscle tissue serves as a power source in biohybrid robots that demonstrate diverse motions. However, current designs typically only drive simple substrates on a small scale, limiting flexibility and controllability. To address this, we proposed a biohybrid hand with multijointed fingers powered by multiple muscle tissue actuators (MuMuTAs), bundles of thin muscle tissues. The MuMuTA can provide linear actuation with high contractile force (~8 millinewtons) and high contractile length (~4 millimeters), which can be converted into the flexion of multijointed fingers by a cable-driven mechanism. We successfully powered the biohybrid hand achieving individual control of fingers and a variety of motions using different signaling controls. This study showcases the potential of MuMuTAs as a driving source for advanced biohybrid robotics.},

Such environments are often highly unstructured and cluttered with plant matter, animals, and debris, which require robots to move swiftly. We report a fast (5.1 centimeters per second translation and 195 degrees per second rotation), centimeter-scale swimming robot with high maneuverability and autonomous untethered operation. Locomotion is enabled by a pair of soft, millimeter-thin, undulating pectoral fins, in which traveling waves are electrically excited to generate propulsion. The actuators, robot design, and power supply are codesigned to enable high-performance locomotion in a scaled-down system. A single soft electrohydraulic actuator per side generates the traveling wave. A compact and lightweight power supply enables untethered operation, made possible by decreasing the operating voltage of the electrohydraulic actuators to below 500 volts and their power consumption to 35 milliwatts. By an experimental study and by modeling, we determined optimum dimensions and operating conditions across designs and size scales. The robots navigate through narrow spaces and through grassy plants and push objects weighing more than 16 times their body weight. Such robots can allow exploration of complex environments as well as continuous measurement of plant and water parameters for aquafarming.},

  abstract     = {Humans exhibit a particular compliant behavior in interactions with their environment. Facilitated by fast physical reasoning, humans are able to rapidly alter their compliance, enhancing robustness and safety in active environments. Transferring these capabilities to robotics is of utmost importance particularly as major space agencies begin investigating the potential of cooperative robotic teams in space. In this scenario, robots in orbit or on planetary surfaces are meant to support astronauts in exploration, maintenance, and habitat building to reduce costs and risks of space missions. A major challenge for interactive robot teams is establishing the capability to act in and interact with dynamic environments. Analogous to humans, the robot should be not only particularly compliant in case of unexpected collisions with other systems but also able to cooperatively handle objects requiring accurate pose estimation and fast trajectory planning. Here, we show that these challenges can be attenuated through an enhancement of active robot compliance introducing a virtual plastic first-order impedance component. We present how elasto-plastic compliance can be realized via energy-based detection of active environments and how evasive motions can be enabled through adaptive plastic compliance. Two space teleoperation experiments using different robotic assets confirm the potential of the method to enhance robustness in interaction with articulated objects and facilitate robot cooperation. An experiment in a health care facility presents how the same method analogously solidifies robotic interactions in human-robot shared environments by giving the robot a subordinate role.},

  abstract     = {Although legged robots have demonstrated effective mobility in some natural settings, as robot size decreases, obstacles in their environment become challenging to overcome. Small arthropods scale obstacles many times their size through jumps powered by mechanisms that overcome speed and power limitations of muscle alone. The motivation for this study was to explore the marriage of impulsive (jumping) and nonimpulsive (cyclic legged ambulation) behaviors in a centimeter-scale robot. Here, jumping is achieved by striking the ground with a bioinspired appendage connected to a parallel linkage. As the linkage configuration passes through the singularity, a torque reversal occurs whereby elastic energy slowly stored by force-dense velocity-limited shape memory alloy actuators is rapidly released. A passively driven elastic hinge is introduced in the striking arm to mediate ground contact forces and direct jumping. High-speed video recording of the 14-millisecond launch phase reveals previously undocumented takeoff dynamics closely resembling those of springtails. A dynamic model was derived, and an experimentally validated simulation was used to optimize the design of key components. The 2.2-gram, 6.1-centimeter-long mechanism achieved a maximum horizontal jumping distance of 1.4 meters (23 body lengths), surpassing that of similarly sized insects. The mechanism was integrated with an agile quadrupedal microrobot with leg articulation suitable to achieve the ideal jumping posture. The platform demonstrated repeatable directional takeoffs and upright landings, enabling complex maneuvers to overcome obstacles and gaps. Last, we used this bioinspired robot to offer reflection on hypotheses related to springtail jumping behavior.},

Excessive or insufficient indentation of the injection cannula into the retina or motion of the cannula with respect to the retina can result in retinal trauma or incorrect placement of the therapeutic product. Robotic assistance can potentially enable the surgeon to more precisely position the injection cannula and maintain its position for a prolonged period of time. However, head motion is common among patients undergoing eye surgery, complicating subretinal injections, yet it is often not considered in the evaluation of robotic assistance. No prior study has both included head motion during an evaluation of robotic assistance and demonstrated a significant improvement in the ability to perform subretinal injections compared with the manual approach. In a hybrid ex vivo and in situ study in which an enucleated eye was mounted on a human volunteer, we demonstrate that head-mounting a high-precision teleoperated surgical robot to passively reduce undesirable relative motion between the robot and the eye results in a bleb-formation success rate on moving eyes that is significantly higher than the manual success rates reported in the literature even on stationary enucleated eyes.},

  abstract     = {Robotic locomotion has shown substantial advancements, yet robots still lack the versatility and agility shown by animals navigating complex terrains. This limits their applicability in complex environments where they could be highly beneficial. Unlike existing robots that rely on intricate perception systems to construct models of both themselves and their surroundings, a more bioinspired approach leverages reconfiguration to adapt a robot’s morphology to its environment. Although interest in such multimodal, terrain-adaptive robots is increasing, their capacity for morphological reconfiguration often remains confined to specific body parts or comes at the expense of increased system complexity and reduced locomotion efficiency. Our study seeks to enhance robotic locomotion by developing robots that can actively reconfigure their morphology, altering their physical properties and leveraging their adaptability to navigate efficiently in diverse environments. We demonstrate how combining a compliant structure with morphological reconfiguration allowed a robot to transition between flat and spherical forms, enabling autonomous, multimodal locomotion—driving, rolling, and swimming—across complex terrains with minimal sensing. By actively reconfiguring its morphology to adapt physical properties for compliant interactions, the robot enhanced locomotion across rough, diverse environments. Leveraging its adaptability in different locomotion modes to navigate a 4.5-kilometer path across mountainous, aquatic, and urban terrains, the robot outperformed traditional and multimodal robots in terms of versatility, energy efficiency, and robustness. Developing versatile, energy-efficient, compliant robots capable of reconfiguring their morphology could substantially enhance autonomous navigation, opening up broader applications in unstructured environments, from environmental monitoring to disaster response and extraterrestrial exploration.},

  abstract     = {Aerial insects are exceptionally agile and precise owing to their small size and fast neuromotor control. They perform impressive acrobatic maneuvers when evading predators, recovering from wind gust, or landing on moving objects. Flapping-wing propulsion is advantageous for flight agility because it can generate large changes in instantaneous forces and torques. During flapping-wing flight, wings, hinges, and tendons of pterygote insects endure large deformation and high stress hundreds of times each second, highlighting the outstanding flexibility and fatigue resistance of biological structures and materials. In comparison, engineered materials and microscale structures in subgram micro–aerial vehicles (MAVs) exhibit substantially shorter lifespans. Consequently, most subgram MAVs are limited to hovering for less than 10 seconds or following simple trajectories at slow speeds. Here, we developed a 750-milligram flapping-wing MAV that demonstrated substantially improved lifespan, speed, accuracy, and agility. With transmission and hinge designs that reduced off-axis torsional stress and deformation, the robot achieved a 1000-second hovering flight, two orders of magnitude longer than existing subgram MAVs. This robot also performed complex flight trajectories with under 1-centimeter root mean square error and more than 30 centimeters per second average speed. With a lift-to-weight ratio of 2.2 and a maximum ascending speed of 100 centimeters per second, this robot demonstrated double body flips at a rotational rate exceeding that of the fastest aerial insects and larger MAVs. These results highlight insect-like flight endurance, precision, and agility in an at-scale MAV, opening opportunities for future research on sensing and power autonomy.},

  abstract     = {Robots have to adjust their motor behavior to changing environments and variable task requirements to successfully operate in the real world and physically interact with humans. Thus, robotics strives to enable a broad spectrum of adjustable motor behavior, aiming to mimic the human ability to function in unstructured scenarios. In humans, motor behavior arises from the integrative action of the central nervous system and body biomechanics; motion must be understood from a neuromechanics perspective. Nervous regions such as the cerebellum facilitate learning, adaptation, and coordination of our motor responses, ultimately driven by muscle activation. Muscles, in turn, self-stabilize motion through mechanical viscoelasticity. In addition, the agonist-antagonist arrangement of muscles surrounding joints enables cocontraction, which can be regulated to enhance motion accuracy and adapt joint stiffness, thereby providing impedance modulation and broadening the motor repertoire. Here, we propose a control solution that harnesses neuromechanics to enable adjustable robot motor behavior. Our solution integrates a muscle model that replicates mechanical viscoelasticity and cocontraction together with a cerebellar network providing motor adaptation. The resulting cerebello-muscular controller drives the robot through torque commands in a feedback control loop. Changes in cocontraction modify the muscle dynamics, and the cerebellum provides motor adaptation without relying on prior analytical solutions, driving the robot in different motor tasks, including payload perturbations and operation across unknown terrains. Experimental results show that cocontraction modulates robot stiffness, performance accuracy, and robustness against external perturbations. Through cocontraction modulation, our cerebello-muscular torque controller enables a broad spectrum of robot motor behavior.},

  abstract     = {Humans excel at applying learned behavior to unlearned situations. A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.},

  abstract     = {Despite the advances in bionic reconstruction of missing limbs, the control of robotic limbs is still limited and, in most cases, not felt to be as natural by users. In this study, we introduce a control approach that combines robotic design based on postural synergies and neural decoding of synergistic behavior of spinal motoneurons. We developed a soft prosthetic hand with two degrees of actuation that realizes postures in a two-dimensional linear manifold generated by two postural synergies. Through a manipulation task in nine participants without physical impairment, we investigated how to map neural commands to the postural synergies. We found that neural synergies outperformed classic muscle synergies in terms of dimensionality and robustness. Leveraging these findings, we developed an online method to map the decoded neural synergies into continuous control of the two-synergy prosthetic hand, which was tested on 11 participants without physical impairment and three prosthesis users in real-time scenarios. Results demonstrated that combined neural and postural synergies allowed accurate and natural control of coordinated multidigit actions (>90% of the continuous mechanical manifold could be reached). The target hit rate for specific hand postures was higher with neural synergies compared with muscle synergies, with the difference being particularly pronounced for prosthesis users (prosthesis users, 82.5% versus 35.0%; other participants, 79.5% versus 54.5%). This demonstration of codesign of multisynergistic robotic hands and neural decoding algorithms enabled users to achieve natural modular control to span infinite postures across a two-dimensional space and to execute dexterous tasks, including in-hand manipulation, not feasible with other approaches.},

  abstract     = {Snap-through, a rapid transition of a system from an equilibrium state to a nonadjacent equilibrium state, is a valuable design element of soft devices for converting a monolithic stimulus into systematic responses with impulsive motions. A common way to benefit from snap-through is to embody it within structures and materials, such as bistable structures. Torque-reversal mechanisms discovered in nature, which harness snap-through instability via muscular forces, may have comparative advantages. However, the current intricacy of artificial torque-reversal mechanisms, which require sophisticated kinematics/kinetics, constrains design possibilities for soft joints and devices. Here, we harnessed hyperelasticity to implement a torque-reversal mechanism in a soft joint, generating repetitive cilia-like beating motions through an embedded tendon. The developed hyperelastic torque-reversal mechanism (HeTRM) exhibits transient bistability under a specific compressive displacement/force threshold, with snap-through occurring at the point where the transience ends. To validate the effectiveness of this design principle, we explored the functionalities of HeTRM in energy storage and release, dual modes for impulsive and continuous motion, mechanical fuse, and rapid three-dimensional motions, through proof-of-concept soft machines. We expect that this design principle provides insight into incorporating snap-through behavior in soft machines and may aid in understanding the relationship between torque-reversal mechanisms and bistability.},

  abstract     = {Micro air vehicles (MAVs) capable of high-speed autonomous navigation in unknown environments have the potential to improve applications like search and rescue and disaster relief, where timely and safe navigation is critical. However, achieving autonomous, safe, and high-speed MAV navigation faces systematic challenges, necessitating reduced vehicle weight and size for high-speed maneuvering, strong sensing capability for detecting obstacles at a distance, and advanced planning and control algorithms maximizing flight speed while ensuring obstacle avoidance. Here, we present the safety-assured high-speed aerial robot (SUPER), a compact MAV with a 280-millimeter wheelbase and a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 5.0, enabling agile flight in cluttered environments. SUPER uses a lightweight three-dimensional light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor for accurate, long-range obstacle detection. To ensure high-speed flight while maintaining safety, we introduced an efficient planning framework that directly plans trajectories using LIDAR point clouds. In each replanning cycle, two trajectories were generated: one in known free spaces to ensure safety and another in both known and unknown spaces to maximize speed. Compared with baseline methods, this framework reduced failure rates by 35.9 times while flying faster and with half the planning time. In real-world tests, SUPER achieved autonomous flights at speeds exceeding 20 meters per second, successfully avoiding thin obstacles and navigating narrow spaces. SUPER represents a milestone in autonomous MAV systems, bridging the gap from laboratory research to real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {For trained individuals such as athletes and musicians, learning often plateaus after extensive training, known as the “ceiling effect.” One bottleneck to overcome it is having no prior physical experience with the skill to be learned. Here, we challenge this issue by exposing expert pianists to fast and complex finger movements that cannot be performed voluntarily, using a hand exoskeleton robot that can move individual fingers quickly and independently. Although the skill of moving the fingers quickly plateaued through weeks of piano practice, passive exposure to otherwise impossible complex finger movements generated by the exoskeleton robot at a speed faster than the pianists’ fastest one enabled them to play faster. Neither a training for fast but simple finger movements nor one for slow but complex movements with the exoskeleton enhanced the overtrained motor skill. The exoskeleton training with one hand also improved the motor skill of the untrained contralateral hand, demonstrating the intermanual transfer effect. The training altered patterns of coordinated activities across multiple finger muscles during piano playing but not in general motor and somatosensory functions or in anatomical characteristics of the hand (range of motion). Patterns of the multifinger movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left motor cortex were also changed through passive exposure to fast and complex finger movements, which accompanied increased involvement of constituent movement elements characterizing the individuated finger movements. The results demonstrate evidence that somatosensory exposure to an unexperienced motor skill allows surmounting of the ceiling effect in a task-specific but effector-independent manner.},
