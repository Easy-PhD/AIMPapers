  abstract     = {Traditionally, medicine has focused on treating disease after symptoms become apparent. Similarly, in patients with chronic diseases, treatment is usually updated in response to breakthrough symptoms or exacerbations. The rare exception to this approach is diabetes, for which continuous glucose monitors provide real-time information about the patient’s physiological state, allowing for rapid intervention. In a Review, Donnelly et al . discuss other diseases that may be amenable to continuous monitoring, such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders, and the technologies being developed to achieve this approach, such as monitoring of key protein concentrations. Depending on the state of clinical science for specific medical conditions, monitoring may be used to tailor lifestyle modifications, optimize clinical treatment, or advance research into the pathogenesis of various disease types. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Continuous biomarker monitoring is revolutionizing chronic disease management, with glucose monitoring for diabetes as the primary example. Given the success of this approach, a transition to continuous protein monitoring (CPM, a real-time, implantable or wearable technology) could similarly advance precision medicine. In this work, we review state-of-the-art CPM platforms and their prospective clinical impact across both chronic disorders—metabolic, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative—and acute crises, such as sepsis and transplant dysfunction. We also highlight remaining barriers to widespread adoption, including sensor stability, robust machine learning models for live interpretation, and responsible data handling for patient privacy. With continued engineering and clinical validation, emerging biosensor technologies could transform disease management, facilitating earlier interventions and individualizing treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Understanding gene function is often complicated by gene redundancy, in which disrupting a single gene yields no clear phenotype. Zik et al . developed dual-transposon sequencing, a high-throughput method to systematically uncover genetic interactions. This approach uses the Cre-lox system to fuse two DNA barcodes identifying random transposon insertions within a single cell. Sequencing these recombined barcodes enabled parallel fitness assessment of millions of double mutants. Applied to Streptococcus pneumoniae , this revealed functions for previously uncharacterized genes across diverse biological pathways. This method offers a powerful tool to explore the vast genetic “dark matter” in microorganisms. —Di Jiang Gene redundancy complicates systematic characterization of gene function as single-gene deletions may not produce discernible phenotypes. We report dual transposon sequencing (dual Tn-seq), a platform for assaying the fitness of a comprehensive double mutant pool in parallel. Dual Tn-seq couples random barcode transposon site sequencing with the Cre- lox system, enabling deep sampling of 73% of the 1.3 million possible double gene deletions in Streptococcus pneumoniae . The genetic interactions identified span a wide range of biochemical processes, revealing new factors in presumably well-studied pathways, exemplified by a cytidine triphosphate synthase PyrJ. Moreover, this approach should permit further investigation of growth condition–specific genetic interactions. Because dual Tn-seq does not require the construction of a large array of single mutants, it should be readily adaptable to various microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {In eukaryotic cells, transcription and RNA splicing are tightly linked, but how these processes are coordinated remains unclear. Shao et al . found that the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain was not required for recruiting splicing factors during co-transcriptional splicing. Instead, the Pol II subunit RPB9 directly interacted with the splicing factor U2AF1, whereas U2AF2 operated independently. There is thus a dynamic “U2AF cycle” that separates splicing into two phases: an early Pol II–dependent phase and a later Pol II–independent phase. These findings reshape our understanding of how splicing is regulated during transcription, with implications for gene expression and disease mechanisms. —Di Jiang Distinguishing functional splice sites from abundant cryptic sites in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) represents a fundamental challenge in decoding mammalian genomes. We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3′ AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3′ splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.},

Hülse and Ridgwell report model results showing how high rates of organic carbon burial caused by elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate-sensitive phosphorous mineral weathering, and phosphate regeneration from marine sediments can turn warming events into ice ages. The juxtaposition of these conditions might help to explain the origins of past “snowball” climates such as those seen in the Neoproterozoic. —Jesse Smith Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.},

  abstract     = {Like leafcutter ants, fungus-farming termites ( Odontotermes obesus ) form a symbiotic relationship with a fungus ( Termitomyces ) that serves as a stable food source. An unknown feature of this relationship is how the termites prevent the nutritional “combs” they produce from being overtaken by other fungi such as filamentous Pseudoxylaria , which have been observed to overtake combs when termites are experimentally removed. Panchal et al . observed termites removing Pseudoxylaria and covering them with soil boluses, and fully encasing Pseudoxylaria successfully prevented its infection of combs (see the Perspective by Goes and Adams). Further experiments showed that soil boluses are effective because of the fungistatic properties of bacteria associated with the termites, which the termites selectively apply to the “weedy,” but not the crop, fungus. —Bianca Lopez The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.},

  abstract     = {For earthquake warnings, each second counts toward characterizing a fault’s rupture. Ruptures from large earthquakes, particularly those offshore, may have varying speed profiles that can only be resolved by dense arrays. In 2022, Atterholt et al . deployed a distributed acoustic sensing array along a 15-kilometer-long coastal telecommunications fiber with channels every 5 meters (see the Perspective by Brodsky and Ruiz). The array provided a second-by-second recording of the 2024 moment magnitude 7 earthquake offshore of Mendocino, California. Beam-forming analysis of P-wave arrivals showed that 8 seconds after the earthquake, the rupture slowed when it encountered the Mendocino Triple Junction and then jumped to supershear velocity before moving onshore. —Angela Hessler Fault structure and rupture physics are deeply intertwined, and observations of this coupling are critical for understanding earthquake behavior. Rupture propagation is observable at fine scales using dense seismic networks. Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures. Our results also demonstrate the potential for fiber-optic sensing to improve real-time estimation of key parameters for early warning.},

  abstract     = {In some model organisms, starvation is known to induce epigenetic changes that extend the life span of progeny of the hungry parent. Zhang et al . investigated the mechanism of these effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (see the Perspective by Bohnert). Their studies implicated an enzyme, lysosomal lipase-like 4 (LIPL-4), in the process. From there, the authors pieced together parts of a pathway in which increased activity of LIPL-4 activated signaling in intestinal lysosomes led to increased transcription and production of a variant of histone H3.3. Protein-tagging experiments indicated that the histone could be transferred to the germline, where it was modified by a methyltransferase and transmitted to progeny, thus extending their life span. —L. Bryan Ray The epigenome is sensitive to metabolic inputs and is crucial for aging. Lysosomes act as a signaling hub to sense metabolic cues and regulate longevity. We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.},

SRO in metals has been linked to properties of mechanical deformation, and in ceramics has been linked to properties related to diffusion. In semiconductors, the concept of SRO has only rarely been studied beyond theoretical predictions linking SRO to important changes in electronic band structure. Using energy-filtered electron microscopy and complementary simulations, Vogl et al . confirmed the presence of SRO in a germanium-silicon-tin semiconductor and identified the actual atomic structure of the SRO motifs. Their work explores an exciting area for understanding and controlling SRO in semiconductors. —Yury Suleymanov Chemical short-range ordering is expected to be a key factor for tuning the electronic structure of semiconductors. However, experimental evidence of short-range ordering is still lacking due to the challenge of characterizing atomic-scale ordering motifs. Here, we determined the presence of short-range order in a ternary GeSiSn semiconductor system using advanced energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and large-scale atomistic models generated by a machine learning neuroevolution potential of first-principles accuracy. This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets.

They found that camouflage was more beneficial when it was rarely used by prey and in low-light environments, whereas warning coloration was less beneficial in high-predation environments, where competition between predators may motivate them to sample aposematic insects. This comparative analysis helps to explain the distribution and evolution of antipredator coloration. —Bianca Lopez Natural selection has repeatedly led to the evolution of two alternative antipredator color strategies—camouflage to avoid detection and aposematism to advertise unprofitability—but we lack understanding of how ecological context favors one strategy over the other. We conducted a globally replicated predation experiment at 21 sites on six continents to test how predator community, prey community, and visual environment influenced the predation risk of 15,018 artificial paper “moth” prey with cryptic or warning coloration. Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low.

  abstract     = {Understanding the properties of a system requires making measurements of a variable and then using that information to piece together a detailed understanding. As the system becomes more complex, the number of required measurements increases exponentially, placing fundamental limits on obtaining that information using classical means. Liu et al . demonstrated a quantum learning advantage in an optical system using entangled photons as probes to reduce the sampling complexity of the process by more than 11 orders of magnitude compared with classical probes. This result highlights a route to quantum enhanced learning protocols for machine learning and developing quantum technologies. — Ian S. Osborne Recent advances in quantum technologies have demonstrated that quantum systems can outperform classical ones in specific tasks, a concept known as quantum advantage. Although previous efforts have focused on computational speedups, a definitive and provable quantum advantage that is unattainable by any classical system has remained elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a provable photonic quantum advantage by implementing a quantum-enhanced protocol for learning a high-dimensional physical process. Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.},

  abstract     = {It is now well known that there were at one time many Homo lineages. Understanding of the differences among these lineages is largely dependent upon crania that are rare and often damaged and deformed by age. Feng et al . reconstructed the 1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 cranium using an approach that allowed for removal of much of the compression and distortion naturally present in the fossil. In doing so, they found that the cranium contained both primitive and derived traits and concluded that it is representative of the H. longi clade, which is sister to H. sapiens and likely contained the Denisovans. —Sacha Vignieri Diverse forms of Homo coexisted during the Middle Pleistocene. Whether these fossil humans represent different species or clades is debated. The ~1-million-year-old Yunxian 2 fossil from China is important for understanding the cladogenesis of Homo and the origin of Homo sapiens . In this study, we restored and reconstructed the distorted Yunxian 2 cranium using recently introduced technology. The results show that this cranium displays mosaic primitive and derived features. Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification. Yunxian 2 may preserve transitional features close to the origins of the two clades.},

  abstract     = {Many species are declining, with lack of adequate habitat being a primary driver. Providing habitats in human-dominated landscapes is essential for maintaining populations and supporting ecosystem functions such as pollination, but habitat protection targets in such landscapes are poorly defined. Bishop et al . developed a framework to assess habitat needs based on the threshold at which populations respond more to increased habitat quality than quantity. They used a meta-analysis to define habitat quantity thresholds, using floral resources as a proxy for habitat quality, for insect pollinators (bumble bees, solitary bees, butterflies, and hoverflies) in agricultural landscapes. Hoverflies had a much lower threshold because of low habitat quality, and this framework could be adapted to guide targets for other taxa. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes is declining, but evidence-based conservation targets to guide international policies for such landscapes are lacking. We present a framework for informing habitat conservation policies based on the enhancement of habitat quantity and quality and define thresholds of habitat quantity at which it becomes effective to also prioritize habitat quality. We applied this framework to insect pollinators, an important part of agroecosystem biodiversity, by synthesizing 59 studies from 19 countries. Given low habitat quality, hoverflies had the lowest threshold at 6% semi-natural habitat cover, followed by solitary bees (16%), bumble bees (18%), and butterflies (37%). These figures represent minimum habitat thresholds in agricultural landscapes, but when habitat quantity is restricted, marked increases in quality are required to reach similar outcomes.},

  abstract     = {US agencies recently named more than 50 elements, minerals, and materials as being critical to energy production, the economy, and national security. Concerns about supply chain exposure have driven US policies that encourage new domestic mines, production from which would require several decades on average. Investigating a more efficient approach, Holley et al . inventoried the potential endowment of unrecovered critical minerals in active US mines compared with imports. Their assessment suggests that 90% recovery of existing by-products could meet nearly all domestic demand for critical minerals—and even 1% recovery would substantially reduce reliance on imports. —Angela Hessler The United States (US) has sufficient geological endowment in active metal mines to reduce the nation’s dependence on critical mineral imports. Demand is increasing for cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements, tellurium, germanium, and other materials used in energy production, semiconductors, and defense. This study uses a statistical evaluation of new geochemical datasets to quantify the critical minerals that are mined annually in US ores but go unrecovered. Ninety percent recovery of by-products from existing domestic metal mining operations could meet nearly all US critical mineral needs; one percent recovery would substantially reduce import reliance for most elements that we evaluated. Policies and technological advancements can enable by-product recovery, which is a resource-efficient approach to critical mineral supply that reduces waste, impact, and geopolitical risk.},

The authors demonstrate a 10-by-10 combinatorial library synthesis with four enzyme variants, which together cover the full range of products. —Michael A. Funk Enzymatic multicomponent carbon-carbon (C–C) bond–forming reactions for diversity-oriented synthesis remain rare. Using cooperative photobiocatalysis, we developed a stereoselective three-component radical-mediated C–C coupling previously unknown in both organic chemistry and biochemistry. Directed evolution of repurposed pyridoxal decarboxylases enabled full fragment variability in this three-component coupling, giving rise to six classes of valuable products, many of which were inaccessible with other methods, even in a racemic fashion. This enzymatic platform integrates a range of asymmetric catalysis principles, including remote stereocenter construction, stereodivergent catalysis, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, achieving excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol over radical intermediates. The broad substrate scope and complementary specificities of evolved enzyme variants enabled combinatorial library synthesis, affording structurally and stereochemically diverse scaffolds for medicinal chemistry.},

The authors found that the genomic sequences within the same “kinetic domain” came together rapidly (less than 1 minute on average), whereas sequences in distinct kinetic domains took much longer (minutes to hours). The rapid search with kinetic domains is dependent upon the motor protein cohesin, which can pull together distal points faster than diffusion. —Di Jiang Genome function requires regulated genome motion. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we introduce an approach to tile mammalian chromosomes with self-mapping fluorescent labels and track them at ultraresolution. We find that sequences separated by submegabase distances transition to proximity in tens of seconds. This rapid search is dependent on cohesin and is exhibited only within domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, rather than structural boundaries. The genomic separation–dependent scaling of the search time for cis interactions violated predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor-driven folding. We also uncover cohesin-dependent processive motion at 2.7 kilobases per second. Together, these multiscale dynamics reveal the organization of the genome into kinetically associated domains.},

Indeed, using genetic data collected only once to calculate effective population size helped to improve their models over multiple species. Although genetic data can be expensive to collect, the fact that doing so only once improved predictions across several years demonstrates a potential benefit for such efforts in the future. —Corinne Simonti Species population sizes fluctuate over time, and these temporal dynamics play a key role in governing the maintenance of biodiversity. Although modeling approaches have been developed to characterize fluctuations in species abundances, the data required to parameterize these models from scratch are substantial. Here we introduce a new approach to modeling population fluctuations on decadal timescales by relating community-level dynamics to population-level patterns encoded in plant genomes. Using genomic samples taken at a single time point to generate contemporary effective population size estimates in a temperate montane forest, we accurately predict fluctuations across three censuses.

Eder et al . investigated how the position of the Sox2 gene influences activation by its enhancer. By systematically relocating reporter genes around the Sox2 locus, the authors found that Sox2 sits in an optimal “sweet spot” for activation and also restricts its enhancer’s reach. Removing Sox2 broadened and boosted enhancer-driven activation. This means that genes can act as gatekeepers, limiting their enhancers’ influence. Understanding these rules helps to explain gene regulation and may inform future genetic engineering or gene therapy strategies. —Di Jiang Genes are often activated by enhancers located at large genomic distances, and the importance of this positioning is poorly understood. By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into thousands of alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. The confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its ~1-kilobase coding region.

In a Review, Li et al . contrasted the electrochemical behavior of both types of metals when coupled with nonaqueous electrolytes. A key goal was to highlight where knowledge from one group has relevance to the other and where specific problems may arise with only one group or one specific metal, with the aim of guiding the development of next-generation batteries. —Marc S. Lavine Monovalent (lithium, sodium, potassium) and multivalent (magnesium, calcium, aluminum) metal anodes are promising alternatives to graphite anodes for overcoming the performance limitations of lithium-ion batteries. In this Review, we compare and contrast their electrochemical behaviors in nonaqueous electrolytes by discussing their common challenges of irregular metal deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), as well as their differences, which are due to dissimilar surface energies and cation charge densities. General design strategies for electrode, electrolyte, and interphase are proposed to enable horizontally deposited metals with preferred crystallographic orientations and stable SEIs with distinct chemical compositions yet similar structural homogeneity. Finally, we assess the specific advantages and unresolved challenges of each system, providing cross-disciplinary insights to advance high-energy and low-cost metal-anode batteries for next-generation energy storage.},

To look deeper into this, Bryan et al . applied optimal transport to receiver functions at broadband seismic stations for several years before and after the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in California (see the Perspective by Rodriguez Padilla). After the events, seismic waves slowed throughout the crustal column, a sign of both shallow and deep damage. Recovery at shallow depths occurred within months, whereas deep damage persisted for at least several years after rupture. —Angela Hessler Earthquakes abruptly release tectonic stress that builds slowly over time through the coupled evolution of faults and the surrounding crust. Seismic wavespeeds track crustal deformation and stress changes, but typical monitoring methods are most sensitive to shallow depths. Using receiver functions, we tracked rupture-zone wavespeed and anisotropy changes throughout the crust during the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. Shallow coseismic wavespeed reductions recovered within months, whereas a deeper postseismic wavespeed drop persisted without measurable recovery over several years. The deep, persistent wavespeed drop likely reflects accumulating damage driven by postseismic deformation, suggesting two possible scenarios: (i) a slow interseismic recovery where wavespeed and anisotropy track long-term stress evolution; or (ii) permanent deformation of an immature fault zone. Both scenarios affect the dynamics and energy budget of the seismic cycle.},

  abstract     = {Storing hydrogen in the solid state helps to avoid the safety concerns associated with high-pressure gas tanks. However, the widespread application of this method has been limited by the lack of high-performance materials that operate at low temperatures. Hirose et al . explored hydride ion–mediated electrochemical hydrogen storage and identified a promising hydride ion–conducting solid electrolyte from the pseudoternary barium, calcium, sodium hydride system (see the Perspective by O’Hayre and Haile). Its excellent electrochemical stability allows it to be flexibly coupled with various metal-hydride electrodes, and magnesium-hydrogen cells using this electrolyte and a magnesium hydride electrode exhibited a high reversible capacity of 2030 milliampere-hours per gram at a relatively low temperature of 90°C. —Jack Huang Hydrogen absorption and desorption in solids are pivotal reactions involved in batteries and hydrogen storage devices. However, conventional thermodynamic and electrochemical hydrogen storage using high-capacity materials suffers from high hydrogen-desorption temperatures and instability of electrolytes. In this work, we explored electrochemical hydride ion (H – )–driven hydrogen storage and developed a solid electrolyte, anti–α-AgI–type Ba 0.5 Ca 0.35 Na 0.15 H 1.85 , which exhibits excellent H – conductivity and electrochemical stability. This electrolyte is compatible with several metal-hydrogen electrodes, such as titanim hydride and magnesium hydride (MgH 2 ), allowing for high-capacity, reversible hydrogen storage at low temperatures. Specifically, Mg–H 2 cells operating as hydrogen storage devices (Mg + H 2 ⇄ MgH 2 ) achieved a reversible capacity of 2030 milliampere hours per gram at 90°C, offering safe and efficient hydrogen-electricity conversion and hydrogen storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Humans have adapted to many environments, dietary shifts, and conditions. Lea et al . analyzed blood markers and genomes from 367 Turkana individuals in northwest Kenya (see the Perspective by McVay and Goldberg). This group has primarily practiced nomadic pastoralism in an extremely arid environment for the past 5000 to 8000 years, with as much as 80% of their traditional diet being composed of animal products. The authors identified several regions of the genome that appear to be under recent selection, including one near the gene STC1 , which is involved in the kidneys’ response to dehydration. The authors also shared the results with these groups, which may help them be more aware of possible medical complications as some individuals move to urban centers. —Corinne Simonti The Turkana pastoralists of Kenya inhabit arid, water-limited environments and rely largely on livestock for subsistence. Working with Turkana communities, we sequenced 367 whole genomes and identified eight regions with evidence for recent positive selection. One of these regions includes a putative regulatory element for STC1 —a kidney-expressed gene involved in metabolism and the response to dehydration. We show that STC1 is induced by antidiuretic hormone in human cells, is associated with urea levels in the Turkana themselves, and is under strong and recent selection in this population as well as a second East African population, the Daasanach. This work highlights how integrating anthropological and genomic approaches can lead to a new understanding of human physiology with biomedical relevance.},

  abstract     = {An enduring challenge in organic chemistry is the selective synthesis of Z olefins, carbon-carbon double bonds with the largest substituents on each carbon oriented on the same side of the bond axis. Verardi et al . report a method that electrochemically replaces carbon-hydrogen bonds on olefins with sulfonium groups. Surprisingly, one of the groups then underwent elimination in a Z-selective manner. The other group could then be replaced with a versatile range of substituents that preserve the Z geometry. —Jake S. Yeston The stereoselective functionalization of C–H bonds represents a central challenge in modern organic synthesis. Despite decades of innovation in C–H activation chemistry, methods for Z -selective functionalization of alkenes have eluded synthetic practitioners. Terminal alkenes present the biggest challenge for Z -selectivity as they require selective cleavage of the more hindered of two otherwise virtually identical C–H bonds. Herein, we describe the transformation of alkenes into transient 1,2- bis -sulfonium intermediates found to undergo Z -selective elimination, overturning a textbook E2 stereoselectivity rule through stabilizing interactions. We identify paired electrolysis as an enabling strategy to both selectively generate the requisite bis -sulfonium intermediate and drive its rapid elimination in situ. The resultant Z -alkenyl sulfonium linchpins provide access to a wide array of Z -alkene targets from inexpensive feedstocks through robust cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {The maturity of experimental studies of nuclear magnetic resonance and the sophistication with which nuclear spins can be manipulated provided the first demonstration of a quantum computer platform. However, progress stalled early on when it was realized that scaling up was problematic. Stemp et al . now demonstrate direct entanglement between two nuclear spins that are separated by a relatively long distance. Two phosphorus atoms implanted in silicon formed a system comprising two 31 P nuclei and two bound electrons. Control of the exchange interaction between the two electrons resulted in quantum entanglement of the two nuclear spins. The results and scalability of the method are promising for the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers. —Ian S. Osborne The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely on coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. In this work, we demonstrated a two-qubit controlled-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atom binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepared and measured a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 − 5 + 5 % and a concurrence of 0.67 − 0.05 + 0.05 . With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear spin–based quantum computers.},

  abstract     = {Rangelands provide livelihoods for billions of people but are being increasingly degraded. Overgrazing is often cited as a cause of this degradation, but the relative effects of grazing and climate change are poorly understood. Purevjav et al . designed a quasiexperimental study to disentangle the effects of climate and herd size on rangeland primary productivity in Mongolia, where livelihoods depend on rangelands and more than half of these rangelands are considered degraded. Although herd size had a negative effect on productivity, weather effects were much larger, particularly at decadal scales over which herders can adapt to changing conditions. These results suggest that policies limiting herd sizes may affect people without preventing rangeland degradation and support the need to curb climate change to protect ecosystems and livelihoods. —Bianca Lopez Rangelands are Earth’s dominant land type, supporting the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people. Concerns about rangeland degradation typically focus on overgrazing. But climate change may be a greater culprit. Using spatially disaggregated, nationwide data from Mongolia, from 1984 to 2024, we exploited seasonal variation in grazing locations to quasi-experimentally estimate the causal effects of livestock herd size, weather, and climate change on rangeland primary productivity. At interannual frequency, herd size modestly but significantly negatively affects primary productivity, with notable variation across ecological zones. The effects of weather fluctuations are, however, an order of magnitude larger. At the decadal scale, over which herders can adapt to climate change, herd size effects disappear, and temperature effects dominate. In Mongolia, climate change seems to drive most long-term change in rangeland primary productivity.},

In this case, knowledge of position was relaxed, resulting in a sharpening of the velocity distribution function.

Despite progress in ground-state cooling of a levitated solid particle, realizing its nonclassical states has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate quantum squeezing of the motion of a single nanoparticle by rapidly varying its oscillation frequency. We reveal appreciable narrowing of the velocity variance to –4.9 ± 0.1 decibels of that of the ground state using free-expansion measurements.

Although El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are known to suppress total summer rainfall throughout India, we show using observational data spanning 1901 to 2020 that, counterintuitively, they simultaneously intensify extreme daily rainfall. This is partly driven by increases in extreme daily values of convective buoyancy, provided that both the undilute instability of near-surface air and the dilution by mixing with drier air above are considered. El Niño could plausibly drive similar changes in other tropical regions, and our framework could be further applied to changes in hourly extremes, to other internal variability modes, and to forced trends under climate change.},

Whether these categories indicate distinct meanings for the animals remains unknown. The zebra finch, a gregarious songbird, uses ~11 call types that are known to communicate hunger, danger, or social conflict and to establish social contact and bonding. Using auditory discrimination tasks, we show that the birds both discriminate and categorize all the call types in their vocal repertoire. In addition, systematic errors were more frequent between call types used in similar behavioral contexts than could be expected from their acoustic similarity.

They summarized recent findings on these neglected hippocampal regions and related circuits and provided original insights into brain functions relevant to behavior and neurological disorders. These findings extend the role of the hippocampus beyond the classic view. —Mattia Maroso Traditional views of hippocampal function are largely based on the canonical flow of information from the entorhinal cortex through the trisynaptic loop—comprising the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis regions CA3 and CA1—and back to cortex, where the hippocampus plays an important role in transforming relevant information into a usable storage system. This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked. These understudied circuits and nontraditional network dynamics such as dentate spikes have recently begun to yield fresh insights into unconventional circuit computations that extend the repertoire of hippocampal function beyond current models.},

  abstract     = {Transcription factors (TFs) are traditionally categorized as activators or repressors, but this binary distinction oversimplifies their functional roles. In practice, many TFs activate some genes while repressing others, depending on the regulatory context. Parisutham et al . investigated how TF function relates to the basal activity of their target promoters and found a conserved pattern across multiple TFs. Rather than uniformly amplifying or silencing gene expression, TFs often buffer against perturbations, opposing changes in expression levels. This buffering behavior appears to be a general feature of TF regulation, highlighting its central role in maintaining homeostasis of gene expression. —Di Jiang Transcription factors (TFs) may activate or repress gene expression through an interplay of different mechanisms, including RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruitment, exclusion, and initiation. However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.},

At the brain network level, the spatial navigation system, not the ventral visual stream as in primates, exhibited a robust preference for visual objects. At the brain region level, one of the top hits of the ultrasound screen was the postsubiculum, an area with many head direction cells. In recordings from postsubiculum cells in freely moving mice, visual objects boosted the firing rate of head direction cells, with preferred firing directions pointing toward the object, and decreased the firing of cells that encoded other head directions. —Peter Stern Animals use visual objects to guide navigation-related behaviors. However, visual object–preferring areas have yet to be described in the mouse brain, limiting our understanding of how visual objects affect spatial navigation system processing. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we identified brain areas that were preferentially activated by images of objects compared with their scrambled versions. Whereas visual cortex did not show a preference, areas associated with spatial navigation were preferentially activated by visual objects. Electrophysiological recordings in postsubiculum, the cortical head direction (HD) system hub, confirmed a preference for visual objects in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In freely moving animals, visual objects increased firing rates of HD cells aligned with a visual object but decreased activity in HD cells coding for other directions.},

However, this productivity is limited by the relative inefficiency of the primary carbon fixation enzyme Rubisco. Lu et al . introduced an additional metabolic pathway, the malyl-CoA glycerate (McG) cycle, into Arabidopsis thaliana . These plants convert a secondary product of Rubisco activity into acetyl coenzyme A, which can then feed into endogenous lipid synthesis pathways. Plants with the McG cycle had increased lipids, seed yield, and overall biomass. This work provides a proof of concept for enhancing carbon fixation and plant growth without the need to directly alter Rubisco performance. —Madeleine Seale Carbon fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle accounts for the majority of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) uptake from the atmosphere. The CBB cycle generates C3 carbohydrates but is inefficient at producing acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) (C2), which is the universal precursor for synthesizing lipids. In this work, we introduced in Arabidopsis thaliana a new-to-nature CO 2 fixing cycle, malyl-CoA-glycerate (McG) cycle, which together with the CBB cycle forms a dual-cycle CO 2 fixation system. This cycle can fix one additional carbon by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and convert the photorespiration product, glycolate, to acetyl-CoA. Plants with the McG cycle show enhanced protein abundance in their photosystems and enhanced photosystem II efficiency. McG plants had doubled CO 2 fixation rates under atmospheric CO 2 , increased lipid production, pronounced growth enhancement, and tripled the seed yield.},

  abstract     = {The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to play a major role in driving parental behavior. However, its role in early life remains to be fully elucidated. Zelmanoff et al . investigated the role of oxytocin in modulating social behavior in mouse pups during separation and reunion with their mothers (see the Perspective by Bellone). Pups separated from their mothers produced more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, and the effect was modulated by the activity of oxytocin-expressing neurons. Pharmacological and optogenetic inhibition of these neurons attenuated ultrasonic vocalizations, suggesting that oxytocin plays a major role in determining social behavior during development. —Mattia Maroso Oxytocin is essential in shaping social behavior across the lifespan. Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.},

  abstract     = {Land conversion not only reduces the total habitat available to other species, but it also fragments habitat into smaller and less-connected patches, thus supporting smaller and less-connected populations. Ecologists have developed various metrics capturing different aspects of habitat fragmentation, such as the number and size of habitat patches and their distribution across space. Zou et al . used remotely sensed data to quantify the degree of fragmentation of global forests from 2000 to 2020, comparing metrics focused on patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Measures incorporating habitat connectivity and aggregation suggested that more than half of global forests have become more fragmented over the past two decades. These changes suggest widespread forest degradation beyond the direct effects of habitat loss. —Bianca Lopez Habitat fragmentation, in which contiguous forests are broken into smaller, isolated patches, threatens biodiversity by disrupting species movement, shrinking populations, and altering ecosystem dynamics. Past assessments suggested declining global fragmentation, but they relied on structure-based metrics that overlook ecological connectivity. We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%). Aggregation-focused metrics confirmed increases in 57 to 83% of forests. Human activities such as agriculture and logging drive this change. Yet protected tropical areas saw up to an 82% reduction in fragmentation, underscoring the potential of targeted conservation.},

  abstract     = {Introgression has been extensively studied for its potential to introduce adaptive alleles into another population or species. Although hybridization has been historically documented more often in plants, the relative rates of introgression in animals and plants have been difficult to quantify. Monnet et al . examined the relationship of introgression with genetic divergence in 61 animal and 280 plant pairs (see the Perspective by Brandvain). They found that the likelihood of plants hybridizing dropped off after genetic divergence levels of 0.3% in plants (consistent across different plant types) compared with 1.8% in animals. These results suggest that barriers to hybridization may arise more quickly in plants, contrary to historical views. —Corinne Simonti Speciation, the process by which new reproductively isolated species emerge from ancestral populations, results from the gradual accumulation of barriers to gene flow within genomes. To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.},

  abstract     = {Proton transfer is perhaps the most fundamental chemical reaction, underlying numerous more complex transformations in both biochemical and synthetic systems. The process often involves a network of numerous water molecules. To home in on the details in a well-controlled context, Rana et al . studied interconversion of two protonated isomers, or protomers, of 4-aminobenzoic acid in small water clusters. By measuring the kinetics of proton migration between nitrogen and oxygen sites with well-resolved spectroscopic signatures, the authors were able to establish precise benchmarks for future modeling. —Jake S. Yeston Isolated cluster systems can help to elucidate the molecular level description of water-mediated proton transfer. Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + ·(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale. These results quantify the kinetics of proton transfers in the context of a closed, finite system at well-defined internal energies and therefore provide experimental benchmarks for theoretical efforts that are being developed to treat relatively slow, highly cooperative solvent-mediated chemical processes.},

  abstract     = {One could be excused for assuming that wildfires in the western US worsen air quality across the rest of the nation only due to smoke transport, but that would be incorrect. Instead, Ma et al . showed that extreme wildfires in the west actually reduce fine particle concentrations in the eastern US by an amount comparable to the increases that they cause in the west (see the Perspective by Qian). They attributed this unexpected effect to weakened eastward transport of fire smoke and enhanced wet removal of air pollutants caused by heat-induced convection from fires. This mechanism actually reduces deaths and economic losses nationwide. —Jesse Smith Conventional wisdom suggests that wildfires in the western United States (WUS) degrade air quality nationwide as a result of aerosol emissions and eastward transport. However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM 2.5 ) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM 2.5 pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has revealed a worrisome, and seemingly increasing, decline in insect populations globally. That said, not all species have been shown to be declining, and the reasons for the differences are not always clear. Liu et al . looked at ant species, using a community genetics approach, on remote Fijian islands to determine susceptibility to human impacts and disturbance. They found that endemic species and those most sensitive to habitat disturbance began to decline as long as 3000 years ago, with the first arrival of humans. More recent arrivals to the islands display more resistance, likely due to their more generalist requirements. —Sacha Vignieri Insect populations have declined worldwide, but the extent and drivers of these declines are debated. Most studies rely on field surveys performed in the past century, leaving gaps in our understanding of longer-term trends. Using a “community genomics” approach, we estimated community assembly over millions of years and more recent demographic trends of ant species in the Fijian archipelago. We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding. The primary correlate of population decline among endemic species was found to be sensitivity to habitat disturbance. This study demonstrates the value of contemporary collections for estimating long-term community trends and highlights the vulnerability of endemic island species to anthropogenic change.},

Li et al . overcame this challenge by using droplets of water, water-gelatin mixtures, or buffer solutions as a dynamic lubricating layer to enable conformal wrapping of fragile, nonstretchable films onto intricate substrates such as skin, polymers, cells, and nerves. The droplet lets the device slide across the target substrate, allowing it to conform to the underlying shape. The authors demonstrated drop printing onto nerves and brain tissue, enabling light-controlled neuromodulation. —Marc S. Lavine Bioelectronic interfaces demonstrate promising applications in health monitoring, medical treatment, and augmented reality. However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue. The interfaces achieve light-controlled in vivo neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution.},

  abstract     = {Misregulation of members of the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS family leads to cancer and other human diseases. One way in which RAS proteins are regulated is through controlled degradation. The substrate adaptor protein Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1) couples RAS proteins to a ubiquitin ligase, and then ubiquitination leads to their degradation. Mutations in LZTR1 are also associated with human diseases. Dharmaiah et al . used crystal structures to define the interaction of LZTR1-binding domains with various RAS proteins. Their results help to explain the effects of disease-causing mutations in LZTR1 and also provide clues for strategies to develop glue-like therapeutic molecules that could target oncogenic RAS proteins to LZTR1-dependent degradation. —L. Bryan Ray The RAS family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are tightly regulated signaling molecules that are further modulated by ubiquitination and proteolysis. Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1), a substrate adapter of the Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds specific RAS GTPases and promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We present structures of LZTR1 Kelch domains bound to RIT1, MRAS, and KRAS, revealing interfaces that govern RAS isoform selectivity and nucleotide specificity. Biochemical and structural analyses of disease-associated Kelch domain mutations revealed three types of alterations: impaired substrate interaction, loop destabilization, and blade-blade repulsion. In cellular and mouse models, mutations disrupting substrate binding phenocopied LZTR1 loss, underscoring its substrate specificity. These findings define RAS recognition mechanisms by LZTR1 and suggest a molecular glue strategy to degrade oncogenic KRAS.},

The driven-dissipative nature of the system further enriched the spin glass phenomenology. —Jelena Stajic Spin glasses are quintessential examples of complex matter. Although their ordering lacks complete theoretical understanding, abstract models of spin glasses inform problems in other fields, such as combinatorial optimization and artificial intelligence—where they form a mathematical basis for neural network computing. We demonstrate the ability to realize a spin glass of a distinct driven-dissipative and vector form. By microscopically visualizing its glassy spin states, the technique allows us to directly measure replica symmetry breaking and the resulting ultrametric hierarchical structure. Ultrametricity is known to be emergent in models of evolution, protein folding, and climate change; this work shows it to be directly observable in a physically realized system.},

Inhibiting parasite fertilization in mosquitoes prevents malaria parasite transmission from mosquitoes to humans, so transmission-blocking vaccines are important tools for malaria elimination. Using cryo–electron microscopy, Dietrich et al . determined the structure of the Pfs230-Pfs48/45 core fertilization complex isolated from the sexual stages of malaria parasites. This structure provided insight into the domains that are critical for complex formation. The authors demonstrated the importance of these domains using Pfs230 nanobodies and mRNA-lipid nanoparticles that block transmission. The findings may have potential for the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against malaria parasites. —Stella M. Hurtley Malaria parasite fertilization occurs in the midgut of a female Anopheles mosquito. Blocking fertilization within the mosquito can prevent malaria transmission. Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 proteins are critical for male fertility and transmission of the malaria parasite. They form a core fertilization complex, but it is unknown how they interact. We determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex showing that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14. Transgenic parasite lines with these domains removed were defective in Pfs230 gamete localization and showed reduced oocyst formation. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibited Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation and reduced transmission, and structural analyses revealed their epitopes. These Pfs230 domains were targets of naturally acquired immunity and immune sera from messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle immunizations blocked parasite transmission.},

Ngou et al . analyzed thousands of plant pattern recognition receptors and identified distantly related receptors with similar ligand-binding regions that convergently evolved to detect bacterial cold shock proteins. By identifying key features of the protein required for binding and altering critical amino acids, the authors engineered receptor proteins with an expanded repertoire of cold shock proteins. The research demonstrates a pipeline for the discovery and optimization of immune recognition mechanisms by using information from diverse species and systems. —Madeleine Seale Plants deploy a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns to activate immune responses. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subgroup XII (LRR-RLK-XII) represents one of the largest PRR families owing to lineage-specific diversification. Through bioinformatics and synthetic biology approaches, we characterized LRR-RLK-XIIs from 285 plant species and identified a receptor, “SCORE,” that perceives cold shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues. Through functional phylogenomics and protein structure predictions, we engineered SCORE variants capable of detecting multiple phytopathogen CSP peptides, thus revealing the diverse PRR recognition landscape in plants. Our strategy holds promise for engineering plant immune receptors, particularly for perennial crops.},

  abstract     = {Neurogenetics has identified many distinct types of inhibitory interneurons. However, how this interneuron diversity contributes to network functions remains elusive. Valero et al . identified the distinct properties of optogenetically identified pyramidal cells and members of the major interneuron families (see the Perspective by Craig and González-Rueda). These properties include their firing rate statistics in different brain states and their contributions to various population activities. Using the electrophysiological fingerprints of this dataset, the researchers trained a machine learning algorithm to infer the different neuronal types in large-scale recordings and then constructed a connectivity graph of these major cell types through targeted optogenetic stimulations and functional connectivity analysis. These findings highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions between interneuron types in the hippocampal network and demonstrate that such interaction is fundamental for the hippocampal cognitive map. —Peter Stern Identifying the computational roles of different neuron families is crucial for understanding neural networks. Most neural diversity is embodied in various types of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) interneurons, grouped into four major families. We collected datasets of opto-tagged neurons from all four families, along with excitatory neurons, from both the neocortex and hippocampus. The physiological features of these neurons were used to train a machine learning classifier, which subsequently inferred specific interneuron families in large-scale recordings. This combined approach enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity motifs across interneuron family members. We further showed that these motifs differentially control the place field features of pyramidal neurons. Our findings attribute a prominent role to interneurons in the formation of a flexible cognitive map.},

Zhang et al . investigated the relationship between PM 2.5 , an index of particle pollution, and the development of Lewy body dementia (LBD), the second most common form of dementia. Epidemiological data showed that PM 2.5 exposure was associated with an increased risk of developing LBD. In mice, nasal administration of PM 2.5 led to brain atrophy due to the accumulation of pathological α-synuclein, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and impaired cognition and motor function. The results identify a potential mechanistic link between air pollution and the development of dementia. —Mattia Maroso Evidence links air pollution to dementia, yet its role in Lewy body dementia (LBD) remains unclear. In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM 2.5 exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in α-synuclein (αSyn)–deficient mice. PM 2.5 exposure generated a highly pathogenic αSyn strain, PM 2.5 –induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling αSyn LBD strains. PM 2.5 samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant αSyn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM 2.5 -exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM 2.5 ’s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.},

  abstract     = {The gut maintains its health by constantly renewing its inner lining, balancing cell production with the removal of cells through a process called extrusion. Krueger et al . found that extrusion is regulated by mechanical forces between cells. Cells are interconnected in a network that enables them to pull on their neighbors, creating a physical competition in a cellular tug-of-war. This way, cells test their mechanical strength relative to one another, and those that find themselves weaker extrude from the tissue while stronger cells remain. By removing unfit cells, this process safeguards the intestinal barrier and promotes homeostasis. —Stella M. Hurtley Cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.},

Following the transformative impact of single-cell gene expression profiling techniques on numerous fields of human biology, recent years have seen increased application to microbes. We review progress in the development of these techniques and discuss challenges in applying them to microbial communities. We highlight applications for dissecting the microbiome in human health and disease that reveal functional heterogeneity within gut communities, antibiotic responses, and the dynamics of mobile genetic elements.

  abstract     = {As the number of elements in a material increases, the possibility of greater entropic contributions to ordering or disordering also increases. Wyatt et al . synthesized 40 MAX materials (where M is a transition metal, A is a group 13 or 14 element, and X is either C or N) using 2 to 9 M elements. They were able to quantify the impact of entropy versus enthalpy on the resulting structure and properties. Enthalpy-driven short-range order persisted until configurational entropy became sufficiently large to randomize metal configurations. Compositional disorder in the precursor phases directly influenced the surface terminations (–O, –OH, and –F) and electronic properties when converted to MXenes. —Marc S. Lavine In compositionally complex materials, there is controversy on the effect of enthalpy versus entropy on the structure and short-range ordering in so-called high-entropy materials. To help address this controversy, we synthesized and probed 40 M 4 AlC 3 layered carbide phases containing two to nine metals and found that short-range ordering from enthalpy was present until the entropy increased enough to achieve complete disordering of the transition metals in their atomic planes. We transformed all of these layered carbide phases into two-dimensional (2D) sheets and showed the effects of the order versus disorder on their surface properties and electronic behavior. This study suggests the key effect that the competition between enthalpy and entropy has on short-range order in multicompositional materials.},

  abstract     = {The vertebrate “hand” has undergone remarkable transformations, from the flexible tool we humans use to the enormous yet flat fore flipper of a whale. One less-explored component of this limb is the presence of either nails, as in primates, or claws, as in predators and diggers. Missagia et al . looked at different types of rodents, which vary with regard to this feature, some bearing a claw on their “thumb” and others a nail. The researchers concluded that the ancestral condition was the presence of a nail, which facilitated rodents’ well-known dexterous handling of food. Only species that evolved to dig or lost this handling acquired a claw. —Sacha Vignieri The unguis (hoof, claw, or nail) of the first digit (D1, also known as the thumb or pollex) of the tetrapod hand exhibits numerous functional adaptations, but its macroevolutionary association with ecological diversity is unknown. Across Rodentia, we find that most extant genera and ancestral lineages bear D1 nails. Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates. Our study recasts ideas about rodent evolution and uncovers a previously unrecognized contributor to their successful radiation.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of research advances and improved clinical outcomes, cardiovascular disease is still the most common cause of death worldwide. A major cause of mortality after myocardial infarction are arrhythmias resulting from injury to the cardiac muscle. During an ischemic event such as myocardial infarction, neutrophils are recruited to the heart, and Kumowski et al . have uncovered a direct link between these neutrophils and subsequent arrhythmias (see the Perspective by Thorp). Using mouse models supported by human data, the authors determined that resistin-like molecule gamma (RELMγ) is highly expressed in neutrophils after myocardial infarction. In the heart, RELMγ damages the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes, promoting cell death directly and also causing ion leaks that disrupt the heart’s electrical activity and result in arrhythmias. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Ventricular tachycardia disrupts the heart’s coordinated pump function, leading to sudden cardiac death. Neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to the ischemic myocardium, promote these arrhythmias. Comparing neutrophils with macrophages, we found that resistin-like molecule γ ( Retnlg or RELMγ) was the most differentially expressed gene in mouse infarcts. RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specific Retnlg deletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia.},

  abstract     = {Climate change concerns have prompted research into replacing fossil fuel feedstocks with carbon dioxide to produce commodity chemicals such as ethylene. Jin et al . now report a two-step procedure using near-ultraviolet light that first reduces the carbon dioxide to ethane and then uses a previously reported photocatalyst to oxidize the ethane to ethylene (see the Perspective by Cortés). The first step relies on a gold-titania catalyst that appears to activate hydrogen heterolytically upon photoirradiation, leading to highly selective reductive coupling of carbon dioxide. —Jake S. Yeston Producing olefins by carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) hydrogenation is a long-standing goal. The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H 2 ) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H 2 dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H 2 dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO 2 to ethane in >99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in >99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.},

These conditions enabled the formation of carbon-carbon bonds to create a diamond lattice. —Phil Szuromi Diamond and adamantane ( Ad ) share a T d -symmetric carbon skeleton, but converting Ad to diamond has been challenging because it requires selective carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bond cleavage and monomer assembly into a diamond lattice. Our approach differs from the conventional high-temperature, high-pressure diamond syntheses. We electron-irradiated Ad submicrocrystals at 80 to 200 kilo–electron volts and 100 to 296 kelvin in vacuum for tens of seconds. This process yielded defect-free nanodiamonds (NDs) of cubic crystal structure, accompanied by hydrogen gas evolution. Time-resolved transmission electron microscopy revealed the initial formation of Ad oligomers transforming into spherical NDs. A sizable kinetic isotope effect indicates that C–H cleavage was rate-determining, and other hydrocarbons tested failed to form NDs.},

  abstract     = {Although both men and women can develop chronic kidney disease, women of reproductive age appear to be relatively protected. By studying mice and human kidney tissue and urine samples, Conte et al . determined that renal progenitor cells are responsive to female sex hormones, showing increased proliferation and differentiation into kidney podocytes in response to estrogen and progesterone at physiologically relevant concentrations. The same phenomenon played a key role in pregnancy-induced expansion of the podocyte population to accommodate the increased workload on the kidneys. Conversely, a failure of this adaptation contributed to preeclampsia and increased the risk of long-term kidney impairment in both mothers and offspring in mouse models, consistent with epidemiological data from humans. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The global burden of kidney disease displays marked sexual dimorphism. Lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that starting from puberty, estrogen signaling in female mice supports self-renewal and differentiation of renal progenitors to increase filtration capacity, reducing sensitivity to glomerular injury compared with that of males. This phenomenon accelerated as female kidneys adapted to the workload of pregnancy. Deletion of estrogen receptor α in renal progenitors disrupted this adaptation, leading to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and increased maternal risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Offspring from affected mothers had fewer nephrons, resulting in early-life hypertension and greater susceptibility to kidney disease. These results highlight the fundamental role of kidney fitness and renal progenitors for pregnancy and preeclampsia and as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in kidney disease.},

Most signals are captured in the 30- to 2000-Hz range, and the lower 10- to 30-Hz band remains largely unexplored because of persistent low-frequency control noise that limits sensitivity. Enhancing this sensitivity could increase cosmological reach. Using nonlinear optimal control through reinforcement learning with a frequency-domain reward, Buchli et al . developed a method that effectively reduces control noise in the low-frequency band. This method was successfully implemented at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in Livingston and the Caltech 40 Meter Prototype, achieving control noise levels on LIGO’s most demanding feedback control loop below the quantum noise, thus removing a critical obstacle to increased detector sensitivity. —Yury Suleymanov Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers and binary black hole eccentricity and provide early warnings for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today’s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave observatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control systems.},

  abstract     = {Earthquakes can trigger silent slip and mud volcanoes, but rarely have the processes been observed together or at long distances. Bayramov et al . documented the flare-up of more than 50 mud volcanoes in the West Caspian Kura basin and substantial aseismic slip across seven faults immediately after the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquakes over 1000 kilometers away. Their findings suggest that seismic waves increased pore pressure in the basin, leading to regional inflation, mud volcano eruption, and reduced effective stress on faults. Faults in fluid-rich basins may thus be susceptible to far-reaching triggering by large earthquakes. —Angela Hessler Seismic waves from large earthquakes are known to trigger slip on distant faults, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and local geodetic and seismic data, we show that the 1000-kilometer-distant, February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in southeastern Türkiye triggered deformation and/or eruption at 56 mud volcanoes and centimeter-scale aseismic slip on seven faults over tens of kilometers within the fluid-rich Kura Basin in the West Caspian region. This transient deformation event, with an equivalent moment magnitude of 6.1, was coupled with local inflation below major hydrocarbon fields. We postulate that seismic waves led to a change in pore pressure at depth, which in turn triggered aseismic slip along several crustal faults crossing the basin and its surroundings.},

  abstract     = {Anti-apoptotic proteins such as MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) are potential targets for cancer therapeutics, but the full range of functions of these proteins has not been explored in vivo. MCL-1 has effects on metabolism not related to its effects on apoptosis. To evaluate and distinguish these functions, Brinkmann et al . replaced MCL-1 genes in mice with genes encoding other BCL-2 family members that are also anti-apoptotic but may not share MCL-1’s other functions. MCL-1 was necessary for early embryogenesis, but this function was compensated for by the other anti-apoptotic proteins. However, later in development and after birth, the metabolic actions of MCL-1 were required and were only partially replaced by some other family members. These results may aid in the development of MCL-1 inhibitors as anticancer agents. —L. Bryan Ray The anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) is essential for embryogenesis and the survival of many cell types that tolerate loss of its relatives, BCL-XL and BCL-2. Apoptosis-unrelated roles of MCL-1 in metabolism may contribute to this requirement, although their relevance for embryogenesis and postnatal life remains unclear. We hypothesized that BCL-XL and BCL-2 may substitute MCL-1’s anti-apoptotic but not its apoptosis-unrelated functions. Replacing MCL-1 with BCL-XL or BCL-2 supported embryo development by rescuing the Mcl-1 −/− preimplantation lethality. Mcl-1 Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 Bcl-2/Bcl-2 mice were born on a mixed background, although they showed metabolic defects. Thus MCL-1’s apoptosis-unrelated functions appear critical in later development, with BCL-XL, but not BCL-2, partially compensating. These findings clarify MCL-1’s distinct physiological roles, critically informing MCL-1 inhibitor development as cancer therapeutics.},

Using transgenic mouse and organoid models, Eyunni et al . discovered how distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations shape prostate cancer progression. Class 1 mutations drive the formation of aggressive tumors that mirror key features of human disease and regress upon androgen deprivation. By contrast, class 2 mutations do not initiate tumors but instead reprogram differentiated cells into hormone-independent, stem-like progenitors. —Di Jiang FOXA1 is altered in 10 to 40% of prostate cancers, yet its oncogenic mechanisms remain uncharacterized in vivo. We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multiomic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction with p53 inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through coactivation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. By contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intraluminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.},

Rico et al . showed that surging wastewater flows in the summer of 2024 enhanced water-to-air hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) transfer at a turbulent hotspot, leading to nighttime atmospheric H 2 S peaks thousands of times greater than typical urban levels. This example makes it clear that poor water quality can drastically affect air quality—an observation with important implications for global waterways. —Jesse Smith Industrial chemicals and untreated sewage have polluted the Tijuana River for decades, recently causing >1300 consecutive days of California beach closures. In summer 2024, wastewater flows surged to millions of gallons per day despite no rain, enhancing water-to-air transfer of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and other toxic gases at a turbulent hotspot. High wastewater flows and low winds led to nighttime H 2 S peaks, reaching 4500 parts per billion (ppb)—exceeding typical urban levels of <1 ppb. H 2 S levels and community malodor reports were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient r = 0.92), validating long-dismissed community voices and highlighting an environmental injustice. This study demonstrates that poor water quality can substantially affect air quality—although rarely included in air quality models and health assessments—with far-reaching implications as polluted waterways increase globally.},

Crawford et al . used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to explore neural activity in the periaqueductal gray brain area, a key region involved in pain processing, and tested the organizational principle of placebo analgesia (see the Perspective by Moayedi and Atlas). The authors exposed participants to heat stimuli of varying intensities on the face, forearm, and leg with or without the application of a placebo analgesic cream and showed that placebo analgesic response was somatotopically (spatially) organized. The results provide insights into how the brain can enable precise and localized pain relief in order to optimize defensive responses. —Mattia Maroso The lateral periaqueductal gray (lPAG) evokes somatotopically appropriate defensive behaviors, including an analgesia that allows the animal to escape or fight unimpeded. Whether the lPAG and its descending targets are also able to drive somatotopically specific analgesic responses is not known. In this work, we performed ultrahigh-field functional magnetic resonance imaging of the lPAG in 93 participants during a placebo analgesia paradigm performed at different body locations. We found that analgesic responses are somatotopically organized in the lPAG and its descending outputs to the rostral ventromedial medulla. These data show that the PAG can regulate analgesic responses in a highly spatially localized manner and thus has the ability to mediate body site–selective control over pain.},

  abstract     = {Cilia are structures found on the surface of most cells that serve critical functions such as generating fluid flow in the lungs and enabling communication between cells. Genetic mutations that disrupt cilia cause developmental abnormalities called ciliopathies. Transcriptional regulation of cilia formation is poorly understood. Liang et al . identified two related transcription factors, SP5 and SP8, that are sufficient to produce cilia on normally unciliated cells through activation of the synthesis of the building blocks for cilia. Furthermore, removal of these transcription factors in mouse embryos caused fewer and shorter cilia to form across cell types, leading to ciliopathy phenotypes. This work provides insights into how cilia are built and the genes responsible for ciliopathies. —Stella M. Hurtley Although specific transcription factors (TFs) are known to regulate cell fate decisions, the degree to which they can stimulate formation of specific cell organelles is less clear. We used a multiomics comparison of the transcriptomes of ciliated and unciliated embryonic cells to identify TFs up-regulated in ciliated cells. We also used conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells and found that the TFs SP5 and SP8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In embryos lacking Sp5 and Sp8 , primary and motile cilia were shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus. Moreover, expression of SP8 was sufficient to induce primary cilia in unciliated cells. This work will facilitate the study of cilia assembly using stem cell models and promote further understanding of human ciliopathies.},

  abstract     = {Urban air pollution in China is characterized by a chemical environment not seen in many other places in the world, with strong haze events being a particularly visible symptom. The high particulate matter loads that define these hazy episodes are largely the result of the production of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Huang et al . reviewed the state of the science of SOA formation under the distinctive chemical conditions in urban China, paying particular attention to the roles of anthropogenic precursors relative to biogenic ones, the prevailing SOA formation and aging mechanisms, and the interplay between inorganic and organic pollutants. —Jesse Smith In the past decades, China has witnessed high air pollution associated with rapid economic development, although regulatory efforts have alleviated the situation since 2013. Haze events characterized by high particulate matter (PM) levels in China are not only of enormous magnitude but also represent a distinct chemical regime. Once driven by direct emissions, these high-PM episodes are now more affected by secondary aerosol, especially secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This Review synthesizes the state of the science of SOA formation in urban China, specifically (i) how the dominance of anthropogenic precursors affects SOA formation, (ii) what are the prevailing SOA formation mechanisms, and (iii) how important are the multipollutant and multiphase processes in SOA formation and evolution. We also highlight essential directions for future studies.},

  abstract     = {When patients are tested for genetic predisposition to clinical conditions, they sometimes are found to have rare gene variants of unknown significance, leaving clinicians to guess at the implications. In addition, mutations may not directly cause the clinical condition but could increase the risk of developing it. To help interpret such scenarios, Forrest et al . used machine learning to evaluate several large cohorts of patients (see the Perspective by Raiken and Stein). The authors used clinical data to calculate disease scores for 10 conditions and then linked those scores with genetic data, including rare mutations with previously unknown roles. In addition to helping to interpret the contributions of rare mutations for the diseases analyzed here, this study provides a model for examining the contribution of unknown genetic variants to other diseases. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Accurate variant penetrance estimation is crucial for precision medicine. We constructed machine learning (ML) models for 10 diseases using 1,347,298 participants with electronic health records, then applied them to an independent cohort with linked exome data. Resulting probabilities were used to evaluate ML penetrance of 1648 rare variants in 31 autosomal dominant disease-predisposition genes. ML penetrance was variable across variant classes, but highest for pathogenic and loss-of-function variants, and was associated with clinical outcomes and functional data. Compared with conventional case-versus-control approaches, ML penetrance provided refined quantitative estimates and aided the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and loss-of-function variants by delineating clinical trajectories over time. By leveraging ML and deep phenotyping, we present a scalable approach to accurately quantify disease risk of variants.},

  abstract     = {In addition to their role in host defense, macrophages contribute to the development and remodeling of tissues. Yu et al . characterized macrophages found in the adipose tissue of mice on the basis of their gene expression, localization within the tissue, and developmental origin. A subset of macrophages localized in the same tissue microenvironment as adipocyte stem cells and promoted their differentiation into white adipocytes. Specific deletion of these macrophages promoted the differentiation of thermogenic, rather than white, adipocytes and prevented mice from becoming obese in response to a high-fat diet. A similar population of cells were identified in human adipose tissue. —Sarah H. Ross Tissue macrophages reside in anatomically distinct subtissular niches that shape their identity and function. In white adipose tissue (WAT), we identified three macrophage populations with distinct localization, turnover, and phenotypes. Septal adipose tissue macrophages (sATMs), marked by CD209b and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, were long-lived and positioned in close proximity to adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) within the WAT septum. Within this shared niche, sATMs instructed the differentiation of ASCs into white adipocytes through transforming growth factor–β1 (TGFβ1). Depletion of sATMs, or the selective loss of TGFβ1 within tissue-resident macrophages, redirected ASC fate toward thermogenic adipocytes, enhancing WAT beiging and protecting against diet-induced obesity. These findings highlight the role of a discrete, anatomically defined macrophage population that governs ASC fate and orchestrates adipose tissue expansion.},

We report a classical-decisive quantum internet architecture in which the integration of quantum information into advanced photonic technologies enables efficient entanglement distribution over a commercially deployed fiber network. On-chip precise synchronization between classical headers and quantum payloads enables dynamic routing and networking of high-fidelity entanglement guided by classical light. The quantum states are preserved through real-time error mitigation, relying solely on classical signal readout without disturbing quantum information.

For a robotic system, this can tax the limits of the onboard power supply. Wang et al . designed a method to launch a robot that uses focused near-infrared heating, ultrasound, or electrical sparks to remotely initiate the growth and catastrophic collapse of cavitation bubbles. Key to the design is the suppression of bubble release until a stability limit is reached, allowing the energy contained therein to be harnessed upon the bubbles’ violent collapse. The authors show that, in addition to jumping, the same approach can be used to power the swimming of a robot. They also demonstrate that this concept works for a range of materials, liquids, and operating environments. —Marc S. Lavine Cavitation, characterized by formation of vapor bubbles in a low-pressure or high-temperature region of a liquid, is often destructive, but it can be harnessed for actuators and robots. We exploit cavitation to accumulate substantial energy in superheated liquids by suppressing its immediate release until reaching a stability limit. The energetic, unstable bubbles collapse violently, producing a burst of high power and force that initiates motion. Notably, a millimeter-scale device launched by cavitation can jump to a height of 1.5 meters—reaching a 12 meters per second (m/s) peak velocity, a 7.14 × 10 4 m/s 2 acceleration, and a 0.64% energy efficiency—and can also swim on water at 12 centimeters per second.

  abstract     = {Cutting emissions is necessary to curb climate change, but storing carbon in forest biomass and soils can also contribute to climate mitigation. Estimating the potential increase in forest carbon is hindered by limited data on soil carbon sequestration rates and unrealistic assumptions about the land available for forestation. Wang et al . addressed these issues by synthesizing soil data and considering potential effects of forestation on warming, water quality, and biodiversity to produce a more realistic estimate: <40 petagrams of carbon by 2050 from reforestation and afforestation, which is much lower than previous estimates. Considering only the land that has been pledged for forestation in existing policy commitments further reduces the estimate. —Bianca Lopez Forestation (afforestation and reforestation) could mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon within biomass and soils. However, global mitigation from forestation remains uncertain owing to varying estimates of carbon sequestration rates (notably in soil) and land availability. In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares). Achieving greater mitigation requires expanding dedicated forestation areas and strengthening commitments from nations with considerable but untapped potential.},

Humans involved in this early relationship played a role in shaping horses to be the fast, strong, and relatively tame creatures they are today. Looking for signatures of selection across a suite of key traits, Liu et al . found shifts in markers related to behavior and body conformation at around 5000 years ago, reflecting patterns of domestication (see the Perspective by Frantz). —Sacha Vignieri Horsepower revolutionized human history through enhanced mobility, transport, and warfare. However, the suite of biological traits that reshaped horses during domestication remains unclear. We scanned an extensive horse genome time series for selection signatures at 266 markers associated with key traits. We detected a signature of positive selection at ZFPM1 —known to be a modulator of behavior in mice—occurring ~5000 years ago (ya), suggesting that taming was one of the earliest steps toward domestication of horses. Intensive selection at GSDMC began ~4750 ya with the domestication bottleneck, leading regulatory variants to high frequency by ~4150 ya. GSDMC genotypes are linked to body conformation in horses and to spinal anatomy, motor coordination, and muscular strength in mice. Our results suggest that selection on standing variation at GSDMC was crucial for the emergence of horses that could facilitate fast mobility in human societies ~4200 ya.},

  abstract     = {The way rivers move, whether through single-thread meandering or multithread braiding, is tied to long- and short-term biogeochemical cycles. Meandering rivers were thought to have evolved along with rooted plants more than 400 million years ago, as suggested by geologic indicators for sinuous flow. However, this view may be changing. Using data from modern rivers, Hasson et al . found that although meandering itself is not specific to vegetated rivers, the migration pattern of unvegetated meandering rivers can produce sedimentary deposits with an orientation more consistent with braided rivers (see the Perspective by Pizzuto). Their results suggest that meandering river deposits may be underrecognized in the preplant geologic record. —Angela Hessler A primary axiom in geoscience is that the evolution of plants drove global changes in river dynamics. Notably, the apparent sinuosity of rivers, derived from the variance of sediment accretion direction measured in rocks, substantially increased when land plants evolved, around 425 million years ago. This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we found that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction. These results explain why meandering rivers have been underrecognized in prevegetation stratigraphy.},

Grabarczyk et al . determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human E4 ligase UBR4 with two protein cofactors that govern specificity. The protein forms a massive ring with a central active site. A cross-kingdom structural study revealed broad similarities and specific differences in E4 complexes. —Michael A. Funk Eukaryotic cells have evolved sophisticated quality control mechanisms to eliminate aggregation-prone proteins that compromise cellular health. Central to this defense is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBR4 acts as an essential E4 ubiquitin ligase, amplifying degradation marks on defective proteins. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3-megadalton ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Our structure shows how UBR4 binds substrate and extends lysine-48–specific ubiquitin chains. Efficient substrate targeting depends on both preubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as a key substrate filter. The architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes, but species-specific adaptations allow UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality control function in diverse cellular environments.},

  abstract     = {Bison once migrated across the western United States in enormous herds, shaping the landscape in ways that they currently cannot because smaller populations are now mainly constrained to specific properties. The population in Yellowstone National Park is an exception because these bison are able to migrate across hundreds of square kilometers. Geremia et al . performed grazing exclusion experiments to examine the effects of bison on soil and vegetation across their migration area. Grazed areas had higher soil microbe density and nitrogen content in both soils and plants. When given large areas to roam, bison create habitat heterogeneity and areas with enhanced nutrition that can support denser populations than are deemed sustainable by current management recommendations. —Bianca Lopez Although momentum is building to restore bison across North America, most efforts focus on small, managed herds, leaving unclear how large, migrating herds shape landscapes and whether their effects enhance or degrade ecosystems. We assessed carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the northern Yellowstone ecosystem, where one of the last remaining large migratory populations resides. Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality. Effects were strongest in wet, nutrient-rich habitats that received higher bison densities and grazing than is recommended in rangeland management, while soil and plant conditions suggested landscape resilience. Restoration should embrace heterogeneity in densities and effects across habitats and spatial scales beyond those guiding most current recovery efforts.},

  abstract     = {Mars is a single-plate planet. In contrast to Earth, where subducting plates have churned the mantle for billions of years, the interior of Mars may preserve characteristics of its early evolution. Charalambous et al . detected marsquake waveforms arriving at NASA’s InSight lander and saw an apparent delay in the high-frequency arrivals that increased with travel distance through Mars’ mantle. They attribute these delays to very fine-scale heterogeneities, the result of chaotic mantle convection during Mars’ impact-filled early history. This widespread heterogeneity was then frozen in place as the planet’s crust cooled and mantle convection slowed to a creep. —Angela Hessler A planet’s interior is a time capsule, preserving clues to its early history. We report the discovery of kilometer-scale heterogeneities throughout Mars’ mantle, detected seismically through pronounced wavefront distortion of energy arriving from deeply probing marsquakes. These heterogeneities, likely remnants of the planet’s formation, imply a mantle that has undergone limited mixing driven by sluggish convection. Their size and survival constrain Mars’ poorly known mantle rheology, indicating a high viscosity of 10 21.3 to 10 21.9 pascal-seconds and low temperature dependence, with an effective activation energy of 70 to 90 kilojoules per mole, suggesting a mantle deforming by dislocation creep. The limited mixing, coupled with ubiquitous, scale-invariant heterogeneities, reflects a highly disordered mantle, characteristic of the more primitive interior evolution of a single-plate planet, contrasting sharply with the tectonically active Earth.},

  abstract     = {Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can be cut into smaller pieces called tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) that can sometimes help cells respond to stress. Li et al . found that levels of one such RNA, Asp-GTC-3′tDR, markedly increased in response to disease-related stress signals in kidney cell culture and mouse models of kidney diseases. Asp-GTC-3′tDR was protective in kidney cells and regulated autophagy, a process by which a cell can recycle its RNA and proteins. Inhibiting Asp-GTC-3′tDR in kidney disease models worsened renal injury, cell death, inflammation, and fibrosis, whereas increasing its abundance protected against these processes. Targeting of tDRs may thus represent a strategy for treating kidney disease. —Stella M. Hurtley Transfer RNA–derived small RNAs (tsRNAs or tDRs) perform a range of cellular functions. Here, we showed that tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR, a hypoxia-induced tDR derived from the 3′ end of tRNA-Asp-GTC, activated autophagic flux in kidney cells and its silencing blocked autophagic flux. Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy. This tDR-induced RNA autophagy pathway was activated during murine and human kidney diseases, suggesting clinical relevance. Thus, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR plays a role in regulating RNA autophagy, which helps to maintain homeostasis in kidney cells and protects against kidney injury.},

  abstract     = {Enlarged lysosomal vacuoles are observed in many conditions, including aging, infection, and prion and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about how these vacuoles are formed, precluding understanding of their pathophysiological functions. Through unbiased proteomics, Yang et al . identified lysosomal vacuolator (LYVAC, also known as PDZD8) as a key driver of lysosomal vacuolation (see the Perspective by Lippincott-Schwartz). Lysosomal osmotic stress remodeled lysosomal lipid composition and increased membrane tension, thereby coordinating LYVAC recruitment and lipid transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to support lysosomal vacuolation. The general requirement of LYVAC for lysosomal osmotic vacuolation across diverse conditions suggests broad pathophysiological relevance of this lipid-transfer pathway. —Stella M. Hurtley Lysosomal vacuolation is commonly found in many pathophysiological conditions, but its molecular mechanisms and functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored lipid transfer protein PDZ domain–containing 8 (PDZD8), which we propose to be renamed as lysosomal vacuolator (LYVAC), is a general mediator of lysosomal vacuolation. Using human cell lines, we found that diverse lysosomal vacuolation inducers converged on lysosomal osmotic stress, triggering LYVAC recruitment through multivalent interactions. Stress-induced lysosomal lipid signaling contributed to both the recruitment and activation of LYVAC. By directly sensing lysosomal phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, the lipid transfer domain of LYVAC mediated directional ER-to-lysosome lipid movement, leading to osmotic membrane expansion of lysosomes. These findings uncover an essential mechanism for lysosomal vacuolation with broad implications in pathophysiology.},

However, less known is the potential for stabilizing interactions to have therapeutically valuable effects on biological systems. Potts et al . reviewed recent progress in developing molecules that reduce the dissociation rate ( k off ) for biomolecular complexes and explain how this mechanism offers a powerful way to redirect endogenous interactions for therapeutic benefit. They named the molecules that reduce k off LOCKTACs and provide examples of emerging areas for preclinical research. —Michael A. Funk Biology is governed by macromolecular interactions, perturbation of which often lies at the heart of disease. Most therapeutic drugs, whether they are small molecules or biologics, exert their effects through impeding such interactions, whether they are of an enzyme with its substrate or a ligand with its receptor. Conversely, a handful of approved drugs and a larger number of candidates in development have the opposite effect: They either activate or inhibit a biological output by stabilizing a preexisting complex through reducing the rate at which its components dissociate ( k off ). In this Review, we present examples of therapeutic candidates that we term “LOCKTACs,” which modulate k off , and discuss possible theoretical and practical advantages of this class of drugs. Prospective discovery of LOCKTACs has the potential to usher in a new class of therapeutics for today’s most challenging targets.},

To address some of these problems, Liao et al . developed a high-resolution method called Stereo-cell.

Stereo-cell further allows integration with imaging-based modalities and multiomics strategies, including immunofluorescence and epitope profiling. This platform is also compatible with profiling extracellular vesicles, microstructures, and large cells, whereas its spatial resolution facilitates in situ analysis of cell-cell interactions, cellular microenvironments, and subcellular transcript localization.

However, how selection has affected introgressed genomic regions has been inconsistently studied across populations. Villanea et al . characterized an introgressed region around the gene MUC19 in admixed American individuals that results in expanded copy number of a tandem repeat. This haplotype features multiple Denisovan variants, although it likely entered human populations through a Neanderthal intermediate. The patterns of positive selection indicate that this introgression occurred in Indigenous Americans during their migration to the Americas. How this change was adaptive for these populations has yet to be determined, but this work does disentangle a complex selection signal in these understudied groups. —Corinne Simonti We study the gene MUC19 , for which some modern humans carry a Denisovan-like haplotype. MUC19 is a mucin, a glycoprotein that forms gels with various biological functions. We find diagnostic variants for the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype at high frequencies in admixed American individuals and at highest frequency in 23 ancient Indigenous American individuals, all pre-dating population admixture with Europeans and Africans. We find that the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype is under positive selection and carries a higher copy number of a 30–base-pair variable number tandem repeat, and that copy numbers of this repeat are exceedingly high in admixed American populations. Finally, we find that some Neanderthals carry the Denisovan-like MUC19 haplotype, and that it was likely introgressed into modern human populations through Neanderthal introgression rather than Denisovan introgression.},

  abstract     = {Cavity-enabled energy transfer in vibrational polaritons is a promising route to manipulating chemical dynamics in condensed phases, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. One important factor that has been largely overlooked is energy disorder, which is prevalent in chemistry and can significantly affect polariton delocalization and modify molecular dynamics. Yin et al . prepared 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol in both saturated solutions (inhomogeneous limit) and crystalline solids (homogeneous limit), which allowed them to probe the polaritonic effects of the same molecular polariton system in distinct disorder conditions (see the Perspective by Son). Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation, the authors showed that energy disorder can suppress polariton delocalization and prevent the consequent cavity-enabled vibrational energy transfer. They also examined potential strategies to overcome disorder-induced localization effects. —Yury Suleymanov Energy disorder is ubiquitous in chemistry and physics. It can suppress polariton delocalization by disrupting molecular coherence–limiting polariton-modified properties. We investigated how energy disorders affect vibrational polariton dynamics by probing ultrafast dynamics in 2,6-di- tert -butylphenol in liquids (inhomogeneous) and solids (homogeneous) using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. In liquids, energy disorder disrupted delocalization, preventing vibrational energy transfer. By contrast, with reduced inhomogeneity, vibrational strong coupling in solids restored delocalization and enabled energy transfer. We established a stringent delocalization criterion, requiring collective coupling strengths exceeding three times inhomogeneous linewidths to sustain polariton coherence. This finding highlights energy disorder’s detrimental effects and outlines strategies to overcome localization—either by minimizing disorder through chemical control or by achieving sufficient couplings using advanced photonic structures.},

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms by which stimulation of this region can reduce depressive symptoms are unclear. By applying chemogenetic prefrontal circuit interventions within area 46 projection pathways, Wood et al . identified a functional network within the left hemisphere of marmosets that is involved in the regulation of positive and negative emotion–related behaviors (see the Perspective by Treadway). The localized targeting of ketamine provided insight into the mechanisms through which this rapid-acting antidepressant may act to ameliorate motivational anhedonia. These findings provide a window into the network dysregulation that may underlie the etiology and treatment of depression. —Peter Stern The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is a higher-order brain structure targeted for noninvasive stimulation for treatment-resistant depression. Nonetheless, its causal role in emotion regulation is unknown. We discovered that inactivating dlPFC area 46 in marmosets blunts appetitive motivation and heightens threat reactivity. The effects were asymmetric—dependent on the left hemisphere only—and were mediated through projections to pregenual cingulate area 32. The antidepressant ketamine blocked the appetitive motivational deficits through mechanisms within subcallosal cingulate area 25, an area linked with treatment success in dlPFC noninvasive stimulation. Our data uncover an integrated prefrontal network for area 46 that contributes to positive and negative emotion regulation that may be core to our understanding of symptoms and therapeutic strategies for treatment-resistant depression and anxiety.},

Looking at populations of endangered pocket mice, Wilder et al . found that breeding of individuals with different karyotypes did lead to lower fitness; however, their fitness was still higher than those breeding with closely related individuals. —Sacha Vignieri Two-thirds of Earth’s species have undergone population declines, leaving many vulnerable to genomic erosion and inbreeding depression. Genetic rescue can boost the fitness of small populations, but perceived risks of outbreeding depression can limit its use. We quantified these trade-offs in hundreds of endangered Pacific pocket mice ( Perognathus longimembris pacificus ) by combining whole-genome sequences with fitness data. The impacts of genomic erosion in remnant populations were reversed in an admixed breeding program, suggesting the potential benefits of genetic rescue. However, differences in chromosome numbers increase the risk of genetic incompatibilities.

Whereas Berry curvature–mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric–induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here, we show that spin-momentum locking, a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit–coupled materials, leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measured and electrically controlled in 111-oriented LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interfaces.

This situation has the potential to widely affect a variety of species because most living organisms have evolved to respond, in one way or another, to the circadian light-dark cycle. Pease et al . looked at the influence of light pollution on activity patterns in more than 500 species of birds globally. They found that birds were generally vocal for nearly an hour longer in the presence of light pollution. Furthermore, birds that are more exposed, or entrained, to light were more affected, such as those with large eyes and open nests. —Sacha Vignieri Light pollution disrupts light–dark cues that organisms use as timetables for life. Although studies—typically focusing on individual species—have documented earlier morning onset of bird vocalization in light-polluted landscapes, a synthesis of light pollution effects across species, space, and season is lacking. We used a global acoustic dataset of more than 60 million detections, representing 583 diurnal bird species, to synthesize effects of light pollution on avian vocalization. On average, light pollution prolonged vocal activity by 50 min. Light pollution responses were strongest for species with large eyes, open nests, migratory habits, and large ranges and during the breeding season. Prolonged activity may confer negative, neutral, or positive fitness effects; documenting these fitness effects and curbing light pollution are challenges for 21st-century conservation.},

  abstract     = {Fans attached to the legs of Rhagovelia , commonly known as ripple bugs, automatically deploy protrusions on their middle legs under water. Ortega-Jimenez et al . examined this phenomenon from the structural, behavioral, and energy consumption perspectives (see the Perspective by Aubin). They show that the protrusions have a flat-ribbon microarchitecture, enabling fast capillary actuation. Furthermore, the individual barbs have divergent rigidity in orthogonal directions, facilitating both elastocapillary morphing and effective force production during a propulsive stroke, which enhances thrust production through unsteady vortices and capillary waves. The researchers designed an insect-scale robot equipped with synthetic, ultralight, ultrafast elastocapillary fans and demonstrated how these structures enable a variety of movements at impressive speeds. —Marc S. Lavine Rhagovelia ripple bugs use specialized middle-leg fans with a flat-ribbon architecture to navigate the surfaces of fast-moving streams. We show that the fan’s directional stiffness enables fast, passive elastocapillary morphing, independent of muscle input. This flat-ribbon fan balances collapsibility during leg recovery with rigidity during drag-based propulsion, enabling full-body 96° turns in 50 milliseconds, with forward speeds of up to 120 body lengths per second—on par with fruit fly saccades in air. Drawing from this morphofunctional architecture, we engineered a 1-milligram elastocapillary fan integrated into an insect-scale robot. Experiments with both insects and robots confirmed that self-morphing fans improve thrust, braking, and maneuverability. Our findings link fan microstructure to controlled interfacial propulsion and establish design principles for compact, elastocapillary actuators in agile aquatic microrobots.},

  abstract     = {Spectroscopy requires knowing precisely the input spectrum used to probe the sample. At present, most photonic components, such as blazed gratings or metasurfaces, have fixed functionalities and static spectral properties, providing only limited spectral tunability that is often restricted to narrowband adjustments or broad, nonselective shifts. Liu et al . introduce a nano-opto-electro-mechanical grating based on a pixelated array of coupled resonators to dynamically control the spectral output. Their on-chip approach provides access to real-time optical spectrum control in an ultracompact footprint, offering agility and spectral flexibility for integrated photonics. —Ian S. Osborne The ability to shape light spectra dynamically and arbitrarily would revolutionize many photonic systems by offering unparalleled spectral efficiency and network flexibility. However, most existing optical components have rigid spectral functionalities with limited tunability, hindering compact and fast optical spectral shaping. We introduce a pixelated nano-opto-electro-mechanical (NOEM) grating that exploits electromechanically induced symmetry breaking for precise, pixel-level control of grating coupling strength, yielding a miniaturized (~0.007 square millimeters) on-chip spectral shaper. We demonstrate the synthesis of grating pixels for arbitrary spectral responses, and we achieved rapid (<10 nanoseconds), high-contrast (>100 decibels), wavelength-selective switching through collective, nanometer-scale electrostatic perturbations. Our pixelated NOEM grating delivers exceptional spectral manipulation capabilities in an ultracompact, on-chip manner, offering prospects for next-generation optical information networks, computing architectures, and beyond.},

The researchers found universal long-time scaling in their data and measured a dynamical exponent consistent with theoretical expectations. —Jelena Stajic Coarsening of an isolated far-from-equilibrium quantum system is a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, relevant from subnuclear to cosmological length scales and predicted to feature universal dynamic scaling. Here, we observed universal scaling in the coarsening of a homogeneous two-dimensional Bose gas, with exponents that match analytical predictions. For different initial states, we reveal universal scaling in the experimentally accessible finite-time dynamics by elucidating and accounting for the initial-state-dependent prescaling effects. The methods we introduce allow direct comparison between cold-atom experiments and nonequilibrium field theory and are applicable to any study of universality far from equilibrium.},

Given that exposures change with environments, these organs must adapt to new conditions while also remaining flexible to environmental change. Yu et al . used comparative genomics and cell atlas data from the human intestine to identify locations under recent selection in humans, finding genes involved in immunity and metabolism. They also generated human and chimpanzee intestinal organoids that recapitulated gene expression in these species and helped to identify cell types of interest with human-specific changes. These results illuminate the evolution of the human intestine and provide a model for this difficult to study tissue. —Corinne Simonti Diet, microbiota, and other exposures make the intestinal epithelium a nexus for evolutionary change; however, little is known about genomic changes associated with adaptation to a distinctly human environment. In this work, we interrogate the evolution of cell types in the developing human intestine by comparing tissue and organoids from humans, chimpanzees, and mice. We find that recent changes in primates are associated with immune barrier function and lipid and xenobiotic metabolism and that human-specific genetic features affect these functions. Enhancer assays, genetic deletion, and in silico mutagenesis resolve evolutionarily important enhancers of lactase ( LCT ) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ( IGFBP2 ). Altogether, we identify the developing human intestinal epithelium as a rapidly evolving system and show that great ape organoids provide insight into human biology.},

However, upon bacteriophage infection, msDNA rapidly degrades, leading to disassembly of the complex and activation of PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to inhibit phage replication. This disassembly-driven activation contrasts with classical immune systems that rely on oligomerization, revealing a distinct regulatory mechanism with potential applications in genome engineering. —Di Jiang Retrons are antiphage defense systems that produce multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) and hold promise for genome engineering. However, the mechanisms of defense remain unclear. The Retron-Septu system integrates retron and Septu antiphage defenses. Cryo–electron microscopy structures reveal asymmetric nucleoprotein complexes comprising a reverse transcriptase, msDNA (a hybrid of msdDNA and msrRNA), and two PtuAB copies. msdDNA and msrRNA are essential for assembling this complex, with msrRNA adopting a conserved lariat-like structure that regulates reverse transcription. Notably, the assembled Retron-Septu complex is inactive, with msdDNA occupying the PtuA DNA binding site. Activation occurs upon disassembly, releasing PtuAB, which degrades single-stranded DNA to restrict phage replication. This “arrest-and-release” mechanism underscores the dynamic regulatory roles of msDNA, advancing our understanding of antiphage defense strategies.},

  abstract     = {Maize plants emit a volatile gas called linalool, which can influence the growth and development of neighboring plants. Guo et al . found that at high planting densities, high linalool concentrations triggered neighboring plants to release benzoxazinoids into the soil (see the Perspective by Schandry and Becker). These compounds cause the soil microbiota to change composition, with knock-on effects for plants that are subsequently grown there. The altered microbiome enhances defense responses to herbivores but reduces plant growth. These findings demonstrate the implications of high planting density on multiple facets of the plant growth environment. —Madeleine Seale High planting density boosts crop yields but also heightens pest and pathogen risks. How plants adapt their defenses under these conditions remains unclear. In this study, we reveal that maize enhances its defense in high-density conditions through a plant-soil feedback mechanism triggered by the leaf volatile linalool. Linalool activates jasmonate signaling in neighboring plants and promotes root exudation of benzoxazinoids, especially 2-(2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one)-β-d-glucopyranose (HDMBOA-Glc). These exudates in turn reshape the rhizosphere microbiome composition to favor growth of specific bacterial taxa that trigger broad-spectrum resistance, albeit at the cost of maize growth. This microbiome-driven feedback loop is governed by salicylic acid signaling. Our findings uncover intricate chemical signaling in high-density cropping, which is instrumental for improving soil health and designing sustainable strategies that balance the trade-off between plant growth and defense.},

Incorporating achiral fluorescent dyes and nanocrystals into these assemblies could produce circularly polarized emission with dissymmetry factors of about 0.1. —Phil Szuromi Supramolecular assemblies hold great promise for advanced chiral materials because of their structural diversity and dynamic features, but their low chiroptical activity limits practical applications. We report hierarchical supramolecular assemblies with giant chiroptical activity and mechanical attributes achieved through coassembly of achiral amphiphilic unimolecular micelles and chiral additives. Chiral fibrillar assemblies emerge from the nanostructured environment imposed by the micelles, driven by progressive chirality transfer through multiple hydrogen bonds between components. Integrating multifarious achiral luminescent molecules and nanocrystals into these assemblies leads to full-color circularly polarized luminescence–active materials with dissymmetry factors of ~10 −1 .

Medeiros et al . found that cells harness mitochondrial metabolism to restrict access of the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to the essential B vitamin folate (see the Perspective by Suomalainen and Nikkanen). When host cells detect intracellular parasite effectors, they activate the integrated stress response and its key effector, ATF4. ATF4 induces one-carbon metabolism processes in host mitochondria that use folate. Because Toxoplasma requires folate to generate thymidine for DNA synthesis, ATF4 activation restricts parasite replication. Thus, infected cells can weaponize mitochondrial metabolism to defend against pathogens. —Stella M. Hurtley As major consumers of cellular metabolites, mitochondria are poised to compete with invading microbes for the nutrients that they need to grow. Whether cells exploit mitochondrial metabolism to protect from infection is unclear. In this work, we found that the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) activates a mitochondrial defense based on the essential B vitamin folate. During infection of cultured mammalian cells with the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii , ATF4 increased mitochondrial DNA levels by driving the one-carbon metabolism processes that use folate in mitochondria. Triggered by host detection of mitochondrial stress induced by parasite effectors, ATF4 limited Toxoplasma access to folates required for deoxythymidine monophosphate synthesis, thereby restricting parasite growth. Thus, ATF4 rewires mitochondrial metabolism to mount a folate-based metabolic defense against Toxoplasma .},

Murphy et al . found that platelets could acquire DNA from nucleated cells by internalizing extracellular vesicles and taking up DNA not enclosed in a membrane, called cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (see the Perspective by Tsui and Lo). In mice, depletion of platelets increased the concentration of cfDNA within blood plasma, indicating that platelets may help to remove cfDNA that has the potential promote inflammation. Human platelets isolated from pregnant individuals contain fetal DNA, and those from cancer patients contain DNA with tumor-associated mutations. Because there is a relatively low concentration of cfDNA in blood plasma, platelets might be an additional source to help overcome a current limitation in clinical diagnostics. —Sarah H. Ross Platelets are anucleate blood cells vital for hemostasis and immunity. During cell death and aberrant mitosis, nucleated cells release DNA, resulting in “cell-free” DNA in plasma (cfDNA). An excess of cfDNA is deleterious. Given their ability to internalize pathogen-derived nucleic acids, we hypothesized that platelets may also clear endogenous cfDNA. We found that, despite lacking a nucleus, platelets contained a repertoire of DNA fragments mapping across the nuclear genome. We detected fetal DNA in maternal platelets and cancer-derived DNA in platelets from patients with premalignant and cancerous lesions. As current liquid biopsy approaches utilize platelet-depleted plasma, important genetic information contained within platelets is being missed.

These antibodies restrained the formation of immune structures, known as germinal centers, within the gut tissue, helped limit T cell responses to food antigens during weaning, and provided protection against experimentally induced colitis.

Complexes comprising bacteria and antibodies could bind to antibody receptors (FcRs) in neonatal life and attenuate the activation of adaptive immune cells. — Sarah H. Ross Maternal antibodies fundamentally regulate gut immunity in the developing infant, yet the mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. We found that maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG), ingested in the first week of life, restrained microbiota-dependent adaptive immune responses weeks later, after weaning. This activity was linked to maternal antibodies that could bind bacteria in the neonatal gut and the ability of microbe-IgG complexes to engage Fc and complement-dependent effector functions in offspring. Ingestion of microbiota-specific maternal IgG also limited aberrant neonatal responses to dietary antigens encountered at weaning. These discoveries suggest that maternal IgG engages the immune system of offspring in early postnatal life to tune mucosal responses and reinforce intestinal homeostasis in the face of dynamic shifts in food and bacterial antigens during development.},

The same behavior is not observed in related species, including the common lab animal D. melanogaster . Tanaka et al . studied the genetics of nuptial gift giving in male animals and showed that expression of the gene FruitlessM ( FruM ) in insulin-like peptide-producing cells (IPCs) was both necessary and sufficient for triggering this behavior in D. subobscura . Overexpression of FruM in D. melanogaster IPCs induced neurite outgrowth in these cells and increased regurgitation behavior. These results unveil the genetic and neuronal basis of an evolutionary important species-specific behavior. —Mattia Maroso In accepting a courting male, Drosophila subobscura females require nuptial gift giving in which a male gives regurgitated crop contents to her mouth to mouth. No similar behavior is found in D. melanogaster . By clonal activation of neurons expressing the male-determinant FruM, we identified insulin-like peptide–producing cells (IPCs) and their putative postsynaptic targets, proboscis-innervating motoneurons, as those critical for gift giving. We demonstrate that loss of FruM from D. subobscura IPCs abrogates neurite extension and gift giving, whereas FruM overexpression in their D. melanogaster counterparts induces overgrowth of neurites that harbor functional synapses, culminating in increased regurgitation. We suggest that the acquisition of FruM expression by IPCs was a key event occurring in an ancestral D. subobscura that conferred a latent capability to perform nuptial gift giving.},

Shen et al . adapted a nonheme iron enzyme for this purpose by substituting the iron for copper and strategically testing amino acid variations around the active site. The reaction starts with excitation of an organic photocatalyst, which can then oxidize the active-site copper ion bound to the desired amine substrate and reduce an N -hydroxyphthalimide ester substrate. The two fragments can then combine to form the product. —Michael A. Funk Copper-catalyzed radical C(sp 3 )‒N coupling has become a major focus in synthetic catalysis over the past decade. However, achieving this reaction manifold by using enzymes has remained elusive. In this study, we introduce a photobiocatalytic approach for radical benzylic C(sp 3 )‒N coupling using a copper-substituted nonheme enzyme. Using rhodamine B as a photoredox catalyst, we identified a copper-substituted phenylalanine hydroxylase that facilitates enantioconvergent decarboxylative amination between N -hydroxyphthalimide esters and anilines. Directed evolution remodeled the active site, resulting in high enantioselectivities for most substrates. On the basis of molecular modeling and mechanistic studies, we propose that the enzyme accommodates a copper-anilide complex that reacts with a benzylic radical.

The design of the experiment is complex, and computer simulations are routinely used to optimize it. Typically, these simulations require manual tuning, which limits their predictive power. Spears et al . built a generative machine learning, physics-informed model that successfully predicted the initial ignition shot and the statistics of subsequent experiments with the same design. —Jelena Stajic An inertial confinement fusion experiment, carried out at the National Ignition Facility, has achieved ignition by generating fusion energy exceeding the laser energy that drove the experiment. Prior to the experiment, a generative machine learning model that combines radiation hydrodynamics simulations, deep learning, experimental data, and Bayesian statistics was used to predict, with a probability greater than 70%, that ignition was the most likely outcome for this shot.},

  abstract     = {High-energy hydrogen and helium atoms have been shown to diffract through graphene without damaging its lattice. Kanitz et al . were able to observe diffraction with atoms having kinetic energies normal to the lattice of up to 1.6 kilo–electron volts despite the expected detrimental effects of decoherence and lattice damage (see the Perspective by Holst). Unlike electron diffraction, this method could enable studies of diffraction of matter waves prepared in specific internal states in transmission experiments. —Phil Szuromi Diffraction of atoms from surfaces provides detailed insights into structures, interactions, and dynamical processes. However, the method is currently limited to measurements in reflection—diffraction through materials has only been demonstrated for subatomic particles and is an outstanding challenge for atoms. In this work, we diffract helium and hydrogen atoms at kilo–electron volt energies through single-layer graphene at normal incidence. Despite the atoms’ high kinetic energy as well as coupling to the electronic system of graphene, we observe coherent scattering. This preservation of coherence was the result of the limited momentum transfer between the projectile and the lattice, resulting from interaction times on the femtosecond scale.},

  abstract     = {Plants and fungi have long been thought to generate their germlines late in development, creating opportunities for somatic mutations to accrue and affect reproductive cells. Hiltunen Thorén et al . sequenced sterile and reproductive tissues from the fairy ring mushroom ( Marasmius oreades ) over 7 years and found that spores and lamellae, which are reproductive tissues, demonstrated consistently different mutations than sterile parts of the fruiting body. This suggests that these reproductive tissues may be sequestered early on in development. This observation in fungi expands the set of taxa that have independently evolved germline sequestration. —Corinne Simonti In sexual organisms, inheritance of new mutations is highly dependent on the timing of germline definition. Here, we used the fairy ring–forming fungus Marasmius oreades to challenge the general assumption of a late germline separation in the Fungi. We collected mushrooms from different parts of rings over a 7-year period and identified new mutations in different tissues by whole-genome sequencing. We found evidence that fertile and sterile tissues had accumulated different mutations, suggesting that the germ line, destined for spore production, is already defined in the mycelium in this species. Moreover, the germ line carried fewer mutations than sterile tissues, indicating a lower mutation rate. Our findings suggest that early germline sequestration is more widespread than previously considered across multicellular life.},

However, it has recently been theoretically predicted that an interacting one-dimensional bosonic gas subject to periodic “kicks” localizes instead of thermalizing. Guo et al . realized such a system using quantum-degenerate samples of cesium atoms and tuned the interaction strength from noninteracting to strongly interacting, finding localization in both limits. —Jelena Stajic The quantum kicked rotor is a paradigmatic model system in quantum physics. As a driven quantum system, it features dynamical localization, specifically Anderson localization in momentum space. However, the interacting many-body kicked rotor is believed to break localization. Here, we present evidence for many-body dynamical localization for the Lieb-Liniger version of the many-body quantum kicked rotor. After some initial evolution, the momentum distribution of interacting quantum-degenerate bosonic atoms in one-dimensional geometry, kicked hundreds of times by means of a pulsed sinusoidal potential, stops spreading. Our results shed light on the boundary between the classical, chaotic world and the realm of quantum physics.},

  abstract     = {The isotopic composition of methane is an important signal indicating whether the molecules were produced by biological or geological processes. However, there are many factors in natural environments that are not reflected in laboratory culture conditions, and caution is necessary when making assumptions about the isotope signatures of biological methanogenesis. Gropp et al . used a CRISPR-edited model methanogen with an inducible version of methyl-CoM reductase, the key enzyme of methanogenesis. Lowered expression of this enzyme resulted in a pathway blockage that increased reversibility in the oxidative branch of methanol and acetate metabolism, resulting in an overall shift of isotopic composition in intermediates leading to methane. —Michael A Funk The stable isotopic composition of microbial methane varies substantially, and the underlying causes are debated. In this work, we experimentally controlled the abundance of the central enzyme in methanogenesis, methyl–coenzyme M reductase (MCR), in Methanosarcina acetivorans and tested whether its cellular concentration alters methane isotopic compositions. We found that during growth on methanol and acetate, lowering the expression of mcr increases the degree of hydrogen isotope exchange between methane and water. Using an isotope-enabled model of methanogenesis, we found that these changes result from an increase in reversibility of enzymes involved in the oxidation of the substrate methyl group. This result indicates that methane produced from organic compounds can deviate from commonly assumed pathway-specific isotope effects, with implications for the interpretation of environmentally relevant methane sources.},

Recently, scanning probe microscopy has enabled the synthesis of two-dimensional molecular carbon rings, but these could only be assembled one by one on surfaces. Gao et al . now report a method to prepare macroscopic quantities of a ring comprising 48 carbons in solution phase. The key was to protect the backbone by threading it through three macrocycles during preparation of the precursor. —Jake S. Yeston Cyclo[ N ]carbons, molecular rings consisting solely of N carbon atoms, have previously been studied in the gas phase and on surfaces at cryogenic temperatures, but they are generally considered too reactive to be studied under ambient laboratory conditions. In this study, we report the synthesis of a cyclo[48]carbon catenane, in which the C 48 ring is protected by being threaded through three other macrocycles. This cyclo[48]carbon [4]catenane is stable enough for spectroscopic characterization in solution at room temperature. Its mass spectrum displays the expected molecular ions; its 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum gives a single resonance for all 48 sp 1 carbon atoms at 72.9 parts per million; and its Raman spectrum shows an intense peak at 1890 inverse centimeters, similar to linear polyynes.},

  abstract     = {Proteins can typically adopt a range of conformations in solution. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to generate ensembles with realistic probabilities, but the required computational resources are large even for simple problems. Lewis et al . developed a generative deep learning protein dynamics emulator called BioEmu that is trained on extensive molecular dynamics results, protein structures, and experimental data. Using a tiny fraction of the power used in traditional simulations, BioEmu generates accurate conformational ensembles for medium-sized soluble proteins. The ability to quickly, cheaply, and accurate generate such data will enable researchers to generate and test many more hypotheses and shift computational resources to validation and investigation of more difficult problems. —Michael A. Funk Following the sequence and structure revolutions, predicting functionally relevant protein structure changes at scale remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce BioEmu, a deep learning system that emulates protein equilibrium ensembles by generating thousands of statistically independent structures per hour on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). BioEmu integrates more than 200 milliseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, static structures, and experimental protein stabilities using new training algorithms. It captures diverse functional motions—including cryptic pocket formation, local unfolding, and domain rearrangements—and predicts relative free energies with 1 kilocalorie per mole accuracy compared with millisecond-scale MD and experimental data. BioEmu provides mechanistic insights by jointly modeling structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties. This approach amortizes the cost of MD and experimental data generation, demonstrating a scalable path toward understanding and designing protein function.},

If another layer is then added on top, a supermoiré lattice can form with an even longer wavelength. Xie et al . studied the influence of this supermoiré potential on the electronic structure of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. The researchers used a local probe, a scanning single-electron transistor microscope, that revealed strongly correlated phases caused by the supermoiré potential and not accessible to transport measurements. —Jelena Stajic In multilayer moiré heterostructures, the interference of multiple twist angles ubiquitously leads to tunable ultralong-wavelength patterns known as supermoiré lattices. However, their impact on the system’s many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoiré lattice–scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoiré lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observed an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near ν = − 2 , possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoiré lattices as a tunable parameter for designing quantum phases and as an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moiré materials.},

However, DNA degrades much faster than other biomolecules such as proteins. Ancient proteomics may enhance our ability to study remains that are older and in environments inhospitable to DNA. Fu et al . analyzed ancient proteomic data from a 146,000-year-old cranium from Harbin, China. They identified 95 proteins with sufficient peptides and found that the amino acid variants were consistent with this individual being most closely related to Denisovans. Given the paucity of confirmed Denisovan remains, ancient proteomics may allow the increased identification of such individuals, enabling further study of these enigmatic hominins. —Corinne Simonti Denisovans are a hominin group primarily known through genomes or proteins, but their precise morphological features remain elusive because of the fragmentary nature of the discovered fossils. Here, we report 95 endogenous proteins retrieved from a nearly complete cranium from Harbin, China, dating to at least 146,000 years ago and previously assigned to a new species, Homo longi . This individual has three Denisovan-derived amino acid variants and clusters with Denisova 3, suggesting that the Harbin individual belongs to a Denisovan population.

Administration of ATV cisLALA :Aβ in mice exhibited broad brain distribution and enhanced parenchymal plaque target engagement.

Although mechanisms governing anaphylaxis after intravenous injection are defined in mice, these models neglect mucosal exposure that accompanies ingestion. We investigated the role of mast cells within the intestine of mice and found that oral anaphylaxis required immunoglobulin E–Fcε receptor 1 (IgE-FcεR1) signaling. Intestinal mast cells were a heterogeneous population, shaped by epithelial cues. Compared with connective tissue mast cells found throughout the body, intestinal mast cells largely resided in the epithelium, displayed divergent transcriptomes and effector functions, and had a diminished ability to generate histamine, but they enhanced leukotriene synthesis.

The membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) is a component of the neuronal cytoskeleton mostly found in axons. Heller et al . investigated the dynamics of MPS using live-cell super-resolution imaging. The authors discovered that MPS is remarkably dynamic, undergoing repeated cycles of disassembly and reformation over much of the axon’s length. Mechanistically, MPS remodeling is regulated by calcium ions and involves actin stabilization, calpain-dependent proteolysis, and protein kinase C–mediated adducin phosphorylation. These results provide valuable insights for understanding how cells carry out their most fundamental activities. —Mattia Maroso The membrane skeleton in neurons adopts a periodic lattice structure in which actin filaments, capped by adducin and tropomodulin, form ring-shaped structures connected by spectrin tetramers along neurites. This membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) is important for many neuronal functions. Using live-cell super-resolution imaging, we found that the MPS is surprisingly dynamic, undergoing local disassembly and reformation constitutively in axons. MPS remodeling is driven by calcium signaling, leading to actin-ring destabilization through protein kinase C–mediated adducin phosphorylation and to spectrin degradation by calpain. Formin, an actin-nucleating and -polymerizing enzyme, plays a dual role in MPS remodeling and maintenance. MPS remodeling is enhanced by neuronal activity and functionally facilitates endocytosis. Our results highlight the importance of a dynamic membrane skeletal structure in neuronal function.},

  abstract     = {Quantum ground-state fluctuations are crucial phenomena in nature, affecting various processes, including quantum phase transitions and chemical reactions. Earlier studies on the topic only showed single fluctuating bond angles or bond distances, such as those in triatomic molecules. Richard et al . used the distinctive capabilities of x-ray–induced Coulomb explosion imaging to obtain accurate single-molecule data, which enabled the direct observation of collective fluctuations across all atoms in the complex polyatomic molecule 2-iodopyridine (C 5 H 4 NI). The presented method advances the ability to address various time-resolved chemistry experiments that present a formidable challenge for other time-resolved imaging techniques that typically rely on averaging measurements over many molecules. —Yury Suleymanov Because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the structure of a molecule fluctuates about its mean geometry, even in the ground state. Observing this fundamental quantum effect experimentally—particularly, revealing the collective nature of the structural quantum fluctuations—remains an unmet challenge for complex molecules. In this work, we achieved this for an 11-atom molecule by inducing its Coulomb explosion with an x-ray free-electron laser. We show that the structural fluctuations manifest themselves in correlated variations of ion momenta obtained through coincident detection of the atomic fragments from individual molecules. Our analysis scheme allows extracting these variations, despite our measurements covering only a fraction of the full 33-dimensional momentum space, thereby establishing a general approach for extracting information on high-dimensional structural dynamics using Coulomb explosion.},

  abstract     = {The ability to detect single photons is key to many areas of research, including quantum technologies, astronomy, and spectroscopy. Present state-of-the-art detectors typically operate at ultralow temperatures (below 1 kelvin) and are limited to visible wavelengths. Nowakowski et al . designed a single-photon detector based on moiré superlattice structures comprising graphene and hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures (see the Perspective by Bandurin). Tuning the electronic bands by twisting the layers relative to each other extends the sensitivity to longer wavelengths (above 11 micrometers), and the system is operable at relatively high temperatures (20 kelvin). Because it is compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor processing, this approach can be incorporated into integrated photonic circuits. —Ian S. Osborne Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. In this work, we introduce a single-photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive nonequilibrium electron phases in moiré materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 micrometers) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometers) and temperatures up to 25 kelvin. This detector offers prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility and seamless integration into photonic-integrated circuits. Our analysis suggests that the underlying mechanism originates from superlattice-induced negative differential velocity.},

As the cusps wear out, they are replaced by newly formed teeth from behind. Nemoto et al . expanded on prior studies of these organisms by exploring the molecular mechanism of magnetite biomineralization (see the Perspective by Scheffel). The authors demonstrate that one protein, which they call radular teeth matrix protein 1 (RTMP1), controls iron oxide deposition and differs from other magnetite-precipitating proteins found in magnetotactic bacteria. —Marc S. Lavine Nature builds multiscale mineral structures with impressive mechanical properties through spatially and temporally orchestrated organic-mineral assembly. One example of regulated mineralization is found in hypermineralized and ultrahard magnetic teeth of chiton, which grind on rock to feed on algae. At early stages of tooth formation, iron oxide deposition is controlled using a chiton-specific radular teeth matrix protein 1 (RTMP1), which is transported into teeth through microvilli. RTMP1 spatially and temporally guides and enhances mineralization on chitinous fibers within the tooth, providing a hard, tough, and strong architecture that enables the organism to perform repetitive abrasive events to survive.},

Under applied stress, twins appeared as irregular ellipsoid shapes. The authors studied preferential growth directions and how twinning relates to dislocation accumulation that precedes crack initiation. —Phil Szuromi At two-thirds the weight of aluminum, magnesium alloys have the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of transportation vehicles. These advancements depend on our ability to optimize the desirable versus undesirable effects of deformation twins, which are three-dimensional (3D) microstructural domains that form under mechanical stresses. Previously only characterized through surface or thin-film measurements, we present 3D in situ characterization of deformation twinning inside an embedded grain over mesoscopic fields of view using dark-field x-ray microscopy supported by crystal plasticity finite element analysis. The results revealed the role of triple junctions on twin nucleation and the sequence and irregularity of twin growth and showed that twin-grain junctions, twin-twin junctions, and twin boundaries were the sites of localized dislocation accumulation.},

He et al . formed strong crystalline interfaces between magnetic vanadium selenide monolayers bearing carboxylate groups as a filler within poly(vinylidene fluoride). These interfaces limited polymer chain motion that would otherwise dissipate energy during use. The resulting films had a high magnetocapacitive coefficient of 23.6% and were used as a wrist-wearable sensor that had performance comparable to a standard gaussmeter. —Phil Szuromi Magnetoelectric sensing holds promise for flexible sensors, offering precise detection of both electric and magnetic fields with minimal power consumption. However, its practical use has been constrained by weak magnetoelectric effects and limited overall performance, particularly under mechanical strain. Herein, we fabricated robust magnetoelectric polymer-inorganic nanocomposites through an interfacial cocrystallization strategy. By leveraging diazonium chemistry on vanadium diselenide (VSe 2 ) monolayers, we created a submolecular-flat interface between ferromagnetic VSe 2 and ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocrystals. This highly crystalline interface has few mobile polymer chains and thus limits energy dissipation and enhances interfacial energy transfer. The scalable composite films show exceptional magnetoelectric performance, with a magnetocapacitive coefficient of 23.6%. These films enable ultrafast magnetoelectric detection, approaching a 10-fold increase in speed compared with conventional sensors, and offer opportunities for integrating multifunctional materials such as thermoelectric coolers into wearable devices.},

Diercks et al . investigated whether a highly mutagenic DNA replication system could speed up evolution in Escherichia coli without harming the host genome. They engineered an orthogonal T7 replisome that replicates only target plasmids at mutation rates 100,000 times higher than normal while leaving the rest of the genome unchanged. Using this system, the authors rapidly evolved TEM-1 β-lactamase to gain much stronger resistance to several antibiotics in under a week. This approach could greatly accelerate protein engineering and antibiotic resistance studies. —Di Jiang Systems that perform continuous hypermutation of designated genes without compromising the integrity of the host genome can substantially accelerate the evolution of new or enhanced protein functions. We describe an orthogonal DNA replication system in Escherichia coli based on the controlled expression of the replisome of bacteriophage T7 (T7-ORACLE). The system replicates circular plasmids that enable high transformation efficiencies and seamless integration into standard molecular biology workflows. Engineering of T7 DNA polymerase yielded variant proteins with mutation rates of 1.7 × 10 −5 substitutions per base in vivo—100,000-fold above the genomic mutation rate. We demonstrated continuous evolution using the T7 replisome by expanding the substrate scope of TEM-1 β-lactamase and increasing activity 5000-fold against clinically relevant monobactam and cephalosporin antibiotics in less than 1 week.},

We posit that the multiple components of the immune system each present trade-offs (such as self-defense–self-harm, and investments in memory–retaining flexibility for future responses) that vary through life, and that variation in how immune components balance these trade-offs increases homeostasis to external and internal threats.

Although the location, specificity, and sensitivity of innate pattern recognition receptors and restriction factors are tuned to facilitate discrimination of infecting viruses from those that are part of self, immune cross-reactions do occur. The RTE viral heritage may, therefore, compromise the ability of the host to respond to virus infection without risking pathology.

In many cases, this is likely due to diseases being caused by noncoding genetic variants, which can alter gene expression but are not as well understood as mutations in the coding sequence itself. To detect such disease-causing variants in gene promoters, Jaganathan et al . developed a deep neural network called PromoterAI to specifically identify promoter variants that change gene expression and demonstrated its ability to find genetic diagnoses for patients with rare diseases. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Only a minority of patients with rare genetic diseases are presently diagnosed by exome sequencing, suggesting that additional unrecognized pathogenic variants may reside in noncoding sequence. In this work, we describe PromoterAI, a deep neural network that accurately identifies noncoding promoter variants that dysregulate gene expression. We show that promoter variants with predicted expression-altering consequences produce outlier expression at both the RNA and protein levels in thousands of individuals and that these variants experience strong negative selection in human populations. We observed that clinically relevant genes in patients with rare diseases are enriched for such variants and validated their functional impact through reporter assays. Our estimates suggest that promoter variation accounts for 6% of the genetic burden associated with rare diseases.},

The authors used the raw scenario data from the IIASA AR6 Scenario Explorer to extract the original 36 scenarios used by UNEP to generate this median scenario published in the UNEP Production Gap Report. However, there was a discrepancy in the resulting data because the formula for transposing the median estimate for oil in fig. S1A was incorrect, which is also reflected in the underlying data S1. The UNEP PGR median rate has now been corrected both in fig. S1B and in the data S1 file. The corrected pathway in the UNEP PGR median scenario still falls within the producing and underdevelopment fields, even though it has a slower reduction rate.

Intervention-specific principles need to be embedded within governance at all levels to avoid the worst risks associated with deploying new marine-climate interventions at scale. —Jesse Smith Marine systems are rapidly changing in response to global heating. The scale and intensity of change are triggering a host of novel interventions to sustain oceans and ocean-dependent societies. However, the pace of new interventions is outstripping capacity to prevent unintended consequences because governance systems to ensure responsible transformation of marine systems are not yet in place. Responsible transformation entails transitioning marine systems to sustainable, equitable, and adaptive states through weighing intervention risks against benefits, resolving ethical liabilities, improving social cobenefits, establishing legitimacy, and managing climate policy integrity.

  abstract     = {To get a handle on what falls apart during aging in the brain, Di Fraia et al . turned to the short-lived killifish (see the Perspective by Dionne and Laurent). The authors monitored changes in protein and RNA abundance, protein solubility, post-translational modification, and organelle composition as the fish aged. As organisms age, protein abundance is less closely coupled to transcript abundance. In the fish, this appeared to have less to do with protein stability and was more likely influenced by altered translation. Proteins rich in basic amino acids, a characteristic of RNA and DNA binding proteins, had delays in translation and decreased in abundance. Changes in mitochondrial composition were also noted as likely contributors to loss of function in aging. —L. Bryan Ray Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegeneration and is characterized by diverse cellular and molecular hallmarks. To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain’s biology—the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.},

  abstract     = {Rings provide a wealth of information on how trees have responded to past environmental change. However, a relative lack of tree-ring data from the tropics limits inferences on these globally important ecosystems. Zuidema et al . compiled tree-ring data from 150 species in sites spanning the tropics and subtropics to determine how tropical trees have responded to drought since 1930. Overall, drought had surprisingly small effects on tree growth, and these deficits were mostly offset by higher growth in the wettest years. Gymnosperms experienced larger growth deficits, especially during the dry season, whereas wet-season droughts were more detrimental for angiosperms. Increasing drought frequency and severity may lead to stronger growth deficits. —Bianca Lopez Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.},

  abstract     = {A major difference between macroscopic and molecular machines is that on their relative scales, macroscopic machines tend to stay still when they are off. Atomic manipulation is instead a process of choreographing constant motion. Much of the recent focus has been on implementing rotors that spin in just one direction. Wachsmuth et al . have now put this type of rotor to work to produce linked rings (see the Perspective by Beves). Successive photochemical and thermal steps twist a cyclic backbone into a braid, and snipping ester connections then produces the catenane motif upon relaxation. —Jake S. Yeston Precise mechanical manipulation of molecules is inherently difficult owing to random thermal motion. Although directed movement on the molecular scale has been achieved, using it to impose specific—especially energetically disfavored—shapes on molecules and construct mechanically interlocked structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules.},

  abstract     = {At appropriate temperatures, the tops of many clouds can be composed of either ice crystals or liquid water droplets. This difference affects their radiative properties and their precipitation behavior, which are important factors for climate projections or weather forecasting. Villanueva et al . combined observations and laboratory measurements to demonstrate that the proportion of ice-topped clouds is correlated with the abundance of dust particles in them. This confirms a relationship that has long been suggested but never demonstrated. —Jesse Smith Clouds between −39° and 0°C can be topped by a liquid or ice layer, which affects their radiative forcing and precipitation. The cloud-top ice-to-total frequency (ITF) quantifies the occurrence of clouds with an ice top relative to total cloud occurrence, but the factors controlling ITF are poorly understood. Using 35 years of satellite data, we show that in the Northern Hemisphere, between −15° and −30°C, dust aerosol is strongly correlated with ITF in both time and space. Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.},

  abstract     = {Dynamically tunable metasurfaces have a wide range of applications in beam steering, sensing, communication, and display technologies. However, fast electrical tuning exceeding gigahertz frequencies of the resonant antennas that make up a metasurface remains challenging. Selvin et al . adapted a nanoparticle-on-mirror approach to combine plasmonic and soft materials, thus creating a nanophotonic platform in which a metallic nanostructure serves as both a mechanical and optical resonator. An ultrathin polymer layer is placed between the nanoparticles and a mirror. Actuation with surface acoustic waves is then used to change the separation between the nanoparticle and the mirror, thereby shifting the resonant response. Modulating the response up to gigahertz, this approach provides a route to achieve fast dynamic control of metasurface response. —Ian S. Osborne The important role of metallic nanostructures in nanophotonics will expand if ways to electrically manipulate their optical resonances at high speed can be identified. We capitalized on electrically driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We placed gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultraconfined geometries.},

One of its high-field superconducting phases has been observed to appear only at fields higher than 40 tesla and tilted from the crystallographic b-axis toward the c-axis. Lewin et al . mapped out the boundaries of this phase by performing transport measurements and found that the phase wraps around the b-axis in a halo-like fashion. —Jelena Stajic The heavy fermion material UTe 2 is a candidate topological superconductor that exhibits multiple magnetic field–induced superconducting phases. One such phase exists only at fields greater than 40 tesla, a considerable scale given its critical temperature of only 2 K. Here, we extend measurements of this state with fields outside of the bc crystallographic plane and reveal its core structure: The superconducting phase wraps around the b axis in a halo-like fashion and appears to be stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. This angle dependence points to a multicomponent spin-triplet order parameter with a finite angular momentum of the Cooper pairs.

Transistors based on aluminum GaN/GaN heterostructures that support a two-dimensional electron gas have high carrier mobility but also high leakage currents. Khan et al . grew a hafnia-zirconia layer on the GaN-capping layer to boost capacitance past the electrostatic limit of a Schottky gate. Unlike a conventional dielectric layer, the ferroic layer also increased the on-state current of the device. —Phil Szuromi For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well—such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures—a Schottky gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO 2 - ZrO 2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG.},

In this TAD, we uncovered genetic circuits for metabolic responses and hibernation-linked cis elements forming regulatory contacts with neighboring genes.

We can look back at fossils and identify changes over time, but it is difficult to identify another key component of adaptation in the fossil record: that of behavior. The theory of behavioral drive posits that behavioral change can expose animals to new selective regimes, leading to adaptive morphological change over time. Fannin et al . looked at isotopes in hominin fossils to characterize a dietary shift to graminoid plants, finding that this shift predated adaptive tooth changes by 700,000 years and confirming the presence of behavioral drive. —Sacha Vignieri Dietary shifts and corresponding morphological changes can sometimes evolve in succession, not concurrently—an evolutionary process called behavioral drive. Detecting behavioral drive in the fossil record is challenging because it is difficult to measure behaviors independently from corresponding morphologies. To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms can probe excitations in many-body systems by injecting a finite density of excitations and observing the subsequent dynamics. Chen et al . performed such a quench spectroscopy experiment using a two-dimensional array of rubidium-87 atoms trapped in optical tweezers. After initializing the system in a state with dipolar ferromagnetic interactions, the researchers found that the excitations behaved as long-lived spin waves. The frustrated nature of antiferromagnetic interactions, in contrast, led to strong damping. —Jelena Stajic The nature and spectrum of elementary excitations are defining features of a many-body system. In this study, we used a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrated the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.},

  abstract     = {Intense research efforts are focused on the development of a human vaccine to prevent HIV infection. However, a preventative HIV vaccine has been challenging to develop for several reasons. An effective vaccine would likely need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can recognize diverse viral strains and ideally target multiple epitopes on the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Caniels et al . report on a human phase 1 clinical that uses a germline-targeting strategy for inducing HIV bnAbs against the conserved CD4-binding site and the trimer apex (see the Perspective by Permar and Wilson). Most vaccine recipients induced the desired precursor B cells for bNAbs. These bnAb precursor responses were structurally extremely similar to existing bnAbs, so the study provides proof of concept for atomic precision vaccination in humans. —Priscilla N. Kelly A protective HIV vaccine will need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans, but priming rare bnAb precursor B cells has been challenging. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 human clinical trial, the recombinant, germline-targeting envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer BG505 SOSIP.v4.1-GT1.1, adjuvanted with AS01 B , induced bnAb precursors of the VRC01-class at a high frequency in the majority of vaccine recipients. These bnAb precursors, which target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design.},

  abstract     = {Intense research efforts are focused on the development of an effective HIV vaccine for humans. Willis et al . tested a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine strategy to help the immune system create rare antibodies capable of blocking many HIV strains (see the Perspective by Permar and Wilson). In two clinical trials, one in the US and one in Rwanda and South Africa, an initial vaccine activated the appropriate precursor immune cells in nearly all participants. In the US trial, a second, slightly different booster shot guided early immune cell maturation, a step toward antibodies with the potential to protect against HIV. Some participants experienced skin reactions, underscoring the need for further study and mitigation efforts. Overall, these findings provide clinical proof of concept for using mRNA technology to initiate an early immune response. —Priscilla N. Kelly A leading HIV vaccine strategy requires a priming immunogen to induce broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) precursors, followed by a series of heterologous boosters to elicit somatic hypermutation (SHM) and produce bnAbs. In two randomized, open-label phase 1 human clinical trials, IAVI G002 in the United States and IAVI G003 in Rwanda and South Africa (IAVI, International Aids Vaccine Initiative), we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-encoded nanoparticles as priming immunogens (both trials) and first-boosting immunogens (IAVI G002). The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except that 18% of IAVI G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development; and elicited antibodies exhibited precise bnAb structural mimicry. The results establish clinical proof of concept that heterologous boosting can advance bnAb precursor maturation and demonstrate bnAb priming in Africa, where the HIV burden is highest.},

  abstract     = {It is known that mitochondria are responsible for generating energy through a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), that they contain their own genome, and that they are built of mitochondrially and nuclear-encoded components. However, the mechanisms underlying the expression of mitochondrial genes, which are essential to building the OXPHOS system, are poorly understood. Cruz-Zaragoza et al . developed an approach to selectively silence specific mitochondria-encoded messenger RNAs in living cells, which allowed them to study the dynamics of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Applying this silencing technique revealed how mitochondrial gene expression affects cellular homeostasis. —Stella M. Hurtley Mitochondria fulfill central functions in metabolism and energy supply. They express their own genome, which encodes key subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system. However, the central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic, and a lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. We silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in RAS genes are common drivers of human tumor growth. The most common RAS mutation, KRAS G12D, introduces an aspartate residue that has been challenging to target using conventional drug design approaches. Weller et al . developed a series of compounds to target KRAS G12D by using a RAS inhibitor that induced a protein-protein interaction between RAS and cyclophilin A, a cellular chaperone protein. The compound harnessed the protein interface to catalyze irreversible inhibition of the aspartate in mutant RAS, which was dependent on cyclophilin A. The resulting inhibitors included zoldonrasib, which when dosed orally in mice, irreversibly modified mutant RAS and reduced tumor growth in experimental models of lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer. —Priscilla N. Kelly Mutant RAS proteins are among the most prevalent drivers of human cancer, and the glycine to aspartic acid mutation at codon 12 (G12D) is the most common variant. Mutation-selective covalent inhibitors spare RAS in healthy tissue and enable extended pharmacodynamic effect, but covalent targeting of RAS G12D is hindered by low nucleophilicity and high proteomic abundance of carboxylic acids. We overcame these challenges with compounds that bind cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic protein-protein interface between CYPA and active RAS that enables selective, enzyme-like rate enhancement of the covalent reaction between D12 and electrophilic warheads with exceptionally low intrinsic reactivity. This approach yielded orally bioavailable compounds with marked antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models of KRAS G12D cancers, including the investigational agent zoldonrasib (RMC-9805) currently undergoing clinical evaluation (NCT06040541).},

We identified SIRal, a human protein with a SIRim domain (subtype of SIR2) that plays a pivotal role in the animal Toll-like receptor pathway of innate immunity and protects against bacterial and viral infections. Proteins containing a SIRim domain are found across 19% of eukaryotic genomes, including zebrafish, where SIRal plays a role in inflammation.

  abstract     = {Globular proteins typically have a stable and densely packed core. Whether mutations are detrimental thus depends on context, and one residue change can potentially be mitigated by another. Escobedo et al . systematically randomized a small set of hydrophobic residues in the cores of three well-studied globular proteins and evaluated the effects on stability and partner binding. There were many possible core residue combinations that retained thermal stability, and a simple energetic model was trained to predict functional cores. This work helps to demystify allosteric interactions in protein structure and lends support to efforts to engineer surface and core sequences. —Michael A. Funk A lack of systematic experimental data limits our understanding of protein evolution. In this study, we experimentally characterized proteins with randomized sequences. Vast numbers of amino acid combinations constitute stable protein cores and surfaces. However, alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function by indirect allosteric effects. Both protein stability and binding can be predicted using simple additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. Indeed, energy models trained on one protein can predict functional cores and surfaces across more than a billion years of evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins. Our results reveal the simple energetic architecture of proteins and suggest that allostery is an important constraint on sequence evolution.},

The rotationally aligned regions in these superlattices are separated by networks of stacking faults that can host ultrasoft shear modes, or phasons, with frequencies less than one wavenumber that are inaccessible using conventional vibrational spectroscopy. Imaging by Zhang et al . at a resolution of under 15 picometers revealed that these spatially localized, anisotropic vibrations dominated the thermal vibrations (see the Perspective by Susi). —Phil Szuromi Twisted two-dimensional materials exhibit distinctive vibrational modes called moiré phonons, which arise from the moiré superlattice. Here, we demonstrate atom-by-atom imaging of phasons, an ultrasoft class of moiré phonons in twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ). Using ultrahigh-resolution (<15 picometers) electron ptychography, we imaged the size and shape of each atom to extract time-averaged vibrational amplitudes as a function of twist angle and position. We observed several signature properties of moiré phasons, such as increased vibrational amplitudes at solitons and AA-stacked regions. By correlating experiments with molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, we show that phasons dominate the thermal vibrations in low-angle twisted bilayers. These results represent a powerful route to image thermal vibrations at atomic resolution, unlocking experimental studies of a thus far hidden branch of moiré phonon physics.},

Extending this Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect to larger systems requires an increasing number of bulky optical components that would be practically infeasible. Yousef et al . report on the use of metasurfaces as a multiport HOM interferometer and related quantum correlation measurements (see the Perspective by Shcherbakov). They also introduce a graph-theoretic formalism that represents both metasurface-based quantum optics and the resulting nonclassical correlation landscape. Such graphs can be used for the design of scalable, low-decoherence quantum information infrastructures. —Ian S. Osborne Multiphoton interference and entanglement are fundamental to quantum information science, yet extending these effects to higher-dimensional systems remains challenging given the imperfections and complexity of scaling conventional linear-optical setups. We present a generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel effect using metasurfaces and graph theory, achieving controlled multiphoton bunching, antibunching, and entanglement across parallel Jones matrix–encoded spatial modes—all within a single-layer metasurface. A graph-theoretic dual framework is introduced that simultaneously encodes the metasurface-based multiport interferometer designs and its resulting nonclassical correlations, enabling the direct translation of linear quantum optical networks into a single-layer metasurface. We also demonstrate the ability of metasurfaces to produce multipath-entangled states and perform transformations equivalent to higher-order Hadamard interferometers.

Two papers in this issue target PI3K signaling in different ways and for different effects (see the Perspective by Solinas). Simanshu et al . developed a small molecule that inhibits activation of PI3Kα by members of the Ras family of small guanosine triphosphatases. The compound effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice, but because insulin signaling does not require Ras proteins, it does so without hyperglycemic side effects. It was also effective against tumors promoted by excessive human epidermal growth factor receptor activity. Terayama et al . describe small-molecule PI3Kα activators that could regulate blood glucose concentrations in rat muscle cells in culture without the hormone insulin. These compounds functioned in an unusual manner by enhancing the binding of rat sarcoma (RAS) family proteins to PI3Kα by nearly three orders of magnitude. Their effectiveness in ameliorating hyperglycemia in a rat model of diabetes indicates that they may prove useful as therapeutic agents for the control of blood glucose without the use of insulin. —L. Bryan Ray While exploring strategies to control blood glucose concentrations in diabetes, we identified so-called molecular glues D223 and D927 that promote glucose uptake in the absence of insulin. They act by increasing the binding affinity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase α (PI3Kα) catalytic subunit p110α to canonical small guanosine triphosphatase RAS proteins and to RRAS, RRAS2, and MRAS by three orders of magnitude. The compounds bind to the RAS-binding domain of p110α, stabilizing the secondary structures of the PI3Kα in a RAS-binding conformation and forming direct interactions with RAS residues tyrosine-40 and arginine-41. In vivo, D927 mimicked the effects of insulin: It rapidly lowered blood glucose concentrations, enhanced glucose metabolism in normal and Zucker fatty rats, and improved hyperglycemia in models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, even in insulin-deficient diabetic animals.},

  abstract     = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established to protect marine ecosystems, in particular fish populations. However, these areas vary in the established level of protection, from complete prohibition of fishing and other uses to limiting these activities. It is also unclear to what degree these regions actually achieve the stated protection levels. In a pair of papers, authors using relatively similar data and approaches reveal seemingly contrary results. Seguin et al . found a continued unauthorized presence of fishing vessels in MPAs of all protection levels. By contrast, Raynor et al . found very little vessel activity in MPAs with the stricter protections. The authors discuss possible drivers underlying the differences (see the Perspective by Worm). —Sacha Vignieri Marine protected areas (MPAs) are expanding worldwide, but industrial fishing within their boundaries remains poorly understood. By combining vessel Global Positioning System data with satellite imagery, we detected industrial fishing in 47% of coastal MPAs worldwide between 2022 and 2024, with two-thirds of vessel detections (67%) untracked by public monitoring. These untracked vessels were most prevalent (80%) in MPAs with the most restrictive management category, which aims to prohibit all extractive activities. The presence and density of fishing vessels were mainly driven by the size and remoteness of MPAs rather than their management category itself. Including untracked vessels increased estimated fishing effort within MPAs by 28%, to an average of 4 hours per square kilometer per year. These results highlight the continued presence of industrial fishing vessels in MPAs and an important gap in our understanding of fishing pressure on protected areas worldwide.},

  abstract     = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established to protect marine ecosystems, in particular fish populations. However, these areas vary in the established level of protection, from complete prohibition of fishing and other uses to limiting these activities. It is also unclear to what degree these regions actually achieve the stated protection levels. In a pair of papers, authors using relatively similar data and approaches reveal seemingly contrary results. Seguin et al . found a continued unauthorized presence of fishing vessels in MPAs of all protection levels. By contrast, Raynor et al . found very little vessel activity in MPAs with the stricter protections. The authors discuss possible drivers underlying the differences (see the Perspective by Worm). —Sacha Vignieri There is a widespread perception that illegal fishing is common in marine protected areas (MPAs) due to strong incentives for poaching and the high cost of monitoring and enforcement. Using artificial intelligence and satellite-based Earth observations, we provide estimates of industrial fishing activity in fully and highly protected MPAs worldwide, in which such fishing is banned. We find little to no activity in most cases. On average, these MPAs had just one fishing vessel present per 20,000 square kilometers during the satellite overpass, a density nine times lower than that of the unprotected waters of exclusive economic zones.},

Ross Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules present peptides derived from intracellular antigens on the cell surface for immune surveillance. Proteins that recognize peptide–MHC-I (pMHCI) complexes with specificity for diseased cells could have considerable therapeutic utility. Specificity requires recognition of outward-facing amino acid residues within the disease-associated peptide as well as avoidance of extensive contacts with ubiquitously expressed MHC. We used RFdiffusion to design pMHCI-binding proteins that make extensive contacts with the peptide and identified specific binders for 11 target pMHCs starting from either experimental or predicted pMHCI structures. Upon incorporation into chimeric antigen receptors, designs for eight targets conferred peptide-specific T cell activation. Our approach should have broad utility for both protein- and cell-based pMHCI targeting.},

Ross The recognition of intracellular antigens by CD8 + T cells through T cell receptors (TCRs) is central for adaptive immunity against infections and cancer. However, the identification of TCRs from patient material remains complex. We present a rapid de novo minibinder (miBd) design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models to engineer miBds targeting the cancer-associated peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) SLLMWITQC/HLA-A*02:01 (NY-ESO-1). Incorporating in silico cross-panning enabled computational prescreening of specificity, and molecular dynamics simulations allowed for improved predictability of in vitro success. We identified a high-affinity NY-ESO-1 binder and confirmed its structure using cryo–electron microscopy, which, when incorporated in a chimeric antigen receptor, induced killing of NY-ESO-1 + melanoma cells. We further designed and validated binders to a neoantigen pMHC complex, RVTDESILSY/HLA-A*01:01, with unknown structure, demonstrating the potential for precision immunotherapy.},

Ross T cell receptor (TCR) mimics offer a promising platform for tumor-specific targeting of peptide–major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) in cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we designed a de novo α-helical TCR mimic (TCRm) specific for the NY-ESO-1 peptide presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–A*02, achieving high on-target specificity with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant K d = 9.5 nM). The structure of the TCRm-pMHC complex at 2.05-Å resolution revealed a rigid TCR-like docking mode with an unusual degree of focus on the up-facing NY-ESO-1 side chains, suggesting the potential for reduced off-target reactivity. Indeed, a structure-informed in silico screen of 14,363 HLA-A*02 peptides correctly predicted two off-target peptides, yet our TCRm maintained peptide selectivity and cytotoxicity as a T cell engager. These results represent a path for precision targeting of tumor antigens with peptide-focused α-helical TCR mimics.},

  abstract     = {Ocean surface temperatures vary from year to year, experiencing heat waves like those felt on land, but 2023 saw an extraordinarily large increase in marine heat waves with no recent analog. Dong et al . report that 2023 set new records in the duration, extent, and intensity of these events by as much as three standard deviations above the historical average of the past four decades. The increasing trends in marine heat waves present intensifying dangers to ecological, social, and economic systems. —Jesse Smith The year 2023 witnessed an extraordinary surge in marine heatwaves (MHWs) across Earth’s oceans, setting new records in duration, extent, and intensity, with MHW activity totaling 53.6 billion °C days square kilometer—more than three standard deviations above the historical norm since 1982. Notable events include the North Atlantic MHW (276-year return period) and the Southwest Pacific (141 years). Using ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean-Phase II) high-resolution daily data, we conducted a mixed-layer heat budget analysis and identified region-specific drivers: enhanced shortwave flux and a shallower mixed layer in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, reduced cloud cover and increased advection in the Southwest Pacific, and oceanic advections in the Tropical Eastern Pacific. The 2023 MHWs highlight the intensifying impacts of a warm climate and the challenges in understanding extreme events.},

  abstract     = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has important roles in receptor signaling that control many processes, including cell growth and metabolism. Two papers in this issue target PI3K signaling in different ways and for different effects (see the Perspective by Solinas). Simanshu et al . developed a small molecule that inhibits activation of PI3Kα by members of the Ras family of small guanosine triphosphatases. The compound effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice, but because insulin signaling does not require Ras proteins, it does so without hyperglycemic side effects. It was also effective against tumors promoted by excessive human epidermal growth factor receptor activity. Terayama et al . describe small-molecule PI3Kα activators that could regulate blood glucose concentrations in rat muscle cells in culture without the hormone insulin. These compounds functioned in an unusual manner by enhancing the binding of rat sarcoma (RAS) family proteins to PI3Kα by nearly three orders of magnitude. Their effectiveness in ameliorating hyperglycemia in a rat model of diabetes indicates that they may prove useful as therapeutic agents for the control of blood glucose without the use of insulin. —L. Bryan Ray BBO-10203 is an orally available drug that covalently and specifically binds to the rat sarcoma (RAS)–binding domain of phosphoinositide 3-kinase α (PI3Kα), preventing its activation by HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS. It inhibited PI3Kα activation in tumors with oncogenic mutations in KRAS or PIK3CA and in tumors with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification or overexpression. In preclinical models, BBO-10203 caused significant tumor growth inhibition across multiple tumor types and showed enhanced efficacy in combination with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6), estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, and KRAS-G12C mutant, including in tumors harboring mutations in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11). Notably, these antitumor effects occurred without inducing hyperglycemia, because insulin signaling does not depend on RAS-mediated PI3Kα activation to promote glucose uptake.},

The former seems to have arrived in the Americas with European colonization, and the latter has only recently been discovered there. Lopopolo et al . show that M. lepromatosis infected humans before European contact. These bacteria cannot be cultured, but a genome was assembled de novo in a single contig from long M. lepromatosis DNA taken from a mouse footpad inoculated with a Costa Rican strain. Phylogenetic reconstruction using ancient and contemporary M. lepromatosis sequences detected distinct precolonial and postcolonial clades. Screening of samples from precontact ancestors uncovered three positive samples spanning the length of the Americas. Whether M. lepromatosis was the endemic New World leprosy and M. leprae the Old World form will not be clear until more comprehensive sampling is done. —Caroline Ash Leprosy, caused primarily by Mycobacterium leprae , is considered a disease introduced into the Americas during European colonization. However, the recent discovery of a second pathogen causing leprosy, M. lepromatosis , mainly found in the Americas, challenges this view. Here, we show that M. lepromatosis infected humans in the Americas before European contact. By screening 389 ancient and 408 contemporary samples, we have expanded the genetic data available for the species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct human-infecting clades of M. lepromatosis , with one dominating North America since colonial times. The presence of millennia-old strains in North and South America indicates that M. lepromatosis may have been widespread during the Late Holocene, demonstrating that M. lepromatosis leprosy has a long-standing history in the Americas before European arrival.},

Labade et al . developed a method to sequence the genome directly within physically expanded nuclei, enhancing imaging resolution. Using this approach, they examined how the three-dimensional organization of active and inactive chromatin changes in progeria, an accelerated aging disorder marked by nuclear lamina defects. This technique enables direct connections between nuclear morphology and alterations in genome architecture. —Di Jiang Microscopy and genomics are used to characterize cell function, but approaches to connect the two types of information are lacking, particularly at subnuclear resolution. Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and super-resolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. Applying ExIGS to progeria-derived fibroblasts revealed that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant chromatin regulation that may erode cell identity. Lamin was found to generally repress transcription, suggesting that variation in nuclear morphology may affect gene regulation across tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform with which to link nuclear abnormalities to gene regulation, offering insights into disease mechanisms.},

These values have also been updated in the main text on pages 2 and 3. One sentence on page 4 was updated to reflect an exception to the results. The original sentence, “Despite the lower radiation dose received, which determined the lower 15N-N2O production, the radiation-normalized rates were similar in the three systems at different latitudes (Fig. 3 and table S5),” has been replaced with the following sentences: “The PAR-normalized rates were similar across the three experiments conducted at the same latitude but decreased in experiment 7, which was conducted at a higher latitude and with a lower substrate concentration (Fig. 3 and table S5). The UVB-normalized rate was not calculated in experiment 7 because UVB was not recorded.” These corrections do not affect the interpretations of the data or the conclusions of the paper.},

Wu et al . developed an in silico design pipeline to create specific and high-affinity binders for a wide range of disordered peptides or proteins (see the Perspective by Moses and Forman-Kay). The authors generated a diverse panel of binder scaffolds that could then be specialized to improve the fit to a target peptide. Experimental validation confirmed the accuracy and specificity of 39 binder designs. The authors suggest potential applications in cellular imaging, in vitro peptide capture, and modulating cell signaling pathways. —Michael A. Funk Intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides play key roles in biology, but a lack of defined structures and high variability in sequence and conformational preferences have made targeting such systems challenging. We describe a general approach for designing proteins that bind intrinsically disordered protein regions in diverse extended conformations with side chains fitting into complementary binding pockets. We used the approach to design binders for 39 highly diverse unstructured targets, including polar targets, and obtained designs with 100-picomolar to 100-nanomolar affinities in 34 cases, testing ~22 designs per target. The designs function in cells and as detection reagents and are specific for their intended targets in all-by-all binding experiments.

  abstract     = {The nucleosome, the smallest unit of packaged eukaryotic DNA, occludes about 150 base pairs and must be precisely positioned to regulate DNA replication and transcription. INO80, a chromatin remodeler, repositions nucleosomes in response to flanking DNA length. Kaur et al . used structural and biochemical analyses to show that when flanking DNA is short, the Arp8 module of INO80 adopts a brake-like conformation, slowing nucleosome sliding. Longer flanking DNA releases this brake, increasing sliding by about 100-fold. This work reveals how INO80 finely tunes nucleosome placement using a switch-like mechanism sensitive to DNA context. —Di Jiang Increasing the flanking DNA from 40 to 80 base pairs (bp) causes ~100-fold faster nucleosome sliding by INO80. A prevalent hypothesis posits that the Arp8 module within INO80 enables a ruler-like activity. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we show that on nucleosomes with 40 bp of flanking DNA, the Arp8 module rotates 180° away from the DNA. Deleting the Arp8 module enables rapid sliding irrespective of flanking DNA length. Thus, rather than enabling a ruler-like activity, the Arp8 module acts as a brake on INO80 remodeling when flanking DNA is short. This autoinhibition–based mechanism has broad implications for understanding how primitive nucleosome mobilization enzymes may have evolved into sophisticated remodelers.},

In the aftermath, infection rates by the mosquito-vectored parasite increased to 10% for school-aged children within 3 months as mosquito and malaria control activities were interrupted. Modeling showed that the recently available vaccines supply prolonged protection (up to 10 months) against repeat malaria infections and offer a sustainable instrument for health resilience in the wake of climate change. —Caroline Ash Extreme weather is common in high malaria burden areas and is likely to increase in severity owing to climate change–related severe weather events. Yet, data on infection rates after these events and the consequences for planning disease control programs remain rare. Data on malaria infection in the wake of major tropical cyclones in Madagascar show that infection is likely to rebound rapidly during the gaps in interventions that occur after extreme events. Relative to other control options, recently available malaria vaccines have a longer duration of protection, with the potential to address interruptions in prevention and treatment deployment.

Using in vitro preparations, Yang et al . showed that polyGly peptides cause toxic aggregates that recruit the entire transfer RNA (tRNA) ligase complex (tRNA-LC) through FAM98B, a subunit of the tRNA-LC with unknown functions (see the Perspective by Kapur and Ackerman). Importantly, in tissue from patients affected by polyGly-related disorders, the authors identified FAM98B depletion and tRNA-processing defects, suggesting a pathological link between protein aggregation and tRNA biogenesis defects. —Mattia Maroso Aggregation-prone polyglycine-containing proteins produced from expanded GGC repeats are implicated in an emerging family of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we showed that polyglycine itself forms aggregates that incorporate endogenous glycine-rich proteins, including FAM98B, a component of the transfer RNA (tRNA) ligase complex (tRNA-LC) that harbors the most glycine-rich sequence in the human proteome. Through this glycine-rich intrinsically disordered region (IDR), polyglycine sequesters and depletes the tRNA-LC, disrupting tRNA processing. Accordingly, patient tissues revealed aggregate-associated FAM98B depletion and accumulation of aberrant tRNA splicing intermediates. Furthermore, Fam98b depletion in adult mice caused progressive motor coordination deficits and hindbrain pathology. Our data suggest that the FAM98B glycine-rich IDR mechanistically links previously disparate neurodegenerative disorders of protein aggregation and tRNA processing.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiota has long been an aspirational target for clinical delivery of therapeutics. Successful therapy by this route depends on ensuring engraftment of the therapeutic organisms and their clearance after treatment. Whitaker et al . have engineered a strain of Bacteroides vulgatus , which is commonly found in the gut of healthy humans, with two genetic modules. One is therapeutic to rectify oxalate metabolism for preventing kidney stone formation, and the second adds multiple biosafety promoters that make the organism reliant on an essential nutrient, in this case porphyrin. Although the approach is very promising therapeutically, so far it is still encountering problems with horizontal gene transfer creating “biosafety escape” mutants. —Caroline Ash Precision microbiome programming for therapeutic applications is limited by challenges in achieving reproducible colonic colonization. Previously, we created an exclusive niche that we used to engraft engineered bacteria into diverse microbiota in mice by using a porphyran prebiotic. Building on this approach, we have now engineered conditional attenuation into a porphyran-utilizing strain of Phocaeicola vulgatus by replacing native essential gene regulation with a porphyran-inducible promoter to allow reversible engraftment. Engineering a five-gene oxalate degradation pathway into the reversibly engrafting strain resulted in a therapeutic candidate that reduced hyperoxaluria, a cause of kidney stones, in preclinical models. Our phase 1/2a clinical trial demonstrated porphyran dose–dependent abundance and reversible engraftment in humans, reduction of oxalate in the urine, and characterized genetic stability challenges to achievinglong-term treatment.},

Transistor array devices had extremely high mobility and a near Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing, with an average value as low as 67 millivolts per decade. —Phil Szuromi Two-dimensional (2D) indium selenide, with its low effective mass, high thermal velocity, and exceptional electronic mobility, is a promising semiconductor for surpassing silicon electronics, but grown films have not achieved performance comparable with that of exfoliated micrometer-scale flakes. We report a solid‒liquid‒solid strategy that converts amorphous indium selenide films into pure-phase, high-crystallinity indium selenide wafers by creating an indium-rich liquid interface and maintaining a strict 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of indium to selenium. The as-obtained indium selenide films exhibit exceptional uniformity, a pure phase, and a high crystallinity across an entire ~5-centimeter wafer. Transistor arrays based on the produced indium selenide wafers demonstrate outstanding electronic performance surpassing that of all 2D film-based devices, including an extremely high mobility (averaging as high as 287 square centimeters per volt-second) and a near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing (averaging as low as 67 millivolts per decade) at room temperature.},

Puriņš et al . used photochemistry to slice into six-membered pyridine, add in a nitrogen, and expel the carbon. Li et al . started with five-membered pyrrolidine and introduced the nitrogen through ring expansion. —Jake S. Yeston Pairs of heterocycles differing by a single constitutive ring atom can exhibit stark differences in the retrosynthetic disconnections available for their preparation. Such a synthesis gap is exemplified by pyridine and pyridazine. Pyridine (a six-membered C 5 N ring) has risen to prominence in discovery chemistry, its ease of assembly spurring further synthetic development. Despite a host of favorable properties, pyridazine (an analogous C 4 N 2 ring) has comparatively lagged behind—a discrepancy attributable to its often-challenging preparation, which arises from an electronically dissonant heteroatom arrangement. In this work, we achieve a single-atom skeletal edit that produces pyridazines from pyridines by direct carbon-to-nitrogen atom replacement: Azide introduction at the ortho position enables a photoinitiated rearrangement of N -amino-2-azidopyridinium cations. This transformation links the two heterocycles such that the richness of pyridine retrosynthesis becomes available to pyridazines.},

Pang et al . developed a two-dimensional channel–confined method to make dome-celled aerogels from a wide range of oxides, carbides, metals, and even high-entropy mixtures. The dome shape imbues the aerogels with mechanical and thermal robustness, allowing them to undergo thousands of compressive cycles up to 99% strain and wide-temperature-change thermal shock. Many of the carbides also have very low thermal conductivity even at high temperatures. —Marc S. Lavine Aerogels are known for their high porosity and very low density and can be made from a range of materials, but are limited by structural instability under extreme thermomechanical conditions. We report on 194 types of dome-celled ultralight aerogels that maintain superior elasticity spanning from 4.2 kelvin (K) to 2273 K, realized by a two-dimensional channel–confined chemistry method. Such aerogels exhibit superelasticity under 99% strain for 20,000 cycles and thermal shock resistance at 2273 K over 100 cycles. The high-entropy carbide aerogel achieves a thermal conductivity of 53.4 mW·m −1 ·K −1 at 1273 K and 171.1 mW·m −1 ·K −1 at 2273 K.

Onesto et al . developed human floor plate organoids from stem cells and integrated them with spinal cord organoids to create human midline assembloids. Using this system, the authors profiled the secretome of human floor plate cells and discovered proteins that were not found to be expressed by the mouse floor plate. Functional work revealed new players in axon guidance during midline crossing. This approach is well suited to revealing distinctive aspects of human commissural axon guidance that might be otherwise difficult to approach experimentally. —Mattia Maroso Organizers orchestrate cell patterning and axon guidance in the developing nervous system. Although nonhuman models have led to fundamental discoveries about floor plate (FP)–mediated midline organization, an experimental model of the human FP would enable insights into human neurodevelopment and midline connectivity. Here, we developed organoids resembling human FP (hFpOs) and assembled them with human spinal cord organoids (hSpOs) to generate midline assembloids (hMAs). We demonstrate that hFpOs promote ventral patterning, commissural axon guidance, and bilateral connectivity. To investigate midline regulators, we profiled the hFpO secretome, identifying 27 human-enriched genes compared with mouse. In an arrayed CRISPR screen of hMAs, we discovered that loss of GALNT2 and PLD3 impaired FP–mediated guidance of axons.

These EOs use “color-blind” language and ideology (4)—unfounded claims that structural racism no longer exists (4, 5)—to attempt to create a false narrative that ongoing “preferential treatment” for people in protected categories leads to favoritism that must be eliminated in the name of fairness. To provide a clearer understanding of who benefits and suffers from racism in the US, and how inequities can be addressed, politicians, scientists, and the public must recognize that color-blind language perpetuates structural racism and avoid its use (4).},

  abstract     = {As roots grow through soil, they must integrate information about their environment to generate internal signals to direct their growth. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often produced in response to stresses such as drought. Roy et al . uncovered a link between ROS and the phytohormone auxin during root responses to drought. The authors found that drought-induced ROS stimulate redox-dependent multimerization of the auxin-signaling protein IAA3. The formation of IAA3 multimers influences how these proteins interact with additional auxin-signaling machinery that can repress downstream gene expression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how environmental cues can influence plant development.—Madeleine Seale Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as key signals in plant adaptation to environmental stresses, such as drought. Roots respond to transient water unavailability by temporarily ceasing branching through the acclimative response xerobranching. In this study, we report how a xerobranching stimulus triggers rapid changes of ROS levels in root nuclei, triggering redox-dependent multimerization of the auxin repressor protein IAA3. Mutations in specific cysteine residues of IAA3 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor TPL, thereby attenuating IAA3-mediated target gene repression. Other AUX/IAA proteins also vary in their redox-mediated multimerization, which reveals a regulatory mechanism that connects dynamic changes in cellular redox status to auxin signaling. Our study reveals how ROS, auxin, and water availability intersect and shape root adaptive responses, thereby maintaining phenotypic plasticity in plants.},

  abstract     = {Heterochromatin, marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), is crucial for genome stability and gene repression. However, how cells prevent excessive H3K9me3 accumulation has been unclear. Zhou et al . discovered that the protein ASB7, which is recruited to heterochromatin by heterochromatin protein 1, acts as a negative regulator by promoting the degradation of the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1. During cell division, phosphorylation of ASB7 temporarily prevents this degradation, allowing H3K9me3 restoration. These findings reveal a dynamic feedback circuit that maintains H3K9me3 balance, ensuring proper epigenetic inheritance and preventing harmful over-heterochromatinization. —Di Jiang The maintenance of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) involves the recognition of preexisting modifications by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recruits the methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) to methylate the adjacent newly incorporated histones, establishing a positive feedback loop. However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. We performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5 ASB7 E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation.},

APCs called Thetis cell type IV peaked in abundance around the time of weaning and were required for inducing CD4 + regulatory T cells in response to food antigens in early life. —Sarah H. Ross In the intestine, peripherally induced regulatory T (pT reg ) cells play an essential role in suppressing inflammatory responses to food proteins. However, the identity of the antigen-presenting cells that instruct food-specific pT reg cells is poorly understood. We found that a subset of Thetis cells, TC IV, is required for food-specific pT reg cell differentiation. TC IV were almost exclusively present within mesenteric lymph nodes, suggesting that their presence underlies the phenomenon of oral tolerance. A wave of TC IV differentiation in the periweaning period was associated with a window of opportunity for enhanced pT reg cell generation in response to food antigens. Our findings indicate that TC IV may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of food-associated allergic and inflammatory diseases.},

The upregulation of the neuropeptides was critical for triggering host defense to intestinal helminths, suggesting that bidirectional ENS-immune communication in the gut is critical for regulating intestinal immunity. —Mattia Maroso Enteric nervous system (ENS)–derived neuropeptides modulate immune cell function, yet our understanding of how inflammatory cues directly influence enteric neuron responses during infection is considerably lacking. Here, we characterized a primary enteric sensory neuron (PSN) subset producing the neuropeptides neuromedin U (NMU) and calcitonin gene–related peptide β (CGRPβ) and coexpressing receptors for the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13. Type 2 cytokines amplified NMU and CGRPβ expression in PSNs both in vitro and in vivo, and this was abrogated by PSN-specific Il13ra1 deletion. Deletion of Il13ra1 in PSNs impaired host defense to the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus and blunted muscularis immune responses. Co-administration of NMU23 and CGRPβ rescued helminth clearance deficits and restored anti-helminth immunity, highlighting the essential bidirectional neuroimmune cross-talk regulating intestinal type 2 inflammation.},

Although the glymphatic system in the rodent brain and in rodent models of disease has been intensively studied, we are just beginning to develop the technologies to evaluate it in the human brain. Efforts to rigorously define the impact of glymphatic dysfunction in clinical Alzheimer’s disease remain in their infancy, and no causal role has yet been directly demonstrated. Keil et al . provide a critical review of this field, clearly defining what is and is not currently understood about the role that glymphatic dysfunction plays in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. —Peter Stern Thirteen years after the initial publication defining the glymphatic system, we critically reappraise the role of its dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our understanding of glymphatic function and its involvement in the pathogenesis of AD derives primarily from correlative clinical data and rodent studies. A causal role for glymphatic dysfunction in AD has not yet been established in humans. We review current approaches to assess glymphatic function clinically, which capture different features of perivascular fluid dynamics or their results. The absence of clinically suitable imaging approaches to measuring glymphatic exchange in the human brain is an obstacle to evaluating whether glymphatic function is impaired in AD populations and to developing and evaluating therapeutics to modulate glymphatic function in the treatment and prevention of AD.},

  abstract     = {Early designs for lower limb prosthetics focused on restoring basic movement. There have been advances enabling greater functionality, but these systems are still based on preprogrammed motions using limbs physically separated from the body. Shu et al . hypothesized that if connections could be formed between the soft and hard tissues and the lower leg prosthetic, then this would lead to greater stability and interfacing with the nervous system and enable more flexible and dynamic control (see the Perspective by Fisher). The authors demonstrated this concept by combining an above-knee prosthetic with an osseointegrated mount and an implanted control system to myoelectrially control the knee joint. With minimal training, the additional feedback provided to and from the knee made it easier for test subjects to avoid obstacles. —Marc S. Lavine Lower-extremity prostheses have evolved through mechanical redesigns that prioritize improved cyclic locomotion. However, this limited approach to limb restoration has precluded necessary progress toward recovering the versatile acyclic movements that constitute the remainder of human athleticism. We present an osseointegrated mechanoneural prosthesis that incorporates modified hard and soft tissues along with permanently implanted hardware in a neuroembodied design. We developed a biomimetic coupling between neuromuscular signaling and joint movement that exceeds the versatility of established control methods, which depend upon conventional amputation musculature and surface electromyography. Our findings also reveal that superior residual neuromuscular function can enable prosthetic movement speeds surpassing that of intact physiology. Anatomical prosthetic integration may be necessary for meeting, and possibly exceeding, the movement capabilities of an intact limb.},

  abstract     = {Telomerase maintains chromosome ends (telomeres) and is an essential factor in genome stability, aging, and cancer. Although telomerase is known to function as a monomer, evidence has hinted at a possible dimeric form. Using cryo–electron microscopy, Balch et al . resolved the structure of a catalytically active telomerase dimer, revealing that it forms through interactions mediated by the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein. Mutations at this interface are linked to premature aging disorders. Disrupting dimerization impairs telomerase assembly and telomere maintenance, suggesting that the dimer acts as an assembly intermediate. These findings reshape our understanding of telomerase biogenesis and its regulation in cells. —Di Jiang Telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) synthesizes telomeric repeats at chromosome ends using a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a telomerase RNA (hTR in humans). Previous structural work showed that human telomerase is typically monomeric, containing a single copy of TERT and hTR. Evidence for dimeric complexes exists, although the composition, high-resolution structure, and function remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a human telomerase dimer bound to telomeric DNA. The structure reveals a 26-subunit assembly and a dimerization interface mediated by the Hinge and ACA box (H/ACA) RNP of telomerase. Premature aging disease mutations map to this interface. Disrupting dimer formation affects RNP assembly, bulk telomerase activity, and telomere maintenance in cells. Our findings address a long-standing enigma surrounding the telomerase dimer and suggest a role for the dimer in telomerase assembly.},

In the brain, CSFR1 is mainly expressed by microglia. Wu et al . developed and used mouse models of ALSP to show that replacing CSF1R-deficient microglia with CSF1R-normal microglia using bone marrow transplantation (BMT) strongly attenuated brain pathology (see the Perspective by Du and Kipnis). Of major clinical relevance, BMT halted disease progression in four individuals, suggesting that this might be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating CSF1R-associated disorders. —Mattia Maroso Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor ( CSF1R ) is primarily expressed in microglia. Its monoallelic mutation causes CSF1R-associated microgliopathy (CAMP), a major form of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) and a fatal neurological disease without clinical cure. We developed mouse models harboring human hotspot mutations of CAMP and replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia with CSF1R-normal cells through microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT), which attenuated pathology in mice. We further demonstrated that, in the context of CSF1R deficiency, traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) in ALSP functions similarly to Mr BMT, efficiently replacing microglia and reducing disease progression. We then replaced CSF1R-deficient microglia in eight patients by tBMT. The disease progression was halted during the 24-month follow-up. Together, microglia replacement corrects pathogenic mutations and halts disease progression in mice and humans.},

  abstract     = {Sex chromosomes have distinct evolutionary patterns compared with autosomes. The Y or W chromosome often degenerates due in part to lack of recombination with the X or Z chromosomes, heterogametic hybrids of two species tend to be inviable or sterile, and the X and Z chromosomes have a larger than expected effect on incompatibility. Lenormand and Roze now propose that a model incorporating dosage compensation, inversions, and deleterious mutations can account for these disparate effects. They suggest that dosage compensation and inversions preventing recombination lead to sex chromosomes evolving in response to divergent pressures in each sex, resulting in dysregulation of gene expression in hybrids. —Corinne Simonti Sex chromosomes are involved in three major empirical patterns: (i) Y (or W) chromosomes are often nonrecombining and degenerate; (ii) heterogametic offspring (XY or ZW) from interspecific crosses are more often sterile or inviable compared with homogametic offspring (Haldane’s rule); and (iii) the X (or Z) has a disproportionately large effect on reproductive isolation between species compared with autosomes (the large X effect). Each observation has received its own tailored explanation involving multiple genetic and evolutionary causes. In this work, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory for sex chromosome evolution incorporating the coevolution of cis- and trans-acting regulators of gene expression and leading to systematic misexpression of dosage-compensated genes in heterogametic F1 hybrids, for both young and old sex chromosomes.},

Analysis of 700,000 cells identified diverse excitatory and inhibitory neurons patterned along the developmental axes of the neural tube. Patterning neural progenitors prior to TF overexpression expanded neuronal diversity by enabling access to regulons active in primary tissue counterparts.

The spatiotemporal dynamics of dopamine transmission remain to be fully elucidated. Yee et al . used in vivo approaches in mice to study striatal dopamine signaling. The authors identified two distinct postsynaptic responses to dopamine release mediated by G protein α– or βγ–signaling pathways operating at different spatiotemporal scales. The results identify an important mechanism for precise spatiotemporal decoding of dopamine signals by striatal neurons. —Mattia Maroso Dopamine (DA) transmission critically regulates diverse, basal ganglia–dependent behaviors by activating distinct subtypes of G protein–coupled receptors. Spatially broad DA release has been extensively characterized, but how DA transmission affects striatal function at a subcellular scale remains poorly understood. Using 2P imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, we defined the spatiotemporal properties of DA transmission onto striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons. Sparse activation of DA release sites evoked localized DA signals, producing spatially discrete, D2 receptor–mediated responses across dendrites. The spatiotemporal properties of DA receptor signaling differed between downstream intracellular pathways. We propose that membrane-delimited Gβγ signaling occurs in parallel to intracellular second messenger pathways, but on different spatial and temporal scales, providing a mechanism for precise decoding of DA signals by striatal neurons.},

For the latter, the effect of fluids on seismicity above subduction zones is of particular interest for populated areas where megathrust earthquakes are known to occur, such as Japan. A machine-learning analysis of earthquake data from ocean-bottom cables led Suzuki et al . to define a belt of relatively shallow seismic activity caused by fluids coming off the subducted Pacific plate. This belt includes the area beneath Tokyo and helps to explain the region’s high seismic activity relative to the rest of Japan. —Angela Hessler A portion of fluids subducted in an oceanic plate is thought to return to Earth’s surface and has the potential to influence faulting during that migration. We used machine learning to detect and locate earthquakes in the northeast Japan forearc using data from a cabled ocean-bottom seismic network. That seismicity shows vertical distributions extending from the subducted plate to near the sea floor. The “forearc seismic belt” corresponds to the seismicity assumed to result from fluid supply from the underlying plate to the forearc and may also act to constrain the down-dip limit of megathrust rupture. The zone of high seismicity continues inland under metropolitan Tokyo, aligning with the Boso slow slip events and the eastern edge of the1923 Kanto earthquake, supporting forecasts of shallow damaging earthquakes.},

This study sequenced 92 modern and ancient genomes to investigate how centuries of isolation shaped the regional Qimmeq populations and the impact of European contact. We found distinct regional populations and evidence for two migrations of dogs into Greenland with the Inuit from Canada. Furthermore, we found that there is minimal European ancestry in present day Qimmit and limited recent inbreeding despite low heterozygosity.

  abstract     = {Mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) molecules that can cause oxidative damage if not properly controlled. Mitochondria have been thought to manage their own ROS using built-in antioxidant systems. However, defects in antioxidant-rich organelles called peroxisomes lead to mitochondrial damage. DiGiovanni et al . found a direct role for peroxisomes in managing mitochondrial ROS (see the Perspective by Fransen). Membrane contacts between peroxisomes and mitochondria allow mitochondrial ROS to transfer directly to peroxisomes for processing. This role of peroxisomes as sinks for ROS provides a way for cells to defend themselves against oxidative damage. —Stella M. Hurtley Maintenance of mitochondrial redox homeostasis is of fundamental importance to cellular health. Mitochondria harbor a host of intrinsic antioxidant defenses, but the contribution of extrinsic, nonmitochondrial antioxidant mechanisms is less well understood. We found a direct role for peroxisomes in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis through contact-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer. We found that ACBD5 and PTPIP51 form a contact between peroxisomes and mitochondria. The percentage of these contacts increased during mitochondrial oxidative stress and helped to maintain mitochondrial health through the transfer of mitochondrial ROS to the peroxisome lumen. Our findings reveal a multiorganelle layer of mitochondrial antioxidant defense—suggesting a direct mechanism by which peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial health—and broaden the scope of known membrane contact site functions.},

  abstract     = {Mutualistic relationships between ants and plants have evolved repeatedly. In these relationships, the ants often supply the plants with nutrients, while the plants provide structures suitable for ant nests, generally referred to as “domatia.” In some pairs, these relationships are exclusive, but in many others, a single plant species may have relationships with more than one ant species. However, such flexibility, although beneficial to the plant, poses a challenge because ants are often territorial and aggressive. Chomicki et al . studied such a promiscuous species of tropical vine and found that conflict among ant species was minimized or completely eradicated simply by physical separation within a single domatium. —Sacha Vignieri Many symbioses involve one host species having several mutualist partners, yet theory predicts that unrelated symbionts lead to destabilizing conflict through competition for host resources. We combined isotope labeling, computed-tomography three-dimensional models, behavioral field experiments, and mathematical models to show that Squamellaria plant hosts reduce conflict among their multiple ant symbiont species by offering nesting sites (domatia) divided into compartments with separate entrances. As long as compartmentalization is maintained, different symbiont species can peacefully coexist, but experimental removal of compartment walls leads to deadly conflicts. Modeling suggests that compartmentalization optimizes nutritional benefits by increasing the time during which domatia harbor large ant colonies. These results reveal a conflict-reduction mechanism that allows hosts to take advantage of unrelated symbionts, which may be widespread in multipartner mutualisms.},

  abstract     = {In rivers, water and sediment move down one or more pathways, or threads. Dams and dikes have forced many multithreaded rivers into single pathways, and effective restoration depends on knowing the mechanism behind a river’s original state. Using satellite imagery to measure changes over 36 years, Chadwick et al . determined that multithreaded rivers develop from an imbalance that favors erosion over deposition. Contrary to the common practice of erosion prevention, these findings suggest that allowing bank erosion would be a more effective way to bring modified rivers back to their natural state. —Angela Hessler Why river channels confine flow to a single pathway or divide flow into multiple interwoven pathways (threads) forms a long-standing fundamental question in river science, which to date remains poorly understood. In this study, we probed channel-pattern origins by mapping thread dynamics along 84 rivers from 36 years of global satellite imagery using particle image velocimetry. Results show that single-thread channels originate from a balance between lateral erosion and accretion, which enables a thread to migrate while maintaining equilibrium width. In contrast, multithread channels originate from imbalance—erosion outpaces accretion in individual threads, causing threads to repeatedly widen and split. Thread-width imbalance provides a mechanistic explanation for how multithread channels develop on Earth and other planets and, in application, can help lower the cost of nature-based river restoration projects.},

  abstract     = {In the past two decades, the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has prevented millions of deaths and new HIV infections through the provision and support of HIV testing, treatment, and prevention programs in more than 50 countries worldwide (1). Although HIV remains incurable, treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to sustained viral suppression, which halts both immune system destruction and HIV transmission (2–4). With ART delivery at its core, PEPFAR has been enormously successful in improving both individual and public health: At the end of 2024, more than 20 million people were receiving life-saving ART through PEPFAR, and between 2010 and 2023, new HIV infections were reduced by an estimated 52% in PEPFAR-supported countries (1). However, in January, the US government ordered a 90-day hold on the PEPFAR program, which was later extended to 20 May (5) and still has not been lifted. Although HIV treatment was quickly exempted from the hold (6), ART delivery has been destabilized and effectively halted in many settings (7). The US government must reinstate PEPFAR to ensure continued progress toward ending HIV as a public health threat.},

  abstract     = {Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs), proteins that bind DNA to initiate transcription. Typically, TFs have distinct DNA-binding and effector domains. However, many zinc finger transcription factors (ZNFs), the largest TF family, deviate from this model. Bianchi et al . discovered Zincore, a two-protein complex that binds ZNFs and activates the genes essential for development (see the Perspective by Nemčko and Stark). Zincore interacts with the zinc finger domains of the ZNF ZFP91, anchoring it to DNA. This discovery reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism of gene activation and introduces a co-regulator that fine-tunes transcriptional programs. —Di Jiang Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) are the largest family of transcription factors, yet how they activate gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we identified Zincore, a protein complex consisting of QRICH1 and SEPHS1, as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for embryonic development in mice and associated with developmental syndromes in humans. We also identified ZFP91 as a representative Zincore client, binding the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR. Cryo–electron microscopy of a Zincore-ZFP91-DNA complex revealed a SEPHS1 arginine clamp to recognize the DNA-bound zinc finger domains. This mode of binding explains recognition of different ZNFs and stabilizes ZFP91 onto its cognate DNA motif. Thus, our study identified Zincore as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for development, involving a distinctive mechanism that locks ZNFs onto DNA and regulates transcription.},

  abstract     = {Molecular glue degraders are small molecules that induce a cell’s natural degradation machinery to eliminate a target protein. Petzold et al . conducted a computational survey of the human proteome to search for structural motifs that could be targeted by a prototypical substrate receptor for molecular glues (see the Perspective by Hartmann). Using three small-molecule compounds, the authors validated more than 20 previously unknown substrates and identified a helical loop recognition motif that differs from the canonical beta-hairpin loop motif known previously. This work greatly expands the potential target scope of molecular glues and should stimulate the development of new small molecules that can selectively target therapeutically relevant proteins for degradation. —Michael A. Funk The CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase is the target of molecular glue degrader compounds that reprogram ligase specificity to induce the degradation of clinically relevant neosubstrate proteins. Known cereblon (CRBN) neosubstrates share a generalizable β-hairpin G-loop recognition motif that allows for the systematic exploration of the CRBN target space. Computational mining approaches using structure- and surface-based matchmaking algorithms predict more than 1600 CRBN-compatible G-loop proteins across the human proteome, including the newly discovered helical G-loop motif, and identify the noncanonical neosubstrate binding mode of VAV1 that engages CRBN through a molecular surface mimicry mechanism. This work broadens the CRBN target space, redefines rules for neosubstrate recognition, and establishes a platform for the elimination of challenging drug targets by repurposing CRL4 CRBN through next-generation molecular glue degraders.},

  abstract     = {Highly repetitive regions of the genome are notoriously difficult to assemble and annotate. This includes the centromere, a rapidly evolving structure that is fundamental for correct chromosomal segregation during cell division. Corda and Giunta developed a pipeline that allows for the rapid annotation of centromeres by recognizing patterns of motif repetition. They were able to identify such sequences from raw reads and to check centromere assemblies for errors. These patterns were also noted outside of centromeres, but their function, if any, is unknown. This pipeline will help in the annotation of centromeres, particularly as more species are sequenced. —Corinne Simonti Centromeres are epigenetically specified by distinct chromatin, whereas their DNA varies between species and individuals. This extensive sequence divergence makes comparative analyses between centromeres challenging. In this study, we identified a chromosome-specific architectural pattern across the human genome, defined by the conserved spacing of a functionally relevant centromeric DNA motif. The distribution of these sites along chromosome arms constitutes the human “centeny map.” By using a custom Genomic Centromere Profiling (GCP) pipeline, we leveraged the motif’s position, orientation, and organization to construct structural models that enable reclassification of human chromosomal clusters, detection of centromere expansion, and identification of structural variants and misassembled regions. The high-resolution maps derived from this pattern not only provide a framework for comparative analysis of centromeres across evolution and disease but also offer a new dimension for chromosome annotation, assembly, and characterization.},

It is known that specific neural populations in the hippocampal ventral CA1 region store and represent specific social memories. However, it remains unclear how these neural populations represent identities and properties of social memory such as sex and strain. Watarai et al . discovered two distinct types of social memory neurons in CA1: cells responding to the identity of an individual and those responding to either the specific sex or specific strain of this individual. Selective reactivation of female sex cells, but not male sex cells, was sufficient to induce a reinforcement effect, suggesting a distinct population that represents sex-specific information. These findings reveal both the physiological and functional mechanisms of sex-specific representations in social memory. —Peter Stern Recognizing familiar individuals is crucial for adaptive social interactions among animals. However, the multidimensional nature of social memory encompassing sexual information remains unelucidated. We found that neurons in the ventral CA1 region (vCA1) of the mouse hippocampus encoded the identities and social properties, specifically sex and strain, of familiar conspecifics by using both rate and theta-based temporal coding. Optogenetic reactivation of social memories of females, but not males, induced place preference. Ablation of the upstream hippocampal dorsal CA2 region or the medial amygdala disrupted the representation of sex and the sexual dichotomy of social memory valence. Thus, vCA1 neurons use dual coding schemes to represent the identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics as a cohesive memory.},

The researchers found that exchange effects slowed down the dynamics of anyon tunneling, in contrast to the situation for electrons. —Jelena Stajic Anyons are quasiparticles that keep a robust memory of particle exchanges via a braiding phase factor. When an anyon excitation is emitted toward a quantum point contact (QPC) in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid, this memory translates into tunneling events that may occur long after the anyon excitation has exited the QPC. In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor ν = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics.

In quantum science, randomization is achieved by the generation of Haar unitary matrices. However, present protocols for the generation of random unitary operations is thought to take long evolution times and require deep circuits. By contrast, Schuster et al . found that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in exponentially lower depths rather than in the polynomial depths seen in classical dynamics (see the Perspective by Yamamoto and Wada). Such a speedup will be important for benchmarking quantum technologies and probing complex quantum dynamics. —Ian S. Osborne Random unitaries are central to quantum technologies and the study of complex quantum many-body physics. However, existing protocols for generating random unitaries require long evolution times and deep circuits. In this work, we prove that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in extremely low depth on any geometry. These shallow circuits have low complexity and create only short-range correlations, yet are indistinguishable from random unitaries with exponential complexity. This finding contrasts sharply with classical systems, in which a long evolution time is required to appear random. Our results have widespread applications across quantum science, from device benchmarking to quantum advantages. Moreover, they reveal that fundamental physical properties—including evolution time, causal structure, and phases of matter—are provably hard to learn.},

Okazaki et al . found that the amino acids in MAVS are carboxylated, and this modification is dependent on γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGC), a membrane protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum that can invert its orientation so that its active site faces the cytosol. In the presence of activating signals, the authors found that GGC-dependent carboxylation of MAVS stimulated cells to produce type 1 interferon but suppressed signals leading to apoptosis. Mice in which GGC was inhibited, either by genetic knock-out in neurons or by depleting its co-factor vitamin K, had dysregulated responses to viral infection of the brain. —Sarah H. Ross Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is an adaptor involved in antiviral immunity, but its regulation is not fully understood. We identified carboxylation of MAVS by vitamin K (VK)–dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which was unexpected owing to the reported membrane topology of GGCX. We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice. Thus, we identified a MAVS regulatory mechanism—the existence of cytoplasmic protein carboxylation and topological inversion of GGCX—and demonstrated how modulating VK levels may influence antiviral defense.},

These tools were not used for hunting, but rather appear to have been designed to obtain and process plant foods. This finding shows that wooden tools were being used across a much wider range at the time, and also provides insight into how cultures from different environments may have developed locally useful implements. —Sacha Vignieri Evidence of Early and Middle Pleistocene wooden implements is exceptionally rare, and existing evidence has been found only in Africa and western Eurasia. We report an assemblage of 35 wooden implements from the site of Gantangqing in southwestern China, which was found associated with stone tools, antler billets (soft hammers), and cut-marked bones and is dated from ~361,000 to ~250,000 years at a 95% confidence interval. The wooden implements include digging sticks and small, complete, hand-held pointed tools. The sophistication of many of these tools offsets the seemingly “primitive” aspects of stone tool assemblages in the East Asian Early Paleolithic.

  abstract     = {It is clear that the climate is changing quickly, but it is less clear how quickly ecosystems will be able to respond and adapt. Species can change in response to climate, but these responses may be nonlinear or lagged, and the timescales over which ecosystems change are not well understood. Fastovich et al . used fossil pollen records spanning 600,000 years and spectral analysis to identify how vegetation responds to climate change over a range of timescales. In this record, vegetation responded at timescales from hundreds to tens of thousands of years, but not at timescales shorter than about 150 years, suggesting that concerns about ecosystems lagging rapid climate change are warranted. —Bianca Lopez Climate and ecosystem dynamics vary across timescales, but research into climate-driven vegetation dynamics usually focuses on singular timescales. We developed a spectral analysis–based approach that provides detailed estimates of the timescales at which vegetation tracks climate change, from 10 1 to 10 5 years. We report dynamic similarity of vegetation and climate even at centennial frequencies (149 −1 to 18,012 −1 year −1 , that is, one cycle per 149 to 18,012 years). A breakpoint in vegetation turnover (797 −1 year −1 ) matches a breakpoint between stochastic and autocorrelated climate processes, suggesting that ecological dynamics are governed by climate across these frequencies. Heightened vegetation turnover at millennial frequencies (4650 −1 year −1 ) highlights the risk of abrupt responses to climate change, whereas vegetation-climate decoupling at frequencies >149 −1 year −1 may indicate long-lasting consequences of anthropogenic climate change for ecosystem function and biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Whether adult neurogenesis occurs in the human hippocampus is one of the most debated issues in neuroscience. Dumitru et al . used a single-cell transcriptomic approach to address this issue in human samples of various ages from birth through adulthood (see the Perspective by Quiniou and Jessberger). Machine learning algorithms helped the authors to identify proliferating neural progenitor cells in the adolescent and adult human hippocampus that resembled progenitor cells found in mouse and pig. The results support the idea that adult neurogenesis occurs in the human hippocampus and add valuable insights of scientific and medical interest. —Mattia Maroso Continuous adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in memory formation and mood regulation but is challenging to study in humans. Difficulties finding proliferating progenitor cells called into question whether and how new neurons may be generated. We analyzed the human hippocampus from birth through adulthood by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We identified all neural progenitor cell stages in early childhood. In adults, using antibodies against the proliferation marker Ki67 and machine learning algorithms, we found proliferating neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic data showed that neural progenitors were localized within the dentate gyrus. The results contribute to understanding neurogenesis in adult humans.},

  abstract     = {Theory predicts that areas of the globe with higher energy (warmer or more productive areas) will have a higher number of species. Empirical studies have found mixed support for this hypothesis, likely because other factors also influence geographical species richness patterns. Coelho et al . used an alternative approach to isolate the effects of climate on biodiversity by comparing vertebrate species richness across climate bins. When controlling for climate bins’ area and isolation, both temperature and productivity had positive relationships with species richness, and there was an indirect effect of temperature on species richness in endotherms. In ectotherms, temperature-species richness relationships matched predictions of metabolic theory. —Bianca Lopez Ecologists have long proposed that environments providing more energy can support more species, yet empirical evidence frequently contradicts this expectation. We argue that such inconsistencies result from confounding geographical influences that mask the true relationship between species richness and energy-related factors. Here, by comparing species richness across different climate conditions, we disentangle the direct effects of temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity from the confounding impacts of the area and isolation of various climates. Using a global analysis of terrestrial vertebrates, we reveal clear and consistent relationships between energy-related factors and species richness. Our findings clarify existing ecological theory and illustrate how adopting a climate space perspective advances biodiversity research, providing critical insights into biodiversity patterns and their responses to environmental change.},

  abstract     = {Calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is one of the main mechanisms mediating neuronal communication. Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is the main calcium sensor in the neocortex. Bornschein et al . examined the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmitter release at small neocortical synapses in rodent brain slices using electrophysiology, quantitative analysis, and modeling. Syt1-mediated release has high affinity for calcium and a steep dose-response curve in the range of action potential–evoked calcium concentrations, suggesting substantial differences to the published work on Syt2-triggered neurotransmitter release in the hindbrain. These results pave the way for a better understanding of neocortical synaptic transmission. —Mattia Maroso Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and Syt2 are the main calcium (Ca 2+ ) sensors triggering synchronous release in the brain. In this work, we studied the mechanisms mediating Syt1-triggered release from neocortical synapses. We measured the Ca 2+ dependency of release in layer 5 pyramidal neuron synapses by laser photolysis of caged Ca 2+ . Release had high Ca 2+ affinity and positive cooperativity. Measurements at cerebellar Purkinje cell synapses and kinetic models indicate substantial differences compared with Syt2-triggered release. Our results suggest that Syt1-controlled release machineries are optimized for high reliability at moderate Ca 2+ elevations and high plastic controllability.},

  abstract     = {During apoptosis, monomeric BAX protein in the cytoplasm is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is activated through oligomerization. Unlike all other known pore-forming proteins, the activated BAX oligomers display vastly different sizes and shapes: arcs, lines, and rings or pores, each of which is capable of permeabilizing or rupturing the membrane. Zhang et al . revealed the molecular mechanism behind the versatility of BAX oligomers by resolving the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the repeating unit shared by all of them. This repeating unit, organized as a dimer of BAX dimers, is connected to another repeating unit through their protruding C-terminal helices. —Di Jiang During apoptosis, cytosolic BAX monomers are translocated to the mitochondria to permeabilize the outer membrane. Here, we identified a dimer of BAX dimers as the basic repeating unit of its various oligomeric forms: arcs, lines, and rings. Cryo–electron microscopy structure of the BAX repeating unit at 3.2-angstrom resolution revealed the interactions within and between dimers. End-to-end stacking of the repeating units through the protruding α9 pairs yielded lines, arcs, polygons, and rings. We structurally characterized the tetragon, pentagon, hexagon, and heptagon, which comprise 16, 20, 24, and 28 BAX protomers, respectively. Missense mutations at the BAX inter-protomer interface damage pore formation and cripple its proapoptotic function. The assembly principle of the various BAX oligomers reported here provides the structural basis of membrane permeabilization by BAX.},

Meanwhile, in all periods, within-building genetic connections were predominantly maternal rather than paternal.

Kanter et al . simultaneously recorded from a very large number of neurons in rat hippocampus, medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). They observed a slow drift in population activity across recording sessions in LEC that did not occur in MEC and hippocampus. This drift was affected by discrete events, such as presentation of a reward or a sequence of odors. These results suggest that LEC has the properties necessary for a representation of temporal context to support episodic memory encoding. —Peter Stern Our experience of the world is a continuous stream of events that must be segmented and organized at multiple timescales. The neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In this work, we simultaneously recorded hundreds to thousands of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex of freely behaving rats. Neural population activity drifted continuously along a one-dimensional manifold during all behaviors and behavioral states, including sleep, which points to an intrinsic origin of the drift. In awake animals, boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in population dynamics, which segmented the neural activity into temporal units. During tasks with recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the drift, encoding event information across multiple timescales. The results identify a hierarchical coding scheme for organizing events in time.},

Understanding these issues will make it easier to build a holistic, multihazard framework for predicting the consequences of extreme events across Earth’s surface. —Jesse Smith This Review synthesizes progress and outlines a new framework for understanding how land surface hazards interact and propagate as sediment cascades across Earth’s surface, influenced by interactions among the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and solid Earth. Recent research highlights a gap in understanding these interactions on human timescales, given rapid climatic change and urban expansion into hazard-prone zones. We review how surface processes such as coseismic landslides and post-fire debris flows form a complex sequence of events that exacerbate hazard susceptibility. Moreover, innovations in modeling, remote sensing, and critical zone science can offer new opportunities for quantifying cascading hazards. Looking forward, societal resilience can increase by transforming our understanding of cascading hazards through advances in integrating data into comprehensive models that link across Earth systems.},

For example, rabbits, but not mice and rats, can fully regenerate damaged ear pinna (the outer ear). Lin et al . performed comparative single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analyses of pinna regeneration in rabbits, rats, and mice. They found that insufficient production of retinoic acid caused the failure of mouse and rat ear pinna regeneration. Exogenous supplementation of retinoic acid or activation of a rate-limiting enzyme in retinoic acid synthesis was sufficient to activate regeneration. Thus, modulation of vitamin A metabolism could potentially provide a strategy for promoting regeneration in normally nonregenerative organs. —Stella M. Hurtley Mammals display prominent diversity in the ability to regenerate damaged ear pinna, but the genetic changes underlying the failure of regeneration remain elusive. We performed comparative single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses of rabbits and mice recovering from pinna damage. Insufficient retinoic acid (RA) production, caused by the deficiency of rate-limiting enzyme Aldh1a2 and boosted RA degradation, was responsible for the failure of mouse pinna regeneration. Switching on Aldh1a2 or RA supplementation reactivated regeneration. Evolutionary inactivation of multiple Aldh1a2-linked regulatory elements accounted for the deficient Aldh1a2 expression upon injury in mice and rats. Furthermore, the activation of Aldh1a2 by a single rabbit enhancer was sufficient to improve ear pinna regeneration in transgenic mice.

Peripheral substituents have conventionally been easiest to manipulate, but there has been major recent progress in editing core atoms as well. Most of these methods have focused on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen swaps. Zhang and Dong now report a protocol to introduce sulfur in place of the carbon and oxygen in cyclic ketones. A custom reagent promotes radical scission of both framework bonds to the ketone carbon, which is driven by aromatization of a triazole precursor. —Jake S. Yeston In drug development, replacement of a skeletal carbon with a sulfur atom can result in analogs of bioactive compounds with improved properties. Currently, the sulfur analogs are almost exclusively prepared by de novo synthesis; the existing approach to swap carbon with sulfur is inefficient and involves stoichiometric mercury reagents. In this study, we report a two-step carbonyl-to-sulfur (CO-to-S) atom swap approach, enabled by a rationally designed N ′-alkyl-hydrazonamide (NAHA) reagent that promotes forming pre-aromatic intermediates twice sequentially by different mechanisms, thereby achieving homolytic cleavage of both α-C−C bonds of the ketone substrates. A Ts−S−Ts (Ts, p -toluenesulfonyl) reagent mediates this process through successive intermolecular and intramolecular alkyl radical trapping by the central sulfur. This method shows a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity, providing a streamlined route to sulfur-containing scaffolds from readily available ketones.},

Sole et al . revisited oceanic rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in northeast Canada, comparing long- and short-lived samarium-neodymium isotope systems to determine when the rocks first crystallized. Their new tests point to an age of about 4.2 billion years, further evidence that a slice of Hadean crust may remain. —Angela Hessler Many questions remain regarding Earth’s earliest crust owing to the rarity of Hadean (>4.03 billion-year-old) rocks and minerals. The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt (NGB) in Canada may be the only known remnant of Hadean crust, although its age is debated, ranging from ≥3.75 to 4.3 billion years old. Mafic intrusions within this belt were specifically sampled and analyzed to investigate the timing of their magmatic differentiation.

It is also one of the most important industrial chemicals, mainly used as fertilizer. Urea production usually relies on the direct reaction between ammonia and carbon dioxide under harsh conditions of high temperature and pressure. Using a combination of single-droplet experiments with quantum chemical modelling, Azizbaig Mohajer et al . detected spontaneous urea formation from these chemicals at the gas-liquid interface of aqueous aerosol droplets under ambient conditions (i.e. non-energetic conditions and without additional catalysts) enabled by chemical gradients across the surface of aqueous droplets. These findings have implications for various scientific disciplines. —Yury Suleymanov Urea is a key molecule in the search for the origin of life and a basic chemical produced in large quantities by industry. Its formation from ammonia and carbon dioxide requires either high pressures and temperatures or, under milder conditions, catalysts or additional reagents. In this study, we observed the spontaneous formation of urea under ambient conditions from ammonia and carbon dioxide in the surface layer of aqueous droplets. Single, optically trapped droplets were probed by using Raman bands as markers. We found the surface layer to act like a microscopic flow reactor, with chemical gradients providing access to unconventional reaction pathways. This observation revealed a general mechanistic scheme for distinctive droplet chemistry. Interfacial chemistry is a possible nonenergetic route for urea formation under prebiotic conditions.},

Metheringham et al . looked at genomic changes in the European ash, Fraxinus excelsior , the numbers of which have been decimated in recent decades by a fungal pathogen, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus . They found that a previously generated list of about 8000 potential variants showed significant differences in allele frequencies between juvenile and adult trees, and these differences were larger than randomly selected variants. This result suggests that polygenic adaptation may indeed be occurring in this population and that some of these variants may point to intervention targets. —Corinne Simonti Rapid evolution through small shifts in allele frequencies at thousands of loci is a long-standing neo-Darwinian prediction but is hard to characterize in the wild. European ash tree ( Fraxinus excelsior ) populations have recently come under strong selection by the invasive fungal pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus . Using genomic prediction models based on field trial phenotypes and 7985 loci, we show a shift in genomically estimated breeding values in an ancient woodland, between adult trees established before the epidemic started and juvenile trees established since. Using simulations, we estimate that natural selection has eliminated 31% of the juvenile population. Thus, we document a highly polygenic heritable microevolutionary adaptive change over a single generation in the wild.},

  abstract     = {Microcrystal electron diffraction enabled rapid screening of combinatorial product mixtures for synthesis of two extra-large pore (ELP) nanosized aluminosilicate zeolites. Ma et al . screened 16 precursor gel compositions under two different hydrothermal processing conditions. After synthesis optimization, they characterized these ELP zeolites as having 22-membered pores with free-sphere diameters of about 1.2 nanometers. These nanozeolites efficiently processed heavy petroleum fractions (commercial vacuum gas oil) into diesel and gasoline fuels. —Phil Szuromi Stable zeolites with extra-large pores and nano dimensions that are capable of processing large molecules are in high demand but have been difficult to produce. Their complex structures and nanoscale crystal sizes present challenges for analysis using conventional x-ray diffraction techniques, leading to inefficiencies in material development. We report NJU120-1 and NJU120-2, two robust and fully connected aluminosilicate nano zeolites featuring interconnected channel systems with extra-large 22-ring pores. NJU120-1 is a nanosheet with only about 8-nanometer thickness, corresponding to 1.5 unit cells, and NJU120-2 is a nanorod with 50 by 250 nanometer dimensions. Their synthesis optimization was greatly accelerated through rapid structure determination with MicroED, revealing their multidimensional pore structures. Their very large largest-free-sphere diameters of approximately 1.2 nanometers coupled with nano morphologies enabled catalytic cracking of large molecules.},

  abstract     = {Cephalopods are one of the most successful marine invertebrates in modern oceans, and they have a 500-million-year-old history. However, we know very little about their evolution because soft-bodied animals rarely fossilize. Ikegami et al . developed an approach to reveal squid fossils, focusing on their beaks, the sole hard component of their bodies. They found that squids radiated rapidly after shedding their shells, reaching high levels of diversity by 100 million years ago. This finding shows both that squid body forms led to early success and that their radiation was not due to the end-Cretaceous extinction event. —Sacha Vignieri The evolution of soft-bodied squids, which provide a major part of the biomass in modern oceans globally, is poorly understood owing to their patchy fossil record. We provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of squids through “digital fossil-mining” techniques, revealing a new lagerstätte. The more than 250 fossil beaks of 40 species show that squids originated and rapidly radiated by 100 million years ago. Our data suggest that the radical shift from heavily shelled, slowly moving cephalopods to soft-bodied forms did not result from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (66 million years ago). Early squids had already formed large populations, and their biomass exceeded that of ammonites and fishes. They pioneered the modern-type marine ecosystem as intelligent, fast swimmers.},

Before the earthquake, a moment magnitude ( M w ) 6.0 slow-slip event (SSE) was observed from late 2023 in a downdip extension of the mainshock. The coseismic slip was adjacent to the 1996 Hyuga-nada earthquake source. The afterslip resolved near the hypocenter area and in the downdip extension of the mainshock, reaching M w 6.7 on 16 September 2024. Leading up to the earthquake, the recurrence interval for SSEs in the preslip area shortened from an average of 2 years, estimated from observations over the past 30 years, to 1 year, consistent with simulations in which the weakening of the Nankai megathrust was attributed to the cause.},

In this work, we analyze formation pore pressure records from three offshore borehole observatories at the Nankai subduction zone, Honshu, Japan, to capture detailed slip-time histories of two slow slip events (SSEs) along the outermost reaches of the plate boundary. Slip initiates ~30 kilometers landward of the trench; migrates seaward at 1 to 2 kilometers per day to within a few kilometers of, and possibly breaching, the trench; and coincides with the onset and migration of tremor and/or very-low-frequency earthquakes. The SSE source region lies in a zone of high pore fluid pressure and low stress, which provides clear observational evidence linking these factors to shallow slow earthquakes.},

  abstract     = {Squids and octopuses are known for their rapid adaptive coloration, an ability that enables them to effectively camouflage and that is also used for communication. Bogdanov et al . performed a detailed examination of the cells (iridophores) and cell clusters (splotches) that produce these colors (see the Perspective by Shawkey). There was a complex distribution of cells and other components that exhibit gradient refractive indices arising from their constituent winding platelet columns, resulting in structural color. Computational modeling of this system supported the design of artificially fabricated nanostructures that show tunable visible and infrared spectral responses. The authors implemented these structures in complex materials such as fabric and clothing. —Marc S. Lavine The manipulation of light by means of materials with varying refractive index distributions is widespread among natural systems and modern technologies. However, understanding how animals leverage refractive index differences for dynamic color changes and then translating such insight into tunable optical devices remains challenging. We experimentally and computationally demonstrated that iridescent cells (iridophores) containing Bragg reflectors with sinusoidal-wave (rugate) refractive index profiles enable squid dorsal mantle tissues to reversibly transition between nearly transparent and vibrantly colored states. We then drew inspiration from these findings for the design and development of iridophore-inspired multispectral composite materials with tunable visible and infrared functionalities. Our study provides insight into squid dynamic structural coloration mechanisms and furnishes a technology for camouflage, heat management, display, and sensing applications.},

Deconjugation occurs by microbial glycosidases in the murine and human gut, which removes xyloglucan and reactivates the dexamethasone. This formulation may have fewer systemic effects and may have than unconjugated dexamethasone in treating inflammatory intestinal diseases. —Caroline Ash The gut microbiota of mammals possess distinctive metabolic pathways with untapped therapeutic potential. Using molecular insights into dietary fiber metabolism by the human gut microbiota, we designed a targeted drug delivery system, called GlycoCaging, that is based on bespoke glycoconjugates of a complex plant oligosaccharide. GlycoCaging of exemplar anti-inflammatory drugs enabled release of active molecules triggered by specific glycosidases of autochthonous gut bacteria. GlycoCaging ensured that drug efficacy was potentiated, and off-target effects were eliminated in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease. Biochemical and metagenomic analyses of gut microbiota of individual humans confirmed the broad applicability of this strategy.},

These two species have deterministic cellular lineages, ensuring that researchers were comparing equivalent cells, which is not always certain in other distantly related organisms. They found that gene regulation involved in development was highly conserved, but many lowly expressed and cell-specific genes have altered over time. Neuronal cell types also demonstrated increased divergence compared with other tissues. This dataset provides important insights into the evolution of gene expression in these important model organisms. —Corinne Simonti The constraints that govern the evolution of gene expression patterns across development remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing can detail these constraints by systematically profiling homologous cells. The conserved invariant embryonic lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae makes them ideal for comparing cell type gene expression across evolution. Measuring the spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across embryogenesis, we find a high level of similarity in gene expression programs between species despite tens of millions of years of evolutionary divergence. Nonetheless, thousands of genes show divergence in their cell type specific expression patterns, with enrichment for functions in environmental response and behavior. Neuronal cell types show higher divergence than others such as the intestine and germline. This work identifies likely constraints on the evolution of developmental gene expression.},

The precise mechanism by which RFs trigger this reaction has been unclear, especially regarding the role of water and a conserved sequence motif in RFs. Aleksandrova et al . used high-resolution structures of bacterial ribosome complexes to reveal that, contrary to previous models, no catalytic water is positioned for the reaction. Instead, RFs induce a structural change in the transfer RNA, enabling its own 2ʹ hydroxyl group to attack and break the bond, clarifying a universally conserved step in translation termination. —Di Jiang Translation termination is essential in all living organisms because it ensures that proteins have lengths strictly defined by their genes. This universal process is mediated by peptide release factors (RFs) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl transfer RNA (peptidyl-tRNA) on the ribosome, presumably by activating a water molecule. We report structures of the bacterial ribosome in complex with peptidyl-tRNA and RFs in the prepeptide release state. No hydrolytic water molecule was seen in the peptidyl transferase center. Instead, RFs induced rearrangements of the peptidyl-tRNA adenine 76 (A76) ribose pucker that orient the 2′-OH for the nucleophilic attack onto the neighboring carbonyl group. These findings suggest a catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and provide a structural basis for the universal conservation of the catalytic domain in peptide RFs.},

Policies to reduce plastic bag consumption are one approach that states and nations have used to curb plastic waste.

Plastic bag policies significantly reduced the proportion of plastic bags in shoreline litter. Although less common, taxes or fees on plastic bags may be even more effective than bans. Regulations on other single-use plastics would likely further reduce plastic pollution. —Bianca Lopez Plastic pollution threatens marine and freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide. Although plastic bag bans and taxes are increasingly implemented worldwide, their effectiveness in reducing plastic litter remains unknown. Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution.},

However, the pathways underlying the homeostatic control of sleep are still unknown. Lee et al . now describe the first homeostatic sleep circuit in mammals (see the Perspective by Gilette and Lipton). This circuit comprises a cluster of excitatory neurons in the nucleus reuniens that is activated by sleep need and is necessary for recovery sleep. Stimulation of these neurons first triggers presleep behavior, followed by deep and persistent sleep that can last hours. This sleep pattern resembles recovery sleep and suggests that activation of reuniens neurons generates sleep pressure even in animals without sleep debt. Silencing this circuit during sleep deprivation disrupts the amount and quality of recovery sleep, suggesting that its activity signals the accrual of sleep need. —Peter Stern Prolonged wakefulness leads to persistent, deep recovery sleep (RS). However, the neuronal circuits that mediate this process remain elusive. From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep.},

This shift, which is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere, could cascade to higher trophic levels and cause unforeseen impacts on fisheries and national economies. —Jesse Smith Although the global greening associated with climate change is well documented on land, similar trends in the ocean have not been thoroughly identified. Using satellite observations of ocean chlorophyll a (Chl) concentration, we show that the surface ocean experienced a poleward greening from 2003 to 2022. Contemporaneously, the subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere experienced a decrease in Chl. As such, the latitudinal disparity in Chl, as documented by an inequality index, has been increasing over the past two decades, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Rising water temperatures may primarily influence the Chl trends. The increasing Chl inequality—marked by “greener green and bluer blue” waters—has the potential to cascade to higher trophic levels, with implications for the fisheries and economies of coastal nations.},

However, some bird species have developed a tolerance for highly acidic, sour flavors. Zhang et al . examined the genetic basis of sour taste perception in birds, finding that canary and pigeon alleles of the OTOP1 gene react to acid differently than mammalian alleles (see the Perspective by Rowland and Schneider). Indeed, gene knock-ins of the canary allele of OTOP1 into mice induced sour tolerance without otherwise affecting taste perception. A mutation shared by all songbirds seems to improve on the sour tolerance seen across other birds and may have contributed to the radiation of songbird species by diversifying dietary options. —Corinne Simonti Taste is crucial in shaping animal perception. Sourness, one of the primary tastes, is aversive in mammals, whereas many birds frequently consume acidic fruits, suggesting a potential tolerance. Our study uncovers a mechanism enabling avian sour tolerance that involves changes to the sour receptor [otopetrin 1 (OTOP1)]. We demonstrate that sour tolerance is a conserved trait in birds, with avian OTOP1 exhibiting acid-induced inhibition and OTOP1 modulation affecting sour perception and tolerance. Ancestral reconstruction reveals that the increase in acid tolerance may have evolved at the same point in the songbird phylogeny as the regain of sweet sensing in this clade. This shift might have enabled songbirds to feed on a wider range of fruits, affecting the evolution and diversification of the songbird radiation.},

By imaging the activity of cholinergic axons projecting to the olfactory bulb, Yu et al . discovered that these axons completely changed their response patterns when mice engaged in an olfactory task. They originally responded to movements, but within seconds of task engagement, they instead responded to task-relevant odor stimuli. Odor responses were stronger when mice were more strongly engaged in the task. Inactivation of these neurons impaired odor representations and task performance. This dynamic behavior during the olfactory task was absent in cholinergic neurons projecting to the dorsal cortex, providing a potential mechanism for modality-specific attention. —Peter Stern The brain’s ability to prioritize sensory information is crucial for adaptive behavior, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated basal forebrain cholinergic neurons modulating olfactory bulb (OB) circuits in mice. The activity of cholinergic feedback axons in OB correlated with orofacial movements, with little responses to passively experienced odors. When mice engaged in an olfactory task, OB cholinergic axons rapidly shifted their response patterns from movement correlated to odor aligned. This response shift was absent in cholinergic axons projecting to the dorsal cortex during olfactory task engagement, and in OB, during an auditory task. Inactivation of OB-projecting cholinergic neurons impaired olfactory task performance and reduced odor responses in OB granule cells.

Data from rodent and nonhuman primate (NHP) models demonstrated tumor control. In autoimmune models, deep and transient depletion of B cells was observed in the blood and tissues of NHPs, resulting in an “immune reset.” Such a strategy may provide an off-the-shelf, nonviral, and scalable alternative to ex vivo CAR-T cell immunotherapy. —Priscilla N.

We present an in vivo engineering strategy using targeted lipid nanoparticles (tLNPs) for messenger RNA delivery to specific T cell subsets. These tLNPs reprogrammed CD8 + T cells in both healthy donor and autoimmune patient samples, and in vivo dosing resulted in tumor control in humanized mice and B cell depletion in cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, the reconstituted B cells after depletion were predominantly naïve, suggesting an immune system reset.

  abstract     = {The solar corona is the Sun’s tenuous upper atmosphere, which contains hot plasma and magnetic fields that are difficult to observe. Simulations have attempted to extrapolate conditions in the corona from observations of the photosphere (optical surface), but those were limited to individual snapshots in time. Downs et al . developed a data assimilation approach by running a simulation of the corona in near real time and updating it hourly with magnetic observations of the photosphere. Their simulation provides a time-varying forecast of the corona, which they used to predict its appearance during a total solar eclipse and to produce other synthetic observables. —Keith T. Smith The Sun’s corona is its tenuous outer atmosphere of hot plasma, which is difficult to observe. Most models of the corona extrapolate its magnetic field from that measured on the photosphere (the Sun’s optical surface) over a full 27-day solar rotational period, providing a time-stationary approximation. We present a model of the corona that evolves continuously in time, by assimilating photospheric magnetic field observations as they become available. This approach reproduces dynamical features that do not appear in time-stationary models. We used the model to predict coronal structure during the total solar eclipse of 8 April 2024 near the maximum of the solar activity cycle. There is better agreement between the model predictions and eclipse observations in coronal regions located above recently assimilated photospheric data.},

  abstract     = {Hundreds of thousands of chemicals of potential environmental concern, including nutrients, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, are found in waterways. Identifying whether any of these chemicals poses a risk to human or ecosystem health requires consistent monitoring with detection at levels below those that would cause harm. Bub et al . assessed the comprehensiveness of the US Water Quality Portal for assessing the risk of aquatic chemical pollutants from 1958 to 2019. They found that less than 1% of chemicals of possible environmental concern have the data required for risk assessment. Furthermore, analytical limits for detecting many chemicals (especially pesticides) are too high for their detection. Monitoring has not kept up with the proliferation of organic chemicals, biasing risk perceptions. —Bianca Lopez Macroscale evaluations of chemical monitoring data require the integration of chemical, spatial, and temporal dimensions. Here, we linked 64 million US surface water monitoring records (1900 chemicals, date range 1958 to 2019, 310,000 sites) and 37 million analytical limits and in vivo and in silico toxicity thresholds. We found that the exposure data required for retrospective risk assessment were available for less than 1% of chemicals with potential environmental concern ( n ≈ 297,000). In contrast to the situation with persistent and often inorganic contaminants in the 1970s, current monitoring schemes lack control of a much larger number of organic chemicals and their degradates. Insufficient chemical and spatial coverage of monitoring, along with analytical limits being far too high to track some of the most toxic chemicals, biases risk perceptions for important chemicals.},

  abstract     = {Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a versatile activation mode for a wide variety of organic reactions. The principle is to use the energy in light absorbed by the catalyst to transfer electrons to or from a substrate and thereby accelerate its reaction. However, especially in high-energy scenarios, back transfer of the electron can compete with the desired reaction. Bains et al . report a photocatalyst that couples electron transfer with deprotonation to suppress back transfer. By accumulating energy from two photons, this catalyst can partially reduce a wide range of challenging arene substrates. —Jake S. Yeston Photoredox catalysis driven by visible light has improved chemical synthesis by enabling milder reaction conditions and unlocking distinct reaction mechanisms. Despite the transformative impact, visible-light photoredox catalysis remains constrained by the thermodynamic limits of photon energy and inefficiencies arising from unproductive back electron transfer, both of which become particularly pronounced in thermodynamically demanding reactions. In this work, we introduce an organic photoredox catalyst system that overcomes these obstacles to drive chemical transformations that require super-reducing capabilities. This advancement is accomplished by coupling the energy of two photons into a single chemical reduction, whereas inefficiencies from back electron transfer are mitigated through a distinct proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism embedded in the catalyst design. The super-reducing capabilities of this organic catalyst system are demonstrated through efficient application in a broad scope of challenging arene reductions.},

  abstract     = {Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are enzymes that synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA templates, a process widely used in biotechnology. Defense-associated reverse transcriptases (DRTs) have emerged as a key player in bacterial antiviral immunity. Song et al . discovered an antiviral mechanism in which a bacterial RT, DRT9, senses phage infection–driven increases in intracellular dATP levels and responds by synthesizing poly(A)–rich single-stranded cDNA. These repetitive poly(A) cDNA molecules likely sequester phage single-stranded DNA–binding proteins, disrupting viral replication. This discovery expands the known functions of reverse transcription, drawing parallels to telomerase-mediated DNA elongation and revealing an unexpected role for cDNA in bacterial immune defense. —Di Jiang Prokaryotic defense-associated reverse transcriptases (DRTs) were recently identified with antiviral functions; however, their functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here we show that DRT9 forms a hexameric complex with its upstream noncoding RNA (ncRNA) to mediate antiphage defense by inducing cell growth arrest through abortive infection. Upon phage infection, the phage-encoded ribonucleotide reductase NrdAB complex increases intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate levels, activating DRT9 to synthesize long, polyadenylate [poly(A)]–rich single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), which likely sequesters the essential phage single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and disrupts phage propagation. We further determined the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DRT9-ncRNA hexamer complex, providing mechanistic insights into its cDNA synthesis. These findings highlight the diversity of RT-based antiviral defense mechanisms, expand our understanding of RT biological functions, and provide a structural basis for developing DRT9-based biotechnological tools.},

  abstract     = {The catalytic activity of a particular enzyme can vary widely between orthologs in different species, depending on their environment and specific metabolic needs. But how do such differences evolve and relate to specific structural features? Using a high-throughput microfluidic system, Muir et al . assayed nearly 200 orthologs of the enzyme adenylate kinase and used the resulting data to build a landscape view of catalytic activity. There was minimal correlation between growth temperature and activity, and high activity peaks were widely distributed in the landscape and likely evolved independently. Current protein language models group enzymes by structure but fail in predicting the catalytic activity landscape; however, there is potential to train models using experimental activity data. —Michael A. Funk Quantitatively mapping enzyme sequence-catalysis landscapes remains a critical challenge in understanding enzyme function, evolution, and design. In this study, we leveraged emerging microfluidic technology to measure catalytic constants— k cat and K M —for hundreds of diverse orthologs and mutants of adenylate kinase (ADK). We dissected this sequence-catalysis landscape’s topology, navigability, and mechanistic underpinnings, revealing catalytically heterogeneous neighborhoods organized by domain architecture. These results challenge long-standing hypotheses in enzyme adaptation, demonstrating that thermophilic enzymes are not universally slower than their mesophilic counterparts. Semisupervised models that combine our data with the rich sequence representations from large protein language models predict orthologous ADK-sequence catalytic parameters better than existing approaches. Our work demonstrates a promising strategy for dissecting sequence-catalysis landscapes across enzymatic evolution, opening previously unexplored avenues for enzyme engineering and functional prediction.},

Blumer et al . sequenced 1375 genomes from 240 species of Lake Malawi cichlids, a clade of fish hallmarked by their extremely species-rich adaptive radiations in several African lakes. The authors found multiple segregating inversions in these populations, as well as genomic signatures showing that these regions had been used repeatedly in adaptation throughout these species. Some of these inversions seem to primarily include genes related to sensory tissues, and two were linked to sex determination. —Corinne Simonti Chromosomal inversions can contribute to adaptive speciation by linking coadapted alleles. By querying 1375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon through admixture, whereas the others established early in the deep benthic clade. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes. These results indicate that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.},

Optimal electrode design would maximize the efficiency of gas transport to the catalyst, but a persistent problem has been clogging over time due to precipitation of bicarbonate salts.

  abstract     = {Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria invade and replicate in red blood cells, causing hemolysis. Parasites detoxify the iron-rich, redox conditions by converting heme into inert hemozoin crystals. However, some people infected with malaria develop jaundice, which indicates that they are detoxifying heme by an alternative route that results in bilirubin production. Figueiredo et al . found that people with malaria inhibit bilirubin conjugation, which indicates that jaundice in malaria might be advantageous (see the Perspective by Kloehn and Soldati-Favre). Experiments in mice showed that unconjugated bilirubin enters the parasite’s cells to disrupt its food vacuole and mitochondria, inhibit pyrimidine synthesis and hemozoin crystallization, and suppress replication. Therefore, it appears that jaundice has an evolutionary advantage for humans living in regions with malaria. —Caroline Ash Jaundice is a common presentation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which arises from the accumulation of circulating bilirubin. It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response to Plasmodium spp. infection. We found that asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibited P. falciparum proliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole. Hence, jaundice appears to represent a metabolic response to Plasmodium spp. infection that limits malaria severity.},

  abstract     = {Genomic DNA typically forms a double-helical structure, but it can also fold into alternative conformations such as G-quadruplex (G4) structures. G4s act as transcriptional regulators, but they can threaten genome integrity if not properly controlled. Using Xenopus laevis egg extract and mammalian cell models, Sato et al . uncovered an intricate mechanism governing genome-wide G4 landscapes. G4s are recognized as DNA lesions, triggering homology-directed RNA invasion opposite the G4 and forming a “G-loop” structure. Regulated disassembly of this structure leads to G4 resolution and renewal of the RNA-containing strand. This reveals a role for RNA transcripts in restoring genome architecture and maintaining its integrity and function. —Di Jiang G-quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent DNA structures that regulate transcription but also threaten genome stability. How G4 dynamics are controlled remains poorly understood. Here, we report that RNA transcripts govern G4 landscapes through coordinated G-loop assembly and disassembly. G-loop assembly involves activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, followed by homology-directed invasion of RNA opposite the G4 strand mediated by BRCA2 and RAD51. Disassembly of the G-loop resolves the G4 structure through DHX36-FANCJ–mediated G4 unwinding, which triggers nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal by DNA synthesis. Inhibition of G-loop disassembly causes global G4 and R-loop accumulation, leading to transcriptome dysregulation, replication stress, and genome instability. These findings establish an intricate G-loop assembly-disassembly mechanism that controls G4 landscapes and is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival.},

This task is also challenging for computational approaches because it can be difficult to identify virus open reading frames. Weingarten-Gabbay et al . devised a mass ribosome profiling method that avoids the hazards of virus culture by using fragments of viral genomes inserted into plasmids that are then transfected into cells. This strategy detects peptides that regulate virus protein expression in ways that modify the course of infection and mediate potent host immune responses, can survey noncanonical translation in many diverse viruses simultaneously, and offers a tool for vaccine development. —Caroline Ash Defining viral proteomes is crucial to understanding viral life cycles and immune recognition but the landscape of translated regions remains unknown for most viruses. We have developed massively parallel ribosome profiling (MPRP) to determine open reading frames (ORFs) across tens of thousands of designed oligonucleotides. MPRP identified 4208 unannotated ORFs in 679 human-associated viral genomes. We found viral peptides originating from detected noncanonical ORFs presented on class-I human leukocyte antigen in infected cells and hundreds of upstream ORFs that likely modulate translation initiation of viral proteins.

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients by lysing neighboring cells through contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation, the type VI secretion system (T6SS) lysed neighboring cells and thus provided nutrients from lysing cells for growth.

The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin.

Sexton et al . developed a model-driven design platform to rapidly design vasculature trees for the generation of organ or tissue mimetics (see the Perspective by Huang and Ju). The model includes hemodynamic properties such as flow patterns and pressure in the context of branching points and hierarchical trees, enabling the fabrication of arbitrarily complex shapes. The authors demonstrate perfusion of three-dimensional bioprinted vascular networks in a bioreactor that show improved cell viability. —Marc S. Lavine Our ability to produce human-scale biomanufactured organs is limited by inadequate vascularization and perfusion. For arbitrarily complex geometries, designing and printing vasculature capable of adequate perfusion poses a major hurdle. We introduce a model-driven design platform that demonstrates rapid synthetic vascular model generation alongside multifidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and three-dimensional bioprinting. Key algorithmic advances accelerate vascular generation 230-fold and enable application to arbitrarily complex shapes. We demonstrate that organ-scale vascular network models can be generated and used to computationally vascularize >200 engineered and anatomic models. Synthetic vascular perfusion improves cell viability in fabricated living-tissue constructs. This platform enables the rapid, scalable vascular model generation and fluid physics analysis for biomanufactured tissues that are necessary for future scale-up and production.},

  abstract     = {For nearly two centuries, chemists have relied on absorption and rotation of polarized light to distinguish chiral compounds, so much so that the term “optically active” is often used synonymously with the structural absence of mirror or inversion symmetry. Parrish et al . now report that a particular centrosymmetric crystalline solid, a lithium cobalt selenium oxide compound, can nonetheless differentially absorb circularly polarized light. They explain the observation as an interference effect between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, and they derive the general symmetry requirements distinguishing the response from conventional optical activity. —Jake S. Yeston Crystalline solids are governed by universal structure-property relationships derived from their crystal symmetry, leading to paradigmatic rules on what properties they can and cannot exhibit. A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li 2 Co 3 (SeO 3 ) 4 , which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids.},

Ion implantation is often used to dope in semiconductor films, but this is difficult in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides. Zhao et al . show that tuning of the band offset and charge transfer across the van der Waals interface with an external gate bias can produce a hole density of 1.49 × 10 14 per square centimeter, which is about five times the conventional dielectric limit. —Phil Szuromi Tailoring carrier density in atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is challenging because of the inherently limited physical space for incorporating charge dopants. Here, we report that interlayer charge-transfer doping in type III van der Waals heterostructures can be greatly modulated by an external gate to realize a hyperdoping effect. Systematic gated-Hall measurements revealed that the modulated carrier density is about five times that of the gate capacitive charge, achieving an ultrahigh 2D hole density of 1.49 × 10 14 per square centimeter, far exceeding the maximum possible electrostatic doping limit imposed by typical dielectric breakdown. The highly efficient hole-doping enables high-performance p-type 2D transistors with an ultralow contact resistance of ~0.041 kilohm micrometers and a record-high ON-state current density of ~2.30 milliamperes per micrometer.},

However, plant responses to heat are scale-dependent, complicating cross-scale prediction. We highlight recent progress revealing how and why plant responses to heat change across scales, including scales of biological organization and space versus time. We give examples of scaling up from molecular- and leaf-scale data and processes, which are modified by homeostatic and buffering mechanisms at whole plant and ecosystem scales. We show that scaling down—predicting plant responses to warming from broad-scale spatial patterns—can also be misleading, even in direction. Addressing such scale dependencies is essential to improving the prediction of plant responses to heat.},

Here, we synthesize our current understanding of temperature sensing and response in plants. We outline how temperature cues are integrated into preexisting signaling cascades using inherently temperature-sensitive proteins or processes. This dispersed nature of thermo-sensitive proteins and processes makes distinct signaling cascades sensitive to temperature. This model integrates current knowledge and distinguishes thermosensing from other conventional sensing and signaling mechanisms in plants.},

  abstract     = {Continued greenhouse gas emissions will accelerate global warming and intensity of heat waves, which already harm crop productivity. From the stability of key enzymes to canopy processes, photosynthesis is affected by temperature. All crops suffer declines in photosynthetic rate when temperatures cross critical thresholds, with irreversible losses typically occurring above 40° to 45°C. Protective measures within plants can be induced by growth at elevated temperatures but not from the sudden temperature elevation of heat waves. Strategies to improve the heat resilience of photosynthesis include modifying surface energy balance, optimizing canopy architecture, improving enzymatic heat tolerance, and (re)engineering key metabolic pathways for greater efficiency or to remove bottlenecks. This Review summarizes present knowledge on the major mechanisms that underlie high-temperature inhibition of photosynthesis and explores opportunities for breeding and biotechnological interventions to overcome them.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent progress in promoting smoking cessation, tobacco-induced lung cancer remains a common and deadly disease. These cancers usually show up many years or decades after the initial exposure to tobacco, suggesting that detailed insights into premalignant changes in the lungs, known as field cancerization, may help to identify at-risk patients and approaches for early intervention. To study this biological phenomenon, Gómez-López et al . performed detailed analysis on lung cells from carcinogen-exposed mice and from humans with or without a history of smoking. The findings shed light on carcinogen-induced changes in cell evolution and competition in the lung and help to identify the cells that give rise to preinvasive lesions and the mechanisms involved. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Preinvasive squamous lung lesions are precursors of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The cellular events underlying lesion formation are unknown. Using a carcinogen-induced model of LUSC with no added genetic hits or cell type bias, we found that carcinogen exposure leads to non-neutral competition among basal cells, aberrant clonal expansions, and basal cell mobilization along the airways. Ultimately, preinvasive lesions developed from a few highly mutated clones that dominate most of the bronchial tree. Multisite sequencing in human patients confirmed the presence of clonally related preinvasive lesions across distinct airway regions. Our work identifies a transition in basal cell clonal dynamics, and an associated shift in basal cell fate, as drivers of field cancerization in the lung.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas systems defend bacteria and archaea against viral (phage) infection using RNA-guided complexes. In many cases, such as in CRISPR-Cas9, the complex directly destroys the phage genome to provide immunity. In the case of CRISPR-Cas10, the RNA-guided complex synthesizes cyclic nucleotide second messengers that activate the downstream effectors responsible for the interruption of the phage infectious cycle. Baca et al . describe a CRISPR-associated TIR protein effector, Cat1, which, upon binding of the cyclic nucleotide ligand, forms long filaments that assemble into large networks formed by trigonal and pentagonal filament bundles. The TIR domains within these filaments cleave nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, depleting this essential metabolite from the infected host to prevent viral propagation. —Di Jiang Type III CRISPR-Cas systems defend against viral infection in prokaryotes by using an RNA-guided complex that recognizes foreign transcripts and synthesizes cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) messengers to activate CRISPR-associated Rossmann-fold (CARF) immune effectors. In this study, we investigated a protein containing a CARF domain–fused Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, Cat1. We found that Cat1 provides immunity by cleaving and depleting oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) molecules from the infected host, inducing a growth arrest that prevents viral propagation. Cat1 forms dimers that stack upon each other to generate long filaments that are maintained by bound cOA ligands, with stacked TIR domains forming the NAD + cleavage catalytic sites. Furthermore, Cat1 filaments assemble into distinct trigonal and pentagonal networks that enhance NAD + degradation. Cat1 presents an unprecedented chemistry and higher-order protein assembly for the CRISPR-Cas response.},

  abstract     = {After 800 quiet years, curtains of lava are erupting through fissures on Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula, cutting across towns and forcing evacuations. Tracking the flow of magma can help to forecast eruptions, but the best satellite methods resolve over hours to days. Using a distributed acoustic recording system attached to an existing telecommunication cable, Li et al . captured magma-migration ground movement on a minute-by-minute basis for nine recent eruptions. Their recordings showed peak magma flow 15 to 22 minutes before each eruption and were behind an early warning issued in the half hour ahead of the largest eruption. —Angela Hessler Continuous geodetic measurements near volcanic systems can image magma transport dynamics, yet resolving dike intrusions with high spatiotemporal resolution remains challenging. We introduce fiber-optic geodesy, leveraging low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (LFDAS) recordings along a telecommunication fiber-optic cable, to track dike intrusions near Grindavík, Iceland, on a minute timescale. LFDAS revealed distinct strain responses from nine intrusive events, six resulting in fissure eruptions. Geodetic inversion of LFDAS strain reveals detailed magmatic intrusions, with inferred dike volume rate peaking systematically 15 to 22 min before the onset of each eruption. Our results demonstrate DAS’s potential for a dense strainmeter array, enabling high-resolution, nearly real-time imaging of subsurface quasistatic deformations. In active volcanic regions, LFDAS recordings can offer critical insights into magmatic evolution, eruption forecasting, and hazard assessment.},

Organoids made from human-derived cells offer a tractable alternative, but they often lack key cell types that are present in an intact organism and may not properly mimic the cellular microenvironment seen during physiological development. By testing numerous differentiation conditions, Abilez et al . developed a method of culturing human pluripotent stem cells that differentiated into vascularized cardiac and hepatic organoids. These vascularized organoids could be used for studying cardiac and hepatic development and for addressing more immediately practical questions, such as the impact of drug exposure on human organ development. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Although model organisms have provided insight into the earliest stages of cardiac and hepatic vascularization, we know very little about this process in humans because of ethical restrictions and the technical difficulty of obtaining embryos during very early development. In this study, we demonstrate that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cell–derived gastruloids enable in vitro modeling of the earliest stages of vascularization. We identify a combination of vascular-inducing factors that give rise to cardiac vascularized organoids with a spatially organized and branched vascular network. To show the broader utility of our vascularization strategy, we use the same vascular-inducing factors to produce hepatic vascularized organoids.

TeNWNs showed good biocompatibility and did not require external power sources. The neuroprosthesis was able to improve vision in mouse and nonhuman primate models. The use of TeNWNs could substantially improve the efficacy of retinal neuroprostheses in restoring vision in blind and visually impaired individuals. —Mattia Maroso Present vision restoration technologies have substantial constraints that limit their application in the clinical setting. In this work, we fabricated a subretinal nanoprosthesis using tellurium nanowire networks (TeNWNs) that converts light of both the visible and near-infrared–II spectra into electrical signals. The broad-spectrum coverage is made possible by a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries. Implanted into blind mice, the TeNWNs restored pupillary reflexes and enabled visually cued learning under visible and near-infrared 1550-nanometer light. In nonhuman primates, TeNWNs elicited robust retina-derived neural responses, confirming biocompatibility and feasibility. By restoring lost photosensitivity and extending vision to near-infrared, this nanoprosthesis offers a promising approach for restoring vision.},

  abstract     = {Primary cilia, antenna-like structures on neurons, play a crucial role in regulating energy balance in the brain. In certain regions of the hypothalamus, these cilia house melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) and adenylyl cyclase 3 (ADCY3), which have both been linked to obesity. Working in mice, Xun et al . identified cilia-localized GPR45, an orphan G protein–coupled receptor, as a regulator of feeding behavior (see the Perspective by Asthana and Jackson). GPR45 recruited the G protein subunit Gαs into the cilia, where it enhanced MC4R signaling and activated ADCY3, increasing cyclic AMP levels specifically within cilia. Thus, by modulating this localized signaling pathway, GPR45 regulates food intake and contributes to energy homeostasis. —Stella M. Hurtley The melanocortin system centrally regulates energy homeostasis, with key components such as melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and adenylyl cyclase 3 (ADCY3) in neuronal primary cilia. Mutations in MC4R and ADCY3 as well as ciliary dysfunction lead to obesity, but how melanocortin signaling works in cilia remains unclear. Using mouse random germline mutagenesis, we identified two missense mutations in G protein–coupled receptor 45 (Gpr45) that lead to obesity through hyperphagia. GPR45 was expressed in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), where it localized to cilia and recruited Gα s to increase ciliary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via ADCY3. GPR45 colocalized with MC4R in PVH cilia and promoted ciliary MC4R activation. Loss of GPR45 in the PVH or MC4R + neurons caused obesity. These findings establish GPR45 as a key regulator of the ciliary melanocortin system, bridging MC4R and ADCY3.},

  abstract     = {Some studies (including work published in 2023 by Singh et al .) have indicated that taurine concentrations decline with age, and supplementation has been suggested to improve both healthspan and lifespan. Fernandez et al . now report results in mice, nonhuman primates, and three distinct large human cohorts studied longitudinally (i.e., with repeated measurements of the same individuals) that yield a more complex picture. The authors found large interindividual variation in circulating taurine concentrations and an increase in taurine concentrations for most cohorts during adult life. There was also no clear association of taurine concentrations with measures of health status. Thus, the possible beneficial effects of taurine supplementation are likely to depend on a range of variables and individual context. —L. Bryan Ray Low circulating taurine concentrations have been proposed as a driver of the aging process. We found that circulating taurine concentrations increased or remained unchanged with age in three geographically distinct human cohorts as well as in nonhuman primates and mice when measured longitudinally (repeatedly in the same population) or cross-sectionally (sampling distinct populations at various ages). Moreover, considerable variability was observed in associations between taurine and age-related changes in health outcomes pertaining to gross motor function and energy homeostasis. Our results suggest that changes in circulating taurine are not a universal feature of aging and that its pleiotropic effects may be dependent on the temporal and physiological context of each individual.},

Successfully management to minimize these impacts is vital to preserving the sustainability of environmental networks and human society. Focusing on China, Xu et al . developed an integrated model for quantifying carbon and nitrogen fluxes and their interactions. By managing them together in an integrated manner, large reductions of carbon and nitrogen could be achieved at lower abatement costs and greater societal benefits than if they were treated separately. —Jesse Smith Carbon and nitrogen are central elements in global biogeochemical cycles. To effectively manage carbon and nitrogen in China, we developed a comprehensive model for quantifying their fluxes, investigating their interplay across 16 human and natural subsystems. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrogen losses in China increased 2.3-fold and carbon emissions surged 6.5-fold. Integrated carbon and nitrogen management holds the potential for a 74% reduction in nitrogen losses to air and water and a 91% decrease in carbon emissions to the atmosphere by 2060. Compared with separate control of carbon or nitrogen, integrated management delivers an additional reduction of 1.8 million tons of nitrogen and 26.5 million tons of carbon by 2060, bringing out a 37% decrease in unit abatement cost and a net societal benefit of 1384 billion USD.},

  abstract     = {Many large marine animals are threatened with extinction. To address this problem, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework has set a goal of protecting, conserving, and managing at least 30% of the world’s oceans. However, the effectiveness of area-based conservation may be limited for highly mobile marine species, especially when there is limited understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of animal movement in the oceans. Sequeira et al . compiled tracking data from thousands of large marine vertebrates representing more than 100 species and identified important migratory corridors and areas where many species reside (see the Perspective by Gerber and Davis). Their findings show hotspots of movement and reveal that 30% protection will be inadequate for effective conservation, particularly considering the distribution of threats to biodiversity. —Bianca Lopez The recent Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) sets ambitious goals but no clear pathway for how zero loss of important biodiversity areas and halting human-induced extinction of threatened species will be achieved. We assembled a multi-taxa tracking dataset (11 million geopositions from 15,845 tracked individuals across 121 species) to provide a global assessment of space use of highly mobile marine megafauna, showing that 63% of the area that they cover is used 80% of the time as important migratory corridors or residence areas. The GBF 30% threshold (Target 3) will be insufficient for marine megafauna’s effective conservation, leaving important areas exposed to major anthropogenic threats. Coupling area protection with mitigation strategies (e.g., fishing regulation, wildlife-traffic separation) will be essential to reach international goals and conserve biodiversity.},

However, it was originally a tropical to subtropical plant, and most of its production was believed to have occurred in similar environments. McLeester et al . used a suite of approaches, including remote spatial measurements and excavation, to explore a Menominee site in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, revealing evidence of extensive maize agriculture and associated cultural complexity even at the most northern extent of its viability. —Sacha Vignieri We describe archaeological evidence of intensive ancestral Native American agriculture in the now heavily forested Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Recent LIDAR (light detection and ranging) and excavation data have uncovered densely clustered ancient agricultural raised garden bed ridges covering an expanse far greater than previously realized. These raised agricultural fields are deeply enmeshed in the broader cultural landscape, as ceremonial and other features were also found. Our results demonstrate a rich anthropogenic landscape created by small-scale ancestral Menominee communities, located near the northern limits of maize agriculture. The excellent preservation of this site is exceptional in eastern North America and suggests that the precolonial landscape was more anthropogenically influenced than currently recognized.},

  abstract     = {Despite much effort and money spent over decades, rhinoceros populations continue to decline because of the market for their horns based on unsubstantiated health claims in some countries. Over time, rhinoceros poaching has become a multimillion-dollar illegal trade, often controlled by multinational criminal organizations. In the face of this crisis, there are many local heroes who dedicate their lives to protecting the few remaining rhinoceroses using an array of approaches, from increased ranger presence to tracking dogs, at a cost of millions of dollars per year. Kuiper et al . looked at the effectiveness of these approaches and found that only one, removal of the poacher’s reward through dehorning, significantly reduced rhinoceros loss. —Sacha Vignieri Across 11 southern African reserves protecting the world’s largest rhino population, we documented the poaching of 1985 rhinos (2017–2023, ~6.5% of the population annually) despite approximately USD 74 million spent on antipoaching. Most investment focused on reactive law enforcement—rangers, tracking dogs, access controls, and detection cameras—which helped achieve >700 poacher arrests. Yet we found no statistical evidence that these interventions reduced poaching (horn demand, wealth inequality, embedded criminal syndicates, and corruption likely combine to drive even high-risk poaching). By contrast, reducing poacher reward through dehorning (2284 rhinos across eight reserves) achieved large (~78%) and abrupt reductions in poaching using 1.2% of the budget. Some poaching of dehorned rhinos continued because poachers targeted horn stumps and regrowth, signaling the need for regular dehorning alongside judicious use of law enforcement.},

  abstract     = {As ocean anoxic zones expand, there is the potential that the microbes living in the sediments beneath them could produce more nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, which could accelerate global warming. However, it has recently been discovered that many regions of anoxic sediments also harbor thriving populations of aerobic nitrite oxidizers. How is this possible? Buchanan et al . found that transitory oxygen intrusions facilitate blooms of these aerobic bacteria, a factor that must be considered when the greenhouse gas production potential of anoxic zones is projected. —Jesse Smith Anaerobic metabolisms are thought to dominate nitrogen cycling in anoxic marine zones (AMZs). However, thriving populations of aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in AMZs challenge this assumption and remain unexplained. Using theory and modeling, we show how periodic oxygen intrusions sustain aerobic NOB in AMZs alongside more competitive aerobic heterotrophs. Ecological theory, supported by numerical simulations and genomics, frames NOB as opportunists exploiting a fleeting supply of oxygen. Consistent with in situ observations, simulated NOB contribute substantially to total oxygen consumption at AMZ boundaries, which implies that NOB may provide a major stabilizing feedback to AMZs. Fine-scale ocean currents increase the metabolic diversity in AMZs, which could stabilize AMZ volume under climate change.},

  abstract     = {A challenge for lithium solid-state batteries is the formation of voids at the lithium-electrolyte interface as the battery is cycled because the loss of interfacial contact degrades battery performance. The typical solution to this problem is to apply a stack pressure to deform the lithium, but the pressures required become unfeasible. Yoon et al . eliminated the need for high pressure by alloying the lithium with up to 20% sodium (see the Perspective by Spencer-Jolly). Because the sodium is immiscible, it forms domains within the lithium microstructure. However, it is also a good conductor, so the accumulation at the solid electrolyte interface ensures good electrical contact but it will still move away from the interface as the lithium plates out during charging. —Marc S. Lavine The complex morphological evolution of lithium metal at the solid-state electrolyte interface limits performance of solid-state batteries, leading to inhomogeneous reactions and contact loss. Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we developed an interfacial self-regulation concept in which a deformable secondary phase dynamically aggregates at the interface in response to local electro-chemo-mechanical stimuli, enhancing contact. The stripping of a lithium electrode that contains 5 to 20 mole % electrochemically inactive sodium domains causes spontaneous sodium accumulation across the interface, with the sodium deforming to attain intimate electrical contact without blocking lithium transport. This process, characterized with operando x-ray tomography and electron microscopy, mitigates voiding and improves cycling at low stack pressures. The counterintuitive strategy of adding electrochemically inactive alkali metal to improve performance demonstrates the utility of interfacial self-regulation for solid-state batteries.},

Individual organisms, such as insects, have the potential to serve as natural reaction platforms in which high densities of multiple enzymes can perform new and complex reactions. We report an “in-insect” unnatural product synthesis that takes advantage of their xenobiotic metabolism. We selectively transform belt- and ring-shaped molecular nanocarbons into otherwise difficult-to-prepare derivatives in which oxygen atoms are inserted into aromatic rings. Cytochrome P450 variants are most likely the enzymes responsible for this reaction. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations indicated a possible mode of substrate incorporation into the enzyme and an unconventional mechanism of direct oxygen insertion into carbon–carbon bonds.},

  abstract     = {The quantum metric, the real part of the complex-valued quantum geometric tensor, has a bearing on the electronic properties of solids, including transport. Although the quantum metric has been measured directly in artificial systems, determining the full tensor in solids has proven tricky. Kim et al . extracted this quantity using photoemission measurements in black phosphorus. The researchers expect that their methodology can be extended to other materials with related band structures. —Jelena Stajic The quantum metric tensor is a central geometric quantity in modern physics that is defined as the distance between nearby quantum states. Despite numerous studies highlighting its relevance to fundamental physical phenomena in solids, measuring the complete quantum metric tensors in real solid-state materials is challenging. In this work, we report a direct measurement of the full quantum metric tensors of Bloch electrons in solids using black phosphorus as a representative material. We extracted the momentum space distribution of the pseudospin texture of the valence band from the polarization dependence of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement. Our approach is poised to advance our understanding of quantum geometric responses in a wide class of crystalline systems.},

  abstract     = {The top and exterior of buildings can be used to passively cool, but this requires materials with the right properties to do so effectively. Fei et al . designed a paint that cools both radiatively and through evaporation and that appears to keep buildings relatively cool even in humid environments. Although radiative cooling is effective at reducing temperature, it requires the material to be sky-facing. Designing a paint that also cools through evaporation allows the material to be effective when applied to the sides of the buildings as well. —Brent Grocholski Integrating radiative and evaporative cooling shows promise for enhancing passive cooling, but durable self-curing integrated cooling paints remain underdeveloped. We designed a modified cementitious structure with advanced thermal-optical and mass transfer properties, boosting cooling power while ensuring durability, mechanical strength, and broad adhesion. The paint achieves 88 to 92% solar reflectance (depending on wetting), 95% atmospheric window emittance, ~30% water retention, and self-replenishing properties, maintaining stable optical performance even when wet. Field tests in tropical Singapore demonstrated superior cooling performance compared with commercial white paints. Pilot-scale demonstrations highlighted consistent electricity savings under varying weather conditions, supported by theoretical modeling. By leveraging sustainable water evaporation and thermal radiation, this paint offers a practical and long-term solution for mitigating the urban heat island effect.},

Sia et al . used cryo–electron microscopy to capture snapshots of the chromatin remodeler ISWI in actively translocating a nucleosome. This work provides a molecular movie to illustrate how the remodeler couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to reposition the nucleosome, and sheds light on the mechanism of ISWI regulation to prevent undue remodeling. —Di Jiang Chromatin remodelers utilize the energy of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to slide nucleosomes, regulating chromatin structure and gene activity in cells. In this work, we report structures of imitation switch (ISWI) bound to the nucleosome during active ATP hydrolysis and remodeling, revealing conformational transitions of the remodeling motor across the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling.},

After correction, the maximum measured cooling power is halved, reaching 2.1 W. Additionally, Li et al. noticed that the amount of energy that can be recovered is larger than the one initially published. Hence, the maximum coefficient of performance of the electrocaloric heat pump—which is affected both by the cooling power and the recoverable energy—reaches 54% of Carnot’s efficiency if 99% of the recoverable energy is harvested. Also, the equation used to extract efficiency considers ideal heat exchangers. The relevant numbers have been updated throughout the text and in Table 1, bottom row; Fig, 3, B, C, and D; and Fig. 4B. In the supplementary materials, corrections have been implemented in equation 3 and figs. S7.2, S7.3, S7.4, S7.5, and S10.1.

  abstract     = {Many animal species have been shown to display distinct emotional states. However, little is known about the neuronal mechanisms underlying the emergence of emotional responses to discrete events. Kauvar et al . performed parallel behavioral, pharmacological, and electrophysiological experiments in mice and humans and identified evolutionarily conserved brain signals forming a basis of sensory and emotional processing of salient aversive stimuli (see the Perspective by Karamihalev and Gogolla). After stimulus-specific (sensory) information is rapidly disseminated throughout the mammalian brain, a slower and more persistent (emotional) activation of brainwide networks occurs. These translational results enhance our understanding of the neural substrates of affective states across species. —Mattia Maroso Emotional responses to sensory experience are central to the human condition in health and disease. We hypothesized that principles governing the emergence of emotion from sensation might be discoverable through their conservation across the mammalian lineage. We therefore designed a cross-species neural activity screen, applicable to humans and mice, combining precise affective behavioral measurements, clinical medication administration, and brain-wide intracranial electrophysiology. This screen revealed conserved biphasic dynamics in which emotionally salient sensory signals are swiftly broadcast throughout the brain and followed by a characteristic persistent activity pattern. Medication-based interventions that selectively blocked persistent dynamics while preserving fast broadcast selectively inhibited emotional responses in humans and mice. Mammalian emotion appears to emerge as a specifically distributed neural context, driven by persistent dynamics and shaped by a global intrinsic timescale.},

Sidhu et al . tracked the genetics of virulence in the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis in ancient and modern samples. They observed that the bacterial virulence factor pla , a gene encoding a protease, periodically becomes depleted late in epidemics. The authors verified that pla depletion reduces virulence in mouse models of bubonic plague. Therefore, in response to high disease mortality, selection could act to attenuate virulence. This would allow the pathogen to persist in tolerant reservoir hosts when susceptible host populations fragment and pathogen transmission becomes uncertain. —Caroline Ash Yersinia pestis has spilled over from wild rodent reservoirs to commensal rodents and humans, causing three historically recorded pandemics. Depletion in the copy number of the plasmid-encoded virulence gene pla occurred in later-dated strains of the first and second pandemics, yet the biological relevance of the pla deletion has been difficult to test. We identified modern Y. pestis strains that independently acquired the same pla depletion as ancient strains and herein show that excision of pla from the multicopy pPCP1 plasmid is accompanied by the integration of a separate full pPCP1 harboring pla into the single-copy pCD1 plasmid, reducing pla dosage. Moreover, we demonstrate that this depletion decreases the mortality of mice in models of bubonic plague but not in the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the disease. We hypothesize that pla depletion may have been selectively advantageous in bubonic plague, owing to rodent fragmentation after pandemic-induced mortality.},

However, the history and domestication of this plant has been fraught with contradicting evidence. Chien et al . analyzed genomic data from 693 wild and cultivated adzuki bean accessions. Cultivated accessions showed high similarity in their chloroplast genomes to Japanese wild accessions, although Chinese varieties displayed higher levels of nuclear genome diversity, which is often indicative of a source population. These results were reconciled in that domestication of adzuki beans likely occurred in Japan, with introgression from wild Chinese varieties being responsible for the complex genomic patterns. —Corinne Simonti Adzuki is a central legume in East Asian culinary culture, yet its domestication origin remains debated. Using ~700 accessions across Asia, we show that the initial domestication happened three to five thousand years ago in central Japan during the Jomon period, followed by a range expansion into China and secondary hybridization with Chinese wild populations. We mapped, validated, and dated key genes associated with seed coat color evolution ( VaPAP1 for loss of mottled black and VaANR1 for gain of red colors). The frequency increases of variants affecting key domestication syndrome substantially predated the wild-cultigen divergence. Together, our results resolve the conflict between genetic and archaeological evidence about adzuki origins and reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of archaeobotanically unobservable traits, consistent with a role of early weak selection during domestication.},

By using cryo–electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant.

Several genomic loci associated with this variation, including a peak encompassing the gene Cycle . This transcription factor is well known for its importance in circadian rhythms across species. Strains lacking the diapause phenotype altogether were homozygous for a frameshift mutation that completely disrupted a single isoform of Cycle .

Very few causal loci underlying diapause variation have yet been identified. By leveraging cross-mapping and genome-wide association analysis, we identified the N terminus of the clock protein CYCLE as a major causal effector underlying embryonic diapause differences in the silk moth. We found that the nondiapause phenotype in polyvoltine strains results from a specific deletion that disrupts an alternative isoform of CYCLE. We further demonstrated that different CYCLE isoforms contribute to a functional diversity in modulating circadian rhythms and diapause, which has been preserved in Lepidoptera for at least 110 million years.

  abstract     = {Plant respiration contributes several times the amount of carbon emissions to the atmosphere as anthropogenic sources. Respiration also increases with temperature, leading to a positive feedback loop. However, plants can acclimatize to warmer temperatures and reduce their respiration rate. Using a model based on ecological-evolutionary optimality principles, Zhang et al . predicted the rate of respiration acclimation to warming driven by decreasing water viscosity within the plant. They then tested these predictions using a dataset of stem respiration measurements from 186 woody plant species collected in the field and laboratory. Incorporating thermal acclimation into emissions projections reduced the predicted terrestrial carbon emissions estimate by nearly one third. —Bianca Lopez The efflux of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from woody stems, a proxy for stem respiration, is a critical carbon flux from ecosystems to the atmosphere, which increases with temperature on short timescales. However, plants acclimate their respiratory response to temperature on longer timescales, potentially weakening the carbon-climate feedback. The magnitude of this acclimation is uncertain despite its importance for predicting future climate change. We develop an optimality-based theory dynamically linking stem respiration with leaf water supply to predict its thermal acclimation. We show that the theory accurately reproduces observations of spatial and seasonal change. We estimate the global value for current annual stem CO 2 efflux as 27.4 ± 5.9 PgC. By 2100, incorporating thermal acclimation reduces projected stem respiration without considering acclimation by 24 to 46%, thus reducing land ecosystem carbon emissions.},

Although the Cretaceous world was considerably warmer than ours, the polar regions still experienced months of near total darkness, suggesting that this was a challenging environment to colonize even when it didn’t experience extreme cold. Wilson et al . report on a fossil assemblage of birds from the late Cretaceous Arctic. This assemblage includes both chicks and adults of multiple species, suggesting that birds began breeding in Arctic regions early on in their evolution. —Sacha Vignieri Polar ecosystems are structured and enriched by birds, which nest there seasonally and serve as keystone ecosystem members. Despite the ecological importance of polar birds, the origins of high-latitude nesting strategies remain obscured by a sparse fossil record. We report an extreme-latitude Arctic avialan assemblage from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska—the northernmost Late Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem. Numerous three-dimensionally preserved fossils constitute one of the most taxonomically rich Late Cretaceous avialan assemblages, including members of Hesperornithes, Ichthyornithes, and near-crown or crown birds (Neornithes), recording a previously undocumented interval in avialan evolution. Abundant perinatal fossils represent the oldest evidence of birds nesting at polar latitudes, which demonstrates that birds began using seasonal polar environments for breeding during the Cretaceous, long before their modern descendants.},

  abstract     = {It is now well known that the early hominin fauna was species rich, with many overlapping lineages existing in the African Pleistocene. However, our knowledge of diversity within many of these lineages has been limited because current ancient DNA technologies have not been able to reveal genetic sequences older than around 0.2 million years. Madupe et al . examined protein sequences from approximately 2-million-year-old Paranthropus robustus teeth that were particularly well preserved. Using proteomics approaches, the authors were able to assign the individual teeth to sex and to identify patterns of diversity suggesting the existence of multiple populations. —Sacha Vignieri Paranthropus robustus is a morphologically well-documented Early Pleistocene hominin species from southern Africa with no genetic evidence reported so far. In this work, we describe the mass spectrometric sequencing of enamel peptides from four ~2 million–year-old dental specimens attributed morphologically to P. robustus from the site of Swartkrans in South Africa. The identification of AMELY-specific peptides enabled us to assign two specimens to male individuals, whereas semiquantitative mass spectrometric data analysis attributed the other two to females. A single amino acid polymorphism and the enamel-dentine junction shape variation indicated potential subgroups present within southern African Paranthropus . This study demonstrates how palaeoproteomics can help distinguish sexual dimorphism from other sources of variation in African Early Pleistocene hominins.},

Large-area perovskite solar modules (areas of ~0.8 square meters) had a power conversion efficiency of ~19% and maintained this power output after 45 days of summer outdoor operation. —Phil Szuromi Natural illumination variations in light-dark cycles induce irreversible ion migration in perovskite solar cells, posing substantial challenges to their long-term outdoor operational stability. We addressed this issue by isolating defective octahedra at the perovskite surface using a vapor-deposited polydentate ligand. Surface octahedra isolation suppresses ion migration into the charge transport layer and reduces surface ionic defects, modulating the kinetics of ion migration during light-dark cycles. Our 785-square-centimeter industrial-scale perovskite solar modules achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%. Our modules demonstrated enhanced diurnal stability, retaining more than 97% of their initial PCE even after 101 light-dark cycles at 50°C.

  abstract     = {High temperature and corrosion stability, as well as high wear resistance and stiffness, have now been shown for oxides containing five transition metals. Shahbazi et al . prevented phase segregation of the metals by oxidizing metal sulfide precursors. The resulting metal oxide nanoribbons were stable in strong acids and bases, at temperatures up to 1000°C, and at pressures up to 12 gigapascals. Above 30 gigapascals, they underwent a reversible amorphization transition. —Phil Szuromi We present the successful synthesis and characterization of a one-dimensional high-entropy oxide (1D-HEO) exhibiting nanoribbon morphology. These 1D-HEO nanoribbons exhibit high structural stability at elevated temperatures (to 1000°C), elevated pressures (to 12 gigapascals), and long exposure to harsh acid or base chemical environments. Moreover, they exhibit notable mechanical properties, with an excellent modulus of resilience reaching 40 megajoules per cubic meter. High-pressure experiments reveal an intriguing transformation of the 1D-HEO nanoribbons from orthorhombic to cubic structures at 15 gigapascals followed by the formation of fully amorphous HEOs above 30 gigapascals, which are recoverable to ambient conditions. These transformations introduce additional entropy (structural disorder) besides configurational entropy. This finding offers a way to create low-dimensional, resilient, and high-entropy materials.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-like ions, those having three electrons orbiting the nucleus, can be used to test the predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Such tests are more stringent than those possible with hydrogen-like ions because of interelectron interactions present in lithium-like systems. A discrepancy that had existed between theory and experiment for the g-factor of lithium-like silicon and calcium was recently resolved, but testing this resolution using a heavier lithium-like ion has remained challenging. Morgner et al . performed a high-precision g -factor measurement of the much heavier lithium-like tin ion and compared it with their QED calculations. The agreement they found provides confidence in theoretical calculations in a previously unexplored regime. —Jelena Stajic Magnetic moments of bound-electron systems are a sensitive tool for testing fundamental interactions. The g factors of lithium-like ions have been rigorously studied in recent years, enabling insights into the relativistic interelectronic effects. In this work, we present the g -factor measurement of lithium-like tin, accurate to 0.5 parts per billion, as well as ab initio theoretical calculations that include an advanced treatment of the interelectronic interaction. We further improved the prediction by using the experimental result for the hydrogen-like tin g factor, inferring from it the unknown higher-order quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. The observed agreement independently confirms the revised theory at a previously inaccessible high atomic number Z of 50, where QED effects are considerably larger.},

  abstract     = {The material uranium ditelluride harbors a superconducting phase that has shown interesting properties that are potentially consistent with a spin-triplet character. Such superconductors are more resilient to the presence of magnetic fields and may even have topologically nontrivial excitations. However, one of the most important properties of this phase, the symmetry of its superconducting order parameter, remains unknown. Gu et al . used a scanning tunneling microscope with a superconducting tip to probe this symmetry (see the Perspective by Nevidomskyy). By comparing their findings with theoretical predictions, the authors concluded that uranium ditelluride is a nonchiral superconductor, narrowing down the possible pairing symmetries. —Jelena Stajic Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in uranium ditelluride (UTe 2 ), its superconductive order parameter Δ k remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band, which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor and also distinguish a chiral from a nonchiral Δ k through enhanced s-wave proximity. In this study, we used s-wave superconductive scan tips and detected intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe 2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging revealed subgap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a -axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity signifies that Δ k of UTe 2 is a nonchiral state: B 1 u , B 2 u , or B 3 u . However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a axis is internodal, then a nonchiral B 3 u state is the most consistent for UTe 2 .},

  abstract     = {The process of mitotic cell division is canonically orchestrated by the mitotic spindle apparatus, which is composed of microtubules. However, cells of the early mouse embryo do not contain centrosomes, the organelles responsible for efficient spindle assembly. The exact processes governing early embryonic cell divisions has therefore remained unclear. Using live-embryo imaging, Hernandez et al . discovered a contractile network of nuclear actin filaments that organizes chromosomes during the early phases of mitosis (see the Perspective by Bement). The authors also observed a separate actin network that regulates spindle size. These findings support the idea that actin filaments serve essential functions during mitotic cell division in early embryos. —Stella M. Hurtley Following fertilization, the preimplantation embryo undergoes successive rounds of cell division and must accurately propagate the genetic material to ensure successful development. However, early mammalian embryos lack efficient spindle assembly mechanisms, and it remains unclear how error-free chromosome segregation is achieved. In this work, we imaged early mouse embryos and identified a network of nuclear actin cables that organize prophase chromosomes at the nuclear periphery. Following nuclear envelope breakdown, the network contracts and gathers chromosomes toward the cell center. Network contraction was driven by filament disassembly in a myosin II–independent manner. Additionally, we identified a network of branched actin filaments that attenuates metaphase spindle elongation. We also visualized nuclear actin in human embryos, suggesting a conserved role for actin in ensuring mitotic fidelity during early mammalian development.},

Although this “brain drain” effect can directly decrease the country’s stock of human capital, Batista et al . reviewed evidence supporting indirect “brain gain” benefits as well. Highlighting research that uses empirical methods to estimate causal effects of emigration, the authors examined how migration opportunities can prove beneficial for origin countries. Many who invest in education motivated by migration may ultimately not emigrate, increasing the domestic stock of human capital. Emigration can lead to domestic benefits through remittances, knowledge transfers, foreign investment and trade, return migration, and other channels. Further research can help in our understanding of the conditions and policy approaches that might best support such origin country benefits from skilled emigration. —Brad Wible How does emigration of highly educated citizens of low-income countries to high-income countries affect the economies of the origin countries? The direct effect is “brain drain”—a decrease in the country’s human capital stock. However, there may also be indirect “brain gain” effects. This review summarizes evidence that uses causal inference methods to reveal mechanisms that may lead to brain drain, gain, or circulation. Collectively, the weight of the evidence suggests that migration opportunities often increase human capital stock in origin countries and produce downstream beneﬁcial effects through remittances; foreign direct investment and trade linkages; transfers of knowledge, technology and norms; and return migration. We discuss conditions under which beneﬁts from skilled migration may outweigh costs and also describe potential research paths to inform policy.},

This behavior is key to biological function, but engineering these properties in designed proteins is very challenging. Guo et al . developed a computational approach to designing such dynamic proteins that can sense and respond to binding of a calcium ion. Starting with a static protein that binds a calcium ion, the authors identified potential alternate conformations and used AlphaFold2 predictions to identify sequences that were compatible with both structures. Validation with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments confirmed a dynamic, multistate design that could be shifted into a single conformation upon ion binding. —Michael A. Funk Deep learning has advanced the design of static protein structures, but the controlled conformational changes that are hallmarks of natural signaling proteins have remained inaccessible to de novo design. Here, we describe a general deep learning–guided approach for de novo design of dynamic changes between intradomain geometries of proteins, similar to switch mechanisms prevalent in nature, with atomic-level precision. We solve four structures that validate the designed conformations, demonstrate modulation of the conformational landscape by orthosteric ligands and allosteric mutations, and show that physics-based simulations are in agreement with deep-learning predictions and experimental data. Our approach demonstrates that new modes of motion can now be realized through de novo design and provides a framework for constructing biology-inspired, tunable, and controllable protein signaling behavior de novo.},

Its unusually small genome has been the subject of speculation, with debates around when and why gene loss occurred. Swali et al . sequenced four ancient B. recurrentis genomes from remains in the UK, the oldest of which dates to 2300 to 2100 years ago. Many of the features of modern genomes were already displayed in these ancient samples, suggesting that the distinctive genomic changes in this species may have occurred only about 5000 years after divergence from its closest relative. —Corinne Simonti Several bacterial pathogens have transitioned from tick-borne to louse-borne transmission, which often involves genome reduction and increasing virulence. However, the timing of such transitions remains unclear. We sequenced four ancient Borrelia recurrentis genomes, the agent of louse-borne relapsing fever, dating from 2300 to 600 years ago. We estimated the divergence from its closest tick-borne relative to 6000 to 4000 years ago, which suggests an emergence coinciding with human lifestyle changes such as the advent of wool-based textiles. Pan-genome analysis indicated that much of the evolution characteristic of B. recurrentis had occurred by ~2300 years ago, though further gene turnover, particularly in plasmid partitioning, persisted until ~1000 years ago. Our findings provide a direct genomic chronology of the evolution of this specialized vector-borne pathogen.},

This method provides a rapid way to characterize IDRs directly from sequence and identify and prioritize potential cellular interactions for experimental testing. —Michael A. Funk Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins play essential roles in cellular function. A growing body of work has shown that IDRs often interact with partners in a manner that does not depend on the precise order of amino acids but is instead driven by complementary chemical interactions, leading to disordered bound-state complexes. However, these chemically specific dynamic interactions are difficult to predict. In this study, we repurposed the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to predict this chemical specificity between IDRs and partner proteins using protein sequence as the only input. Our approach—FINCHES—enables the direct prediction of phase diagrams, the identification of chemically specific interaction hotspots on IDRs, the decomposition of chemically distinct domains in IDRs, and a route to develop and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding IDR function in molecular recognition.},

Several processes sequester carbon at depth in labile and recalcitrant forms of dissolved organic carbon. Zakem et al . recognized that current biogeochemical models for the roles of microbial dynamics in ocean carbon storage are inadequate. To improve models, the authors harnessed available datasets from Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean transects to investigate the structure of oceanic microbial communities and then studied how this structure relates to function. At low latitudes, a vertical gradient can be discerned, with oligotrophs on the surface and increasingly copiotrophic populations at mesopelagic depths that avoid surface predation, grow slowly, and are key to regulating the amount of dissolved carbon stored in the ocean. —Caroline Ash Heterotrophic bacteria and archaea (“heteroprokaryotes”) drive global carbon cycling, but how to quantitatively organize their functional complexity remains unclear. We generated a global-scale understanding of marine heteroprokaryotic functional biogeography by synthesizing genetic sequencing data with a mechanistic marine ecosystem model. We incorporated heteroprokaryotic diversity into the trait-based model along two axes: substrate lability and growth strategy. Using genetic sequences along three ocean transects, we compiled 21 heteroprokaryotic guilds and estimated their degree of optimization for rapid growth (copiotrophy). Data and model consistency indicated that gradients in grazing and substrate lability predominantly set biogeographical patterns, and we identified deep-ocean “slow copiotrophs” whose ecological interactions control the surface accumulation of dissolved organic carbon.},

  abstract     = {DNA breakage can cause chromosome rearrangements, which are a hallmark of cancer. DNA break repair can occur by DNA joining or homologous recombination, with the latter being dependent on the gene BRCA1 , mutations of which cause familial breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 promotes DNA resection, a process that creates a crucial DNA intermediate needed for successful repair. Rogers et al . uncovered a multilayered mechanism by which the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a known DNA-joining factor, negatively regulates DNA resection. Importantly, they showed that BRCA1 alleviates the CST-mediated DNA resection blockade. These findings have implications for understanding drug resistance arising in tumors deficient in BRCA1. —Di Jiang Antagonistic activities of the 53BP1 axis and the tumor suppressor BRCA1-BARD1 determine whether DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by end joining or homologous recombination. We show that the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, a central 53BP1 axis component, suppresses DNA end resection by EXO1 and the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex but acts by distinct mechanisms in restricting these entities. Whereas BRCA1-BARD1 alleviates the CST-imposed EXO1 blockade, it has little effect on BLM-DNA2 restriction. CST mutants impaired for DNA binding or BLM–EXO1 interaction exhibit a hyper-resection phenotype and render BRCA1-deficient cells resistant to poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Our findings mechanistically define the crucial role of CST in DNA DSB repair pathway choice and have implications for understanding cancer therapy resistance stemming from dysfunction of the 53BP1 axis.},

  abstract     = {Kelp creates dense underwater forests in coastal temperate waters, providing habitat for numerous ecologically and economically important animals. Recently, kelp forests in warming waters have been replaced by qualitatively different beds of red algae. “Turf algae” appear to prevent kelp recovery, creating an alternative stable state. Farrell et al . combined metabolomics and laboratory experiments to show that turf algae in the Gulf of Maine in the US release allelopathic chemicals that inhibit kelp recruitment (see the Perspective by Feehan and Filbee-Dexter). This study demonstrated that chemically mediated species interactions play an important role in temperate reefs, much as in terrestrial systems and tropical reefs, and that regional interventions and curbing climate change may be necessary to facilitate kelp forest recovery. —Bianca Lopez In temperate regions experiencing rapid ocean warming, kelp forests are being replaced by chemically rich turf algae. However, the extent to which these turf algae alter the surrounding chemical environment or affect the rebound potential of kelp forests (through chemically mediated interactions) remains unknown. Here, we used underwater visual surveys, comprehensive chemical profiling, and laboratory experiments to reveal that turf algae release bioactive compounds into the water that fundamentally alter the reef “chemical landscape” and directly suppress kelp recruitment. Therefore, our study reveals that chemical ecology is critical in shaping modern kelp forest ecosystems and their resilience. Further, it demonstrates that reversing climate-driven state shifts will require not only curbing global carbon emissions but also implementing targeted local interventions that break harmful ecological feedback loops and foster recovery.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, null space theory has become one of the principal frameworks with which neuronal recordings are analyzed. However, a direct way to test the idea in the brain has been lacking. Fakharian et al . investigated population coding in the marmoset cerebellum (see the Perspective by Churchland and Sawtell). Purkinje cells exhibited saccade-evoked simple spike activity patterns that were most effectively activated along a potent vector. Despite this tuning specificity, most Purkinje cells fired simple spikes during all saccades. Comparison of simple spike activity revealed that individual Purkinje cells canceled each other out in the nonpotent vector compared with the potent vector. This agrees with the principles of null space computation theory. Mossy fiber inputs interacting through interneurons enabled Purkinje cell populations to predict key kinematic aspects of goal-directed actions. —Peter Stern Null space theory predicts that neurons generate spikes not only to produce behavior but also to prevent the undesirable effect of other neurons on behavior. In this work, we show that this competitive cancellation is essential for understanding computation in the cerebellum. In marmosets, we identified a vector for each Purkinje cell (P cell) along which its spikes displaced the eyes. Two spikes in two different P cells produced superposition of their vectors. In the resulting population activity, the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. Mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands and the goal of the movement. Molecular layer interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P cell population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped.},

  abstract     = {Today, there are six species of sloths, all of which have similar ecologies such as arboreality and a slow metabolism. These species are a tiny remnant of a once diverse American clade that was mostly made up of large-bodied species. Boscaini et al . looked across the evolutionary history of sloths and reveal that the ancestral groups were terrestrial and large, with smaller species being derived and convergent. For 30 million years, the sloth family diversified across the Americas, from a species as large as an elephant to one that was entirely aquatic. Unfortunately, like most other large Pleistocene herbivores, the clade was almost entirely eradicated by newly arriving humans. —Sacha Vignieri The emergence of multi-tonne herbivores is a recurrent aspect of the Cenozoic mammalian radiation. Several of these giants have vanished within the past 130,000 years, but the timing and macroevolutionary drivers behind this pattern of rise and collapse remain unclear for some megaherbivore lineages. Using trait modeling that combines total-evidence evolutionary trees and a comprehensive size dataset, we show that sloth body mass evolved with major lifestyle shifts and that most terrestrial lineages reached their largest sizes through slower evolutionary rates compared with extant arboreal forms. Size disparity increased during the late Cenozoic climatic cooling, but paleoclimatic changes do not explain the rapid extinction of ground sloths that started approximately 15,000 years ago. Their abrupt demise suggests human-driven factors in the decline and extinction of ground sloths.},

  abstract     = {Stars in binary systems can interact, which affects the evolution of both objects. Theory predicts that some binary systems experience a common envelope phase in which one object orbits within the outer layers of its companion, but this has not been directly observed. Yang et al . identified a rapidly spinning pulsar on a close orbit with a companion helium star. Comparison with theoretical models showed that this system recently underwent a common envelope phase, with the pulsar orbiting inside the envelope of a main sequence companion. The companion’s envelope was ejected within a thousand years, producing the helium star, and some mass was transferred to the pulsar, increasing its spin rate. —Keith T. Smith A stellar common envelope occurs in a binary system when the atmosphere of an evolving star expands to encompass an orbiting companion object. Such systems are predicted to evolve rapidly, ejecting the stellar envelope and leaving the companion in a tighter orbit around a stripped star. We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.},

This allowed us to extract the Lamb shift, the 2 P fine structure splitting, and the 2 S -hyperfine splitting in μ 3 He + .

  abstract     = {Atoms trapped in optical tweezers are a promising platform for quantum information processing. Typically in such systems, quantum information is encoded in the atoms’ electronic or nuclear states. However, their motional states, which are more robust to environmental effects, could also be exploited for quantum information. Shaw et al . have demonstrated this approach using an array of optical tweezers filled with strontium atoms. The researchers first cooled the atoms to their motional ground state with high fidelity and then went on create a Bell state in both motional and electronic degrees of freedom, which is known as hyperentanglement. —Jelena Stajic Coherently controlling the motion of single atoms in optical tweezers would enable new applications in quantum information science. To demonstrate this, we first prepared atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures, errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrated. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we performed mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection through local shelving into motional superposition states. We lastly entangled the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generated hyperentanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.},

To maximize the combination of flux and selectivity, thin polymer films, usually based on amide chemistry, are put onto porous supports. Lee et al . use interfacial polymerization to create thin film polymers with imine linkages, where shape-persistent monomers introduce high free volume into the final film (see the Perspective by Budd). To avoid the need for one monomer to be stable in the water phase and the other in the organic phase, the authors used an acid-catalyzed technique with both monomers dissolved in an organic phase and polymerization occurring on contact with an aqueous phase containing an acid catalyst. The polyimine films outperformed their polyamide counterparts and were resistant to the swelling and consequent reduction in selectivity that occurs with many organic solvents. —Marc S. Lavine Interfacial polymerization has been an industrial standard for preparing desalination membranes. Extending the same concept to molecular separation of organic solvents would be a key enabler for the decarbonization of the chemical and petrochemical industries through energy-efficient crude or biocrude oil fractionation. Here, we report a molecular engineering approach based on acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization for efficient hydrocarbon separation. The design strategies include (i) changing the linkage from amide to imine and (ii) subsequent introduction of shape-persistent units such as triptycene and spirobifluorene. The prepared polyimine membranes exhibit ultrahigh microporosity and enhanced swelling and plasticization resistance compared with conventional polyamide counterparts. These membranes, which feature fast and selective transport of hydrocarbons, including multicomponent and industrially relevant mixtures, outperform commercial and state-of-the-art benchmark membranes.},

Witte et al . developed a continuous evolution platform to improve CAST activity, yielding an evolved CAST with more than 200-fold increased activity in human cells. This enzyme enables efficient gene integration across a variety of therapeutically relevant genomic sites in multiple human cell types, representing a versatile new platform for mammalian cell genome editing. —Di Jiang Programmable gene integration in human cells has the potential to enable mutation-agnostic treatments for loss-of-function genetic diseases and facilitate many applications in the life sciences. CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) catalyze RNA-guided DNA integration but thus far demonstrate minimal activity in human cells. Using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), we generated CAST variants with >200-fold average improved integration activity. The evolved CAST system (evoCAST) achieves ~10 to 30% integration efficiencies of kilobase-size DNA cargoes in human cells across 14 tested genomic target sites, including safe harbor loci, sites used for immunotherapy, and genes implicated in loss-of-function diseases, with undetected indels and low levels of off-target integration.

Wu et al . assigned 81 backbone amide nuclear magnetic resonance signals in a prototypical GPCR, the β1-adrenergic receptor, and built a residue-by-residue picture of how the receptor conformation shifts in response to ligand binding. Their model involves a combination of rigid and loose coupling between key regions of the protein divided by proline residues in three separate transmembrane helices. —Michael A. Funk The regulation of G protein–coupled receptor signaling by different orthosteric ligands is thought to occur through shifts in dynamically interconverting, conformational distributions. Such changes in dynamical distributions have been detected so far only by very sparse, often non-native experimental probes at low resolution. Using a recently developed paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method, we could assign and follow 81 1 H- 15 N NMR correlations in the β 1 -adrenergic receptor β 1 AR at ambient conditions in response to various orthosteric ligands in the absence or presence of a G protein–mimicking nanobody. The comparison reveals the dynamics and mechanism of the central, highly conserved xWIPF 3 motif, contiguous regions of rigid and loose conformational coupling separated by conserved prolines during signal transmission, and the plasticity of the intracellular face in response to transducer binding.},

They also identified compounds that interfere with interactions, thereby disrupting RNP function. These findings shed new light on how influenza viruses replicate and also pave the way for antiviral development. —Di Jiang Influenza viruses replicate and transcribe their genome in the context of a conserved ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. By integrating cryo–electron microscopy single-particle analysis and cryo–electron tomography, we define the influenza RNP as a right-handed, antiparallel double helix with the viral RNA encapsidated in the minor groove. Individual nucleoprotein subunits are connected by a flexible tail loop that inserts into a conserved pocket in its neighbor. We visualize the viral polymerase in RNP at different functional states, revealing how it accesses the RNA template while maintaining the double-helical architecture of RNP by strand sliding. Targeting the tail loop binding interface, we identify lead compounds as potential anti-influenza inhibitors.

However, it can be difficult to identify such variants when the genetic variation of a population is not well understood. Nunes et al . generated whole-genome sequence data for 2723 healthy individuals across Brazil, a population characterized by recent and unequal admixture among Indigenous Americans, Europeans, and African enslaved people. They identified nearly 9 million previously unreported genetic variants, including some predicted to negatively affect protein function, and used these data to refine admixture timing estimates. These data represent an important step toward ameliorating the disparities in genomic coverage between populations. —Corinne Simonti Brazil, the largest Latin American country, is underrepresented in genomic research despite boasting the world’s largest recently admixed population. In this study, we generated 2723 high-coverage whole-genome sequences from the Brazilian population, including urban, rural, and riverine communities representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. We reveal the impressive genomic diversity of Brazilians, identifying >8 million previously unknown variants, including 36,637 predicted deleterious and potentially affecting population health. We found a positive correlation between these deleterious variants and ancestry. Brazilian genomes are a global haplotype mosaic shaped by nonrandom mating, with peak admixture in the 18th and 19th centuries. Within this diversity, ancestry-specific haplotypes exhibit an uneven spatiotemporal distribution. We also identified putatively selected genes in this diverse population, primarily linked to fertility, immune response, and metabolic traits.},

  abstract     = {From our origins in Africa, humans have migrated and settled across the world. Perhaps none of these migrations has been the subject of as much debate as the expansion into and throughout the Americas. Gusareva et al . used 1537 whole-genome sequenced samples from 139 populations in South America and Northeast Eurasia to shed light on the population history of Native Americans. Collected as a part of the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, analysis of these data showed that there are four main ancestral lineages that contributed to modern South Americans. These lineages diverged from each other between 10,000 and 14,000 years ago, and this analysis reveals more details of the population history dynamics in these groups. —Corinne Simonti Genome sequencing of 1537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups reveals the genetic characteristics of understudied populations in North Asia and South America. Our analysis demonstrates that West Siberian ancestry, represented by the Kets and Nenets, contributed to the genetic ancestry of most Siberian populations. West Beringians, including the Koryaks, Inuit, and Luoravetlans, exhibit genetic adaptation to Arctic climate, including medically relevant variants. In South America, early migrants split into four groups—Amazonians, Andeans, Chaco Amerindians, and Patagonians—~13,900 years ago. Their longest migration led to population decline, whereas settlement in South America’s diverse environments caused instant spatial isolation, reducing genetic and immunogenic diversity. These findings highlight how population history and environmental pressures shaped the genetic architecture of human populations across North Asia and South America.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into a set of chromosomes within a single nucleus. Xu et al . discovered an exception to this rule (see the Perspective by Mitchison and Sullivan). They found that two plant-damaging fungi, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea , distribute their chromosomes across multiple nuclei within a single cell. S. sclerotiorum divides its 16 chromosomes between two nuclei, and B. cinerea spreads its 18 chromosomes across four to five nuclei. This unusual arrangement challenges established concepts in cell biology and may provide insight into these fungi’s adaptability to diverse environments. —Di Jiang Nuclei define eukaryotes, enabling macromolecular compartmentalization and cellular regulation. Each nucleus is believed to contain one or more haploid sets of chromosomes (1N). However, we discovered that haploid cells of the pathogenic fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea distribute their chromosomes such that each of their nuclei contains only a subset of the haploid chromosomes (≤½N). The unusual chromosomal distribution was confirmed by cellular and molecular methods including chromosome counting, fluorescence in situ hybridization, flow cytometry–based DNA measurements, and single-nucleus polymerase chain reaction experiments. This phenomenon challenges fundamental assumptions about nuclear organization and opens fresh avenues in chromosome biology.},

Three independent studies investigated the mechanisms and molecular players involved in astrocyte-neuron communication using multiple in vivo and in vitro models (see the Perspective by Eroglu). Guttenplan et al . used fruit fly larvae and mammalian astrocyte cultures to show that exposure to the norepinephrine (NE) homolog tyramine enables astrocytes to suddenly respond potently to a range of neurotransmitters to which they are normally nonresponsive. In zebrafish, Chen et al . found that NE modulates larval behavior through NE receptor activation on astrocytes, astrocyte secretion of ATP, extracellular metabolism of ATP into adenosine, and activation of neuronal adenosine receptors. Finally, Lefton et al . showed that, in mice, NE modulates synaptic function through a signaling pathway involving astrocytic adrenergic receptors. These three studies point to a model of neural network function in which neuronal signaling and network function can be gated by computations in astrocytes. —Mattia Maroso Locus ceruleus (LC)–derived norepinephrine (NE) drives network and behavioral adaptations to environmental saliencies by reconfiguring circuit functional connectivity, but the underlying synapse-level mechanisms are elusive. Here, we show that NE remodeling of synaptic function is completely independent from its binding on neuronal receptors. Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses. Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy. These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.},

During futility-induced behavioral transitions in the larval zebrafish, the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) drives fast excitation and delayed inhibition of behavior and circuit activity. We found that astroglial purinergic signaling implements the inhibitory arm of this motif. In larval zebrafish, NE triggers astroglial release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), extracellular conversion of ATP into adenosine, and behavioral suppression through activation of hindbrain neuronal adenosine receptors. Our results suggest a computational and behavioral role for an evolutionarily conserved astroglial purinergic signaling axis in NE-mediated behavioral and brain state transitions and position astroglia as important effectors in neuromodulatory signaling.},

Here, we report a mechanism in Drosophila by which G protein–coupled adrenergic signaling in astrocytes can control—or “gate”—their ability to respond to other neurotransmitters. Further, we show that manipulating this pathway potently regulates neuronal circuit activity and animal behavior. This gating mechanism is conserved in cultured primary mammalian astrocytes, suggesting that it might be an ancient feature of astrocyte circuit function.

Kim et al . have worked to develop alternative models for studying bat-virus interactions by obtaining cells from wild-caught insectivorous vespertilionid and rhinolophid bats (see the Perspective by Zhou and Yuen). Organoids were created from four different organs of five different species of bat. The cellular composition of the organoids was verified, and infection experiments were conducted with a range of coronaviruses and influenza A viruses, which showed intact and differentiated innate immune responses. In addition, the organoids were used successfully for virus discovery and in efficacy testing for antiviral drugs. —Caroline Ash Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, but suitable model systems for comprehensively exploring host-pathogen interactions and assessing spillover risks remain limited. To address this gap, we developed a collection of bat organoid models spanning five species and four organ types. This multispecies, multiorgan organoid panel showed species- and tissue-specific replication patterns for several viruses, offering robust pathophysiological models for studying respiratory, renal, and enteric zoonotic viruses. Using this platform, we successfully isolated and characterized bat-borne mammalian orthoreoviruses and paramyxoviruses, demonstrating the utility of these organoid panels for virome surveillance.

As far as we know, modern North American horses are descended from Eurasian lineages later brought by Europeans. Running Horse Collin et al . looked across modern and ancient samples and found that horse movement between North America and Asia was common across Beringia between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. In the late Pleistocene, this route was lost, and connectivity between these populations ended, leading to the extinction of horses on their natal continent. Understanding how such losses of connectivity have affected species in the past should shape our efforts to maintain species into the future. —Sacha Vignieri Climate affects habitat, food availability, and the movement and sustainability of all life. In this work, we apply Indigenous and Western scientific methods, including genomics and isotope profiling, on fossils from across Beringia to explore the effect of climate change on horses. We find that Late Pleistocene horses from Alaska and northern Yukon are related to populations from Eurasia and crossed the Bering land bridge multiple times during the last glacial interval. We also find deeply divergent lineages north and south of the American ice sheets that genetically influenced populations across Beringia and into Eurasia. As climate warmed and horses entered the ice-free corridor connecting Beringia and midcontinental America, restricted mobility and food availability impeded population growth. Our combined Western and Indigenous framework offers critical guidance for wildlife conservation amid ongoing climate change.},

Chen et al . used temporal datasets of plant and animal species ranges from five continents to determine whether species are indeed moving upslope and if this is occurring more than would be expected by a null model accounting for the area they occupy. They found that both upward and downward range shifts occurred, with narrow-ranged and lowland species more likely to expand their ranges upward. However, ranges did not generally contract, and trends fell within the range of null model expectations, suggesting that, so far, species are not showing the expected responses to climate change. —Bianca Lopez Mountain biodiversity reorganizes rapidly as species shift upslope to track temperatures. Pervasive species redistribution poses substantial threats to mountain ecosystems, a phenomenon sometimes described as an “escalator to extinction,” primarily through mountaintop extinctions, range shift gaps (i.e., rapid shifts of suitable temperatures getting ahead of narrow-range species’ upper limits), and lowland biodiversity attrition, yet empirical evidence remains scarce. In this study, our analysis of 8800 records of historical and modern elevational range limits for 440 animal and 1629 plant species revealed little evidence supporting the proposed threats. Observed changes largely fell within random expectations, accounting for geometric constraints. Although delayed mountaintop extinctions point to accumulating extinction debt, concurrent range expansions of both narrow-range and lowland species suggest thermal niche underfilling, processes that collectively drive biotic homogenization across biologically complex mountain ecosystems.},

However, optimizing the solid-solid interface remains a grand challenge to achieve high sulfur utilization and long cycle life. Lee et al . used ultra-high-speed mixing of a sulfur cathode with a halide-based solid electrolyte to fabricate composite electrodes. This process leads to interfacial segregation and formation of a lithium chloride–rich shell on the surface of the particles. This structure enhances charge transport kinetics, boosts interfacial stability, and mitigates mechanical failure in solid-state batteries. The formation and efficacy of the halide segregation was confirmed using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy techniques. —Marc S. Lavine Mixing electroactive materials, solid-state electrolytes, and conductive carbon to fabricate composite electrodes is the most practiced but least understood process in all-solid-state batteries, which strongly dictates interfacial stability and charge transport. We report on universal halide segregation at interfaces across various halogen-containing solid-state electrolytes and a family of high-energy chalcogen cathodes enabled by mechanochemical reaction during ultrahigh-speed mixing. Bulk and interface characterizations by multimodal synchrotron x-ray probes and cryo–transmission electron microscopy show that the in situ segregated lithium halide interfacial layers substantially boost effective ion transport and suppress the volume change of bulk chalcogen cathodes. Various all-solid-state lithium-chalcogen cells demonstrate utilization close to 100% and extraordinary cycling stability at commercial-level areal capacities.},

  abstract     = {The rapid rise in textile waste worldwide has brought growing attention to the environmental consequences of fast fashion. In 2015, the global textiles and clothing industry generated an estimated 92 million metric tons of waste (1), and projections suggest that this figure could increase by at least 50% by 2030 under a business-asusual scenario (2). Unsustainable waste management practices, such as landfilling, have exacerbated environmental challenges, contributing to the release of micro- and nanoplastics as well as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into ecosystems (3, 4). The textile industry urgently needs sustainable interventions that will promote a circular economy.},

The lack of discussion leaves a difficult ethical question unresolved: When so much attention is given to the value of biodiversity and the conservation of species, what circumstances, paradoxically, might justify the deliberate, full extinction of a species? At least one species is now a preliminary candidate for full extinction, and cases under consideration for temporary suppression and local extinction might pose a risk of full extinction. We discuss three cases in which genome modification might be used to eradicate a species. Together, we argue, these cases suggest that deliberate full extinction might occasionally be acceptable, but only extremely rarely. The cases also highlight tensions within some widely held views about the conservation of species and the governance of genome editing.},

  abstract     = {It is accepted that neuromodulators such as norepinephrine and dopamine bind to and activate receptors on neurons to influence the activity of neuronal circuits and plasticity (changes in strength or wiring patterns) of synaptic connections, thus shaping the behavior of the organism. Unlike classical neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate), which typically mediate fast, point-to-point synaptic communication, neuromodulators diffuse broadly through neural tissue to regulate the strength, duration, and plasticity of neuronal signaling. Emerging evidence now implicates astrocytes—traditionally seen as passive support cells—as active players in neuromodulation ( 1 – 3 ). However, whether astrocytes are necessary intermediaries in neuromodulation or represent regulatory adjuncts to neuronal actions is unclear. On pages 763, 769, and 776 of this issue, Guttenplan et al . ( 4 ), Chen et al . ( 5 ), and Lefton et al . ( 6 ), respectively, address these gaps in knowledge by reporting that astrocytes are indispensable for neuromodulatory signaling across diverse neural circuits, behavioral contexts, and species.},

The nuclei of gametes contain a haploid (1N) genome after segregation and separation of parental chromosomes during meiosis. In fungi, the second meiotic division (meiosis II), which generates haploid gametes, is often followed by a round of ordinary cell division (mitosis) to generate eight haploid ascospores in each fruiting body (an ascus). Nuclei containing fewer than a haploid set of chromosomes likely lack many genes necessary for cell or organism viability. On page 784 of this issue, Xu et al .

Underlying this transition is the competition between the kinetic energy of water molecules and the potential energy arising from their mutual interactions. When the temperature falls below the freezing point, the interaction energy wins this competition and water freezes. A two-dimensional (2D) system of electrons exhibits a similar competition between kinetic and potential energies that also gives rise to a freezing–melting transition. However, the nature of this transition in an electron system has remained mysterious for decades. On page 736 of this issue, Xiang et al.

The observed intricate spatial patterns raise fascinating questions about the nature of this fundamental phase transition in the quantum realm.},

Only recently has this alga been discovered to be host to a giant, 617,000–base pair DNA virus that is integrated into the algal genome. Using long-read sequencing, Erazo-Garcia et al . found that this giant endogenous viral element can produce active virus particles from apparently healthy algal cultures and in wild populations. The widespread presence of virus relicts hints that virus integration is common in this alga and that selection is acting to deactivate them. This giant virus contains several RNA-guided nucleases that are encoded by mobile sequences and, along with other proteins, these nucleases are packaged into its particles. —Caroline Ash Latency is a common strategy in a wide range of viral lineages, but its prevalence in giant viruses remains unknown. In this work, we describe a 617–kilo–base pairs integrated giant viral element in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . We resolved the integrated viral genome using long-read sequencing, identified a putative polintovirus-like integrase, and show that viral particles accumulate primarily during the stationary growth phase. A diverse array of viral-encoded selfish genetic elements is expressed during viral activity, including several Fanzor nuclease–encoding transposable elements. In addition, we show that field isolates of Chlamydomonas spp. harbor signatures of endogenous giant viruses related to the C. reinhardtii virus that exhibit similar infection dynamics, suggesting that giant virus latency is prevalent in natural host communities. Our work describes an unusually large temperate virus of a unicellular eukaryote, substantially expanding the scope of cryptic viral infections in the virosphere.},

When one anyon is exchanged with another, the many-body wave function acquires a phase that can be measured using Fabry-Pérot interferometers. Werkmeister et al . used such a technique to measure this so-called braiding phase for two different filling factors in a graphene device. The researchers expect that the approach can also be used for even-denominator FQH states, where non-abelian anyons are predicted to arise. —Jelena Stajic The search for anyons, quasiparticles with fractional charge and exotic exchange statistics, has inspired decades of condensed matter research. Quantum Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase through discrete interference phase jumps when the number of encircled localized quasiparticles changes. In this study, we observed this braiding phase in both the filling factor 1/3 and 4/3 fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real time. We found that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number n fluctuations, and we reconstructed three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by 2π/3, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around n (mod 3) anyons. Our methods can be readily extended to interference of non-abelian anyons.},

Analytical methods thus need to be precise, sensitive to both size and shape, and ideally based on single-molecule observations. Zhu et al . developed a microfluidic chip-based method, escape-time stereometry, that enables real-time analysis of the size and conformation of molecules in solution (see the Perspective by Goldsmith and Brewster). The authors demonstrated this approach in experiments measuring small-molecule reaction kinetics, conformational differences in DNA and RNA nanostructures, and binding between biomolecules. —Michael A. Funk Size and shape are critical discriminators between molecular species and states. We describe a microchip-based high-throughput imaging approach offering rapid and precise determination of molecular properties under native solution conditions. Our method detects differences in molecular weight across at least three orders of magnitude and down to two carbon atoms in small molecules. We quantify the strength of molecular interactions across more than six orders of magnitude in affinity constant and track reactions in real time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure. We further leverage the method’s structural sensitivity for diagnostics, exploiting ligand-induced conformational changes in the insulin receptor to sense insulin concentration in serum at the subnanoliter and subzeptomole scale.},

These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function ( gcu s) whose role and adaptive value remain unexplored. In this work, we show that gcu s encode phage resistance systems, many of which are newly discovered. Bacteriophage resistance integron cassettes (BRiCs) can be combined and mixed with resistance cassettes to produce multiphage or drug and phage resistance. The fitness costs of BRiCs are variable and dependent on the genetic context and can be modulated by changing the order of cassettes in the array. Hence, MIs act as highly mobile, low-cost defense islands.},

  abstract     = {In South Asia, bricks are typically made in coal-fired kilns that are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in the region. Regulating such informal industries is difficult and limited by state capacity in many low- and middle-income countries. However, Brooks et al . found that simple modifications to operational practices at “zigzag” kilns in Bangladesh reduced their energy use, emissions, and fuel costs while improving brick quality. Uptake of the intervention was high (65%) and even sought out by almost 20% of kilns in the control group. The short-term economic benefits and lack of capital investment of the intervention likely contributed to its uptake and success. —Bianca Lopez We present results from a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that introduced operational practices to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in 276 “zigzag” brick kilns. Of all intervention kilns, 65% adopted the improved practices. Treatment assignment reduced energy use by 10.5% ( P -value <0.001) and decreased CO 2 and PM 2.5 emissions by 171 and 0.45 metric tons, respectively, per kiln per year. Valuing the CO 2 reductions using a social cost of carbon of 185 USD per metric ton, we find that the social benefits outweigh costs by a factor of 65 to 1. The intervention, which required no new capital investment, also decreased fuel costs and increased brick quality. Our results demonstrate the potential for privately profitable, as well as publicly beneficial, improvements to address environmental problems in informal industries.},

  abstract     = {Cancer neoantigens are proteins expressed by tumor cells that can trigger an immune response that eliminates the tumor. A major challenge that limits their use as successful immunotherapy for solid tumors, particularly pancreatic cancer, is rarity of such cancer-specific proteins and peptides that are consistently expressed by most of the tumor cells. Ely et al . performed an immunopeptidomics study of human pancreatic cancers and identified a large number of unique peptides derived from noncoding regions of the genome (see the Perspective by Tuveson). Certain peptides were immunogenic and provided a source to generate T cell–specific immune responses that could kill pancreatic cancers in preclinical models. Some of the cancer-derived peptides were shared by multiple patients and were absent from normal pancreatic cells, raising the prospect of universal “off-the-shelf” therapies, as opposed to more challenging personalized approaches. —Priscilla N. Kelly Translation of the noncoding genome in cancer can generate cryptic (noncanonical) peptides capable of presentation by human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I); however, the cancer specificity and immunogenicity of noncanonical HLA-I–bound peptides (ncHLAp) are incompletely understood. Using high-resolution immunopeptidomics, we discovered that cryptic peptides are abundant in the pancreatic cancer immunopeptidome. Approximately 30% of ncHLAp exhibited cancer-restricted translation, and a substantial subset were shared among patients. Cancer-restricted ncHLAp displayed robust immunogenic potential in a sensitive ex vivo T cell priming platform. ncHLAp-reactive, T cell receptor–redirected T cells exhibited tumoricidal activity against patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids. These findings demonstrate that pancreatic cancer harbors cancer-restricted ncHLAp that can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. Future therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer, and potentially other solid tumors, may include targeting cryptic antigens.},

The authors also developed a version of the protein amenable to in-cell–directed evolution, enabling further optimization and expansion of the reactivity to silylation reactions. Their final design is highly active even in a mixed aqueous-organic solvent. —Michael A. Funk De novo design of protein catalysts with high efficiency and stereoselectivity provides an attractive approach toward the design of environmentally benign catalysts. Here, we design proteins that incorporate histidine-ligated synthetic porphyrin and heme ligands. Four of 10 designed proteins catalyzed cyclopropanation with an enantiomeric ratio greater than 99:1. A second class of proteins were designed to catalyze a silicon-hydrogen insertion and were optimized by directed evolution in whole cells. The evolved proteins incorporated features unlikely to be generated by computational design alone, including a proline in an α helix. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that as the proteins evolved toward higher activity, their conformational ensembles narrowed to favor more productive conformations. Our work demonstrates that efficient de novo protein catalysts are designable and should be useful for manifold chemical processes.},

  abstract     = {The Cambrian explosion is known as a time when evolution “experimented” with a wide array of new body forms, the modern affinities of which are often incredibly difficult to identify. This difficulty not only arises because of their unusual morphologies, but also because of the age of the fossils, which can make identification of key traits challenging. One classic enigmatic example is Shishania , an elongated, bag-like creature covered in spines. Recent assessments have placed this genus as an early mollusk, but Yang et al . describe new specimens that challenge that interpretation, pushing this organism back toward the sponge-like chancelloriids. —Sacha Vignieri The Cambrian evolutionary radiation is noted for its profusion of bizarre and unfamiliar body forms, many of which illuminate the early ancestry of major animal groups. The spine-covered fossil Shishania aculeata (Cambrian Stage 4, Yunnan, China) has been interpreted as intermediate between mollusks and their lophotrochozoan ancestors. Our new material challenges this interpretation. We propose taphonomic explanations for apparent molluscan features and instead identify prominent anatomical similarities to coeval chancelloriids from nearby strata. Our reinterpretation of Shishania as an early-diverging chancelloriid helps to consolidate a model for the early evolution of this enduringly problematic group of sponge-like metazoans.},

Okuyama et al . identified the disulfide synthase enzymes responsible for producing volatile oligosulfides in three plant genera, including Asarum species (see the Perspective by Caputi and O’Connor). By examining enzymatic functions and reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences, the authors found that disulfide synthases probably evolved from a methanethiol oxidase gene that is widely conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Disulfide synthases were independently co-opted for oligosulfide production in each floral lineage, and this process could be achieved with just two or three amino acid substitutions. The work provides insight into the convergent evolution of new traits in the context of floral mimicry. —Madeleine Seale Identifying the metabolic and genetic changes that confer evolutionary novelty is essential for understanding the factors facilitating or constraining the occurrence of traits. We show that dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), a volatile compound that attracts saprophilous pollinators, is produced by a disulfide synthase (DSS) in the plant genus Asarum (Aristolochiaceae). DSS is derived from methanethiol oxidase (MTOX), an enzyme conserved among animals and plants, and similar DSS enzymes have independently evolved in two other plant genera. Three amino acid changes shared among the DSSs of independent origins were sufficient to cause a functional switch between MTOX and DSS. The small number of amino acid changes and the co-option of a highly conserved enzyme may explain why DMDS-emitting flowers are widespread among floral mimics.},

However, because the effects only last several days, additional infusions of ketamine can be required. With repeated use, ketamine may produce unwanted side effects. Ma et al . discovered that the antidepressant effects of ketamine can be prolonged by manipulations of the signal transduction cascade involving extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) (see the Perspective by Hashimoto). A single dose of ketamine increased synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus for a short period of time, but enhancing ERK function caused these changes to be long-lasting. These results demonstrate that the antidepressant action of ketamine can be significantly extended after a single dose, thus avoiding repeated administration. —Peter Stern Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration. Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action. Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6). The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months. The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects. These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.},

The reaction operates on dihydrobenzofurans and likely involves a cyclopropyl intermediate accessed photochemically. —Jake S.

In this work, we report a formal 1,2-acyl transposition through the photochemical exchange of the C 2 –C 3 positions of C 2 -acylated dihydrobenzofurans. This strategy relies on an unusual photochemical isomerization of the dihydrobenzofuran core to a highly electrophilic spiro-cyclopropane intermediate that is then intercepted by a halide nucleophile. A variety of aryl ketones are transposed using 370-nanometer centered irradiation. Additionally, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides can be transposed using 310-nanometer centered irradiation.

  abstract     = {Skyrmions, whirlpools of magnetic spin that hold promise for spintronics applications, usually occur in materials that lack a center of symmetry. They have also been observed in centrosymmetric materials, where they can be as small as a few nanometers, but the mechanism for their formation is not well understood. Dong et al . used photoemission measurements to access the electronic structure of GdRu 2 Si 2 , a centrosymmetric material featuring a skyrmion phase. The researchers focused on the ground state from which the skyrmion phase arises. Photoemission revealed the emergence of the so-called Fermi arcs, as well as a pseudogap. These findings will help to distinguish between the various theories of skyrmion formation in this class of materials and may also lead to practical applications. —Jelena Stajic Skyrmions in noncentrosymmetric materials are believed to occur due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By contrast, the skyrmion formation mechanism in centrosymmetric materials remains elusive. Here, we reveal the intrinsic electronic structure of the centrosymmetric GdRu 2 Si 2 by selectively measuring magnetic domains using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We found robust Fermi surface (FS) nesting, consistent with the magnetic modulation q -vector detected by the previous resonant x-ray scattering measurements. The pseudogap opens at the nested FS portions, which vary for different magnetic domains. The anomalous pseudogap disconnects the FS to generate Fermi arcs with twofold symmetry. These results indicate that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction plays a decisive role in generating the screw spin modulation responsible for the skyrmion formation in GdRu 2 Si 2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexible nature of magnetism in GdRu 2 Si 2 by manipulating magnetic domains with magnetic field and temperature cyclings, providing potential future applications for data storage and processing devices.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a valuable tool for generating patient-specific implants, either externally or even directly inside the body. The limitation of the former approach is the need for surgical implantation, whereas the latter approach is limited by the need for precursor materials and a polymerization method safe for in vivo use that can be activated with precision from outside of the body. Davoodi et al . developed a platform that uses imaging-guided ultrasound printing, which is capable of penetration depths much greater than the other approaches (see the Perspective by Kuang). The authors loaded cross-linking agents loaded into low-temperature–sensitive liposomes for incorporation into tunable bioinks. In vivo demonstrations included printing near diseased areas in a mouse bladder and deep within rabbit leg muscles. —Marc S. Lavine Three-dimensional printing offers promise for patient-specific implants and therapies but is often limited by the need for invasive surgical procedures. To address this, we developed an imaging-guided deep tissue in vivo sound printing (DISP) platform. By incorporating cross-linking agent–loaded low-temperature–sensitive liposomes into bioinks, DISP enables precise, rapid, on-demand cross-linking of diverse functional biomaterials using focused ultrasound. Gas vesicle–based ultrasound imaging provides real-time monitoring and allows for customized pattern creation in live animals. We validated DISP by successfully printing near diseased areas in the mouse bladder and deep within rabbit leg muscles in vivo, demonstrating its potential for localized drug delivery and tissue replacement. DISP’s ability to print conductive, drug-loaded, cell-laden, and bioadhesive biomaterials demonstrates its versatility for diverse biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Retail outlets will often use inflatable air dancers to attract attention. Although they are tethered, and thus confined to oscillate within a limited space, the motion is largely chaotic. Comoretto et al . showed that a soft, elastomeric, kinked tube connected to a continuous air flow could undergo self-regulating, periodic motion. The kink travels along the tube driven by the air inflow, cyclically changing its fluidic resistance based on how much the tube opening is restricted when the kink is in different positions. The authors used a set of oscillating kinked tubes as limbs for both a tethered and an untethered legged robot that does not require a controller unit to coordinate the motion. The robots showed faster locomotion compared with other soft robots. —Marc S. Lavine Animals achieve robust locomotion by offloading regulation from the brain to physical couplings within the body. In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. Here, we introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires a constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. Physical synchronization of several of these self-oscillating limbs enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than those of comparable state-of-the-art robots. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.},

Under the assumption that talent is evenly distributed across social and demographic groups, social mobility indicates whether a society offers equal opportunities for economic and social success irrespective of initial condition. We present new evidence on the social mobility beliefs of a large, representative sample of 15-year-olds in 57 countries worldwide that highlights how young people believe in opportunities for meritocratic advancement even in contexts with a large degree of income inequality and constrained opportunities for social mobility. Such belief that individuals in a society can move up or down can render stark income disparities more acceptable and motivate effort to advance. But it may also encourage a willingness to defend an unequal system. In the long term, unfulfilled expectations could lead to frustration and potentially a breakdown of social bonds.},

Somatic mutations can result in altered or new proteins that are not present in normal cells, and these “neoantigens” are considered to be a main source of endogenous antitumor immunity. Genome sequencing has revealed that many cancers harbor dozens to hundreds of potential neoantigens, which might be harnessed to develop cancer immunotherapies and vaccines. On page 607 of this issue, Ely et al.

Its off-label use is especially common in the US ( 1 ). Despite a short half-life, a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine has antidepressant effects lasting 1 to 2 weeks. Clinically, repeated ketamine infusions are needed to maintain these antidepressant benefits, but this increases the risk of side effects, such as psychotomimetic and dissociative reactions, as well as its potential for abuse ( 2 ). On page 646 of this issue, Ma et al . ( 3 ) report a strategy that extends ketamine’s effects by enhancing a specific signaling pathway in hippocampal neurons of the mouse brain.

Additive manufacturing, or three-dimensional (3D) printing, offers an alternative to quickly build personalized implants with complex shapes ( 1 – 4 ). 3D printing using infrared light has enabled the patterning of complex shapes underneath submillimeter-thick skins or muscles ( 5 ). In this approach, irradiating tissue-embedded polymer inks with light triggers polymerization. However, considerable attenuation and scattering of light beams by intervening tissues limit direct printing of implants beneath millimeter-thick tissues. On page 616 of this issue, Davoodi et al.

  abstract     = {As tissues assemble, the dynamic shape changes that define their form occur coincident with the asymmetric cell divisions that generate cellular diversity. Lovegrove et al . used morphometric analyses of tissue formation in multiple contexts, including zebrafish, human, and mouse blood vessel and neural crest development, finding that these morphogenetic events are fundamentally co-dependent. Distinct shifts in shape-switched cells to a so-called “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserves premitotic shape and the unequal distribution of identity determinants throughout division. This switch, which avoids the usual cell rounding associated with division, breaks symmetry and creates daughter cells that adopt disparate identities. Thus, shape change sculpts tissue architecture and tunes the mode, symmetry, and outcome of cell division to direct identity decisions driving tissue building. —Stella M. Hurtley During tissue formation, dynamic cell shape changes drive morphogenesis while asymmetric divisions create cellular diversity. We found that the shifts in cell morphology that shape tissues could concomitantly act as conserved instructive cues that trigger asymmetric division and direct core identity decisions underpinning tissue building. We performed single-cell morphometric analyses of endothelial and other mesenchymal-like cells. Distinct morphological changes switched cells to an “isomorphic” mode of division, which preserved pre-mitotic morphology throughout mitosis. In isomorphic divisions, interphase morphology appeared to provide a geometric code defining mitotic symmetry, fate determinant partitioning, and daughter state. Rab4-positive endosomes recognized this code, allowing them to respond to pre-mitotic morphology and segregate determinants accordingly. Thus, morphogenetic shape change sculpts tissue form while also generating cellular heterogeneity, thereby driving tissue assembly.},

In this approach, two split inteins, encoded elements that are self-cleaving when joined, enable the removal and replacement of an interior segment of a protein (see the Perspective by Hampton and Liu). The authors demonstrated that their system functions in vitro and in live cells by installing modified peptide tags into endogenously expressed tagged proteins. —Michael A. Funk The ability to study proteins in their native cellular context is crucial to our understanding of biology. In this work, we report a technology for intracellular protein editing, drawing from split intein–mediated protein splicing, genetic code expansion, and endogenous protein tagging. This approach enables us to rapidly and site-specifically install residues and chemical handles into a protein. We demonstrate the power of this platform to edit cellular proteins, inserting epitopes, protein-specific sequences, and noncanonical amino acids. Notably, we use an endogenous tagging approach to apply our protein editing technology to endogenous proteins with minimal perturbation. We anticipate that the protein editing technology presented in this work will be applied to a diverse set of problems and phenomena in live mammalian cells.},

Zhou et al . undertook a large-scale survey of fecal and environmental fungi in humans across China (see the Perspective by Hooper and Koh). They identified a filamentous fungus called Fusarium foetens that negatively associated with the human metabolic disease phenotype metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis. Experiments in mice using cultured isolates of this species revealed that it produced diverse metabolites, including a small naphthoquinone molecule that inhibited the mammalian enzyme ceramide synthase. The metabolite and the presence of the fungus reduced ceramide accumulation and alleviated fatty liver disease in mice. —Caroline Ash The gut microbiota is known to be associated with a variety of human metabolic diseases, including metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Fungi are increasingly recognized as important members of this community; however, the role of fungal symbionts in metabolic diseases is unknown. We have systematically isolated and characterized gut fungi, identifying Fusarium foetens as an intestinal symbiotic filamentous fungus in mice. F. foetens reverses MASH progression in mouse models through an intestinal ceramide synthetase 6 (CerS6)–ceramide axis.

Lyu et al . used the fly olfactory circuit as a model to identify general principles of neural circuit assembly (see the Perspective by Zhong and Desplan). By tracing dendrite and axon development of individual neurons, the authors showed that receptor neurons follow a predetermined trajectory on the surface of the antennal lobe. There, they encounter a small subset of projection neurons, thus reducing a three-dimensional search to an easier one-dimensional task. The dimensionality reduction principle shown here greatly simplifies the problem of synaptic partner matching in olfactory circuit assembly. —Mattia Maroso A navigating axon faces complex choices when selecting postsynaptic partners in a three-dimensional (3D) space. In this work, we discovered a principle that can establish the 3D glomerular map of the fly antennal lobe by reducing the higher dimensionality serially to 1D projections. During development, olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons first contact their partner projection neuron dendrites on the spherical surface of the antennal lobe, regardless of whether the adult glomeruli lie near the surface or inside. Along this 2D surface, axons of each ORN type take a specific, arc-shaped trajectory that precisely intersects with their partner dendrites. Altering axon trajectories compromises synaptic partner matching. A 3D search is thus reduced to one dimension, simplifying partner matching.},

Almost all species showed areas with population increases and areas with declines, often with the strongest declines occurring in areas where species were most abundant. Most species were declining overall, suggesting a worsening situation for birds. However, areas of population increase may offer refuge or point to conditions that could facilitate recovery. —Bianca Lopez Efforts to address declines of North American birds have been constrained by limited availability of fine-scale information about population change. By using participatory science data from eBird, we estimated continental population change and relative abundance at 27-kilometer resolution for 495 bird species from 2007 to 2021. Results revealed high and previously undetected spatial heterogeneity in trends; although 75% of species were declining, 97% of species showed separate areas of significantly increasing and decreasing populations. Populations tended to decline most steeply in strongholds where species were most abundant, yet they fared better where species were least abundant.

However, adaptation and gene flow between populations adapted to different climates are rarely integrated into models predicting how species will respond to climate change. Anderson et al . collected data on Boechera stricta , a common perennial plant, from five common garden experiments in the Rocky Mountains of the US to quantify the amount of migration needed to keep up with climate change and the potential for evolutionary rescue (see the Perspective by Aitken). Using integral projection models, they predicted a decline in adaptive potential and insufficient gene flow to keep up with climate change. This work shows the importance of accounting for evolution in ecological predictions and the limitations of species distribution models. —Bianca Lopez Climate change increasingly drives local population dynamics, shifts geographic distributions, and threatens persistence. Gene flow and rapid adaptation could rescue declining populations yet are seldom integrated into forecasts. We modeled eco-evolutionary dynamics under preindustrial, contemporary, and projected climates using up to 9 years of fitness data from 102,272 transplants (115 source populations) of Boechera stricta in five common gardens. Climate change endangers locally adapted populations and reduces genotypic variation in long-term population growth rate, suggesting limited adaptive potential. Upslope migration could stabilize high-elevation populations and preserve low-elevation ecotypes, but unassisted gene flow modeled with genomic data is too spatially restricted. Species distribution models failed to capture current dynamics and likely overestimate persistence under intermediate emissions scenarios, highlighting the importance of modeling evolutionary processes.},

Many of these shapes can be described by Gauss incompatibility. An exception to this behavior is the shape of rose petals, which do satisfy Gauss conditions. However, Zhang et al . have shown that the formation of localized cusps along the edges of rose petals during their growth is driven by Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson incompatibility instead (see the Perspective by Cui and Jin). Although this theory is known, it has not been connected to natural growth. By combining theory, simulations, and experimental results, including the fabrication of synthetic petals, the authors provide an expanded perspective on the geometric frustrations that affect morphogenesis in biological systems and qualitatively demonstrate the role of stress concentration in petal growth. —Marc S. Lavine Growth and form are deeply interconnected, in a manner often mediated by mechanical instabilities arising from geometric incompatibilities. Although Gauss incompatibility has long been recognized as the source of morphing in naturally growing slender organs, here we show that the growth profile of rose petals remains Gauss compatible. Their distinctive shape emerges from a different type of geometric incompatibility, the Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson (MCP) incompatibility, which leads to the formation of localized cusps along the petal margins. We validated this mechanism in model disc petals theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. Our study reveals distinct morphological regimes, ranging from smooth edges to cusp-forming configurations, and demonstrates how stress focusing at cusps influences subsequent petal growth. These findings position MCP incompatibility as a generic mechanism for cusp formation in both natural and manmade self-morphing sheets.},

To explain this striking specificity, the chemoaffinity hypothesis proposes that neurons bear molecular identification tags (e.g., cell surface proteins) that distinguish them from one another and establish specific connections ( 1 ). Although this idea has been validated in some cases, given the limited number of cell surface proteins encoded by the genome, it is unlikely that such large numbers of neurons could rely solely on strict chemoaffinity to establish complicated neuronal networks ( 2 ). This problem might become insurmountable when the neurons have to find their targets in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. On page 538 of this issue, Lyu et al . ( 3 ) report that olfactory neurons in the fruit fly ( Drosophila ) solve this problem by reducing the dimensionality of the search path.

Hong et al . showed that this formed a highly active catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. After prolonged use, the oxidative removal of built-up carbon also redispersed platinum clusters that had formed back to single atoms. This self-regeneration was achieved for more than 110 reaction-regeneration cycles and, unlike commercial platinum-tin catalysts, did not require added chlorine. —Phil Szuromi Supported noble metal cluster catalysts are typically operated under severe conditions involving switching between reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, causing irreversible transformation of the catalyst structure and thereby leading to permanent deactivation. We discovered that various platinum (Pt) precursors spontaneously disperse in a germanium-MFI (Ge-MFI) zeolite, which opposes the Ostwald ripening phenomenon, producing self-regenerating Pt/Ge-MFI catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts reversibly switch between Pt clusters and Pt single atoms in response to reducing reaction and oxidizing regeneration conditions. This environmental adaptability allows them to completely self-regenerate over 110 reaction and regeneration cycles in propane dehydrogenation, and they exhibited unprecedented sintering resistance when exposed to air at 800°C for 10 days. Such spontaneous metal dispersion in a Ge-MFI zeolite is a robust and versatile methodology for fabricating various rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and palladium cluster catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Lipids are crucial molecules for membrane structure and energy storage, but they are also key signaling molecules within and between cells. Lin et al . investigated the cell surface G protein–coupled receptor FPR2, which is expressed highly in adipocytes, and found that it responds specifically to ceramide lipids with a saturated acyl chain and a length of 20 or fewer carbons. Experiments in mice showed that such lipids are inhibitory for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and can lead to detrimental metabolic outcomes in mice fed a high-fat diet. The authors also determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 bound to ceramides that revealed the molecular basis for lipid recognition. —Michael A. Funk Ceramides play a central role in human health and disease, yet their role as systemic signaling molecules remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14 to C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis through G i cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors. Our findings provide a structural basis for adipocyte thermogenesis mediated by FPR2.},

  abstract     = {Many RNAs fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures that are essential to their biological function. Quaternary structures, formed by the interaction of two RNA molecules, are much rarer. Wang et al . used cryo–electron microscopy to elucidate the global structures of four types of RNA molecules capable of homomeric self-assembly. The structures reveal the specific interactions that facilitate the association of two identical RNA molecules and elucidate the mechanisms by which multiple identical RNA molecules assemble to form cage-like structures with hollow centers. The findings demonstrate that the morphology and dimensions of these cages are determined by the number of interaction sites, as well as the shape and flexibility of individual molecules. —Di Jiang Homo-oligomerization of biological macromolecules leads to functional assemblies that are critical to understanding various cellular processes. However, RNA quaternary structures have rarely been reported. Comparative genomics analysis has identified RNA families containing hundreds of sequences that adopt conserved secondary structures and likely fold into complex three-dimensional structures. In this study, we used cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures from four RNA families, including ARRPOF and OLE forming dimers and ROOL and GOLLD forming hexameric, octameric, and dodecameric nanostructures, at 2.6- to 4.6-angstrom resolutions. These homo-oligomeric assemblies reveal a plethora of structural motifs that contribute to RNA multivalency, including kissing-loop, palindromic base-pairing, A-stacking, metal ion coordination, pseudoknot, and minor-groove interactions. These results provide the molecular basis of intermolecular interactions driving RNA multivalency with potential functional relevance.},

  abstract     = {RNA-guided systems use base pairing between RNA and complementary nucleic acids to achieve precision targeting, a property that has been harnessed to create gene-editing tools. Faure et al . describe a family of RNA-guided systems called TIGRs that use a distinctive guide for DNA recognition and cleavage. The authors structurally and biochemically characterized these systems, revealing similarities to certain small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, and demonstrated the potential to use one of them, TIGR-TasR, for gene editing. This discovery bridges gaps in our understanding of how RNA-based targeting mechanisms emerged across life, shedding light on the origins and diversity of these systems. —Di Jiang RNA-guided systems provide remarkable versatility, enabling diverse biological functions. Through iterative structural and sequence homology-based mining starting with a guide RNA-interaction domain of Cas9, we identified a family of RNA-guided DNA-targeting proteins in phage and parasitic bacteria. Each system consists of a tandem interspaced guide RNA (TIGR) array and a TIGR-associated (Tas) protein containing a nucleolar protein (Nop) domain, sometimes fused to HNH (TasH)– or RuvC (TasR)–nuclease domains. We show that TIGR arrays are processed into 36-nucleotide RNAs (tigRNAs) that direct sequence-specific DNA binding through a tandem-spacer targeting mechanism. TasR can be reprogrammed for precise DNA cleavage, including in human cells. The structure of TasR reveals striking similarities to box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and IS110 RNA-guided transposases, providing insights into the evolution of diverse RNA-guided systems.},

  abstract     = {Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO-stimulating agents have been used to treat anemia in cancer patients, but some research has suggested that this treatment may negatively affect survival. Shedding light on this puzzle, Chiu et al . found that tumor cells require secreted EPO to evade immune attack (see the Perspective by Armouk and Van Ginderachter). Increased tumor-derived EPO levels were associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in liver cancer models. Blocking either tumor-secreted EPO or the EPO receptor on macrophages promoted T cell infiltration and improved the control of hepatocellular carcinoma. The EPO/EPO receptor pathway may therefore act as a switch to toggle cancer immunity. —Priscilla N. Kelly Successful cancer immunotherapy requires a patient to mount an effective immune response against tumors; however, many cancers evade the body’s immune system. To investigate the basis for treatment failure, we examined spontaneous mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with either an inflamed T cell–rich or a noninflamed T cell–deprived tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) secreted by tumor cells determines tumor immunotype. Tumor-derived EPO autonomously generates a noninflamed TME by interacting with its cognate receptor EPOR on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). EPO signaling prompts TAMs to become immunoregulatory through NRF2-mediated heme depletion. Removing either tumor-derived EPO or EPOR on TAMs leads to an inflamed TME and tumor regression independent of genotype, owing to augmented antitumor T cell immunity. Thus, the EPO/EPOR axis functions as an immunosuppressive switch for antitumor immunity.},

  abstract     = {High-pathogenicity avian influenza subtype H5N1 is now present throughout the US, and possibly beyond. More cattle infections elevate the risk of the virus evolving the capacity to transmit between humans, potentially with high fatality rates. Nguyen et al . show that from a single transmission event from a wild bird to dairy cattle in December 2023, there has been cattle-to-poultry, cattle-to-peridomestic bird, and cattle-to-other mammal transmission. The movement of asymptomatic dairy cattle has facilitated the rapid dissemination of H5N1 from Texas across the US. Evolution within cattle, assessed using deep-sequencing data, has detected low-frequency sequence variants that had previously been associated with mammalian adaptation and transmission efficiency. —Caroline Ash Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cross species barriers and have the potential to cause pandemics. In North America, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses related to the goose/Guangdong 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin phylogenetic clade have infected wild birds, poultry, and mammals. Our genomic analysis and epidemiological investigation showed that a reassortment event in wild bird populations preceded a single wild bird–to-cattle transmission episode. The movement of asymptomatic or presymptomatic cattle has likely played a role in the spread of HPAI within the United States dairy herd. Some molecular markers that may lead to changes in transmission efficiency and phenotype were detected at low frequencies. Continued transmission of H5N1 HPAI within dairy cattle increases the risk for infection and subsequent spread of the virus to human populations.},

Wang et al . characterized adipocyte progenitor cells in middle-aged mice using single-cell messenger RNA sequencing (see the Perspective by Jeon and Kim). Many stem cell populations show diminished function in aging, but the authors identified a committed preadipocyte population with enhanced proliferative and adipogenic activity in middle age. These cells maintained increased proliferation when transplanted into young mice. Proliferation of the preadipocytes required signaling by the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. Similar cells were identified in human tissue samples. Thus, these adipocyte progenitor cells may contribute to age-associated obesity and related metabolic disorders. —L. Bryan Ray Starting at middle age, adults often suffer from visceral adiposity and associated adverse metabolic disorders. Lineage tracing in mice revealed that adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in visceral fat undergo extensive adipogenesis during middle age. Thus, despite the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, adipogenesis is unlocked during middle age. Transplantations quantitatively showed that APCs in middle-aged mice exhibited high adipogenic capacity cell-autonomously. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a distinct APC population, the committed preadipocyte, age-enriched (CP-A), emerging at this age. CP-As demonstrated elevated proliferation and adipogenesis activity. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations indicated that leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling was indispensable for CP-A adipogenesis and visceral fat expansion. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism of age-dependent adipose remodeling, offering critical insights into age-related metabolic diseases.},

Perhaps to avoid detection, these caterpillars construct portable cocoons decorated with inedible discarded parts. This species is 5 million years older than the oldest Hawaiian island but is now highly endangered, being found in only a single population on Oʻahu. —Sacha Vignieri Lepidoptera is the most herbivorous of all the insect orders, with predatory caterpillars globally comprising less than 0.13% of the nearly 200,000 moth and butterfly species.

Phylogenomic data suggest that the origin of this unique spider cohabitant is at least six million years old, more than one million years older than Hawaii’s current high islands. After decades of searching, only one species has been discovered, and it is restricted to 15 square kilometers of a single mountain range on the island of Oʻahu, meaning that other members of the lineage have disappeared from older islands.

The biophysical properties that these polymeric scaffolds require for signal transduction are not clearly defined. Here, we engineered single-component DF signalosomes. We found that functionality depends on the stability provided by the DF polymer, which could also be achieved with a bacterial DF domain, a synthetic filament-forming domain, and amyloid-like sequences. This demonstrates the importance of polymer stability and inducibility irrespective of the motif’s origin. By varying the number of included TRAF6 interaction motifs, we demonstrate that avidity is a tunable property that can control the amplitude of signaling outputs. This work lays out a reductionist framework to elucidate the required signaling properties through polymeric scaffolds by adjusting their assembly kinetics, stability, and avidity.},

  abstract     = {High-intensity, high-yield “conventional” agriculture uses practices that can reduce soil health and have other negative environmental impacts. Organic farming generally has a lower environmental impact because it avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, but both organic and conventional farms can vary widely in practices that affect soil. van Rijssel et al . assessed soil biota and functions, including a measure of multifunctionality, in 53 organic and conventional fields across the Netherlands. They found no significant difference in soil multifunctionality between broader agriculture types, but specific practices positively (cover cropping) or negatively (inversion tillage) affected soil functions. Adopting specific practices might thus improve the sustainability of both organic and conventional farms. —Bianca Lopez Organic farming is often considered to be more sustainable than conventional farming. However, both farming systems comprise highly variable management practices. In this study, we show that in organic and conventional arable fields, the multifunctionality of soils decreases with increasing agricultural management intensity. Soil organic carbon content and bacterial biomass, respectively, were the strongest abiotic and biotic predictors of soil multifunctionality. Greater soil multifunctionality was associated with less-frequent inversion tillage and higher frequency of grass-legume cover cropping, and organic farming did not outperform conventional farming. Our results suggest that reducing management intensity will enhance soil multifunctionality in both conventional and organic farming. This implies that, in contexts where high-yielding, high-intensity agriculture prevails, the paradigm of sustainable intensification should be replaced by “productive deintensification.”},

  abstract     = {The electrical double layer (EDL), which is formed when an electrolyte solution comes into contact with a solid surface, is an important concept in many fields. However, understanding its dynamics at high concentrations remains difficult, particularly because traditional electrical measurements are constrained by response times and complex interactions with the probing system. Moreover, classical mean-field models have not been validated for this regime. Greco et al . developed an all-optical method to induce and monitor EDL dynamics at the air-electrolyte interface at arbitrary concentrations. Classical Debye-Falkenhagen theory accurately predicted EDL relaxation times at high concentrations, suggesting its applicability beyond traditional limits. This insight into EDL dynamics highlights the complex interplay between specific interactions and classical electrostatic forces at high concentrations. —Yury Suleymanov The electric double layer (EDL) is critical in electrochemical capacitors and transistors, on-water chemistry, and bioelectric technologies. Ion dynamics within the EDL define the limits for charging and discharging processes. Classical EDL models struggle at high electrolyte concentrations, and observing EDL dynamics has been challenging. In this study, an all-optical technique allowed real-time monitoring of EDL dynamics at arbitrary concentration by quasi-instantaneously changing the surface propensity of protons (H 3 O + ) adsorbed at the air-aqueous electrolyte solution interface and by subsequently tracking EDL relaxation with femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy. EDL reorganization occurred on picosecond timescales and was strongly concentration dependent. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and analytical modeling showed that ion conduction primarily drove EDL dynamics. This research quantified EDL dynamics and identified its primary driver, providing insights for optimization of electrochemical applications.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational microlensing occurs when a foreground star passes between Earth and a background star, focusing light and causing an apparent increase in brightness. If the foreground star has an orbiting planet, then a second, briefer brightness increase can occur. Zang et al . identified a microlensing event due to an exoplanet with a planet/star mass ratio between those of Earth and Neptune. They combined this object with a larger sample of planets detected using microlensing to constrain the abundance and population distribution of planets on Jupiter-like orbits. They found a bimodal distribution, which they interpreted as reflecting the formation mechanisms. —Keith T. Smith Exoplanets classified as super-Earths are commonly observed on short-period orbits, close to their host stars, but their abundance on wider orbits is poorly constrained. Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn’s. We combined this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer that there are ~0.35 super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.},

By contrast, methods to break down or repurpose silicones lag far behind, in part because of the often complex cross-linked structures at play. Vũ et al . now report a versatile method to recycle a wide range of silicone materials using the combined action of a gallium catalyst and a boron trichloride reagent (see the Perspective by Ghosh). The reaction produces chlorinated silane monomers that can be straightforwardly reused, as well as a boron oxide co-product that is applicable in the glass industry. —Jake S. Yeston Chemical recycling to monomers is a key strategy for a sustainable circular polymer economy. However, most efforts have focused on polymers with carbon backbones. Recycling of silicone polymers and corresponding materials, featuring a robust inorganic backbone and tunable properties, remains in its infancy. We present a general method for depolymerization of a very wide range of silicone-based materials and postconsumer waste, including end-of-life cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane-based networks within formulated materials. The reaction proceeds at 40°C, harnessing an efficient gallium catalyst for a million-fold rate enhancement and boron trichloride as the chlorine source, to produce nearly quantitative yields of (methyl)chlorosilanes, key intermediates in the Müller-Rochow process that anchors the silicone industry.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas systems confer antiviral immunity to their bacterial hosts using RNA-guided Cas nucleases, which mediate sequence-specific destruction of viral DNA or RNA. In response, viruses evolved counterdefenses, usually proteins, called anti-CRISPRs that inhibit activities of Cas proteins to overcome immunity. Some viruses also produce RNA anti-CRISPRs, which resemble CRISPR guide RNAs in sequence but induce malfunction of CRISPR machinery. Hayes et al . identified one such system that acts as an RNA inhibitor of the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system. Analysis of the RNA in complex with Cas13 revealed that it bears little sequence similarity to guide RNAs but mimics their structure to inhibit Cas13. —Di Jiang To circumvent CRISPR-Cas immunity, phages express anti-CRISPR factors that inhibit the expression or activities of Cas proteins. Whereas most anti-CRISPRs described to date are proteins, recently described small RNAs called RNA anti-CRISPRs (rAcrs) have sequence homology to CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and displace them from cognate Cas nucleases. In this work, we report the discovery of rAcrVIA1—a plasmid-encoded small RNA that inhibits the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system in its natural host, Listeria seeligeri . We solved the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the Cas13-rAcr complex, which revealed that rAcrVIA1 adopts a fold nearly identical to crRNA despite sharing negligible sequence similarity. Collectively, our findings expand the diversity of rAcrs and reveal an example of immune antagonism through RNA structural mimicry.},

We report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We independently tuned the dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the molecular motion and studied their interplay on coherent spin dynamics. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed and modeled interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion.

However, amid rising political polarization ( 4 ), a fundamental question remains open: Is science used differently by policy-makers in different parties? Here we combine two large-scale databases capturing policy, science, and their interactions to examine the partisan differences in citing science in policy-making in the United States. Overall, we observe systematic differences in the amount, content, and character of science cited in policy by partisan factions in the United States. These differences are strikingly persistent across fields of research, policy issues, time, and institutional contexts.},

  abstract     = {Annual global production of silicone—a synthetic polymer with a long chain of silicon and oxygen atoms—exceeds 2.6 million metric tons ( 1 ). Its manufacturing is anchored in energy-intensive processes. More than 70% of silicone’s carbon footprint stems from elemental silicon production from raw minerals ( 2 ). Compounding this issue, postconsumer silicone waste often ends up in landfills or is incinerated ( 3 ). Because of the strong silicon-oxygen bond and many additives such as organic fillers and catalysts in its formulation, decomposition of silicone into smaller molecules is challenging. On page 392 of this issue, Vũ et al . ( 4 ) report a method that breaks down postconsumer and industrial silicone waste from a cross-linked network into chlorosilane, which is a key intermediate molecule in silicone production. This depolymerization chemistry could potentially be used in large-scale silicone manufacturing processes.},

This increase in VAT-selective deposits is linked to declines in insulin sensitivity and a heightened risk of metabolic diseases ( 3 ). Total energy expenditure in humans remains relatively stable from ages 20 to 60 years old ( 4 ). However, if caloric expenditure is roughly constant, it is unclear how VAT continues to grow with age. On page 378 of this issue, Wang et al . ( 5 ) report that a population of adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) emerges in middle-aged VAT that drives adipogenesis. This APC subpopulation exhibits a high potential for differentiation into adipocytes, which suggests that adipose tissue in middle age is biologically primed for spread.},

( 2 ) report that the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) is a central driver of the noninflamed TME in hepatocellular carcinoma tumors through its direct effect on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that express the EPO receptor. Consequently, these macrophages adopt an immunoregulatory phenotype, promoting the infiltration of immunosuppressive cell types such as regulatory T cells (T reg cells), while decreasing the intratumoral abundance of cytotoxic T cells. These findings elucidate factors contributing to a noninflamed TME and may inspire new therapeutic avenues to optimize antitumor immunity.},

Ghanim et al . used cryo–electron microscopy to capture LINE-1 at the moment of insertion, revealing how the retrotransposition machinery reshapes the target DNA to enable this process. Structural predictions also suggest that cellular factors play a critical role in the LINE-1 retrotransposition life cycle. —Di Jiang Long interspersed element–1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons are the only active autonomous transposable elements in humans. They propagate by reverse transcribing their messenger RNA into new genomic locations by a process called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). In this work, we present four cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human LINE-1 TPRT complex, revealing the conformational dynamics of open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p) and its extensive remodeling of the target DNA for TPRT initiation. We observe nicking of the DNA second strand during reverse transcription of the first strand. Structure prediction identifies high-confidence binding sites for LINE-1–associated factors—namely proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPC1)—on ORF2p. Together with our structural data, this suggests a mechanism by which these factors regulate retrotransposition and supports a model for TPRT that accounts for retrotransposition outcomes observed in cells.},

Zeng et al . discovered a base-modified nucleotide, deoxyinosine 5′-triphosphate (dITP), that acts as an antiviral immune signal in bacteria. Produced through a cascade involving a bacterial adenosine deaminase and phage-derived nucleotide kinases, dITP activates a downstream effector that kills infected bacteria, thus halting viral spread. Some phages carry enzymes that degrade deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP), the precursor of dITP, and thus evade this defense. These findings expand the range of nucleotide-based immune signals and highlight the ongoing bacteria-phage arms race for controlling nucleotide metabolism. —Di Jiang Signaling from pathogen sensing to effector activation is a fundamental principle of cellular immunity. Whereas cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we reveal a bacterial antiphage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine triphosphates (dITPs) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates a downstream effector to mediate depletion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular deoxyadenosine monophosphate, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification–based antiphage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.},

Taking advantage of maize’s low levels of linkage disequilibrium, Marand et al . examined single-cell chromatin accessibility from 172 inbred maize lines. They found about 22,000 variants associated with chromatin accessibility, many of which were specific to cell types and overlapped transposable elements. Many of these variants were linked to traits such as flowering time and affected binding sites for the transcription factor TCP. These results provide insight not only into important agricultural traits, but also regulatory element turnover during adaptation. —Corinne Simonti Gene expression and complex phenotypes are determined by the activity of cis-regulatory elements.

We present the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of the nucleolin-MycG4 complex, revealing a folded parallel three-tetrad G-quadruplex with two coordinating potassium ions (K + ), interacting with RBD1, RBD2, and Linker12 through its 6–nucleotide (nt) central loop and 5′ flanking region. RBD3 and RBD4 bind MycG4’s 1-nt loops as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Cleavage under targets and tagmentation sequencing confirmed nucleolin’s binding to MycG4 in cells.

Through careful sequencing, the authors found that although these populations were only separated by a valley, they showed limited gene flow and had quite different patterns of structural variation.

We found that color pattern in populations of stick insects on two mountains is associated with translocations that have also been inverted. These translocations differ in size and origin on each mountain, but they overlap partially and involve some of the same gene regions.

  abstract     = {The brain learns from experience through changes in synaptic weights. But how are specific synapses selected to undergo different forms of plasticity during learning? Wright et al . examined synaptic plasticity rules in different dendritic compartments of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse primary motor cortex (see the Perspective by Groisman and Letzkus). Strengthening of apical synapses depended on their correlated activity with their neighboring synapses and was independent of postsynaptic action potentials. By contrast, basal synapse strengthening was driven by activity coincidence with the postsynaptic action potentials, consistent with Hebbian mechanisms of plasticity. These different plasticity rules suggest functional specializations within individual neurons. Apical plasticity drives the formation of functional clusters of learning-related synapses for nonlinear integration, whereas basal plasticity favors the formation of Hebbian ensembles for reliable pattern completion. —Peter Stern Synaptic plasticity underlies learning by modifying specific synaptic inputs to reshape neural activity and behavior. However, the rules governing which synapses will undergo different forms of plasticity in vivo during learning and whether these rules are uniform within individual neurons remain unclear. Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without affecting apical plasticity. Thus, individual neurons use multiple activity-dependent plasticity rules in a compartment-specific manner in vivo during learning.},

Hou et al . analyzed data from more than 1000 regional studies to identify areas of metal toxicity and explore drivers of these trends. They estimate that 14 to 17% of cropland exceeds agricultural thresholds for at least one toxic metal. Climate and topography, along with mining activity and irrigation, predicted which soils would exceed metal thresholds. Soil metal pollution is a global issue that will likely increase with the growing demand for toxic metals in new technologies. —Bianca Lopez Toxic metal pollution is ubiquitous in soils, yet its worldwide distribution is unknown. We analyzed a global database of soil pollution by arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel, and lead at 796,084 sampling points from 1493 regional studies and used machine learning techniques to map areas with exceedance of agricultural and human health thresholds. We reveal a previously unrecognized high-risk, metal-enriched zone in low-latitude Eurasia, which is attributed to influential climatic, topographic, and anthropogenic conditions. This feature can be regarded as a signpost for the Anthropocene era. We show that 14 to 17% of cropland is affected by toxic metal pollution globally and estimate that between 0.9 and 1.4 billion people live in regions of heightened public health and ecological risks.},

  abstract     = {Lithium dendrite formation and porosity effects caused by high current density are known reasons for the failure of lithium metal batteries. However, there is an open question of why failure can occur at a current density much lower than the critical current density upon cycling. Wang et al . propose that mechanical fatigue of the lithium metal is the primary cause of cycle degradation (see the Perspective by Nanda and Kalnaus). Using in operando scanning electron microscopy, they showed that reversible plating and stripping of lithium generates cyclic stresses, even at low current densities, and these stresses lead to defects, microcracks, and microvoids that cause interface degradation. In conjunction with simulation, the authors showed that they could determine the cycle life of solid-state batteries as a function of current density. —Marc S. Lavine Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSBs) are promising for electric vehicles because of their potential to provide high energy density and enhanced safety. However, these batteries face short-circuit challenges caused by uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth during cycling. Using operando scanning electron microscopy and phase-field simulations, we determined that failure of SSBs is closely linked to the fatigue of the lithium metal anode, which markedly contributes to interface degradation and dendrite growth in SSBs. This fatigue follows the Coffin-Manson equation in mechanics, indicating that it is an innate characteristic. Clarifying the essential role of fatigue provides a physical basis for understanding failures of SSBs and paves the way to extending their lifespan.},

  abstract     = {Plants and their pathogens continually undergo a molecular arms race. Sanguankiattichai et al . found that the bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae inhibits a plant-secreted glycosidase that would otherwise initiate the release of flagellin fragments that are recognized by the plant to trigger its defenses (see the Perspective by Schroeder). The authors performed high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy and chemical synthesis studies to show that this glycosidase inhibitor, glycosyrin, is a distinct iminosugar that mimics galactose. Glycosyrin biosynthesis was induced by virulence regulators during the infection process and produced by a distinct iminosugar biosynthesis pathway. Glycosyrin also altered the glycosylation of plant proteins and the accumulation of extracellular metabolites. Many plant-associated bacteria can produce glycosyrin, which suggests that glycobiology manipulation may represent a common battleground during plant-pathogen interactions. —Stella M. Hurtley The extracellular space (apoplast) in plants is a key battleground during microbial infections. To avoid recognition, the bacterial model phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 produces glycosyrin. Glycosyrin inhibits the plant-secreted β-galactosidase BGAL1, which would otherwise initiate the release of immunogenic peptides from bacterial flagellin. Here, we report the structure, biosynthesis, and multifunctional roles of glycosyrin. High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy and chemical synthesis revealed that glycosyrin is an iminosugar with a five-membered pyrrolidine ring and a hydrated aldehyde that mimics monosaccharides. Glycosyrin biosynthesis was controlled by virulence regulators, and its production is common in bacteria and prevents flagellin recognition and alters the extracellular glycoproteome and metabolome of infected plants. These findings highlight a potentially wider role for glycobiology manipulation by plant pathogens across the plant kingdom.},

  abstract     = {The Curiosity rover is gradually climbing a mountain located in Gale crater on Mars. Higher levels of the stratigraphy expose rocks that formed at later times. Tutolo et al . studied the composition of drill samples taken from a sulfate-rich layer (see the Perspective by Bishop and Lane). They found that the rocks contained abundant iron carbonate, which was invisible in previous orbital observations. If there are similar abundances of carbonate in other sulfate-rich layers across Mars, then those layers may contain a substantial reservoir of carbon dioxide extracted from the atmosphere. The carbonates found by the authors have partially decomposed, returning some carbon dioxide to the atmosphere: an ancient carbon cycle. —Keith T. Smith Ancient Mars had surface liquid water and a dense carbon dioxide (CO 2 )–rich atmosphere. Such an atmosphere would interact with crustal rocks, potentially leaving a mineralogical record of its presence. We analyzed the composition of an 89-meter stratigraphic section of Gale crater, Mars, using data collected by the Curiosity rover. An iron carbonate mineral, siderite, occurs in abundances of 4.8 to 10.5 weight %, colocated with highly water-soluble salts. We infer that the siderite formed in water-limited conditions, driven by water-rock reactions and evaporation. Comparison with orbital data indicates that similar strata (deposited globally) sequestered the equivalent of 2.6 to 36 millibar of atmospheric CO 2 . The presence of iron oxyhydroxides in these deposits indicates that a partially closed carbon cycle on ancient Mars returned some previously sequestered CO 2 to the atmosphere.},

  abstract     = {Forging carbon-nitrogen bonds in just one of two mirror image orientations is essential to the preparation of numerous pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Many catalysts have been developed for this purpose, but they usually rely on specific binding sites on the substrate to dictate the reaction choreography. Zhang et al . report the theory-guided design of an enveloping cone-shaped ligand for copper-catalyzed carbon-nitrogen bond formation with alkyl iodides that lack well-differentiated binding sites. The reaction produces a wide range of chiral amines with high selectivity. —Jake S. Yeston Differentiating between similar alkyl groups is a major challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Achieving enantiocontrol over unactivated prochiral alkyl radicals is even more difficult owing to their high reactivity and limited interactions with chiral catalysts. In this study, we report a copper-catalyzed asymmetric amination of unactivated prochiral secondary alkyl radicals, using specifically designed chiral anionic multidentate ligands in a radical substitution reaction. This approach efficiently produces highly enantioenriched α-chiral alkyl amines and facilitates the enantioselective formal synthesis of a series of important drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that bulky peripheral modifications on the ligands help create a truncated cone-shaped chiral pocket, enabling precise enantiodiscrimination through steric hindrance and noncovalent interactions. This strategy holds broad potential for asymmetric transformations involving diverse unactivated prochiral alkyl radicals and nucleophiles.},

We used an optical technique to probe the electrical transport of correlated electron-hole bilayers based on MoSe 2 /hBN/WSe 2 heterostructures. We observed perfect Coulomb drag in the excitonic insulator phase at low temperatures; the counterflow resistance of interlayer excitons remained finite. These results indicate the formation of an exciton gas that does not condense into a superfluid.

This problem even occurs when the battery operates at small currents. The underlying mechanism of this failure is not well understood. On page 311 of this issue, Wang et al . ( 1 ) report that structural defects accumulate in the lithium metal anode under repeated charging and discharging at a small current. This is similar to mechanical fatigue that is observed over longer periods of intermittent straining of a material. The observation could guide the design of lithium batteries with increased life span.},

These elaborate, treelike processes receive the lion’s share of a neuron’s synaptic inputs. Electrical dendritic recordings ( 1 ) combined with computer modeling ( 2 ) have uncovered a wealth of mechanisms whereby dendrites can shape information processing and storage. Despite thus gaining deep insights into their computational capacities, much less is known about how dendritic mechanisms enable the brain to instruct meaningful behavior. On page 322 of this issue, Wright et al .

For this purpose, plants and animals have evolved dedicated receptors to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that trigger a host of defense responses ( 1 ). These ancient and conserved surveillance systems detect equally conserved PAMPs, which have diverse chemical structures, including bacterial flagellin and lipopolysaccharides. The ability of plants and animals to recognize such microbial signatures has driven the evolution of sophisticated countermeasures by pathogens to evade detection. On page 297 of this issue, Sanguankiattichai et al. ( 2 ) report that pathogenic bacteria undermine plant perception of flagellin by producing an iminosugar, called glycosyrin, that inhibits a plant glycosidase required for flagellin detection and thereby suppresses plant immune responses. The finding has broad implications for the role of glycobiology in plant-microbe interactions and also drug discovery.},

The ubiquitin kinase PINK1 plays a key role in this process by detecting depolarized mitochondria and starting a signaling pathway that marks these organelles for autophagy. Callegari et al . determined the structure of PINK1 in complex with the translocase of the outer membrane complex, which imports proteins, including PINK1, into the mitochondria, and a pair of voltage-dependent anion channels. This structure revealed how stalling of PINK1 during import and oxidation of surface cysteine residues establishes a dimeric preactive complex that is prepared to initiate downstream signaling. —Michael A. Funk Mutations in the ubiquitin kinase PINK1 cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease, but how PINK1 is stabilized at depolarized mitochondrial translocase complexes has remained poorly understood. We determined a 3.1-angstrom resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of dimeric human PINK1 stabilized at an endogenous array of mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complexes. Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22. Our structure explains how human PINK1 is stabilized at the TOM complex and regulated by oxidation, uncovers a previously unknown TOM-VDAC assembly, and reveals how a physiological substrate traverses TOM40 during translocation.},

  abstract     = {Despite major advances in computational protein design over the past decade, building de novo enzymes has turned out to be much more difficult. Active-site residues must be precisely positioned and must participate in dynamics that enable the necessary bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions, often over multiple distinct steps. Lauko et al . now show that screening designs for active-site preorganization across the full reaction coordinate can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency of de novo–designed enzymes. The authors demonstrate the power of this approach by creating a functional serine hydrolase, a particularly difficult enzyme because of the multistep reaction coordinate and potential for trapping the enzyme in a covalent intermediate. —Michael A. Funk The design of enzymes with complex active sites that mediate multistep reactions remains an outstanding challenge. With serine hydrolases as a model system, we combined the generative capabilities of RFdiffusion with an ensemble generation method for assessing active site preorganization at each step in the reaction to design enzymes starting from minimal active site descriptions. Experimental characterization revealed catalytic efficiencies ( k cat / K m ) up to 2.2 × 10 5 M −1 s −1 and crystal structures that closely match the design models (Cα root mean square deviations <1 angstrom). Selection for structural compatibility across the reaction coordinate enabled identification of new catalysts remove with five different folds distinct from those of natural serine hydrolases. Our de novo approach provides insight into the geometric basis of catalysis and a roadmap for designing enzymes that catalyze multistep transformations.},

Recent advances in multiomic imaging have been constrained by the lack of availability of labeling dyes with distinct spectra and by other technical limitations. To address some of these challenges, Gandin et al . developed a method based on split hybridization chain reaction techniques using paired probes that must both recognize their targets to produce a positive signal. This approach allowed for the accurate detection of both rare and high-abundance targets. It can even work in thick tissue samples, which are difficult to study but helpful for examining cells in their biological context. The authors applied their method to uncover specific structures and gene expression patterns in mouse hippocampal slices and intact embryos. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Limited color channels in fluorescence microscopy have long constrained spatial analysis in biological specimens. We introduce cycle hybridization chain reaction (cycleHCR), a method that integrates multicycle DNA barcoding with HCR to overcome this limitation. cycleHCR enables highly multiplexed imaging of RNA and proteins using a unified barcode system. Whole-embryo transcriptomics imaging achieved precise three-dimensional gene expression and cell fate mapping across a specimen depth of ~310 μm. When combined with expansion microscopy, cycleHCR revealed an intricate network of 10 subcellular structures in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In mouse hippocampal slices, multiplex RNA and protein imaging uncovered complex gene expression gradients and cell-type–specific nuclear structural variations. cycleHCR provides a quantitative framework for elucidating spatial regulation in deep tissue contexts for research and has potential diagnostic applications.},

Understanding how these cells are specified, differentiated, and maintained is of critical importance because they are highly susceptible to irreversible damage, leading to hearing loss. Sun et al . found that the poorly characterized transcription factor Casz1 is required at early developmental stages for inner hair cell identity and for outer hair cell survival in mice. Another transcription factor, Gata3, acts as a key downstream effector of Casz1 function. These findings reveal a genetic pathway that could potentially be targeted in the development of hearing restoration therapies. —Stella M. Hurtley Cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) require different transcription factors for their cell fate stabilization and survival, which suggests that separate mechanisms are involved. In this study, we found that the transcription factor Casz1 is crucial for early IHC fate consolidation and for OHC survival during mouse development. Loss of Casz1 resulted in transdifferentiation of IHCs into OHCs, without affecting OHC production. However, long-term OHC survival was compromised in Casz1 mutant mice. In addition, the transcription factor Gata3 was down-regulated in Casz1 -deleted IHCs, and overexpressing Gata3 partially rescued IHC properties, OHC numbers, and hearing in Casz1 -deleted mice. Thus, Casz1 plays critical roles in early IHC fate stabilization and OHC survival and could potentially provide a lead for therapies aimed at regenerating both IHCs and OHCs.},

  abstract     = {Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes, which include cohesin and condensin, play crucial roles in chromatin organization during the interphase and mitosis steps of the cell cycle. Samejima et al . investigated how these complexes interact and guide mitotic chromosome formation. Using chromatin structure analysis, imaging, proteomics, and polymer modeling, the investigators explored the “rules of engagement” for SMC complexes as cells transitioned from interphase to mitosis. They found that condensin disassembles interphase chromatin structures by evicting or displacing cohesin while bypassing cohesive cohesin to maintain sister chromatid cohesion. This study also examined the dynamics of loop extrusion by condensins in vivo and the impact of cohesin depletion on mitotic chromosome organization. —Di Jiang We used Hi-C, imaging, proteomics, and polymer modeling to define rules of engagement for SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes as cells refold interphase chromatin into rod-shaped mitotic chromosomes. First, condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. Second, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion as sisters separate. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II, and condensin I alone or in combination lead to refined models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase, loops are extruded in vivo at ∼1 to 3 kilobases per second by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids.},

  abstract     = {The obstetrical dilemma stems from a conflict between the optimal pelvic structure for bipedalism and what is required for successfully birthing infants with larger brains than previous hominins. However, the data required to test this theory have not been available. Xu et al . used the UK Biobank to disentangle the genetic basis of pelvic morphology. They found 180 genome sites associated with seven pelvic proportion phenotypes, as well as genetic correlations between pelvic proportions and traits such as osteoarthritis, walking speed, and back pain, giving insight into facets of the obstetrical dilemma. —Corinne Simonti Human pelvic evolution following the human-chimpanzee divergence is thought to result in an obstetrical dilemma, a mismatch between large infant brains and narrowed female birth canals, but empirical evidence has been equivocal. By using deep learning on 31,115 dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans from UK Biobank, we identified 180 loci associated with seven highly heritable pelvic phenotypes. Birth canal phenotypes showed sex-specific genetic architecture, aligning with reproductive function. Larger birth canals were linked to slower walking pace and reduced back pain but increased hip osteoarthritis risk, whereas narrower birth canals were associated with reduced pelvic floor disorder risk but increased obstructed labor risk. Lastly, genetic correlation between birth canal and head widths provides evidence of coevolution between the human pelvis and brain, partially mitigating the dilemma.},

  abstract     = {Priming and activation of antigen-specific T cells takes place within lymph nodes and requires multiple signals that stimulate proliferation and differentiation. Jobin et al . examined the dynamics between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) after the first phase of T cell priming was completed. As CD8 T cells underwent a second phase of stable interactions with DCs, helper CD4 T cells halted briefly before moving on to another DC, whereas regulatory T cells did not stop. This cellular choreography could facilitate CD8 T cells with high affinity for antigen to receive interleukin-2 signals from helper CD4 T cells to promote their differentiation into effector cells. —Sarah H. Ross T cell priming is characterized by an initial activation phase that involves stable interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). How activated T cells receive the paracrine signals required for their differentiation once they have disengaged from DCs and resumed their migration has been unclear. We identified a distinct priming phase that favors CD8 T cells expressing receptors with high affinity for antigen. CXCR3 expression by CD8 T cells was required for their hours-long reengagement with DCs in specific subfollicular niches in lymph nodes. CD4 T cells paused briefly at the sites of CD8 T cell and DC interactions and provided Interleukin-2 (IL-2) before moving to another DC. Our results highlight a previously unappreciated phase of cell-cell interactions during T cell priming and have direct implications for vaccinations and cellular immunotherapies.},

  abstract     = {Cachexia, or wasting syndrome, arises during advanced stages of many chronic diseases, including cancer, and is often associated with loss of motivation and apathy. It is known that inflammation is a critical factor in cancer cachexia. However, the link between tumor-induced inflammation and the underlying brain mechanisms that produce motivational deficits remains elusive. Using a well-established mouse model of cancer cachexia, Zhu et al . uncovered a brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit that suppresses dopamine signaling (see the Perspective by Dalley and Lynall). Neurons in the area postrema sense the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and relay this signal to the parabrachial nucleus. The parabrachial nucleus drives inhibitory neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, which then suppress dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. This sequence reduces dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, ultimately increasing effort sensitivity and lowering motivation. —Peter Stern Cachexia, a severe wasting syndrome associated with inflammatory conditions, often leads to multiorgan failure and death. Patients with cachexia experience extreme fatigue, apathy, and clinical depression, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these behavioral symptoms and their relationship to the disease remain unclear. In a mouse cancer model, cachexia specifically induced increased effort-sensitivity, apathy-like symptoms through a cytokine-sensing brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit. This neural circuit detects elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at cachexia onset and translates inflammatory signals into decreased mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity. We alleviated these apathy-like symptoms by targeting key circuit nodes: administering an anti–IL-6 antibody treatment, ablating cytokine sensing in the brainstem, and optogenetically or pharmacologically boosting mesolimbic dopamine. Our findings uncovered a central neural circuit that senses systemic inflammation and orchestrates behavioral changes, providing mechanistic insights into the connection between chronic inflammation and depressive symptoms.},

  abstract     = {The drugs that humans excrete into wastewater are increasingly making their way into natural waterways. Depending on the original intent of these compounds, they can influence wild species in many ways, from basic health to behavior. Aquatic vertebrates such as fishes may be especially susceptible because their brains share many pathways of action with mammals. Using laboratory and field experiments, Brand et al . found that a common aquatic pollutant, the psychoactive benzodiazepine drug clobazam, is present in the brains of Atlantic salmon and influences their migration behavior, likely through reduced tendency to shoal. —Sacha Vignieri Despite the growing threat of pharmaceutical pollution, we lack an understanding of whether and how such pollutants influence animal behavior in the wild. Using laboratory- and field-based experiments across multiple years in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ; n = 730), we show that the globally detected anxiolytic pollutant clobazam accumulates in the brain of exposed fish and influences river-to-sea migration success. Clobazam exposure increased the speed with which fish passed through two hydropower dams along their migration route, resulting in more clobazam-exposed fish reaching the sea compared with controls. We argue that such effects may arise from altered shoaling behavior in fish exposed to clobazam. Drug-induced behavioral changes are expected to have wide-ranging consequences for the ecology and evolution of wild populations.},

Liu et al . developed a nanocomposite of lead zirconium titanate and magnesium oxide in which the morphology of the two phases helps to increase the electrical breakdown strength of the material. The magnesium oxide–insulating phase has a dendritic morphology that inhibits the growth of the electrical trees responsible for material failure under high electric fields. The resulting composite has a high energy density, and this fabrication strategy may be useful for developing better capacitors. —Marc S. Lavine Electrostatic dielectric capacitors with ultrahigh power densities are sought after for advanced electronic and electrical systems owing to their ultrafast charge-discharge capability. However, low energy density resulting from low breakdown strength and suppressed polarization still remains a daunting challenge for practical applications. We propose a microstructural strategy with dendritic nanopolar (DNP) regions self-assembled into an insulator, which simultaneously enhances breakdown strength and high-field polarizability and minimizes energy loss and thus markedly improves energy storage performance and stability. For illustration, in this study, we achieved a high energy density of 215.8 joules per cubic centimeter with an efficiency of 80.7% at a high electric field of 7.4 megavolts per centimeter in a DNP structure–designed PbZr 0.53 Ti 0.47 O 3 -MgO film.

However, the incomplete penetrance of GBA1 mutations suggests that there could be genetic modifiers influencing disease risk. Minakaki et al . performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference screening and identified candidate genes that modulated GCase activity. One of the components of the Commander complex, COMMD3, was essential for lysosomal GCase activity, and variants were associated with increased PD risk, suggesting that regulation of this complex might play a role in determining GBA1-mediated PD risk. —Mattia Maroso Variants in GBA1 resulting in decreased lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity are a common risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Incomplete penetrance of GBA1 variants suggests that additional genes contribute to PD and DLB manifestation. By using a pooled genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified copper metabolism MURR1 domain–containing 3 (COMMD3) protein, a component of the COMMD/coiled-coil domain–containing protein 22 (CCDC22)/CCDC93 (CCC) and Commander complexes, as a modifier of GCase and lysosomal activity. Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction. Rare variants in the Commander gene family were associated with increased PD risk. Thus, COMMD genes and related complexes regulate lysosomal homeostasis and may represent modifiers in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction.},

Zhao et al . identified an immune protein, MYC2, which is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase PUB21. Citrus species and their relatives vary in resistance to Huanglongbing depending on the allele of PUB21 and on variations in MYC2-binding sites in the PUB21 promoter. The authors elucidated how a regulatory circuit between PUB21 expression and MYC2 stability confers Huanglongbing resistance. Using an artificial intelligence screening tool, the authors identified microbial peptides that could inhibit proteolysis. They narrowed down the selection to a single small peptide that stabilized MYC2 and reduced disease symptoms when applied to citrus trees. The work offers a mechanistically derived approach to fighting a devastating plant disease (see the Perspective by Opachaloemphan and He). —Madeleine Seale Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating citrus disease. In this work, we report an HLB resistance regulatory circuit in Citrus composed of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, PUB21, and its substrate, the MYC2 transcription factor, which regulates jasmonate-mediated defense responses. A helitron insertion in the PUB21 promoter introduced multiple MYC2-binding cis-elements to create a regulatory circuit linking the PUB21 activity with MYC2 degradation. Ectopic expression of a natural dominant-negative PUB21 paralog discovered in distant Citrus relatives stabilized MYC2 and conferred resistance to HLB. Antiproteolysis peptides (APPs), identified by artificial intelligence, stabilized MYC2 by binding and inhibiting PUB21 activity. A 14–amino acid peptide, APP3-14, molecularly controlled HLB in greenhouse and field trials.

  abstract     = {In bacteria’s circular chromosomes, replication begins bidirectionally from one location (oriC) and ends at another (ter). Genes are still expressed during replication, so those near oriC are more likely to have multiple copies present and are more highly expressed during growth. Hu et al . analyzed chromosome positions for all genes across 910 bacterial species. Consistent with previous studies, they found that many transcription and translation genes were biased toward oriC. However, 65.8% of gene families showed bias toward particular positions, and these biases were stronger with higher growth rates. This work demonstrates that many more genes are positionally constrained in bacteria than was previously thought, possibly providing insight into the function of uncharacterized genes. —Corinne Simonti The arrangement of genes along bacterial chromosomes influences their expression through growth rate–dependent gene copy number changes during DNA replication. Although translation- and transcription-related genes often cluster near the origin of replication, the extent of positional biases across gene families remains unclear. We hypothesized that natural selection broadly favors specific chromosomal positions to optimize growth rate–dependent expression. Analyzing 910 bacterial species and proteomics data from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis , we found that about two-thirds of bacterial gene families are positionally biased. Natural selection drives genes mainly toward the origin or terminus of replication, with the strongest selection in fast-growing species. Our findings reveal chromosomal positioning as a fundamental mechanism for coordinating gene expression with growth rate, highlighting evolutionary constraints on bacterial genome architecture.},

  abstract     = {The neutrino, a weakly interacting, uncharged elementary particle, has been shown to have a nonzero mass, the exact value of which remains unknown. This is not what the usually very reliable Standard Model of particle physics predicts, which means that measuring the neutrino mass may offer hints of physics that this model cannot account for. The KATRIN Collaboration used the beta-decay of molecular tritium to directly measure the mass of the antiparticle of a particular flavor of the neutrino (see the Perspective by Gastaldo). By combining data from the first five runs of the experiment, the researchers reduced the upper limit on the neutrino mass by a factor of two compared with their previous result. —Jelena Stajic That neutrinos carry a nonvanishing rest mass is evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. Their absolute mass holds relevance in fields from particle physics to cosmology. We report on the search for the effective electron antineutrino mass with the KATRIN experiment. KATRIN performs precision spectroscopy of the tritium β-decay close to the kinematic endpoint. On the basis of the first five measurement campaigns, we derived a best-fit value of m ν 2 = − 0.14 − 0.15 + 0.13 eV 2 , resulting in an upper limit of m ν < 0.45 eV at 90% confidence level. Stemming from 36 million electrons collected in 259 measurement days, a substantial reduction of the background level, and improved systematic uncertainties, this result tightens KATRIN’s previous bound by a factor of almost two.},

This identification confirms previous genomic predictions of the group’s widespread occurrence, including in warmer climates. The robust nature of this mandible is similar to that seen in a Denisovan one from Tibet, suggesting that this is a consistent trait for the lineage. —Sacha Vignieri Denisovans are an extinct hominin group defined by ancient genomes of Middle to Late Pleistocene fossils from southern Siberia.

We retrieved 4241 amino acid residues and identified two Denisovan-specific variants.

  abstract     = {Whereas thermopolymers can be remelted and reused, thermoset polymers typically need to be broken back down into monomers for efficient recycling, which is possible only if the polymers are designed with this property in mind. Yang et al . explored the potential of lignin-derivable building blocks for making circular resins for three-dimensional (3D) printing (see the Perspective by Lopez de Pariza and Sardon). During printing, the photopolymerization forms dithioacetal bonds. When trying to reuse the material, rather than breaking it down into monomers, the authors reverted the polymers only partially back to photoreactive oligomers using catalytic thermal dissociation of the dithioacetal bonds. This allowed for circular use without loss of properties in each print cycle. —Marc S. Lavine One approach for closed-loop plastics recycling relies on reverting polymers back into monomers because one can then make new plastics without loss of properties. This depolymerization requirement restricts the molecular design to making polymers with high mechanical performance. We report a three-dimensional (3D) printing chemistry through stepwise photopolymerization by forming dithioacetal bonds. The polymerized network can be transformed back into a photoreactive oligomer by dissociation of the dithioacetal bonds. This network-oligomer transformation is reversible, therefore allowing circular 3D printing using the same material. Our approach offers the flexibility of making modular adjustments in the design of the network backbone of a polymer. This allows access to fully recyclable elastomers, crystalline polymers, and rigid glassy polymers with high mechanical toughness, making them potentially suitable for diverse applications.},

The investigating psychiatrist reported losing sleep for weeks just from reviewing disturbing material to which digital platforms had exposed Molly. Yet scientists are debating whether and how such technologies pose harm to individuals and society. From social media to artificial intelligence (AI), the accelerating development and deployment of new digital technologies have outpaced the capacity of science—constrained by limited resourcing and restrictions on proprietary data—to effectively assess their impacts. We must urgently fix this science-policy ecosystem to support timely, measured assessments of sociotechnical risks that can lead to real change. We must transform how science and policy is organized, better manage the risk of being wrong, and develop policies that synchronize science and innovation.},

However, it is unknown how cancerous growths in the periphery affect the brain regions involved in these emotional states. On page 169 of this issue, Zhu et al . ( 3 ) describe a neural circuit underlying cachexia-related apathy in a mouse model of cancer. The pathway originates in the brain stem, which senses a proinflammatory cytokine [interleukin-6 (IL-6)], and leads to decreased dopamine release in the striatum, a brain region associated with motivation. Notably, interfering with this circuitry ameliorated deficits in motivation associated with cachexia.},

King et al . contrasted the performance of their quantum annealing processor to state-of-the-art classical simulations of topical problems such as the quantum dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model. The researchers found that across a range of graph topologies, the quantum processor was able to outperform classical simulations. The results provide a challenge to classical computing, in which method improvement has in the past tempered claims of quantum advantage. —Jelena Stajic Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.},

Cook et al . obtained cryo–electron microscopy structures of the complex that show the important role of myristate modification of the VPS15 pseudokinase subunit, which also apparently binds guanosine triphosphate rather than adenosine triphosphate. Activation of autophagy might be effective therapeutically to alleviate neurodegenerative and other diseases. The structural details offer potential targets for small-molecule drugs. —L. Bryan Ray The class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complexes I and II (PI3KC3-C1 and PI3KC3-C2) have vital roles in macroautophagy and endosomal maturation, respectively. We elucidated a structural pathway of enzyme activation through cryo–electron microscopy analysis of PI3KC3-C1. The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering its N -myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and promote activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease are increasing in prevalence, and in-depth mechanistic insights and improved therapeutic approaches continue to be needed. Previous studies have identified evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in these disorders. By examining multiple mouse models and human pancreatic islet beta cells, Walker et al . identified a mechanism whereby abnormalities in mitochondrial quality control pathways can promote dedifferentiation and cellular immaturity in beta cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes, leading to detrimental changes across multiple metabolic tissues. The authors also identified a potential pharmacologic intervention for reversing the observed abnormalities. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Mitochondrial damage is a hallmark of metabolic diseases, including diabetes, yet the consequences of compromised mitochondria in metabolic tissues are often unclear. In this work, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β cell identity after the loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders.},

A corrected analysis, using Poisson regression, gives the same results, demonstrating that the detected subsequences show a strong relation between frequency and length, as predicted by Zipf’s law of brevity. The error in the code only affected the analysis of Zipf’s law of brevity and not the main analyses of Zipf’s law of frequency, for which the R2 analysis was appropriately applied. The authors have replaced the Zipf’s law of brevity R2 analysis with a Poisson mixed-effects regression, the state-of-the-art method recommended by Youngblood [Proc. Biol. Sci. 291, 20240250 (2024)]. This shows that the brevity law does indeed hold with P < 0.00001 for all the authors’ segmentation methods. Figure 3 and figs. S11 and S12 have been amended to reflect this, and section 6.2 of the code S1 supplementary file has been updated to include the new analysis.

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative condition of the joints that is usually attributed to “wear and tear” and is managed by treating the symptoms. By performing metabolomic studies in hundreds of patients from independent clinical cohorts, Yang et al . identified specific differences in bile acids between people who did or did not have osteoarthritis (see the Perspective by Liu), identified the underlying signaling mechanism, and also linked the differences in bile acids to specific species among the intestinal microbiota. Using a mouse model of osteoarthritis, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of repurposing a clinically approved drug that targets bile acid metabolism. Moreover, human patients using this drug for other reasons had a lower risk of requiring a knee replacement for osteoarthritis, providing further support for potential clinical translation. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Whether a gut-joint axis exists to regulate osteoarthritis is unknown. In two independent cohorts, we identified altered microbial bile acid metabolism with reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in osteoarthritis. Suppressing farnesoid X receptor (FXR)—the receptor of GUDCA—alleviated osteoarthritis through intestine-secreted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in mice. GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance of Clostridium bolteae , which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment with C. bolteae and Food and Drug Administration–approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR–joint GLP-1 axis in mice. UDCA use was associated with lower risk of osteoarthritis-related joint replacement in humans. These findings suggest that orchestrating the gut microbiota–GUDCA–intestinal FXR–GLP-1–joint pathway offers a potential strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.},

  abstract     = {There are two broad classes of chemical catalysis, one in which the catalyst dissolves with the reagents in homogeneous solution and another in which it persists in a separate heterogeneous solid phase. Harraz et al . reported the surprising finding that catalytic palladium (Pd) appears to operate in both regimes in the commercial synthesis of vinyl acetate (see the Perspective by Tway and Filip). The mechanism of this process, which couples ethylene with acetic acid using oxygen, has remained uncertain despite more than 50 years of vigorous study. Through multiple electrochemical experiments, the authors found evidence that heterogeneous Pd reduces oxygen to release Pd(II) into solution for the coupling step and redeposition. —Jake S. Yeston Presently, mechanistic paradigms in catalysis generally posit that the active species remains either homogeneous or heterogeneous throughout the reaction. In this work, we show that a prominent industrial process, palladium (Pd)–catalyzed vinyl acetate synthesis, proceeds via interconversion of heterogeneous Pd(0) and homogeneous Pd(II) during catalysis, with each species playing a complementary role. Using electrochemical probes, we found that heterogeneous, nanoparticulate Pd(0) serves as an active oxygen reduction electrocatalyst to furnish the high potential required for corrosion to form homogeneous Pd(II), which then catalyzes selective ethylene acetoxylation with reformation of heterogeneous Pd(0). Inhibiting the corrosion of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by galvanic protection results in reversible poisoning of catalysis, evincing the essential role of phase conversion in this catalytic cycle. These results highlight how dynamic phase interconversion can harness and couple complementary reactivity across molecular and material active sites.},

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and vacuolar ATPase were identified as mediators of mRNA uptake and endosomal escape, respectively. The E3 ubiquitin/ISG15 ligase TRIM25 specifically targets RNAs entering cells through endocytosis, with its RNA-binding affinity enhanced in acidic environments, suggesting proton-sensing activation. N 1 -methylpseudouridine modifications in mRNA reduce interactions with TRIM25, mitigating the suppression of mRNA. These findings uncover a pH-dependent foreign RNA surveillance mechanism and offer insights for improving mRNA therapeutics design. —Di Jiang Exogenous messenger RNAs (mRNAs) require cellular machinery for delivery and translation but also encounter inhibitory factors. To investigate their regulation, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens with in vitro–transcribed mRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) were identified as mediators of LNP uptake and endosomal escape, respectively. TRIM25—an RNA binding E3 ubiquitin ligase—emerged as a key suppressor inducing turnover of both linear and circular mRNAs. The endoribonucleases N4BP1 and KHNYN, along with the antiviral protein ZAP, act redundantly in TRIM25-dependent surveillance. TRIM25 specifically targets mRNAs delivered by endosomes, and its RNA affinity increases at acidic pH, suggesting activation by protons released from ruptured endosomes. N 1 -methylpseudouridine modification reduces TRIM25’s RNA binding, helping RNAs evade its suppressive effect. This study comprehensively maps cellular pathways regulating LNP-mRNAs, offering insights into RNA immunity and therapeutics.},

Heiles et al . developed a method to allow the generation of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images of gene expression and 2D ultrasound images of capillary vessels. The fundamental idea behind this method, which is called nonlinear sound-sheet microscopy, is simple. Biomolecules expressed in cells or microbubbles circulating in blood vessels are excited along thin ultrasound sheets that are swept across the sample. This method enables fast, deep, and volumetric imaging of living opaque organs labeled with echogenic reporters. Ultrasound sectioning, the ability to resolve structures in the z plane, was achieved by modulating acoustic pressure along nondiffractive beams to confine nonlinear echoes of biomolecules or microbubbles to a plane. —Stella M. Hurtley Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has revolutionized biology by visualizing dynamic cellular processes in three dimensions. However, light scattering in thick tissue and photobleaching of fluorescent reporters limit this method to studying thin or translucent specimens. In this study, we applied nondiffractive ultrasound beams in conjunction with a cross-amplitude modulation sequence and nonlinear acoustic reporters to enable fast and volumetric imaging of targeted biological functions. We reported volumetric imaging of tumor gene expression at the cubic centimeter scale using genetically encoded gas vesicles and localization microscopy of cerebral capillary networks using intravascular microbubble contrast agents. Nonlinear sound-sheet microscopy provides a ~64× acceleration in imaging speed, ~35× increase in imaged volume, and ~4× increase in classical imaging resolution compared with the state of the art in biomolecular ultrasound.},

It has, however, been proposed that subcortico-cortical loops play a prominent role in conscious perception. Using simultaneous intracranial recordings from human thalamus and prefrontal cortex, Fang et al . investigated the neurophysiological correlates of conscious detection and report. Analysis of the oscillatory dynamics of the neural signals suggested that the direction of information flow for neural correlates of consciousness was from the medial and intralaminar thalamus to the prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei gate conscious perception. This conclusion is a significant advance in our understanding of the network basis of visual awareness in humans. —Peter Stern Human high-order thalamic nuclei activity is known to closely correlate with conscious states. However, it is not clear how those thalamic nuclei and thalamocortical interactions directly contribute to the transient process of human conscious perception. We simultaneously recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the thalamic nuclei and prefrontal cortex (PFC), while patients with implanted electrodes performed a visual consciousness task. Compared with the ventral nuclei and PFC, the intralaminar and medial nuclei presented earlier and stronger consciousness-related activity. Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the θ phase of the intralaminar and medial nuclei during conscious perception. The intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei thus play a gate role to drive the activity of the PFC during the emergence of conscious perception.},

Ideally, trends would be assessed using population time series spanning many taxa and locations, with variation in the strength of drivers such as temperature, land use change, and pesticide use. However, these criteria are not often met, making it difficult to parse drivers and find overall patterns. Cooke et al . reviewed the factors that complicate insect trend detection and the data sources available to do so. The authors propose a model for integrating data sources to predict relationships and the effects of policies aiming to mitigate insect decline rather than waiting for more time series to accumulate. —Bianca Lopez Insects dominate animal species diversity yet face many threats from anthropogenic drivers of change. Many features of insect ecology make them a challenging group, and the fragmented state of knowledge compromises our ability to make general statements about their status. In this Review, we discuss the challenges of assessing insect biodiversity change. We describe how multiple lines of evidence—time series, spatial comparisons, experiments, and expert opinion—can be integrated to provide a synthesis overview of how insect biodiversity responds to drivers. Applying this approach will generate testable predictions of insect biodiversity across space, time, and changing drivers. Given the urgency of accelerating human impacts across the environment, this approach could yield a much-needed rapid assessment of insect biodiversity change.},

One calibration point is provided by the impact event about 4.5 billion years ago that resulted in sterilization of Earth and formation of the Moon. Davín et al . used molecular clocks, machine learning, and phylogenetic reconciliation to present a reconstruction of the evolution of Earth’s bacterial biosphere over the past 4 billion years with particular emphasis on aerobic metabolisms. Their analysis showed that the last common ancestor of bacteria likely existed 4.4 to 3.9 billion years ago, and aerobic organisms likely emerged before the Great Oxidation Event (2.43 to 2.33 billion years ago). Oxygen tolerance may have been a prerequisite for, rather than a consequence of, the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. —Caroline Ash Microbial life has dominated Earth’s history but left a sparse fossil record, greatly hindering our understanding of evolution in deep time. However, bacterial metabolism has left signatures in the geochemical record, most conspicuously the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). We combine machine learning and phylogenetic reconciliation to infer ancestral bacterial transitions to aerobic lifestyles, linking them to the GOE to calibrate the bacterial time tree. Extant bacterial phyla trace their diversity to the Archaean and Proterozoic, and bacterial families prior to the Phanerozoic. We infer that most bacterial phyla were ancestrally anaerobic and adopted aerobic lifestyles after the GOE. However, in the cyanobacterial ancestor, aerobic metabolism likely predated the GOE, which may have facilitated the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

Rados et al . explored the mechanobiology of haloarchea, demonstrating that many archaea species can also form multicellular tissue–like structures when compressive forces are applied (see the Perspective by Pillai and Brunet). The cells undergo a phase of enlargement without division before reaching a critical size. At this point, changes in membrane tension appear to trigger cellularization. These results establish multicellularity as a feature of all three domains of life and highlight the role of mechanical forces in shaping archaeal tissues. —Madeleine Seale The advent of clonal multicellularity is a critical evolutionary milestone, seen often in eukaryotes, rarely in bacteria, and only once in archaea. We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types—peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells—with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns. Our findings highlight the potential convergent evolution of a biophysical mechanism in the emergence of multicellular systems across domains of life.},

  abstract     = {One hallmark of human language is the combination of elements into larger meaningful structures, a pattern referred to as compositionality. Compositionality can be trivial, in which the two parts are added together to give meaning, or nontrivial, in which the meaning in one part modifies the meaning in the other. Recent research has found the presence of trivial compositionality across a number of species, but it has been argued that nontrivial compositionality is unique to humans. Berthet et al . used a large dataset of bonobo vocalizations in conjunction with a distributional semantics approach and found that not only did they display compositionality, but three of the four types were nontrivial. —Sacha Vignieri Compositionality, the capacity to combine meaningful elements into larger meaningful structures, is a hallmark of human language. Compositionality can be trivial (the combination’s meaning is the sum of the meaning of its parts) or nontrivial (one element modifies the meaning of the other element). Recent studies have suggested that animals lack nontrivial compositionality, representing a key discontinuity with language. In this work, using methods borrowed from distributional semantics, we investigated compositionality in wild bonobos and found that not only does each call type of their repertoire occur in at least one compositional combination, but three of these compositional combinations also exhibit nontrivial compositionality. These findings suggest that compositionality is a prominent feature of the bonobo vocal system, revealing stronger parallels with human language than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Regulatory T (T reg ) cells play a well-defined role in restraining inflammatory immune responses. Midavaine et al . found that depleting T reg cells specifically localized to the meninges of the central nervous system (mT reg cells) increased the responses of female, but not male, mice to mechanical pain stimuli. These mT reg cells were a source of enkephalin, an endogenous opioid peptide, within the cerebrospinal fluid. In the context of nerve injury, the enkephalin associated with mT reg cells could decrease pain sensing by activating the δ-opioid receptor expressed by a subset of nociceptive neurons involved in mechanical pain sensing. Injecting the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) into the spinal fluid increased mT reg cell numbers and decreased mechanical pain sensing in female mice after nerve injury. The analgesic effect of IL-2 in female mice could be prevented by blocking female sex hormones. —Sarah H. Ross T cells have emerged as orchestrators of pain amplification, but the mechanism by which T cells control pain processing is unresolved. We found that regulatory T cells (T reg cells) could inhibit nociception through a mechanism that was not dependent on their ability to regulate immune activation and tissue repair. Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal T reg cells (mT reg cells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mT reg cells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD + sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for T reg cell–mediated immunosuppression. Thus, our findings uncovered a sexually dimorphic immunological circuit that restrains nociception, establishing T reg cells as sentinels of pain homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative lattice contraction created by small chlorine and rubidium ions allows the formation of a stable wide-bandgap perovskite for use in tandem solar cells. The small size of rubidium cations usually prevents formation of the perovskite phase, but Zheng et al . showed that the strain induced with added chlorine prevents phase segregation of the rubidium and cesium cations in the perovskite and creates a phase with a wide band gap (1.67 electron volts). A perovskite solar cell had an open-circuit voltage of 1.3 volts, 93.5% of the radiative open-circuit voltage limit. —Phil Szuromi A-site cation mixing can enhance the photovoltaic performance of a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite, but rubidium (Rb) cation mixing generally forms a nonperovskite phase. We report that lattice strain locks Rb ions into the α-phase of the lattice of a triple-halide WBG perovskite, preventing phase segregation into a nonperovskite Rb-cesium–rich phase. This process cooperates with chloride accommodation and promotes halide homogenization across the entire film volume. The resulting 1.67–electron volt WBG perovskite exhibits photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 14% under 1-sun-equivalent irradiation, corresponding to a quasi–Fermi level splitting of ~1.34 electron volts. A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiative V OC limit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites.},

  abstract     = {A range of techniques are used to strengthen metal alloys to increase their duty life, but these approaches often reduce the ability of the alloys to resist asymmetric stress cycling, which can cause cumulative unidirectional plastic strain. Pan et al . showed that it is possible to achieve both high strength and superior resistance to cyclic creep by engineering the gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells in single-phase, face-centered cubic 304 stainless steel. Under asymmetrical cyclic stresses, continuous stacking fault formation and crystal structure transformation led to sustained structural refinement. This process resulted in enhanced strain hardening, reduced dynamic recovery, and mitigated strain localization, thus lowering cumulative ratcheting strain. —Marc S. Lavine Cyclic creep, or ratcheting, is a severe form of fatigue deformation caused by cumulative unidirectional plastic strain under asymmetrical stress cycling with a nonzero mean stress. It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials.},

  abstract     = {The gut has essential microbial assemblages that need conservation during treatment to maintain homeostasis, but they can also be manipulated to good effect to exclude pathogens. Whole-cell inactivated oral vaccines are safe and stimulate high-affinity immunoglobulin A responses, but alone they may not eliminate infection. Lentsch et al . recognized that such host responses put specific bacterial pathogens at a competitive disadvantage compared with more benign bacteria occupying the same metabolic niche. After oral vaccination of mice, the authors found that a benign niche competitor, which can be supplied as a probiotic supplement, could outgrow and replace or exclude pathogenic variants consistently and permanently without provoking inflammation. —Caroline Ash Colonization of the intestinal lumen precedes invasive infection for a wide range of enteropathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. We show that combining oral vaccination with engineered or selected niche-competitor strains permits pathogen exclusion and strain replacement in the mouse gut lumen. This approach can be applied either prophylactically to prevent invasion of nontyphoidal Salmonella strains, or therapeutically to displace an established Escherichia coli. Both intact adaptive immunity and metabolic niche competition are necessary for efficient vaccine-enhanced competition. Our findings imply that mucosal antibodies have evolved to work in the context of gut microbial ecology by influencing the outcome of competition. This has broad implications for the elimination of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacterial reservoirs and for rational microbiota engineering.},

With a few exceptions, proteins are not amenable to this kind of manipulation once they are produced and folded.

Matching the kinetics of the two splicing reactions is key to efficient transposition. This system functions on folded proteins in vitro, and the authors also demonstrated reactions in live cells. —Michael A. Funk Protein engineering through the ligation of polypeptide fragments has proven enormously powerful for studying biochemical processes. In general, this strategy necessitates a final protein-folding step, constraining the types of systems amenable to the approach. Here, we report a method that allows internal regions of target proteins to be replaced in a single operation. Conceptually, our system is analogous to a DNA transposition reaction but uses orthogonal pairs of engineered split inteins to mediate the editing process. This “protein transposition” reaction is applied to several systems, including folded protein complexes, allowing the efficient introduction of a variety of noncoded elements. By carrying out a molecular “cut and paste” under native protein-folding conditions, our approach substantially expands the scope of protein semisynthesis.},

However, the mechanisms through which these variants exert their effects remain largely unclear in most cases. Martin-Rufino et al . have developed “Perturb-multiome,” a technology that uses CRISPR to disrupt key regulatory proteins while simultaneously analyzing changes in DNA accessibility and gene activity in individual blood-forming cells. The authors identified critical regions of the human genome that regulate gene expression in response to perturbations, which are essential for shaping blood cell development despite comprising only a small fraction of the genome. This approach facilitates linking genetic variants to their functions across the genome, thereby advancing our understanding of gene regulation in both health and disease. —Di Jiang Most phenotype-associated genetic variants map to noncoding regulatory regions of the human genome, but their mechanisms remain elusive in most cases. We developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of master transcription factors (TFs). We examined the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other accessible chromatin regions.

Traditionally, it has been regarded as a degenerative disease driven by mechanical wear and tear ( 1 , 2 ). However, emerging evidence highlights the role of metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis ( 3 , 4 ). For instance, obesity predisposes individuals to osteoarthritis even in non–weight-bearing joints, indicating that chronic metabolic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism—rather than mechanical overload alone—can drive cartilage breakdown. However, mechanisms underlying the links between metabolism and disease progression remain poorly understood, limiting the ability to develop new therapeutic approaches. On page 48 of this issue, Yang et al . ( 5 ) report compelling evidence for a gut-joint axis involving bile acid metabolism and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) signaling in osteoarthritis development, advancing the understanding of osteoarthritis pathogenesis and opening new avenues for therapy.},

  abstract     = {Extremely palatable food is pleasant and can cause prolonged consumption, which sometimes leads to overeating and obesity. The neural circuits underlying this eating behavior are poorly understood. Zhu et al . found that neurons projecting from a brain region surrounding the locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediated the increase of palatable food consumption (see the Perspective by Small). Temporally precise closed-loop VTA dopamine-releasing neuron modulation exclusively during consumption was critical for controlling this behavior. Activation of satiety pathways with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist suppressed VTA dopamine-releasing neuron responses during palatable food consumption. These findings reveal that VTA dopamine-releasing neurons encode palatability and control the consummatory phase of eating dependent on the specific timing of their activity. —Peter Stern Hedonic eating is defined as food consumption driven by palatability without physiological need. However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.},

Owner behaviors such as limiting food access and providing physical activity can help mitigate the dogs’ risks, but genetic variants are also thought to play a role. Wallis et al . performed a genome-wide association study in hundreds of pet Labrador retrievers and identified the gene DENND1B as a major culprit in these dogs’ obesity. The authors demonstrated that DENND1B regulates the activity of the melanocortin 4 receptor, which plays a major role in energy homeostasis. They also identified a human patient with a mutation in DENND1B and other humans with additional mutations found in the dogs, demonstrating the connection to human physiology. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Obesity is a heritable disease, but its genetic basis is incompletely understood. Canine population history facilitates trait mapping. We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score—a measure of obesity—in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis.

  abstract     = {Beginning as early as 5000 years ago and lasting until just around 150 years ago, horses were integral to human societies. Their capacity for intense exertion led to their being used as everything from beasts of burden to elite racers. This athleticism is largely driven by increased oxygen consumption rates due to muscles full of mitochondria. Castiglione et al . found that horses evolved to cope with the increased oxidative burden brought about by mitochondrial activity through the evolution of a single point mutation that increases oxidative phosphorylation while simultaneously mitigating the consequent oxidative stress. —Sacha Vignieri Horses are among nature’s greatest athletes, yet the ancestral molecular adaptations fueling their energy demands are poorly understood. Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates.},

Breakdown of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains of integral membrane proteins is especially challenging, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Combining organelle proteomics, untargeted metabolomics, and reconstitution assays, Jain et al . identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP) as the protease responsible for degrading hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which has a high level of endocytosis. LyLAP ablation caused undigested hydrophobic domains to accumulate and led to lysosomal damage and PDA cell death, highlighting the critical role of this process under conditions of high membrane protein turnover. —Stella M. Hurtley Breakdown of every transmembrane protein trafficked to lysosomes requires proteolysis of their hydrophobic helical transmembrane domains. Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.},

We present a detailed chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse preimplantation development, revealing distinct chromatin signatures in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm during lineage segregation. Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Single-cell long-read sequencing enables in-depth analysis of chromatin accessibility in noncanonical imprinting, imprinted X chromosome inactivation, and low-mappability genomic regions, such as repetitive elements and paralogs.

  abstract     = {Many bacteria maintain their genomic DNA as circular plasmids, but some species keep their chromosomes as linear molecules, similar to eukaryotes. The ends of linear chromosomes have adaptations called telomeres that are protected and maintained by enzymes. Hsieh et al . discovered a class of parasitic DNA elements called transposons that bias integration into chromosome ends. These telomeric transposons use special assembly and targeting mechanisms and have their own telomere maintenance systems that allow the element to control the chromosome end. These bacteria thus need to preserve the transposon, which ensures its survival and shapes how it exchanges genetic information. —Di Jiang Eukaryotes have linear DNA, and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.},

In this excitation scheme, the signal pulses exponentially grow or decrease in amplitude over time. This dynamical behavior allows passive systems to mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to non-Hermitian responses without specific material modifications and leading to exotic optical effects. Applicable to wave systems in general, such complex excitations can be applied to developments in metamaterials, optical computing, sensing, and image processing. —Ian S.

By contrast, non-Hermitian wave systems are characterized by Hamiltonians with poles and zeros at complex frequencies, whose control through precise engineering of material loss and gain can lead to exotic scattering phenomena. Notably, excitation signals that oscillate at complex-valued frequencies can mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to these non-Hermitian responses without material modifications. These findings have been advancing the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interactions and are enabling breakthroughs in metamaterials, imaging, sensing, and computing. This Review examines theoretical advances and experimental discoveries in this emerging field, demonstrating how tailored time-domain excitations offer new opportunities for wave manipulation and control.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, sensing, and communication, but it is fragile and susceptible to decoherence. Typically, methods are developed to mitigate interactions between the quantum system and its environment. Selim et al . took a different route, non-Hermitian optics, in which the interactions between the system and the environment are carefully engineered (see the Perspective by Moiseev and Wang). With the ability to engineer the dissipation within a fully integrated non-Hermitian system, the authors demonstrate a quantum entanglement filter. With on-demand generation of entangled photons and nondestructive entanglement purification on-chip, this approach provides a route to develop quantum technologies on integrated and compact platforms. —Ian S. Osborne Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, sensing, and communication, but it is susceptible to decoherence. To address this, research in quantum optics has explored filtering techniques such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. We introduce an approach to entanglement retrieval that exploits the features of non-Hermitian systems. By designing an anti–parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network and achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels, remaining robust against decoherence during propagation. Our results offer an approach to using non-Hermitian symmetries to address central challenges in quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Plant immunity relies heavily on intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which can act as either receptors or signal transducers to facilitate disease resistance. In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4—known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively—are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as “sensor-executor” pairs against fungal pathogens. Additionally, evolutionary analyses reveal a coevolutionary trajectory of the tandem kinase-NLR module, highlighting their cooperative role in triggering plant immunity.},

  abstract     = {In theory, nanocrystalline alloys should be able to retain considerable strength even at high temperatures, but this has rarely been demonstrated in practice. Hornbuckle et al . started with a binary alloy of copper (Cu) and tantalum (Ta), even though the two are immiscible, to which they added lithium (Li). This mixture resulted in precipitates of nanoscale clusters of Cu 3 Li coated with Ta. This core-shell structure neither dissolves nor coarsens at temperatures of up to 800°C while also causing the yielding strength to be in excess of 1 gigapascal. —Marc S. Lavine We present a bulk nanocrystalline copper alloy that can operate at near-melting temperatures with minimal coarsening and creep deformation. The thermal stability of the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic % (at %) alloy is attributed to coherent, ordered L1 2 Cu 3 Li precipitates surrounded by a tantalum-rich atomic bilayer phase boundary complexion. Adding 0.5 at % lithium to the immiscible Cu-Ta system changes the morphology of the nanoscale precipitates from spherical to cuboidal while simultaneously tailoring the phase boundary. The resultant complexion-stabilized nanoscale precipitates provide excellent thermal stability, strength, and creep resistance. The underlying alloy design principles may guide the development of next-generation copper alloys for high-temperature applications such as heat exchangers.},

  abstract     = {As climate has warmed, precipitation and evapotranspiration changes have affected land surface water fluxes. What impact has that had on terrestrial water storage, the amount of water stored on and in the land? Seo et al . combined soil moisture data from satellites, measurements of sea level, and observations of polar motion to estimate terrestrial water storage over the past four decades, which revealed a dramatic decline (see the Perspective by Samaniego). During the interval from 2000 to 2002, terrestrial water storage decreased by nearly twice as much as Greenland ice mass loss over the same period. —Jesse Smith Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.},

  abstract     = {US police detain racial or ethnic minority drivers (Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic) more than white drivers. However, a longstanding debate remains unsettled: Does this necessarily reflect police bias? Hypothetically, if minorities were more prone to disobey speed limits and traffic laws, then their traffic stops may be warranted. To put this debate to rest, Aggarwal et al . examined rideshare data from Lyft in the state of Florida to compare minority drivers with their white counterparts. Lyft objectively measured drivers’ locations, driving speed, and location speed limits (see the Perspective by Knox and Mummolo). White and minority drivers showed no discernible differences in speeding behaviors or traffic violations. However, when both drove at identical speeds, police were still 33% more likely to issue speeding citations to minority drivers and charged 34% more expensive fines, unequivocally revealing bias. —Ekeoma Uzogara Prior research on racial profiling has found that in encounters with law enforcement, minorities are punished more severely than white civilians. Less is known about the causes of these encounters and their implications for our understanding of racial profiling. Using high-frequency location data of rideshare drivers in Florida ( N = 222,838 individuals), we estimate the effect of driver race on citations and fines for speeding using 19.3 million location pings. Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines. We find no evidence that accident and reoffense rates explain these estimates, which suggests that an animus against minorities underlies our results.},

However, these patterns are difficult to determine from modern genomes alone because different scenarios can result in similar genomic outcomes. Grundler et al . created a method using ancestral recombination graphs to trace the spatiotemporal history of DNA segments shared between modern humans (see the Perspective by Gravel). They predicted the least costly migration paths for their sampled individuals back through 200,000 years ago, showing that the most likely path out of Africa was the northern route. This method may prove useful in other species and could provide an alternate way to account for shared ancestry in genetic studies. —Corinne N.

We present a method that capitalizes on the rich genealogical information encoded in genomic tree sequences to infer the geographic locations of the shared ancestors of a sample of sequenced individuals. We used this method to infer the geographic history of genetic ancestry of a set of human genomes sampled from Europe, Asia, and Africa, accurately recovering major population movements on those continents. Our findings demonstrate the importance of defining the spatiotemporal context of genetic ancestry when describing human genetic variation and caution against the oversimplified interpretations of genetic data prevalent in contemporary discussions of race and ancestry.},

China now publishes more scientific papers than any other country, and the impact of this research (although trickier to measure) is impressive ( 1 ). Despite China’s remarkable progress, its policymakers continue to grapple with a basic question that all countries face: how to balance between promoting research focused on national priorities and that driven by academic curiosity. This article begins by explaining how Chinese policy-makers have recently stepped up efforts to guide science in keeping with national priorities, including economic, environmental, and national security concerns. It then notes an important countercurrent, particularly the growing interest in “original innovation” and the appreciation that curiosity-driven research has a role to play in this regard. It concludes by noting that China is part of a broader international shift to leverage science for national purposes, and by highlighting the risks this trend entails.},

Similarly, particles in a quantum system are entangled to share some correlated feature even if they are far away. This phenomenon, called quantum entanglement ( 1 ), is important for quantum information processing but highly sensitive to decoherence (loss of quantum properties) ( 2 ). Exposure to uncontrolled environments, such as thermal fluctuations, causes entangled particles to pick up random noises, which leads to a so-called mixed state. Fortunately, there are ways to “filter” a mixed state back into a pure entangled state by engineering a quantum bath (or reservoir)—a controlled environment to which the system is coupled ( 3 , 4 ). On page 1424 of this issue, Selim et al. ( 5 ) report a new way to filter entangled photons by exploiting a fundamental physics concept that is extensively applied in classical context, called non-Hermitian symmetries. This could offer a new way of solving a key challenge in quantum technology.},

However, in many human populations, this adaptive behavior is made maladaptive by readily available, energy-dense sources of food, resulting in high rates of obesity. One such behavior, called invigoration, causes an increase in speed, duration, and intake of a palatable food ( 1 ). The neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not yet clear. On page 1376 of this issue, Zhu et al . ( 2 ) report a brain circuit that drives feeding invigoration in mice. This circuit begins with neurons in the area around the locus coeruleus (periLC) and results in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The finding provides a neural target, the therapeutic modulation of which might enable changes to food intake by preventing invigoration.},

Although local and regional changes in the water cycle have been observed ( 1 , 2 ), conclusive proof of a global-scale shift has been elusive.

  abstract     = {Epithelial cells often polarize along a tissue plane, a collective cell behavior known as planar cell polarity (PCP). To couple polarity between cells, asymmetrically localized PCP proteins bind intercellularly at cell junctions. Although PCP is by definition a multicellular process, the minimal number of cells required for PCP proteins to asymmetrically localize is not known. Basta et al . addressed this issue using chimeric mouse embryos in which dual-PCP reporter cells had been genetically uncoupled from their neighbors. They found that intercellular binding between just two cells was both necessary and sufficient to initiate the sorting of PCP complexes into asymmetric bridges. —Stella M. Hurtley For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.},

Uytiepo et al . used three-dimensional electron microscopy coupled with chemogenetic tagging and behavioral analysis to determine the structural changes supporting the acquisition of long-term fear memories, focusing on the Schaffer collateral synapses. Long-term memory acquisition was found to be associated with a selective increase in multisynaptic boutons without the involvement of simultaneous activation of synaptically connected neurons. These results challenge the general applicability of the Hebbian model and expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory formation. —Mattia Maroso Memory engrams are formed through experience-dependent plasticity of neural circuits, but their detailed architectures remain unresolved. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes. Our findings elucidate the physical hallmarks of long-term memory and offer a structural basis for the cellular flexibility of information coding.},

  abstract     = {The number of species in an ecosystem relates to several other key properties, including biomass and stability across time. Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez While both species richness and ecosystem stability increase with area, how these scaling patterns are linked remains unclear. Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.},

Yates et al . investigated the mechanism mediating this so-called infantile amnesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in awake infants performing a memory task (see the Perspective by Ramsaran and Frankland). They found that infants are capable of encoding memories during infancy, and deficits in postencoding retrieval mechanisms are likely responsible for infantile amnesia in humans. —Mattia Maroso Humans lack memories for specific events from the first few years of life. We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.},

In this work, we report on the direct growth of close-packed SWNT arrays on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, demonstrating high alignment and uniform chirality within each array. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a self-assembly growth mechanism resulted from the intertube van der Waals attraction and the ultralow sliding friction of SWNTs on the atomically flat hBN substrate. Field-effect transistors constructed from the grown SWNT array exhibit high performance at room temperature, with mobilities of up to 2000 square centimeters per volt per second, on/off ratios of ~10 7 , and a maximum current density of ~6 milliamperes per micrometer.},

Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrated fast qubit-state readout with 99.960 − 24 + 14 % fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we used cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)% fidelity and a 32(1)% success rate (the number in parentheses is the standard deviation). Second, we performed a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)%, increased to 76(2)% with error detection.

Bar-On et al . examined existing observational records of terrestrial carbon pools and found that live biomass has stored only a small fraction of that carbon, the bulk having been incorporated into nonliving organic matter (see the Perspective by Canadell). This work has important implications for understanding how quickly carbon is returned to the atmosphere. —Jesse Smith Terrestrial sequestration of carbon has mitigated ≈30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.},

Furthermore, the authors established that mutants lacking a Casparian strip were less able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules, implying a connection between these processes. The presence of the Casparian strip also affected expression of the root-shoot signaling peptides that regulate nodulation. This work expands the role of the Casparian strip and links it to the spatial regulation of nodulation in plant roots. —Madeleine Seale Establishment of the apoplastic root barrier known as the Casparian strip occurs early in root development. In legumes, this area overlaps with nitrogen-fixing nodule formation, which raises the possibility that nodulation and barrier formation are connected. Nodules also contain Casparian strips, yet, in this case, their role is unknown. We established mutants with defective barriers in Lotus japonicus . This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation.

As such, they are especially susceptible to low blood oxygen levels, which could lead to drowning while submerged. McKnight et al . exposed diving gray seals to various gas mixes and found that the seals responded to low levels of blood oxygen but not high levels of carbon dioxide (see the Perspective by Hawkes and Kendall-Bar). Nearly all other mammals are insensitive to blood oxygen levels, instead gauging blood oxygen by sensing increasing carbon dioxide. Direct sensing of oxygen levels likely improves diving efficiency. —Sacha Vignieri Marine mammals rely on maintaining sufficient blood oxygen levels while diving to prevent drowning. Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH.

However, mammals and birds are thought to be unable to sense oxygen directly in the blood but instead use carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a proxy for changes in oxygen concentration. This poses a particular challenge for diving animals that spend most of their lives underwater holding their breath, a condition that can cause a dangerous buildup of CO 2 (hypercapnia) and insufficient oxygen (hypoxia). On page 1276 of this issue, McKnight et al . ( 1 ) report that gray seals ( Halichoerus grypus ) can directly sense the level of blood oxygen and modify their diving behavior accordingly, independent of the amount of CO 2 present. This raises the question of direct sensing of blood oxygen by other animals as well.},

Key to the power of quantum computing is the ability to entangle two or more qubits (quantum bits) into joint states that cannot be described by the properties of individual particles alone. Entanglement between neutral-atom qubits has been achieved between atoms close to each other, typically through electromagnetic fields in free space—as opposed to confined to a restricted region of space within a device, such as a cavity between mirrors ( 1 ). On page 1301 of this issue, Grinkemeyer et al . ( 2 ) report that quantum gates that entangle qubits separated by a small optical cavity can perform operations quickly and accurately. The system includes a fiber-optic cable that transmits information over long distances, representing an essential step toward building reliable and large-scale quantum computing networks.},

This phenomenon, given the name infantile amnesia by Sigmund Freud, has intrigued scientists for more than a century ( 1 ). Do people not remember experiences from infancy because the brain is too immature to form memories, or are these memories formed and then forgotten? This seemingly simple question has been difficult to answer given the technical challenges of studying the infant brain. On page 1316 of this issue, Yates et al . ( 2 ) provide functional neuroimaging evidence that the infant hippocampus (a brain region important for memory) can encode the types of information that are required for episodic memory, that is, memories for specific life events containing information about people, places, and things. This suggests that immaturity of postencoding processes, such as memory consolidation or retrieval, is a more likely explanation for infantile amnesia.},

The locations where the absorbed emissions are stored govern the long-term stability and management of carbon pools—those places in Earth’s biosphere that can accumulate, store, and release carbon. Nonetheless, how carbon is dispersed across different pools on land remains unclear. On page 1291 of this issue, Bar-On et al. ( 1 ) report an unexpectedly large distribution of terrestrial carbon in pools of nonliving organic matter that are natural or human made. Carbon sequestration beyond the more vulnerable components, such as trees, could imply greater carbon stability on land than previously thought.

Klawon et al . used mouse models to investigate the role of T reg cells that recognized the same prostate tissue peptide antigen as T conv cells. In immune responses accompanied by increased availability of prostate antigen, deletion of prostate-specific T reg cells increased the infiltration of the matched T conv cells into the prostate. Thus, in this context, nonmatched T reg cells could not restrain self-reactive T conv cells. Rather, the self-recognizing T reg cells proliferated earlier in response to antigen than their T conv counterparts, helping to curb their activity. —Sarah H. Ross During infections, CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T (T reg ) cells must control autoreactive CD4 + conventional T (T conv ) cell responses against self-peptide antigens while permitting those against pathogen-derived “nonself” peptides. We defined the basis of this selectivity using mice in which T reg cells reactive to a single prostate-specific self-peptide were selectively depleted. We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.},

Che et al . analyzed basalt fragments retrieved by Chang’e-6, using radiometric dating to show that they formed 2.8 billion years ago. The composition of the basalt constrains the properties of the magma source of the volcanism. The authors found both similarities to and differences from samples taken on the near side of the Moon and discuss the implications for geochemical models. —Keith T. Smith Volcanism on the Moon has produced surface basalt deposits, which record lunar interior processes. The Chang’e-6 mission retrieved samples from the South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA) on the Moon’s far side. We analyzed basalt fragments collected by Chang’e-6 and found that their composition resembles that of low-titanium basalts previously sampled by the Apollo missions. Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating indicated a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 million years and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during the late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization. The results are consistent with the LMO model, but the Chang’e-6 basalt deviates from the trend in Apollo mission samples of younger basalts having higher μ-values. We suggest that this indicates post-LMO modification of the mantle by the SPA impact.},

Sattar et al . report a multifaceted examination of the causes and consequences of this disaster, drawing from satellite imagery, seismic and meteorological data, field observations, and numerical modeling. Their results point to the pressing need to enhance prediction capabilities and early warning systems as melting glaciers raise the risk of such floods in the Himalayan region. —Jake S. Yeston On 3 October 2023, a multihazard cascade in the Sikkim Himalaya, India, was triggered by 14.7 million cubic meters of frozen lateral moraine collapsing into South Lhonak Lake. The impact generated an ~20-meter tsunami-like impact wave, which breached the moraine and drained ~50 million cubic meters of the lake’s water. The ensuing glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million cubic meters of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impacts of this event prompt urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters. Insights into multihazard evolution are pivotal for informing policy development, enhancing early warning systems (EWS), and spurring paradigm shifts in GLOF risk management strategies in the Himalaya and other mountain environments.},

These parasites depend on a tail-like oscillating appendage called a flagellum to travel within their insect carriers or vertebrate hosts. The movement of the flagellum is generated by an enormous internal protein-based machine called the axoneme. Xia et al . used high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy to reveal the intricate structure and connections of the flagellum components of Trypanosoma brucei . They identified components specific to the parasite and uncovered how molecular motors drive the movement. Doran et al . defined individual components of the axoneme and identified a cluster of proteins that are essential for the parasite’s ability to swim properly. Together, these studies shed light on flagellum biology, evolution, and function; enhance our understanding of parasite biology; and highlight potential drug targets to prevent parasite spread and infection. —Stella M. Hurtley The movement and pathogenicity of trypanosomatid species, the causative agents of trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, are dependent on a flagellum that contains an axoneme of dynein-bound doublet microtubules (DMTs). In this work, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of DMTs from two trypanosomatid species, Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata , at resolutions up to 2.7 angstrom. The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior. Our study shows that proper B-tubule closure is critical for flagellar motility, exemplifying how integrating structural identification with systematic gene deletion can dissect individual protein contributions to flagellar motility.},

Doran et al . defined individual components of the axoneme and identified a cluster of proteins that are essential for the parasite’s ability to swim properly. Together, these studies shed light on flagellum biology, evolution, and function; enhance our understanding of parasite biology; and highlight potential drug targets to prevent parasite spread and infection. —Stella M. Hurtley The flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei drives the parasite’s characteristic screw-like motion and is essential for its replication, transmission, and pathogenesis. However, the molecular details of this process remain unclear. Here, we present high-resolution (up to 2.8 angstrom) cryo–electron microscopy structures of T. brucei flagellar doublet microtubules (DMTs). Integrated modeling identified 154 different axonemal proteins inside and outside the DMT and, together with genetic and proteomic interrogation, revealed conserved and trypanosome-specific foundations of flagellum assembly and motility. We captured axonemal dynein motors in their pre–power stroke state. Comparing atomic models between pre– and post–power strokes defined how dynein structural changes drive sliding of adjacent DMTs during flagellar beating. This study illuminates structural dynamics underlying flagellar motility and identifies pathogen-specific proteins to consider for therapeutic interventions targeting neglected diseases.},

  abstract     = {Linoleic acid is the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in the Western-style diet and has been implicated in promoting inflammation and cancer. Koundouros et al . report a mechanism by which linoleic acid can activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase, which coordinates growth and nutrient signals (see the Perspective by Jacinto). Particularly in certain breast cancer cells that overexpressed fatty acid binding protein 5, mTORC1 was activated by linoleic acid, and this action appeared to be mediated by direct binding of this protein to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR. —L. Bryan Ray Diet influences macronutrient availability to cells, and although mechanisms of sensing dietary glucose and amino acids are well characterized, less is known about sensing lipids. We defined a nutrient signaling mechanism involving fatty acid–binding protein 5 (FABP5) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that is activated by the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ω-6 linoleic acid (LA). FABP5 directly bound to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) to enhance formation of functional mTORC1 and substrate binding, ultimately converging on increased mTOR signaling and proliferation. The amounts of FABP5 protein were increased in tumors and serum from triple-negative compared with those from receptor-positive breast cancer patients, which highlights its potential role as a biomarker that mediates cellular responses to ω-6 LA intake in this disease subtype.},

TNTLs extend across the cardiac jelly, allowing direct cell-cell contact, signal transduction, and selective protein transfer. Disrupting TNTLs leads to abnormal heart wall formation, highlighting the importance of TNTLs in cardiac development. —Stella M. Hurtley In the developing mammalian heart, the endocardium and the myocardium are separated by so-called cardiac jelly. Communication between the endocardium and the myocardium is essential for cardiac morphogenesis. How membrane-localized receptors and ligands achieve interaction across the cardiac jelly is not understood. Working in developing mouse cardiac morphogenesis models, we used a variety of cellular, imaging, and genetic approaches to elucidate this question. We found that myocardium and endocardium interacted directly through microstructures termed tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs). TNTLs extended from cardiomyocytes (CMs) to contact endocardial cells (ECs) directly. TNTLs transported cytoplasmic proteins, transduced signals between CMs and ECs, and initiated myocardial growth toward the heart lumen to form ventricular trabeculae-like structures. Loss of TNTLs disturbed signaling interactions and, subsequently, ventricular patterning.},

However, fundamental mechanical properties, such as the ice flow law and viscosity structure, remain under debate. In this work, by leveraging remote-sensing data and physics-informed deep learning, we provide evidence over several ice shelves that the flow law follows a grain size–sensitive composite rheology in the compression zone. In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf–wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts.

Islam et al . evaluated these constraints using published data on mineral production and water requirements for different minerals, coupled with regional water-carrying capacities from a hydrologic model. They found that mineral production exceeds water resources in many regions because of high production or low water availability. Coal, iron, copper, and gold showed some of the highest overconsumption, coal because of its high production rates and the metals because they require more water to process. Water requirements for mineral production are expected to increase in the future. —Bianca Lopez Although the global economy requires geological resource mining, production has substantial environmental impacts, including the use of regional available water. In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible. Future demand for geological resources is expected to require a considerable increase in water consumption.

We used low-resolution optical spectra to measure the extinction curve of 130 million stars. By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameter R ( V ) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.},

We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite.

There was little color variation, and the animals were entirely dark in color. The authors argue that this was likely due to the animals’ nocturnal nature, and that brighter and more varied colors in mammals may have arisen after the extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period. —Sacha Vignieri Pelage coloration, which serves numerous functions, is crucial to the evolution of behavior, physiology, and habitat preferences of mammals. However, little is known about the coloration of Mesozoic mammaliaforms that coevolved with dinosaurs. In this study, we used a dataset of melanosome (melanin-containing organelle) morphology and quantitatively measured hair colors from 116 extant mammals to reliably reconstruct the coloration of six Mesozoic mammaliaforms, including a previously undescribed euharamiyidan. Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality.

We report green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in a chirally ordered supramolecular assembly, with 24% dissymmetry in a triazatruxene (TAT) system. We found that TAT assembled into helices with a pitch of six molecules, associating angular momentum to the valence and conduction bands and obtaining the observed CPL. Cosublimation of TAT as the “guest” in a structurally mismatched “host” enabled fabrication of thin films in which chiral crystallization was achieved in situ by thermally triggered nanophase segregation of dopant and host while preserving film integrity. The OLEDs showed external quantum efficiencies of up to 16% and electroluminescence dissymmetries ≥10%. Vacuum deposition of chiral superstructures opens new opportunities to explore chiral-driven optical and transport phenomena.},

  abstract     = {One of the defining characteristics of aryl compounds such as benzene is their greater stability compared with other arrangements of carbon-carbon double bonds. If one of the aryl bonds is broken, those remaining tend to be more reactive. Olivier et al . report a reaction manifold that reverses this prevailing trend. A nitroarene reagent can be photoexcited to a state that preferentially reacts with arenes over olefins, likely through transient complexation, thereby enabling clean oxidative cleavage of just one aryl bond. —Jake S. Yeston The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.},

Some AI researchers and commentators speculate that we are on the cusp of creating agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI), a prospect anticipated with both elation and anxiety. There have also been extensive conversations about cultural and social consequences of large models, orbiting around two foci: immediate effects of these systems as they are currently used, and hypothetical futures when these systems turn into AGI agents—perhaps even superintelligent AGI agents. But this discourse about large models as intelligent agents is fundamentally misconceived. Combining ideas from social and behavioral sciences with computer science can help us to understand AI systems more accurately. Large models should not be viewed primarily as intelligent agents but as a new kind of cultural and social technology, allowing humans to take advantage of information other humans have accumulated.},

Subsequent development of the heart ventricles involves the formation of trabeculae—muscular ridges lined by the endocardium. How signals pass between the endocardium and myocardium across the cardiac jelly to ensure normal development is not fully understood. On page 1166 of this issue, Miao et al . ( 1 ) report that, in mice, the myocardium and endocardium of the early heart tube communicate directly through tiny membrane-enclosed projections called tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs).

These ice shelves exert buttressing forces on inland upstream ice, affecting ice sheet stability ( 1 ). A key factor governing the ice flow dynamics is the deformation of ice under stress.

A key component of this machinery is the enzyme mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR partners with other proteins to form two distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that regulate various aspects of anabolic metabolism ( 1 ). Yet, how mTORCs sense nutrients, particularly lipids or fats, remains largely unexplored. On page 1164 of this issue, Koundouros et al .

  abstract     = {Naturally occurring obstacles in chromosomal DNA can challenge the faithful propagation of the genome across generations. Batra et al . determined that noncanonical DNA secondary structures called G-quadruplexes can impede DNA copying by arresting the replicative DNA helicase known as CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS), which serves as the central engine of the molecular machinery that copies chromosomal DNA. The CMG helicase moves along DNA through a previously unrecognized inchworm-like mechanism. These observations uncover fundamental principles of the chromosome replication process that are essential for the maintenance of genome stability. —Di Jiang DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non–B-form DNA secondary structures that threaten genome stability by impeding DNA replication. To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions.},

  abstract     = {Peroxisomes are small, membrane-bound structures within cells that play a crucial role in synthesizing and breaking down fat. Wei et al . found that that severe COVID-19 can disrupt peroxisomes in macrophages, an immune cell type specialized in engulfing cellular debris and pathogens. This disruption led to impaired lung repair, prolonged inflammation, and chronic fibrosis (see the Perspective by Sariol and Perlman). In mouse models, enhancing peroxisome function using an FDA-approved drug improved lung healing and reduced long-term damage after viral infection. Thus, targeting peroxisomes could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing acute and chronic complications caused by respiratory viruses. —Stella M. Hurtley Peroxisomes are vital but often overlooked metabolic organelles. We found that excessive interferon signaling remodeled macrophage peroxisomes. This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models. Thus, macrophage peroxisome dysfunction contributes to chronic lung pathology and fibrosis after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.},

  abstract     = {Despite the toxicity of many of its raw components, manioc (also known as cassava or yuca) is a prevalent staple crop. Kistler et al . sequenced the genomes of 200 herbarium samples, two archeological samples, and 80 modern samples of manioc to reconstruct its population history. Their analysis revealed that many lineages of manioc have been propagating for at least a century but with almost no geographical patterns of variation like their wild relatives. These patterns instead reflected local agricultural practices. By incorporating Indigenous knowledge, this study explores the impact of domestication on this crop and how this process is reflected in genetic variation. —Corinne Simonti Manioc—also called cassava and yuca—is among the world’s most important crops, originating in South America in the early Holocene. Domestication for its starchy roots involved a near-total shift from sexual to clonal propagation, and almost all manioc worldwide is now grown from stem cuttings. In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide. Interviews with Indigenous traditional farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado illuminate how traditional management strategies for sustaining, diversifying, and sharing the gene pool have shaped manioc diversity.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian cells are packed with millions of ribosomes, tiny machines that decode genetic information into proteins. Although they are essential for this decoding process, they are often viewed as identical particles with little regulatory influence. Zhang et al . developed techniques to observe single ribosomes and examine their composition in different cellular compartments. They found that a protein called Lsg1 is involved in recruiting ribosomes near the endoplasmic reticulum to produce membrane-embedded proteins. They also found specialized ribosomes near mitochondria for making metabolism-related proteins and remodeling of ribosomal populations in neuronal processes, revealing a new layer of gene control based on ribosome type and location. —Di Jiang Millions of ribosomes are packed within mammalian cells, yet we lack tools to visualize them in toto and characterize their subcellular composition. In this study, we present ribosome expansion microscopy (RiboExM) to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique (ALIBi) to probe their composition. We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins. Additionally, we discovered ribosome heterogeneity at mitochondria guiding translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Lastly, we visualized ribosomes in neurons, revealing a dynamic switch between monosomes and polysomes in neuronal translation. Together, these approaches enable exploration of ribosomal localization and composition at unprecedented resolution.},

  abstract     = {In model animals, products from the gut microbiota have been identified that influence host cell function. For example, a bacterial protein has been found that promotes beta cell proliferation in the islets of the pancreas of zebrafish. Hill et al . found that neonatal mice must be exposed to a microbiota during a particular developmental window to be able to develop functional pancreatic beta cells and islets. The fungal species Candida dubliniensis mediates this effect through islet macrophages, possible through fungal cell wall components. If the developmental window is missed (e.g., in germ-free mice) or if the microbiota are disrupted during the developmental window, there is reduced beta cell development and compromised metabolic function reverberates throughout the life of the animal. —Caroline Ash Loss of early-life microbial diversity is correlated with diabetes, yet mechanisms by which microbes influence disease remain elusive. We report a critical neonatal window in mice when microbiota disruption results in lifelong metabolic consequences stemming from reduced β cell development. We show evidence for the existence of a similar program in humans and identify specific fungi and bacteria that are sufficient for β cell growth. The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces β cells. Candida dubliniensis increases β cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence. Provision of C. dubliniensis after β cell ablation or antibiotic treatment improves β cell function. These data identify fungi as critical early-life commensals that promote long-term metabolic health.},

  abstract     = {Species are expected to shift their ranges as the climate changes, but shifts may not occur fast enough, especially for immobile species such as plants. Two papers in this issue assess the degree to which plant species are tracking climate change in the American tropics, where data availability has constrained inference. Ramírez-Barahona et al . show that in Mesoamerican cloud forests, climate change and deforestation together have led to a mean upward shift in species ranges since 1979, mainly due to contracting lower range edges. In tropical forests across the Americas, Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al . found that tree traits are not shifting fast enough to track climate change based on trait-climate relationships, with smaller shifts in montane forests. —Bianca Lopez Understanding the capacity of forests to adapt to climate change is of pivotal importance for conservation science, yet this is still widely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.},

Previous approaches have either used a self-coiling method, which is limited to muscles with a low spring index, or involve wrapping the fibers around a mandrel, which allows for high–spring index yarns, but the mandrel then needs to be extracted, generating excess waste. Zhang et al . managed to get rid of the mandrel by developing a process in which fibers are first twisted and then plied with other twisted fibers (see the Perspective by Zhang). After thermal stabilization, they are separated to produce coils from the original fibers. This process makes it possible to vary the spring index along the length of the fiber. The authors demonstrate the use of these polymer muscles for environmentally driven tunable insulation and in robotics through electrically driven actuation. —Marc S. Lavine Methods for making high-spring-index polymer fiber or yarn muscles have required expensive fabrication by wrapping around a mandrel, which limits their practical applications. We demonstrate an inexpensive mandrel-free method for making polymer muscles that can have a spring index of >50 and a contractile tensile stroke exceeding 97%. This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle’s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets.

Using records of 12.6 million individual butterflies from >76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programs, we characterized overall and species-specific butterfly abundance trends across the contiguous United States. Between 2000 and 2020, total butterfly abundance fell by 22% across the 554 recorded species. Species-level declines were widespread, with 13 times as many species declining as increasing.

In both cases, the carbon-carbon double bonds served as convenient handles for the transformation of a wide variety of complex molecules. —Jake S. Yeston Deconstructive transformation of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) is a pivotal strategy in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Despite the substantial advances in olefin metathesis and ozonolysis for natural product synthesis through C=C double-bond cleavage, the catalytic remodeling of complex molecules through C=C double-bond deconstruction has been underdeveloped. We report a heterogeneous copper-catalyzed C=C double-bond cleavage, which enables the remodeling of complex molecules by converting the carbons on either side of the C=C double bond to carbonyl and cyano groups, respectively. In particular, this method provides an efficient protocol to conveniently transform terpenoids, glycals, steroids, and bioactive molecules to privileged scaffolds with underexplored chemical space.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a cutting-edge technique that can manipulate tunneling electrons on subpicosecond timescales using an electric field generated by a THz pulse. THz-STM has been used in recent years to study ultrafast nanometer-scale dynamics induced by charge transfer on solid surfaces. However, there are still many challenges in improving spatiotemporal resolution. Kimura et al . successfully demonstrated ultrafast manipulation of exciton formation in a single phthalocyanine molecule on a metal-supported ultrathin insulating film by tailoring the waveform of THz pulses. The presented experimental platform is a promising step in studying exciton dynamics with single-molecule precision. —Yury Suleymanov The ultrafast manipulation of molecular states by charge transfer is essential for characterizing and controlling molecular dynamics. In this study, we demonstrated exciton formation in a single molecule through ultrafast electron tunneling processes between a molecule and a metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a phase-controlled terahertz (THz) pulse. The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions.},

We mechanically reinforced perovskite thin films by integrating a polymer-coupled monolithic single-layer graphene interface that led to a twofold enhancement in modulus and hardness. The synergistic effect of graphene and poly(methyl methacrylate) restricted photoinduced lattice expansion and decreased the deformation ratio from 0.31 to 0.08%, which minimized the structural damage caused by dynamic lattice evolution.

  abstract     = {Proteins are translated from messenger RNA (mRNA), and the levels of these biomolecules are often correlated for a given gene. However, this observation is at odds with the fact that many variants that alter gene expression do not alter protein levels. Cope et al . tested several phylogenetic models relating mRNA and protein levels in coupled transcriptomic and proteomic data from skin samples across 10 mammals. They found that evolution primarily acting on protein levels best fit the data, with gene expression driven to accommodate those optimal levels. These mRNA values did not match perfectly and are likely amplified due to post-transcriptional mechanisms such as translational efficiency or protein degradation. —Corinne Simonti The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances is well-studied, but less is known about the evolutionary processes shaping their relationship. To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.},

Two papers in this issue assess the degree to which plant species are tracking climate change in the American tropics, where data availability has constrained inference. Ramírez-Barahona et al . show that in Mesoamerican cloud forests, climate change and deforestation together have led to a mean upward shift in species ranges since 1979, mainly due to contracting lower range edges. In tropical forests across the Americas, Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al . found that tree traits are not shifting fast enough to track climate change based on trait-climate relationships, with smaller shifts in montane forests. —Bianca Lopez Global change drives biodiversity shifts worldwide, but these shifts are poorly understood in highly diverse tropical regions. In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species’ occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change. Our results highlight the vulnerability of cloud forests under global change and the urgency to increase monitoring of species’ responses.},

Constructed by coiling a twisted fiber often made of polymers, its functionality is determined by the spring index, which is the ratio of coil diameter to fiber diameter ( 1 ). Various synthetic materials with high spring indices have been developed ( 2 , 3 ), but these often require expensive fabrication methods. On page 1101 of this issue, Zhang et al.

However, the bright colors of butterflies are a source of delight that have captivated observers for centuries, enabling the collection of valuable data on butterfly diversity and abundance and making it possible to study long-term changes in butterfly communities. Studies combining historical records and citizen science data have reported large butterfly population declines in western Europe ( 1 ) and the western US ( 2 ). On page 1090 of this issue, Edwards et al . ( 3 ) report the assembly of the most comprehensive dataset of systematic, decades-long butterfly monitoring within the contiguous US. The study reveals a worrying decline in total butterfly abundance, the magnitude of which is in line with global estimates of insect declines ( 4 ).},

The target of erucamide is the conserved bacterial type III secretion system syringe protein HrcC. Erucamide accumulation is part of plant defense, and transgenic plants with reduced erucamide were found to be susceptible to bacterial infection. —Ankit Walia Numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens employ the type III secretion system (T3SS), a multiprotein injectisome, to deliver virulence proteins into host cells and cause diseases. We uncover erucamide as a previously unknown phytoalexin of both dicots and monocots that blocks the T3SS function of multiple bacterial pathogens. Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance.

To characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of demyelination in a translationally relevant primate model of MS (an experimental autoimmune encephalitis marmoset model), Lin et al . performed longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–guided RNA profiling. By correlating MRI-detected lesions with spatial transcriptional changes, the authors identified gene profile microenvironments around the lesions, which enabled them to propose therapeutic targets and potential treatments for MS. —Mattia Maroso Inferring cellular and molecular dynamics of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from postmortem tissue collected decades after onset is challenging. Using magnetic resonance image (MRI)–guided spatiotemporal RNA profiling in marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), we mapped lesion dynamics and modeled molecular perturbations relevant to MS. Five distinct lesion microenvironments emerged, involving neuroglial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and brain border regulation. Before demyelination, MRI identified a high ratio of proton density–weighted signal to T 1 relaxation time, capturing early hypercellularity, and elevated astrocytic and ependymal senescence signals marked perivascular and periventricular areas that later became demyelination hotspots. As lesions expanded, concentric glial barriers formed, initially dominated by proliferating and diversifying microglia and oligodendrocyte precursors, later replaced by monocytes and lymphocytes. We highlight SERPINE1 + astrocytes as a signaling hub underlying lesion onset in both marmoset EAE and MS.},

ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

Barker et al . took a new approach to answering this question by looking at the morphology of glacial inception and deglaciation. They found that those steps depend strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity, with precession having more influence on deglacial onset and obliquity being more important for reaching peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. Thus, glacial-interglacial variability in the relevant period, called the 100,000-year world, is largely deterministic. —Jesse Smith Identifying the specific roles of precession, obliquity, and eccentricity in glacial-interglacial transitions is hindered by imprecise age control. We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.},

This conclusion has set the tone for much thinking about such movement in nature. Sayin et al ., including authors of the original study, combined field and laboratory studies and found that locusts, and likely also other animals moving collectively, do not follow a “self-propelled” particle model (see the Perspective by Buhl and Simpson). Rather, they found that sensory and cognitive mechanisms mediate the interactions. —Sacha Vignieri Collective motion, which is ubiquitous in nature, has traditionally been explained by “self-propelled particle” models from theoretical physics. Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.},

We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.},

  abstract     = {Pest resistance is one of the major traits introduced into genetically modified crops. Such crops can reduce the need for chemical pesticides. However, when they are planted over entire landscapes, their effectiveness declines, and the cost-benefit ratio shifts as pests develop resistance. Ye et al . investigated how farmers’ choices about how much Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis ) transgenic maize to plant aligned with the optimum based on field trials (see the Policy Forum by Brown and Reisig). Farmers generally planted more Bt maize than the optimum across the US corn belt, suggesting misperceptions of the costs and benefits. This was especially true in eastern states, where crop rotation is more common and corn rootworm damage was lower in field trials. —Bianca Lopez Widespread use of genetically engineered maize targeting the corn rootworm complex ( Diabrotica species) has raised concerns about insect resistance. Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the “tragedy of the commons” perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources. We propose moving toward a more diversified and transparent seed supply.},

  abstract     = {Adjusting the curvature of dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals can control particle bonding directionality to form a variety of intricate two-dimensional superlattices. Wan et al . found that superlattice formation from these rare earth fluoride colloids results from globally interlocking self-assembly driven by curvature-guided depletion interactions that are difficult to achieve with conventional convex particles (see the Perspective by Korgel). This method could also stabilize structures with periodic vacancies, such as the chiral Kagome lattice. —Phil Szuromi Shape-anisotropic nanocrystals and patchy particles have been explored to construct complex superstructures, but most studies have focused on convex shapes. We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the structure of ferrocene, an iron ion sandwiched between two carbon rings, was foundational to the theory and practice of organometallic chemistry. In the ensuing decades, numerous analogous metal sandwich compounds have been prepared and applied. Russo et al . now extend the motif to berkelium, a radioactive element heavier than uranium. Their experiments required rapid synthesis and characterization on a submilligram scale to compensate for the ongoing decay. Spectroscopic and theoretical analysis supported covalent interactions between the cyclic ligands and f orbitals of the metal. —Jake S. Yeston Interest in actinide–carbon bonds has persisted since actinide organometallics were first investigated for applications in isotope separation during the Manhattan Project. Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.},

  abstract     = {The properties of a hydrogel are highly dependent on maintaining their large water content. This can limit their use to temperatures between 0° and 100°C or may require the use of hygroscopic additives or replacing the water with ionic liquids. Zhang et al . explored a different approach that involves binding water molecules to the polymer network (see the Perspective by Yu and Lin). The authors started with a double network structure based on polyacrylate and alginate, which they then treated with concentrated sulfuric acid and heated to convert the alginate to carbon nanoparticles. The incorporated sulfate groups acted as strong binding sites for water, and the carbon nanoparticles provided electrical and mechanical sensitivity to the gels, which enabled their use over a temperature range from −115° to 143°C. —Marc S Lavine Hydrogels consist of cross-linked polymers that are highly swollen with water. Water evaporation or freezing during temperature changes may lead to stiff and brittle hydrogels. We introduce a strategy called “hydro-locking,” which involves immobilizing the water molecules within the polymer network of the hydrogel. This is accomplished by establishing robust connections between water molecules and the polymer by using sulfuric acid. A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C. The strategy works with a range of hydrogels and solutions and may enable the preservation and observation of materials or even living organisms at extreme temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Interference effects are easily seen when light passes through closely spaced slits or bounces off an etched grating. Quantum mechanics dictates that an analogous type of behavior pertains to molecules, not just to light, but molecular interference tends to be harder to discern. Reilly et al . observed that when methane molecules scatter off a gold surface, an interference effect clearly manifests: Certain final rotational states are entirely suppressed depending on their reflection symmetry relationship to the incoming states. —Jake S. Yeston Although the dynamics of collisions between a molecule and a solid surface are ultimately quantum mechanical, decohering effects owing to the large number of interacting degrees of freedom typically obscure the wavelike nature of these events. However, a partial decoupling of internal molecular motion from external degrees of freedom can reveal striking interference effects despite significant momentum exchange between the molecule and the bath of surface vibrations. We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Plant pathogens often release proteins to target host machinery and increase their infection success. McCombe et al . examined the NUDIX family of proteins, which are found in diverse pathogens and target multiple plant species (see the Perspective by Gutjahr). They found that fungal pathogens can use NUDIX proteins to trick plants by disrupting their ability to sense their own inorganic phosphate status. NUDIX proteins hydrolyze inositol pyrophosphate, which is the main phosphate compound monitored by plant cells. If the plant focuses on growth and nutrition, then it may be less able to activate immune responses. —Madeleine Seale Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is essential for life, and plant cells monitor Pi availability by sensing inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) levels. In this work, we describe the hijacking of plant phosphate sensing by a conserved family of Nudix hydrolase effectors from pathogenic Magnaporthe and Colletotrichum fungi. Structural and enzymatic analyses of the Nudix effector family demonstrate that they selectively hydrolyze PP-InsP. Gene deletion experiments of Nudix effectors in Magnaporthe oryzae , Colletotrichum higginsianum , and Colletotrichum graminicola indicate that PP-InsP hydrolysis substantially enhances disease symptoms in diverse pathosystems. Further, we show that this conserved effector family induces phosphate starvation signaling in plants. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism, used by multiple phytopathogenic fungi, that manipulates the highly conserved plant phosphate sensing pathway to exacerbate disease.},

Stress fields that penetrated below the surface of platinum nanoparticles supported on cerium oxide destabilized the nanoparticles and led to a series of transitions between ordered and disordered configurations. —Phil Szuromi Materials functionalities may be associated with atomic-level structural dynamics occurring on the millisecond timescale. However, the capability of electron microscopy to image structures with high spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution is often limited by poor signal-to-noise ratios. With an unsupervised deep denoising framework, we observed metal nanoparticle surfaces (platinum nanoparticles on cerium oxide) in a gas environment with time resolutions down to 10 milliseconds at a moderate electron dose. On this timescale, many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. Stress fields can penetrate below the surface, leading to defect formation and destabilization, thus making the nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with in situ electron microscopy greatly improves spatiotemporal characterization, opening a new window for the exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.},

  abstract     = {Greater use of a pesticide usually has two dynamic and countervailing effects on pest populations: (i) To the extent that susceptibility remains in the population, it reduces that population’s growth (population suppression) or crop damage, and (ii) it selects for resistant genotypes, which can increase future crop damage (resistance selection). Because these effects occur simultaneously, it is challenging to disentangle them in field settings. Economists studying pesticide resistance have theorized that two potential market failures inherent to the problem can work in opposing directions; it is an empirical matter whether farms are over- or underusing a pesticide in any given context, compared to what would be optimal for their collective profits. On page 943 of this issue, Ye et al. ( 1 ) describe the use of transgenic Bacillus thuringus (Bt) corn to provide an important example of how to empirically assess the balance of these market failures in an applied, policy-relevant setting.},

In contrast to polymers that transform between different states when heated or cooled, a hydrogel generally does not undergo polymeric phase transition because of its hydration. However, a change in temperature can evaporate or freeze mobile water molecules within the polymer networks, which modifies the hydrogel’s mechanical properties ( 1 ). This compromises elasticity of a hydrogel and makes it easily breakable. On page 967 of this issue, Zhang et al.

Although plants have evolved innate immune responses against pathogens, 10 to 23% of global crop yield is lost every year to fungal pathogens alone ( 1 ). Plantinteracting microorganisms, including pathogenic fungi, translocate effector proteins into plant cells. These effectors enhance pathogen virulence by directly interfering with the plant immune system or by manipulating other cellular functions. On page 955 of this issue, McCombe et al . ( 2 ) report that the pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (which causes devastating rice blast) and two additional plant disease–causing fungi enhance their pathogenicity by manipulating the plant’s monitoring of phosphate, a phosphorus-containing compound essential for plant growth. The mechanism tricks plants into entering a phosphate starvation response, which alters metabolism but also disrupts immune signaling and responses to infection. These findings represent a mechanism by which fungal pathogens can manipulate plant defense indirectly.},

  abstract     = {Demographic histories of species are rarely straightforward, complicating the ability to determine accurate species relationships. Phylogenetic analyses must often exclude large segments of the genome or require unrealistic amounts of computing time to run, limiting their use at a time when whole genomes are becoming increasingly available. Zhang et al . developed CASTER, a method that can use whole-genome alignments to infer species trees. Using simulations and previously analyzed datasets, the authors showed that CASTER is typically faster and more accurate than other state-of-the-art methods. Given the increasing number of genomes being produced across taxa, methods that can fully incorporate such data, including CASTER, fill an important gap. —Corinne Simonti Genomes contain mosaics of discordant evolutionary histories, challenging the accurate inference of the tree of life. Although genome-wide data are routinely used for discordance-aware phylogenomic analyses, because of modeling and scalability limitations, the current practice leaves out large chunks of genomes. As more high-quality genomes become available, we urgently need discordance-aware methods to infer the tree directly from a multiple genome alignment. In this study, we introduce Coalescence-Aware Alignment-Based Species Tree Estimator (CASTER), a theoretically justified site-based method that eliminates the need to predefine recombination-free loci. CASTER is scalable to hundreds of mammalian whole genomes. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of CASTER in simulations that include recombination and apply CASTER to several biological datasets, showing that its per-site scores can reveal both biological and artifactual patterns of discordance across the genome.},

However, the IPCC’s reported targets are based on the assumption that global net-zero emissions are achieved. Therefore, these CDR targets are reflective of the net-negative CDR required and do not account for the additional CDR that may be needed if it is also used to offset hard-to-abate emissions. To improve transparency, the authors have made the following revisions: (i) They have revised both Fig. 3 and Table 2 to add the total CDR values, alongside the existing net-negative CDR values that they have reported. (ii) They have added a description in the section “Contribution to CDR targets in mitigation scenarios” to clarify the distinction between net-negative CDR targets and total CDR targets.

Barnett et al . designed experiments in which lineages of bacteria cycled between two selective environments (see the Perspective by Kussell). In response to changing conditions, a multistep evolutionary dynamic emerged in which selection first acts to elevate transcription rates at a single regulatory gene. An increase in frameshift mutations occurs at the same locus that also allows hitchhiking of secondary, possibly adaptive mutations. This phenomenon provides an evolutionary mechanism for increasing the capacity for evolvability toward specific adaptive outcomes. —Caroline Ash Evolvability—the capacity to generate adaptive variation—is a trait that can itself evolve through natural selection. However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.},

Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA.

The product of the recently identified PD-risk gene FAM171A2 was found to be the neuronal receptor for α-synuclein fibrils, mediating their internalization through endocytosis. In silico screening identified an approved drug, bemcentinib, that is able to inhibit α-synuclein internalization in vitro and in vivo by blocking its binding to FAM171A2. The results provide insights into PD pathogenesis and identify a potential therapeutic target. —Mattia Maroso Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified FAM171A2 as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with >1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2–α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice.

  abstract     = {Most chemical reactions that manipulate carbon centers change just one or two bonds at a time. Recently, a reagent with carbon sandwiched between phosphorus and nitrogen proved adept at releasing the carbon atom alone to form four new bonds. However, these reactions tended to produce linear, triple-bonded molecules as products. Sun et al . now report that upon swapping out the phosphorus for sulfur, the carbon transfer reactivity shifted to deliver three-dimensional products with four single bonds. Reactions with successive olefins produced a range of strained spiro compounds that are otherwise challenging to access. —Jake S. Yeston The introduction of a single C-atom into organic substrates typically results in the formation of flat molecules containing unsaturated C(sp)-centers. Adding a single C(sp 3 )-atom surrounded by four σ-C–C bonds, which opens up the three-dimensional space, is an unresolved problem in synthetic chemistry. We report the synthesis and application of the diazosulfur ylide Ph 2 S=C=N 2 reagent that combines the reactivity of both sulfur ylides and diazo compounds to create carbon spiro-centers in a general fashion by the sequential or single-step installation of a C(sp 3 )-atom. New C–C and C–X (where X is O or N) bonds can be created around the C(sp 3 )-atom, which can ultimately be extended to four C–C σ-bonds in one step without resorting to transition metal catalysis. Ph 2 SCN 2 can also be used to access highly strained frameworks containing (oxa)spiro[2.2]pentanes as well as tricyclic spiro-compounds.},

  abstract     = {One vision for robotics is to design groups of simple robots that work together, for example, like a colony of ants that can move like a flowing fluid but can also form a solid structure such as a bridge for an unpassable span. Devlin et al . designed a robot collective that can switch between a “fluidizing” state and a solid state based on the rotational state of the robot. Drawing from embryonic morphogenesis, the authors identified three important components of the biological process, interunit force, polarization, and adhesion, and developed their robotic counterparts. These elements enable locally tunable mechanical properties that can be exploited to change the collective’s shape and strength. —Marc S. Lavine The vision of robotic materials—cohesive collectives of robotic units that can arrange into virtually any form with any physical properties—has long intrigued both science and fiction. Yet, this vision requires a fundamental physical challenge to be overcome: The collective must be strong, to support loads, yet flow, to take new forms. We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.},

  abstract     = {Most current plastic-recycling methods rely on macroscopic mechanical shredding, cleaning, and reprocessing. As a result, the properties of the recycled material degrade relative to the virgin polymer. Chemical decomposition to the original monomer would enable more thorough purification and then repolymerization to restore ideal performance. Wang et al . report the surprising discovery that in dichlorobenzene solvent, violet light irradiation can cleanly break down polymethacrylates such as plexiglass to their original monomers. The process appears to involve hydrogen abstraction from the backbone by small quantities of chlorine radicals liberated from the solvent. —Jake S. Yeston The reversion of vinyl polymers with carbon-carbon backbones to their monomers represents an ideal path to alleviate the growing plastic waste stream. However, depolymerizing such stable materials remains a challenge, with state-of-the-art methods relying on “designer” polymers that are neither commercially produced nor suitable for real-world applications. In this work, we report a main chain–initiated, visible light–triggered depolymerization directly applicable to commercial polymers containing undisclosed impurities (e.g., comonomers, additives, or dyes). By in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the solvent, near-quantitative (>98%) depolymerization of polymethacrylates could be achieved regardless of their synthetic route (e.g., radical or ionic polymerization), end group, and molecular weight (up to 1.6 million daltons). The possibility to perform multigram-scale depolymerizations and confer temporal control renders this methodology a versatile and general route to recycling.},

  abstract     = {Traces of nickel can increase the selectivity of supported silver ethylene epoxidation catalysts to levels comparable to that of added alkyl chloride promoters. Theoretical studies by Jalil et al . showed that nickel dopants on silver could activate molecular oxygen, and surface science experiments showed that nickel could stabilize nucleophilic oxygen that would otherwise react unselectively. Parts per million addition of nickel enhanced selectivity by 25%, and added chlorine could also boost the effect of nickel by an additional 10%. —Phil Szuromi Over the last 80 years, chlorine (Cl) has been the primary promoter of the ethylene epoxidation reaction valued at ~40 billion USD per year, providing a ~25% selectivity increase over unpromoted silver (Ag) (~55%). Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.},

  abstract     = {Laser-based additive manufacturing of metals is a complex process that often leads to the introduction of voids through what are called keyhole instabilities. Fan et al . sought to understand how this pore-forming process is modified with magnetic fields using high-speed x-ray imaging. They found that a flow driven by the thermoelectric effect can either improve or degrade keyhole formation depending on the direction of the field. These observations reveal one way to modulate the formation of pores, which is important for controlling the mechanical properties of the alloy. —Marc S. Lavine Keyhole instability during laser welding and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can cause keyhole collapse and pore formation. Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.},

Using measurements made with fiber-optic cables, Fichtner et al . report observations of brittle deformation in the Greenland Ice Sheet that reveal a nonviscous flow mechanism caused by englacial ice quake cascades. This effect should help to reconcile results from current ice sheet models and observations. —Jesse Smith Ice streams are major regulators of sea level change. However, standard viscous flow simulations of their evolution have limited predictive power owing to incomplete understanding of involved processes. On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric coolers are attractive because they have no moving parts and may be more efficient than coolers based on vapor compression. However, one challenge with these materials is manufacturing them so that they do not degrade in their thermoelectric efficiency. Xu et al . developed bismuth antimony telluride and silver selenide inks for extrusion printing that avoid degradation in properties after sintering (see the Perspective by Perren and Yarema). Careful choices for the binders in the inks resulted in a printed thermoelectric device capable of generating a 50°C gradient with a good coefficient of performance. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are pivotal in modern heat management but face limitations in efficiency and manufacturing scalability. We address these challenges by using an extrusion-based 3D printing technique to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials. Our ink formulations ensure the integrity of the 3D-printed structure and effective particle bonding during sintering, achieving record-high figure of merit ( zT ) values of 1.42 for p-type bismuth antimony telluride [(Bi,Sb) 2 Te 3 ] and 1.3 for n-type silver selenide (Ag 2 Se) materials at room temperature. The resulting TEC demonstrates a cooling temperature gradient of 50°C in air. Moreover, this scalable and cost-effective method circumvents energy-intensive and time-consuming steps, such as ingot preparation and subsequently machining processes, offering a transformative solution for thermoelectric device production and heralding a new era of efficient and sustainable thermoelectric technologies.},

However, with the demand for precision and fidelity of computational models continuing to grow, HPC faces bottlenecks in data handling, algorithm efficiency, and the scalability of new architectures, especially in fields such as chemistry and biology, where molecular simulations increasingly strain hardware and software limits. Governments worldwide are heavily investing in HPC infrastructure to support research, industrial innovation, and national security, each adopting distinct approaches shaped by national interests and regulatory landscapes. Conversely, in the US, there is no long-term plan or comprehensive vision for the next era of HPC advancements, leaving the future trajectory of US HPC and scientific and technological leadership uncertain.},

Humans are not alone in this instinct. Animals as diverse as elephants [ Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis ( 2 )], chimpanzees [ Pan troglodytes ( 3 )], and dolphins [ Tursiops truncatus ( 4 )] can recognize and intervene by touching, nudging, and even carrying an incapacitated individual. On pages 843 and 842 of this issue, Sun et al. ( 5 ) and Sun et al. ( 6 ), respectively, provide information on the neurobiology underlying this impulse. They report that mice ( Mus musculus ) have an instinct to revive an unresponsive mouse and identify two distinct brain regions that are crucial for this behavior. These findings add to the evidence that an impulse to help others in states of extreme distress is shared by many species and highlight neural mechanisms that drive instinctive rescue.},

For energy technologies such as thermoelectric cooling, however, 3D printing is notably less integrated because of the intricate specifications required of functional semiconductors. Characteristics of a material, such as charge carrier mobility, level of impurities (dopants), and microstructural defects, as well as surface and interfacial properties, must be precisely engineered to achieve desired performance. 3D printed semiconductor devices often demonstrate lesser performance compared to their thin-film counterparts because of imperfections in the functional layer that are introduced during printing ( 2 , 3 ). On page 845 of this issue, Xu et al. ( 4 ) report additive manufacturing of a thermoelectric cooler with a cooling efficiency surpassing that of existing devices. This demonstrates potential use of 3D printing for large-scale production of semiconductor devices.},

  abstract     = {Evolvability, or the capacity to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, can itself evolve in response to selection ( 1 ). Species that evolve too slowly may be unable to adapt to environmental change and are more likely to go extinct than faster-evolving species. Yet what it takes to get evolvability to evolve, in nature or in the lab, has remained puzzling. For example, many generations might be needed for natural selection to change a species’ ability to adapt. Higher evolvability can result in lower heritability, a cornerstone of natural selection’s ability to act, and the same degree of evolvability might not suit all traits equally. On page 840 of this issue, Barnett et al. ( 2 ) describe how experimental evolution can yield increased evolvability by localized hypermutation in populations of bacteria exposed to an alternating selection regime, akin to the regularly fluctuating conditions that pathogenic bacteria experience moving from one host to another.},

ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to alignment to improve its fidelity. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins.

By comparing the enzymatic and solution reaction, we identified molecular features that provide catalysis and quantified their energetic contributions to catalysis. Serine proteases precisely position their reactants in destabilized conformers, creating a downhill energetic gradient that selectively favors the motions required for reaction while limiting off-pathway conformational states. The same catalytic features have repeatedly evolved in proteases and additional enzymes across multiple distinct structural folds.

  abstract     = {CD8 T cells within a population responding to signs of disease can form several discrete states with distinct functional properties. Fagerberg et al . combined CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing with single-cell RNA sequencing to examine how the deletion of genes in mouse T cells affected the formation of these different states during immune responses. The transcription factor KLF2 was required to maintain the availability of cells with the potential to form functional effectors and suppressed cells from acquiring an exhausted phenotype after infection with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. In the context of tumors, KLF2 expression was linked to maintaining stem-like T cells and limiting terminal dysfunction. — Sarah H. Ross Naïve CD8 T cells have the potential to differentiate into a spectrum of functional states during an immune response. How these developmental decisions are made and what mechanisms exist to suppress differentiation toward alternative fates remains unclear. We employed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9–based perturbation sequencing to assess the role of ~40 transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators in T cell fate decisions. Unexpectedly, we found that knockout of the TF Klf2 resulted in aberrant differentiation to exhausted-like CD8 T cells during acute infection. KLF2 was required to suppress the exhaustion-promoting TF TOX and to enable the TF TBET to drive effector differentiation. KLF2 was also necessary to maintain a polyfunctional tumor-specific progenitor state. Thus, KLF2 provides effector CD8 T cell lineage fidelity and suppresses the exhaustion program.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction, the anodic process in commercial electrochemical hydrogen production, is often constrained by the durability of catalysts, especially under acidic conditions. By controlling the nucleation of iridium nanocatalysts on a continuously ripening cerium oxide support through sonication and thermal treatment, Shi et al . effectively embedded the nanocatalysts within the oxide matrix. This approach prevents nanocatalysts from detaching and agglomerating during operation, yielding exceptional efficiency and ultrastable performance (see the Perspective by Pendergast and Boettcher). Moreover, the strategy is adaptable to other compound systems, opening avenues for the development of additional high-performance catalysts. —Jack Huang The future deployment of terawatt-scale proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technology necessitates development of an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst with low cost and long lifetime. Currently, the stability of the most active iridium (Ir) catalysts is impaired by dissolution, redeposition, detachment, and agglomeration of Ir species. Here we present a ripening-induced embedding strategy that securely embeds the Ir catalyst in a cerium oxide support. Cryogenic electron tomography and all-atom kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that synchronizing the growth rate of the support with the nucleation rate of Ir, regulated by sonication, is pivotal for successful synthesis. A PEMWE using this catalyst achieves a cell voltage of 1.72 volts at a current density of 3 amperes per square centimeter with an Ir loading of just 0.3 milligrams per square centimeter and a voltage degradation rate of 1.33 microvolts per hour, as demonstrated by a 6000-hour accelerated aging test.},

  abstract     = {Plasmonics offers a route to shrink light wavelengths down to the nanoscale using collective electronic excitations. Intuitively, highly conducting metals are the materials of choice, providing for long plasmon lifetime. Ruta et al . looked at the so-called “bad metal” molybdenum oxide dichloride, in which electronic correlations give rise to high resistivity. Surprisingly, they observed plasmons with very long lifetimes. The unexpected finding of long-lifetime plasmons may provide a route to expanding the choice of materials for nanophotonic applications. —Ian S. Osborne Correlated metals may exhibit unusually high resistivity that increases linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies have suggested that plasmons are overdamped, whereas other studies have detected propagating plasmons. In this work, we present direct nano-optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl 2 . HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl 2 . Photoemission data presented here reveal a highly anisotropic Fermi surface, reconstructed and made partly incoherent, likely through electronic interactions as explained by many-body theory. HPPs remain long-lived despite this, revealing previously unseen imprints of many-body effects on plasmonic collective modes.},

This approach allowed them to conclude that the median US stream network is six times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. —Jesse Smith The aggregate length of flowing streams in a drainage network lengthens and shortens as landscapes become wetter and drier. However, direct measurements of stream network variability have been limited to a handful of small drainage basins. We estimated the variability of stream network length for 14,765 gauged basins across the contiguous United States using measured streamflow distributions and topography-based estimates of how sensitive each stream network is to changing landscape wetness (the network’s elasticity). We find that the median US stream network is five times longer during annual high-flow conditions than during annual low-flow conditions. Stream networks are more dynamic in some regions than in others, driven by regional differences in both hydroclimatology and the networks’ elasticity in response to hydroclimatic forcing.},

Shen et al . prepared molybdenum disulfide membranes by aligning seeds along the 60-degree grain boundaries (also known as mirror twin boundaries) during the chemical vapor deposition process to form eight-membered ring pores. The physical size of the intrinsic eight-membered rings allows only water molecules to pass through while blocking a wide range of hydrated ions due to their larger size. The performance can be tuned by controlling the density of the eight-membered rings. Optimized membranes demonstrate both ultrahigh water-to-sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. —Marc S. Lavine Two-dimensional (2D) materials have long been considered as ideal platforms for developing separation membranes. However, it is difficult to generate uniform subnanometer pores over large areas on 2D materials. We report that the well-defined eight-membered ring (8-MR) pores, typically formed at the boundaries of two antiparallel grains of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), can serve as molecular sieves for efficient water-ion separation. The density of grain boundaries and, consequently, the number of 8-MR pores can be tuned by regulating the grain size. Optimized MoS 2 membranes outperformed the state-of-the-art membranes in forward osmosis tests by demonstrating both ultrahigh water/sodium chloride selectivity and exceptional water permeance. Creating precise pore structures on atomically thin films through grain boundary engineering presents a promising route for producing membranes suitable for various applications.},

Using foraging patterns and success linked to ocean conditions, the authors were able to successfully hindcast twilight zone fish abundance. Such hindcasting success facilitated future predictions. Elephant seals can thus provide insight into how this hidden but essential system responds to external changes. —Sacha Vignieri The open ocean twilight zone holds most of the global fish biomass but is poorly understood owing to difficulties of measuring subsurface ecosystem processes at scale. We demonstrate that a wide-ranging carnivore—the northern elephant seal—can serve as an ecosystem sentinel for the twilight zone. We link ocean basin–scale foraging success with oceanographic indices to estimate twilight zone fish abundance five decades into the past, and into the future. We discovered that a small variation in maternal foraging success amplified into larger changes in offspring body mass and enormous variation in first-year survival and recruitment.

The authors found that only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was replenished by a very wet 2023.

We tracked two-decadal changes in groundwater in Greater Los Angeles using seismic ambient-field interferometry. The derived seismic hydrographs reveal distinct expressions of groundwater and surficial water droughts: Whereas surface and near-surface water storage nearly fully recovered in the epic wet season of 2023, only about 25% of the groundwater lost since 2006 was restored.

It is unclear why sugar appetite is selectively stimulated in satiety states. Minère et al . found that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons from the arcuate nucleus send projections to the paraventricular thalamus. Unlike most other POMC neuron projections, these do not release α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone. Rather, they produce the appetite-stimulating opioid β⁠-endorphin, which selectively inhibits postsynaptic neurons in the paraventricular thalamus expressing µ-opioid receptors, and this drives sugar consumption in the fed state (see the Perspective by Farooqi). Blocking this opioid transmission could thus reduce sugar intake and potentially combat binge eating and obesity. —Peter Stern High sugar–containing foods are readily consumed, even after meals and beyond fullness sensation (e.g., as desserts). Although reward-driven processing of palatable foods can promote overeating, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the selective appetite for sugar in states of satiety remain unclear. Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are principal regulators of satiety because they decrease food intake through excitatory melanocortin neuropeptides. We discovered that POMC neurons not only promote satiety in fed conditions but concomitantly switch on sugar appetite, which drives overconsumption. POMC neuron projections to the paraventricular thalamus selectively inhibited postsynaptic neurons through mu-opioid receptor signaling. This opioid circuit was strongly activated during sugar consumption, which was most notable in satiety states. Correspondingly, inhibiting its activity diminished high-sugar diet intake in sated mice.},

  abstract     = {Cancer often exhibits genome-wide hypertranscription, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain unclear. To understand how increased transcription might contribute to cancer progression, Henikoff et al . investigated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity across different tumor types. Mapping RNAPII activity across the whole genome in tumor and normal tissues, the authors found widespread transcriptional changes. They also discovered that RNAPII occupancy at histone genes correlated with tumor aggressiveness, particularly in meningiomas and breast cancers. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes predicted rapid cancer recurrence and corresponded to chromosome losses, suggesting that histone gene hypertranscription may drive overproliferation and genomic instability in cancer. —Di Jiang Genome-wide hypertranscription is common in human cancer and predicts poor prognosis. To understand how hypertranscription might drive cancer, we applied our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)–cleavage under targeted accessible chromatin method for mapping RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) genome-wide in FFPE sections. We demonstrate global RNAPII elevations in mouse gliomas and assorted human tumors in small clinical samples and discover regional elevations corresponding to de novo HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps. RNAPII occupancy at S-phase-dependent histone genes correlated with WHO grade in meningiomas, accurately predicted rapid recurrence, and corresponded to whole-arm chromosome losses. Elevated RNAPII at histone genes in meningiomas and diverse breast cancers is consistent with histone production being rate-limiting for S-phase progression and histone gene hypertranscription driving overproliferation and aneuploidy in cancer, with general implications for precision oncology.},

These metals are central to the development of a green-energy economy (2). However, deep-sea mining disrupts marine ecosystems and could reduce marine carbon sequestration. India should not expand its mining activities until its effects on deep-sea biodiversity, and deep-sea species’ effects on carbon sequestration, are better understood.},

These off-site damages may be less than on-site gains—in which case the action is still beneficial but less so than it superficially seems. However, if activities are displaced to more biodiverse (or less productive) places, leakage impacts may exceed local benefits, so that well-intentioned efforts cause net harm. There is a pressing need for leakage effects like this to be acknowledged and as far as possible avoided or mitigated—through demand reduction, careful selection of conservation or restoration sites, or compensatory increases in production in lower-impact areas.},

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are the highest-performing commercialized technology ( 1 ). These devices split water into oxygen gas and hydrogen ions (protons) at the anode. The protons then migrate through an ion-conducting polymer membrane (ionomer) to be reduced to hydrogen gas at the cathode. The anode reaction’s harsh environment requires the use of precious-metal catalysts, such as iridium oxide (IrO x ). Given the expense and scarcity, the design of electrodes that minimize the use of precious metals without compromising the requisite stability and activity is desired for large-scale hydrogen production ( 2 , 3 ). On page 791 of this issue, Shi et al. ( 4 ) report that anchoring IrO x catalysts onto porous cerium-oxide (CeO x ) supports maintains performance even with much reduced precious metal use.},

  abstract     = {Overeating is a major cause of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers ( 1 ). Although in many societies, readily available, cheap foods promote overconsumption, the sensory properties of food also influence the amount and type of food eaten. Sensory-specific satiety (fullness) describes the decline in pleasantness of a food as it is eaten, relative to uneaten foods that have different sensory qualities—for example, the desire for a sweet dessert after a meal ( 2 ). However, the neural mechanisms that mediate this preference for sweet food are incompletely understood. On page 750 of this issue, Minère et al . ( 3 ) report a neural circuit that regulates the preference for sweet food after the consumption of a standard meal in mice ( Mus musculus ). This circuit is formed by neurons that project from the hypothalamus to the paraventricular thalamus, a region involved in sensing pleasantness and driving motivated behaviors. This work advances understanding of the drive to eat sweet food when already full.},

Unsustainable groundwater use can have detrimental effects such as aquifer depletion, loss of storage capacity, chemical and waste contamination, saltwater intrusion, and rapid land subsidence. Thus, it is essential to accurately track changes in the distribution of groundwater to manage the use and replenishment of these water systems below Earth’s surface. However, conventional groundwater measurements are limited in their ability to map out the spatiotemporal state of aquifers, which makes it challenging to track groundwater storage. On page 758 of this issue, Mao et al . ( 1 ) report how groundwater storage distribution can be monitored in both space and time through measurements of seismic ground vibrations or noise.

Large-scale genome engineering methods effective in model organisms are frequently inapplicable, and systematic studies of gene function are few. We generated more than 175,000 transposon insertions in the Plasmodium knowlesi genome, averaging an insertion every 138 base pairs, and used this “supersaturation” mutagenesis to score essentiality for 98% of genes. The density of mutations allowed mapping of putative essential domains within genes, providing a completely new level of genome annotation for any Plasmodium species. Although gene essentiality was largely conserved across P. knowlesi , Plasmodium falciparum , and rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei , a large number of shared genes are differentially essential, revealing species-specific adaptations. Our results indicated that Plasmodium essential gene evolution was conditionally linked to adaptive rewiring of metabolic networks for different hosts.},

To help address this problem in a comprehensive way, Liu et al . compiled a massive resource consisting of genetic data on more than 2 million human patients and detailed examination of the kidneys for hundreds of individuals, with a subset studied at single-cell precision. In addition to identifying a multitude of genetic variants that contribute to various types of kidney disease, the authors have devised a genetic scorecard to assist in the identification of additional relevant genes, cell types, and potential therapeutic targets. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Kidney dysfunction is a major cause of mortality, but its genetic architecture remains elusive. In this study, we conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study in 2.2 million individuals and identified 1026 (97 previously unknown) independent loci. Ancestry-specific analysis indicated an attenuation of newly identified signals on common variants in European ancestry populations and the power of population diversity for further discoveries. We defined genotype effects on allele-specific gene expression and regulatory circuitries in more than 700 human kidneys and 237,000 cells. We found 1363 coding variants disrupting 782 genes, with 601 genes also targeted by regulatory variants and convergence in 161 genes. Integrating 32 types of genetic information, we present the “Kidney Disease Genetic Scorecard” for prioritizing potentially causal genes, cell types, and druggable targets for kidney disease.},

  abstract     = {The sequence composition, chromatin structure, and transcriptional activity of a genome reflect billions of years of evolution. The introduction of foreign DNA, which can differ substantially from the host genome, often perturbs this evolutionary process. Meneu et al . have shown that, depending on their GC content, large DNA sequences from bacteria and eukaryotes introduced into budding yeast either mingle with other active yeast chromosomes or segregate into an inactive globular compartment (see the Perspective by Fudenberg and Ramani). This spontaneous segregation requires active transcription of the host genome, which is accurately predicted by the underlying DNA sequence. This suggests that chromatin compartmentalization emerged from acquired genomic sequence diversity. —Di Jiang In eukaryotes, DNA-associated protein complexes coevolve with genomic sequences to orchestrate chromatin folding. We investigate the relationship between DNA sequence and the spontaneous loading and activity of chromatin components in the absence of coevolution. Using bacterial genomes integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which diverged from yeast more than 2 billion years ago, we show that nucleosomes, cohesins, and associated transcriptional machinery can lead to the formation of two different chromatin archetypes, one transcribed and the other silent, independently of heterochromatin formation. These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome. They do not mix in the nucleus, leading to a bipartite nuclear compartmentalization, reminiscent of the organization of vertebrate nuclei.},

  abstract     = {It has been proposed that one of the many functions of the sensory cortex is to modify the vigor of instinctive responses by modulation of subcortical circuits. Mederos et al . uncovered a subcortical synaptic plasticity mechanism for learning to suppress instinctive defensive behavior. The critical pathway was the projection from higher-order visual areas posterolateral of the primary visual cortex (area V1) to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), which modulated instinctive fear responses based on experience. After learning, this pathway was no longer needed. This learning-induced plasticity involved endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of inhibitory synapses onto vLGN neurons activated by posterolateral higher-order visual areas, which decreased presynaptic release probability. —Peter Stern Fast instinctive responses to environmental stimuli can be crucial for survival but are not always optimal. Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.},

  abstract     = {Insulin resistance, often induced by obesity, is the underlying abnormality for type 2 diabetes. Most studies looking at mechanisms for obesity and insulin resistance have examined cells known to play key roles in metabolism, such as those in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Cho et al . shifted their focus to the vasculature, more specifically, endothelial insulin signaling. The authors discovered that adrenomedullin, a peptide hormone that increases in concentration in the setting of obesity, inhibits insulin signaling in the endothelium of both humans and mice. In addition to examining the underlying mechanism, the authors showed in mouse models that an adrenomedullin receptor antagonist has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, suggesting a potential direction for future therapeutic approaches. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Insulin resistance is a hallmark of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. Insulin’s actions go beyond metabolic cells and also involve blood vessels, where insulin increases capillary blood flow and delivery of insulin and nutrients. We show that adrenomedullin, whose plasma levels are increased in obese humans and mice, inhibited insulin signaling in human endothelial cells through protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B–mediated dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor. In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance. Endothelial loss or blockade of the adrenomedullin receptor improved obesity-induced insulin resistance. These findings identify a mechanism underlying obesity-induced systemic insulin resistance and suggest approaches to treat obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract     = {In a heterogeneous soil landscape, plant root systems must locate water. Scharwies et al . found that some maize varieties produce lateral roots at locations where water is limited, whereas others more efficiently direct growth toward water. Uncovering the genetic basis for this trait variance, the authors found that auxin, ethylene, and an arabinogalactan protein work together to encourage lateral root development where water is present while suppressing lateral roots from forming on drier parts of the root. Variation in genes underlying these components leads to variation in root hydropatterning, potentially affecting the success of some maize varieties in drier environments. —Madeleine Seale Plants grow complex root systems to extract unevenly distributed resources from soils. Spatial differences in soil moisture are perceived by root tips, leading to the patterning of new root branches toward available water in a process called hydropatterning. Little is known about hydropatterning behavior and its genetic basis in crop plants. Here, we developed an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and revealed substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection. Genetic analysis of hydropatterning confirmed the regulatory role of auxin and revealed that the gaseous hormone ethylene locally inhibits root branching from air-exposed tissues. Our results demonstrate how distinct signaling pathways translate spatial patterns of water availability to developmental programs that determine root architecture.},

  abstract     = {The mantis shrimp is known for its ability to rapidly and forcefully strike its prey, both directly and due to the rapid collapse of cavitation bubbles, without sustaining significant damage. Much of this ability has been attributed to the complex multiscale organization of the structure of the shrimp’s dactyl club and its resultant mechanical properties. Alderete et al . used fast spectroscopy techniques to disclose the effect of the club structure in terms of its phononic shielding abilities (see the Perspective by Zavattieri), showing that it can effectively filter shear waves to mitigate impact forces during strikes. —Marc S. Lavine The powerful strikes generated by the smasher mantis shrimp require it to possess a robust protection mechanism to withstand the resultant forces. Although recent studies have suggested that phononic bandgaps complement the mantis shrimp’s defensive suite, direct experimental evidence for this mechanism has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range. These features effectively shield the shrimp from harmful high-frequency stress waves generated by cavitation bubble collapse events during impact.},

This distribution pertains to the frequency of relative word use and is believed to reflect cultural transmission of language. This pattern has also been found in infants during the beginnings of language production. The approach used to study these preverbal patterns allows for the study of songs and calls in other species. Arnon et al . used this approach to study humpback whale song collected over 8 years (see the Perspective by Whiten and Youngblood). They found clear evidence of a Zipf distribution in this song, as well as other hallmarks of human language such as statistical coherence and brevity of subsequences. —Sacha Vignieri Humpback whale song is a culturally transmitted behavior. Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law. These properties facilitate learning and may therefore arise because of their contribution to the faithful transmission of language over multiple cultural generations. If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry and topology of physical systems are closely related to the symmetries governing the topological properties. Quasicrystals are ordered systems but have no translation or rotational symmetries. Theoretical work has shown that quasicrystals can be understood as the projection of a higher-dimensional crystal onto a lower-dimensional space. Tsesses et al . developed a plasmonic-based system in which to study the implications of that projection for topological invariants. When going into four-dimensional space and projecting it down into two dimensions, the complex dynamics of light waves on the plasmonic quasicrystal exhibited motions of four-dimensional topological charge vectors and associated topological charge conservation laws. This approach allows the study of topological systems in higher dimensions. — Ian S. Osborne According to Noether’s theorem, symmetries in a physical system are intertwined with conserved quantities. These symmetries often determine the system topology, which is made ever more complex with increased dimensionality. Quasicrystals have neither translational nor global rotational symmetry, yet they intrinsically inhabit a higher-dimensional space in which symmetry resurfaces. Here, we discovered topological charge vectors in four dimensions (4D) that govern the real-space topology of 2D quasicrystals and reveal their inherent conservation laws. We demonstrate control over the topology in pentagonal plasmonic quasilattices, mapped by both phase-resolved and time-domain near-field microscopy, showing that their temporal evolution continuously tunes the 2D projections of their distinct 4D topologies. Our work provides a route to experimentally probe the thermodynamic properties of quasicrystals and topological physics in 4D and above.},

  abstract     = {Under current nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, global warming is projected to reach 2.7°C above preindustrial levels. In this review, we show that at such a level of warming, the Arctic would be transformed beyond contemporary recognition: Virtually every day of the year would have air temperatures higher than preindustrial extremes, the Arctic Ocean would be essentially ice free for several months in summer, the area of Greenland that reaches melting temperatures for at least a month would roughly quadruple, and the area of permafrost would be roughly half of what it was in preindustrial times. These geophysical changes go along with widespread ecosystem disruptions and infrastructure damage, which, as we show here, could be substantially reduced by increased efforts to limit global warming.},

  abstract     = {Antarctica harbors many distinctive features of life, yet much about the diversity and functioning of Antarctica’s life remains unknown. Evolutionary histories and functional ecology are well understood only for vertebrates, whereas research on invertebrates is largely limited to species descriptions and some studies on environmental tolerances. Knowledge on Antarctic vegetation cover showcases the challenges of characterizing population trends for most groups. Recent community-level microbial studies have provided insights into the functioning of life at its limits. Overall, biotic interactions remain largely unknown across all groups, restricted to basic information on trophic level placement. Insufficient knowledge of many groups limits the understanding of ecological processes on the continent. Remedies for the current situation rely on identifying the caveats of each ecological discipline and finding targeted solutions. Such precise delimitation of knowledge gaps will enable a more aware, representative, and strategic systematic conservation planning of Antarctica.},

Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.},

In the Arctic, as in the rest of the world, these issues are complex, interconnected, and compounding each other. In what follows, we elaborate on three central issues: current scientific understanding of the regional and global impacts of Arctic climate change, ensuring that Arctic research addresses the needs of Arctic peoples and communities, and the importance of sustaining Arctic cooperation in challenging geopolitical times.},

Sung only by males, the songs penetrate the ocean for many miles and are suspected to attract females for mating through their musical complexity. Year by year, the songs may become more complex and perhaps more alluring to females. However, in the southwestern Pacific, a totally new song emerges every few years that is adopted across the ocean ( 2 ). The rapidity with which new songs and variations are copied demonstrates that they are culturally transmitted, but the evolutionary forces that shape the complex song structures over time have remained mysterious. On page 649 of this issue, Arnon et al . ( 3 ) report that fundamental laws identified in quantitative linguistics and in the culturally evolved learnability of human languages apply to whale song.},

Evolutionary contingency constrains relationships between genome sequence, organization, and function. However, technologies for engineering ever-larger stretches of DNA now enable synthetic regulatory reconstitution experiments ( 2 – 4 ) in which foreign DNA, freed from historical contingency, can be placed directly into a host cell. Such “in hostia” reconstitutions complement classic in vitro approaches for determining the rules of genomic regulation. Notably, in hostia reconstitutions assess the regulatory “ground state” of a host cellular environment—that is, the propensity for inserted DNA to be active or silent. On page 627 of this issue, Meneu et al. ( 5 ) describe what happens when bacterial DNA is introduced into yeast cell nuclei as synthetic chromosomes. The spontaneous formation of active or inactive chromatin, dependent on sequence composition of the exogenous chromosomes, has implications for synthetic chromosome design.},

This effect is useful for technologies such as acoustic imaging, acoustic cloaking, shock proofing, and energy harvesting. Architected metamaterials are artificially made; does a similar phenomenon exist in nature? On page 659 of this issue, Alderete et al.

  abstract     = {Optical-frequency combs and dual-comb spectroscopy have already been shown to enable high-resolution spectroscopy. Herman et al . have now taken dual-comb spectroscopy to the quantum regime, demonstrating the metrological advantage of using quantum mechanically squeezed light in optical-frequency combs. Dual-frequency comb spectroscopy using squeezed light enhances the sensitivity of molecular detection, in this case for hydrogen sulfide, with the quantum noise reduction leading to a twofold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration. This approach will motivate further development using squeezed states for frequency comb metrology, high-resolution spectroscopy, and sensing applications. —Ian S. Osborne Optical frequency combs have enabled distinct advantages in broadband, high-resolution spectroscopy and precision interferometry. However, quantum mechanics ultimately limits the metrological precision achievable with laser frequency combs. Quantum squeezing has led to substantial measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers, but experiments demonstrating metrological advantage with squeezed combs are less developed. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, a 1-gigahertz frequency comb centered at 1560 nanometers is amplitude-squeezed by >3 decibels (dB) over a 2.5-terahertz bandwidth. Dual-comb interferometry yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio nearly 3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit. The quantum noise reduction leads to a twofold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with implications for high-speed measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.},

To address these challenges, we developed Genome-Shuffle-seq, a method that enables the multiplex generation and mapping of thousands of SVs (deletions, inversions, translocations, and extrachromosomal circles) throughout mammalian genomes. We also demonstrate the co-capture of SV identity with single-cell transcriptomes, facilitating the measurement of SV impact on gene expression.

Liu et al . found that ablating itch-sensing neurons or physically preventing scratching decreased the inflammation associated with antigen-dependent mast cell responses in response to chemicals that induce allergic immune responses (see the Perspective by Ver Heul). Scratching promoted pain-sensing neurons to release a neuropeptide that stimulated mast cells, and this peptide hormone synergized with antigen-dependent activation to increase the mast cell’s degranulation and ability to produce inflammatory mediators. In a model of skin infection associated with antigen-specific mast cell responses, scratching contributed to decreasing the bacterial load. —Sarah H. Ross Itch is a dominant symptom in dermatitis, and scratching promotes cutaneous inflammation, thereby worsening disease. However, the mechanisms through which scratching exacerbates inflammation and whether scratching provides benefit to the host are largely unknown. We found that scratching was required for skin inflammation in mouse models dependent on FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. Scratching-induced inflammation required pain-sensing nociceptors, the neuropeptide substance P, and the mast cell receptor MrgprB2. Scratching also increased cutaneous inflammation and augmented host defense to superficial Staphylococcus aureus infection. Thus, through the activation of nociceptor-driven neuroinflammation, scratching both exacerbated allergic skin disease and provided protection from S. aureus , reconciling the seemingly paradoxical role of scratching as a pathological process and evolutionary adaptation.},

Ray et al . monitored fruit bats within a naturalistic environment and found that neurons in the hippocampus also coded for distinct individuals, including their sex, rank, location, and unique identity. Thus, the hippocampus creates not only an individual’s cognitive map, but also a complex map of their social environment. —Sacha Vignieri Social animals live in groups and interact volitionally in complex ways. However, little is known about neural responses under such natural conditions. Here, we investigated hippocampal CA1 neurons in a mixed-sex group of five to 10 freely behaving wild Egyptian fruit bats that lived continuously in a laboratory-based cave and formed a stable social network. In-flight, most hippocampal place cells were socially modulated and represented the identity and sex of conspecifics. Upon social interactions, neurons represented specific interaction types. During active observation, neurons encoded the bat’s own position and head direction, together with the position, direction, and identity of multiple conspecifics. Identity-coding neurons encoded the same bat across contexts. The strength of identity coding was modulated by sex, hierarchy, and social affiliation. Thus, hippocampal neurons form a multidimensional sociospatial representation of the natural world.},

Little is known about the mechanisms governing the production of replay or the selection of specific sequences. Mallory et al . recorded large numbers of replay events in rats exploring multiple environments (see the Perspective by Takigawa and Bendor). After a pause in exploration, replay actively avoided the animal’s most recent path for about 3 seconds and instead depicted future possibilities. Replay avoided not just recently traversed, but also recently reactivated paths. Cells that were recently active could not participate in replay for some period. Inactivation of medial entorhinal cortex eliminated the window of past preference that was typically observed later in the stopping period. These findings have implications for episodic memory retrieval during a memory-guided navigation task. —Peter Stern The mechanisms by which the brain replays neural activity sequences remain unknown. Recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells in freely behaving rats, we observed that replay content is strictly organized over multiple timescales and governed by self-avoidance. After movement cessation, replays avoided the animal’s previous path for 3 seconds. Chains of replays avoided self-repetition over a shorter timescale. We used a continuous attractor model of neural activity to demonstrate that neuronal fatigue both generates replay sequences and produces self-avoidance over the observed timescales. In addition, replay of past experience became predominant later into the stopping period, in a manner requiring cortical input. These results indicate a mechanism for replay generation that unexpectedly constrains which sequences can be produced across time.},

The η-to-θ phase transition of alumina is unidirectional in bulk and retains the crystal lattice orientation. We report a rare example of a statistical kinetics study showing that for nanoparticles on a bulk Al(OH) 3 surface, this phase transition occurs nondeterministically through an ergodic equilibrium through the molten state, and the memory of the lattice orientation is lost in this process. The rate of the interconversion was found to be insensitive to the electron dose rate, and this process had a small Gibbs free energy of activation.

Energetic patterns at the individual level successfully predicted larger-scale population dynamics. A single driver, energy limitation, emerged as being responsible for the population decline, confirming that polar bears face food shortages due to the loss of ice. —Sacha Vignieri Human-driven Arctic warming and resulting sea ice loss have been associated with declines in several polar bear populations. However, quantifying how individual responses to environmental change integrate and scale to influence population dynamics in polar bears has yet to be achieved.

The model successfully captured trends in individual morphometrics, reproduction, and population abundance observed over four decades of empirical monitoring data.

Rousset et al . investigated a bacterial immune system involving a TIR-domain protein and a caspase-like protease that defends against phage infection. They discovered that during phage invasion, the TIR protein produces a previously unknown signaling molecule derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide that activates a bacterial caspase-like protease. This protease then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins, including the elongation factor Tu, effectively halting phage replication. The defense system, called type IV Thoeris, was found to be abundant across bacterial and archaeal species and provides population-level protection against viral invasion. —Di Jiang Caspase family proteases and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain proteins have central roles in innate immunity and regulated cell death in humans. We describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule adenosine 5′-diphosphate-cyclo[N7:1′′]-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease, which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation.

  abstract     = {There are currently 8.2 billion humans on the planet, leaving little room for wildlife, especially large carnivores. Ensuring that nonhuman species persist is important not just because they have a right to exist beyond human value, but also because they are essential to the maintenance and integrity of ecosystems. India, the world’s most populated country, has been successfully working to recover one of the largest and most iconic carnivores, the tiger, for decades. Jhala et al . found that tigers persisted most in high-quality protected areas. However, they were also found in adjacent areas shared with humans where war, poverty, and extensive land alteration were minimal. —Sacha Vignieri Recovery of large yet ecologically important carnivores poses a formidable global challenge. Tiger ( Panthera tigris ) recovery in India, the world’s most populated region, offers a distinct opportunity to evaluate the socio-ecological drivers of megafauna recovery. Tiger occupancy increased by 30% (at 2929 square kilometers per year) over the past two decades, leading to the largest global population occupying ~138,200 square kilometers. Tigers persistently occupied human-free, prey-rich protected areas (35,255 square kilometers) but also colonized proximal connected habitats that were shared with ~60 million people. Tiger absence and extinction were characterized by armed conflict, poverty, and extensive land-use changes. Sparing land for tigers enabled land sharing, provided that socioeconomic prosperity and political stability prevailed. India’s tiger recovery offers cautious optimism for megafauna recovery, particularly in the Global South.},

  abstract     = {Fixing carbon dioxide into biomass is a fundamental biochemical process that has evolved just a few times in nature. In one pathway that likely dates back to the dawn of microbial life, a complex of two large enzymes, both of which contain complex metallocofactors that have been the subject of decades of study, catalyze the key reactions to make the two-carbon unit acetyl-coenzyme A from carbon dioxide. Using cryo–electron microscopy, Yin et al . determined a nearly complete set of snapshots of this enzyme complex in states corresponding to events occurring during the reaction (see the Perspective by Feng and Rees). Large conformational changes permit binding and release of a large partner protein that delivers a methyl group to the active site. —Michael A. Funk In the ancient microbial Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is fixed in a multistep process that ends with acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthesis at the bifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex (CODH/ACS). In this work, we present structural snapshots of the CODH/ACS from the gas-converting acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum , characterizing the molecular choreography of the overall reaction, including electron transfer to the CODH for CO 2 reduction, methyl transfer from the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP) partner to the ACS active site, and acetyl-CoA production. Unlike CODH, the multidomain ACS undergoes large conformational changes to form an internal connection to the CODH active site, accommodate the CoFeSP for methyl transfer, and protect the reaction intermediates. Altogether, the structures allow us to draw a detailed reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which is crucial for CO 2 fixation in anaerobic organisms.},

  abstract     = {Sheep have provided key resources for human society through their domestication, most iconically wool for making textiles; however, the origins of sheep are still not entirely clear. Daly et al . sequenced 118 ancient genomes from Eurasian domestic and wild sheep samples spanning the past 12,000 years. They found that a Neolithic Turkish population likely represents a basal lineage to modern domesticated sheep, but other wild varieties such as a steppe-derived group contributed a large degree of diversity to modern populations. This study explores some of the complex dynamics that played a role in sheep domestication and reveals some potential parallels with human migrations. —Corinne Simonti The origins and prehistory of domestic sheep ( Ovis aries ) are incompletely understood; to address this, we generated data from 118 ancient genomes spanning 12,000 years sampled from across Eurasia. Genomes from Central Türkiye ~8000 BCE are genetically proximal to the domestic origins of sheep but do not fully explain the ancestry of later populations, suggesting a mosaic of wild ancestries. Genomic signatures indicate selection by ancient herders for pigmentation patterns, hornedness, and growth rate. Although the first European sheep flocks derive from Türkiye, in a notable parallel with ancient human genome discoveries, we detected a major influx of Western steppe–related ancestry in the Bronze Age.},

Zichó et al . identified a previously unrecognized reward center in the mouse brain called the subventricular tegmental nucleus (SVTg) that is activated by reward and reward prediction (see the Perspective by Grillner). Mechanistically, the authors show that GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons in the SVTg project to the lateral habenula, an area associated with depression, and, once activated, contribute to valence-based behavior by inhibiting LHb neurons. Using optogenetics, anatomic work, and molecular profiling, the study unveils a reward center that is conserved in the primate and human brainstem and plays a functional role in processing reward. —Mattia Maroso Rewards are essential for motivation, decision-making, memory, and mental health. We identified the subventricular tegmental nucleus (SVTg) as a brainstem reward center. In mice, reward and its prediction activate the SVTg, and SVTg stimulation leads to place preference, reduced anxiety, and accumbal dopamine release. Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression. This mechanism may also explain why SVTg suppression induces aversion and increases fear. The translational relevance of these findings is supported by evidence in the rat, monkey, and human brainstem, establishing SVTg as a key hub for reward processing, emotional valence, and motivation.},

Image-based single-cell transcriptomic methods, which profile the transcriptome of cells in their local environments, offer a promising avenue for bacterial study. However, the extreme density of bacterial RNAs has challenged such methods. Sarfatis et al . solved this challenge by developing a method called bacterial-MERFISH, which combines up to 1000-fold volumetric expansion with image-based transcriptomics. With the ability to profile the transcriptome of single cells within complex native environments, this method promises an exciting new window into a range of bacterial phenomena. —Di Jiang Single-cell decisions made in complex environments underlie many bacterial phenomena. Image-based transcriptomics approaches offer an avenue to study such behaviors, yet these approaches have been hindered by the massive density of bacterial messenger RNA. To overcome this challenge, we combined 1000-fold volumetric expansion with multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to create bacterial-MERFISH. This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon. We envision that bacterial-MERFISH will be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial single-cell heterogeneity in diverse, spatially structured, and native environments.},

Dead krill and their feces sink and are assumed to export tens of millions of tons of carbon annually; however, these data are gleaned from patchy observations. Smith et al . deployed a seafloor lander carrying an echosounder, camera, lights, and other equipment offshore of East Antarctica to provide consistent direct observational data, including difficult-to-obtain winter data, to feed into a carbon flux model. The year-long observations showed heterogeneous migratory behaviors by krill, including strong seasonal shifts. Migration means that recirculation of carbon can occur, so krill may make a smaller contribution to net carbon storage than what is found in current estimates. —Caroline Ash Vertical migrations by marine organisms contribute to carbon export by consumption of surface phytoplankton followed by defecation in the deep ocean. However, biogeochemical models lack observational data, leading to oversimplified representation of carbon cycling by migrating organisms, such as Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ). Using a numerical model informed by 1 year of acoustic observations in the East Antarctic, we estimated the total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux from krill fecal pellets to be 9.68 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day (mg C m −2 day −1 ). A maximum of 25% of krill migrated to depths >200 m with a strong seasonality component, transporting <10% of the total krill POC flux (1.28 mg C m −2 day −1 ) to the deep ocean. Accurate carbon flux estimates are essential to inform climate policy and mitigation strategies, and models that include vertical migration will overestimate carbon export if this seasonality is not captured.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a poorly understood condition that remains difficult to treat and carries a high risk of mortality. Harvey et al . identified a nuclear receptor called NCOA7 that acts as a biological brake on inflammation in the lining of blood vessels (see the Perspective by Pullamsetti and Savai). In cells and in mouse and rat models, deficiency of NCOA7 promoted lysosomal dysfunction and the generation of proinflammatory bile acids and oxysterols. This finding was consistent with data from patients, for whom the severity of PAH symptoms and mortality correlated with the gene sequence of NCOA7 . The authors also identified a potential therapeutic approach by designing a compound that activated NCOA7 and improved disease manifestations in a rat model of PAH. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Vascular inflammation regulates endothelial pathophenotypes, particularly in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Dysregulated lysosomal activity and cholesterol metabolism activate pathogenic inflammation, but their relevance to PAH is unclear. Nuclear receptor coactivator 7 ( NCOA7 ) deficiency in endothelium produced an oxysterol and bile acid signature through lysosomal dysregulation, promoting endothelial pathophenotypes. This oxysterol signature overlapped with a plasma metabolite signature associated with human PAH mortality. Mice deficient for endothelial Ncoa7 or exposed to an inflammatory bile acid developed worsened PAH. Genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency was driven by single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11154337, which alters endothelial immunoactivation and is associated with human PAH mortality. An NCOA7-activating agent reversed endothelial immunoactivation and rodent PAH. Thus, we established a genetic and metabolic paradigm that links lysosomal biology and oxysterol processes to endothelial inflammation and PAH.},

  abstract     = {Chirality is a topological property of a material and is usually fixed when the material is prepared. A material is chiral (or achiral) and remains so for all temperatures and thermodynamics conditions. A right-handed chiral state cannot be easily switched to a left-handed one. Zeng et al . identified a class of materials with compensated staggered chirality in which left- and right-handed chiral forms coexist within the same unit cell (see the Perspective by Romao and Juraschek). Application of ultrafast laser pulses induced a nonlinear excitation of the phonon modes, favoring the enhancement of one staggered chiral state over the other. Such light-induced chirality could be used to explore nonequilibrium physics in topological and correlated systems. — Ian S. Osborne Chirality, a pervasive form of symmetry, is intimately connected to the physical properties of solids, as well as the chemical and biological activity of molecular systems. However, inducing chirality in a nonchiral material is challenging because this requires that all mirrors and all roto-inversions be simultaneously broken. Here, we show that chirality of either handedness can be induced in the nonchiral piezoelectric material boron phosphate (BPO 4 ) by irradiation with terahertz pulses. Resonant excitation of either one of two orthogonal, degenerate vibrational modes determines the sign of the induced chiral order parameter. The optical activity of the photo-induced phases is comparable to the static value of prototypical chiral α-quartz. Our findings offer new prospects for the control of out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena in complex materials.},

  abstract     = {Nature-based solutions are increasingly part of the strategy for achieving net zero carbon emissions to curb climate change. However, promoting tree growth in previously forested areas (reforestation) or unforested areas (afforestation) and planting bioenergy crops may help or harm biodiversity in the process. Smith et al . modeled projected vertebrate biodiversity responses to these land use changes in 2050. Although both strategies had positive effects on biodiversity by reducing climate change, local effects through habitat conversion were much stronger. Because most modeled species inhabit forests, forest growth had a mean positive effect, whereas bioenergy cropping had a mean negative effect. Reforestation can benefit many vertebrates, but models suggest that for most nonforest areas, doing nothing is better for biodiversity than afforestation or bioenergy cropping. —Bianca Lopez Pathways to achieving net zero carbon emissions commonly involve deploying reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy crops across millions of hectares of land. It is often assumed that by helping to mitigate climate change, these strategies indirectly benefit biodiversity. Here, we modeled the climate and habitat requirements of 14,234 vertebrate species and show that the impact of these strategies on species’ habitat area tends not to arise through climate mitigation, but rather through habitat conversion. Across locations, reforestation tends to provide species more habitat through both land-cover change and climate mitigation, whereas habitat loss from afforestation and bioenergy cropping typically outweighs the climate mitigation benefits. This work shows how and where land-based mitigation strategies can be deployed without inadvertently reducing the area of habitat for global biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Despite the relatively straightforward reproductive systems of male and female forms in animals, mate choice within these constructs can be complex. In ruff sandpipers males come in three different morphs: showy “independents,” slightly less showy “satellites,” and female-mimicking “faeders.” Although the system has been studied for decades, it has remained unknown what generates these three distinct male forms. Loveland et al . found that changes in sequence, regulation, and structure of a single gene orchestrate the suite of hormonal and physiological changes that lead to the generation and maintenance of the morphs (see the Perspective by Rosvall). —Sacha Vignieri Androgens are pleiotropic and play pivotal roles in the formation and variation of sexual phenotypes. We show that differences in circulating androgens between the three male mating morphs in ruff sandpipers are linked to 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (HSD17B2), encoded by a gene within the supergene that determines the morphs. Low-testosterone males had higher HSD17B2 expression in blood than high-testosterone males, as well as in brain areas related to social behaviors and testosterone production. Derived HSD17B2 isozymes, which are absent in high-testosterone males but preferentially expressed in low-testosterone males, converted testosterone to androstenedione faster than the ancestral isozyme. Thus, a combination of evolutionary changes in regulation, sequence, and structure of a single gene introduces endocrine variation underlying reproductive phenotypes.},

The authors attribute the different behavior to a combination of short-range ordering that is segregated near the grain boundaries and the formation of L1 2 particles less than 10 nanometers in size that are dispersed in the grain interiors. —Marc S. Lavine Higher strength and higher ductility are desirable for structural materials. However, ultrastrong alloys inevitably show decreased strain-hardening capacity, limiting their uniform elongation. We present a supranano (<10 nanometers) and short-range ordering design for grain interiors and grain boundary regions, respectively, in fine-grained alloys based on vanadium, cobalt, and nickel, with additions of tungsten, copper, aluminum, and boron. The pronounced grain boundary–related strengthening and ductilization mechanism is realized through segregation of the short-range ordering near the grain boundary. Furthermore, the supranano ordering with a larger size has an enhanced pinning effect for dislocations and stacking faults, multiplied and accumulated in grain interiors during plastic deformation. These mechanisms promote continuously increased flow stress until fracture of the alloy at 10% strain with 2.6-gigapascal tensile stress.},

The authors then characterized the effects of each of their mutants on spermatogenesis, X-Y pairing, and other aspects of meiosis and the testis transcriptome. This study provides valuable insights into the functions of key genes on the Y chromosome, and the mouse models are a resource for further research in this area. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich The mammalian Y chromosome is essential for male fertility, but which Y genes regulate spermatogenesis is unresolved. We addressed this by generating 13 Y-deletant mouse models. In Eif2s3y , Uty , and Zfy2 deletants, spermatogenesis was impaired. We found that Uty regulates spermatogonial proliferation, revealed a role for Zfy2 in promoting meiotic sex chromosome pairing, and uncovered unexpected effects of Y genes on the somatic testis transcriptome. In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants. Thus, Y genes may regulate spermatogenesis even if they show no phenotypes when deleted individually. This study advances our knowledge of Y evolution and infertility and provides a resource to dissect Y-gene functions in other tissues.},

Neutron powder diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density-functional theory calculations of ammonia adsorption revealed T8 as single aluminum site in the straight channel.

Accurately determining Al positions has been challenging. We used synchrotron resonant soft x-ray diffraction (RSXRD) at multiple energies near the Al K-edge combined with molecular adsorption techniques to precisely locate “single Al” and “Al pairs” in a commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolite. This analysis depicts three distinct Al tetrahedral (T) sites: T8, T6, and T4. A combined suite of characterizations, including ammonia temperature-dependent desorption, neutron powder diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, reveal isolated ammonia adsorption on T8 as “single Al” in the straight channel and bridged ammonia adsorption on T6 and T4 as an “Al pair” (Al T6 -O-Si T5 -O-Al T4 ) in the straight-sinusoidal intersection.},

  abstract     = {Stretchable organic solar cells for powering wearable devices have been achieved by blending a ductile donor semiconductor polymer with a plasticizing small-molecule acceptor to overcome the inherent brittleness of the photoactive components. Wang et al . have shown that the acceptor actually enhances ductility in the blend and maintains electron mobility despite its lack of crystallinity. Devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of greater than 16% and could maintain 80% of that efficiency at 80% strain. —Phil Szuromi Emerging wearable devices would benefit from integrating ductile photovoltaic light-harvesting power sources. In this work, we report a small-molecule acceptor (SMA), also known as a non–fullerene acceptor (NFA), designed for stretchable organic solar cell ( s -OSC) blends with large mechanical compliance and performance. Blends of the organosilane-functionalized SMA BTP-Si4 with the polymer donor PNTB6-Cl achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >16% and ultimate strain (ε u ) of >95%. Typical SMAs suppress OSC blend ductility, but the addition of BTP-Si4 enhances it. Although BTP-Si4 is less crystalline than other SMAs, it retains considerable electron mobility and is highly miscible with PNTB6-Cl and is essential for enhancing ε u . Thus, s -OSCs with PCE > 14% and operating normally under various deformations (>80% PCE retention under an 80% strain) were demonstrated. Analysis of several SMA-polymer blends revealed general molecular structure–miscibility–stretchability relationships for designing ductile blends.},

Although we agree that this elephant population is crucial to species conservation, we consider only collared elephants to be under study, not the entire subpopulation or all elephants monitored, and we do not agree that the handful of elephants killed by trophy hunters puts the population at risk. Poole et al. also suggest that Tanzania should make exceptions to the United Nations (UN) Principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, essentially ceding management of the elephant population to Kenya, but the UN principle has no exceptions and applies universally and equally, unless a bilateral agreement has been established and agreed upon by partner states.},

Collectively, they have spent millions of dollars and countless employee hours on diversity training. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that such training increases diversity in organizations ( 1 , 2 ). Diversity training may be ineffective because it is commonly implemented in ways that are not conducive to changing behavior: It takes place far in advance of consequential decisions and tends to be generic and not specific to the behaviors that organizations may want to affect (e.g., hiring). Results of our large-scale field experiment in a global telecommunications and engineering firm show that behaviorally designed diversity training can influence hiring decisions. This training increased the short-listing of women and nonnational applicants and increased the hiring of nonnational applicants relative to business as usual. This proof of concept demonstrates that new approaches to diversity training can deliver results.},

The targets of VTA neurons include the striatum, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. On page 379 of this issue, Zichó et al.

Activation of these neurons in the mouse inhibited the lateral habenula, a brain region associated with depression.

For example, amino acids and sugars found in all living organisms are chiral, bearing a specific handedness (left or right) that affects the reactivity of the molecule. Crystals can also have inherent chirality and exist as a pair of two distinct states that are mirror images of one another (enantiomers). Chirality of crystals is intimately connected to electromagnetic properties and dictates how light interacts with a material ( 1 ). However, modifying chirality in solids is challenging because it requires structural rearrangement. On page 431 in this issue, Zeng et al .

  abstract     = {Strigolactones (SLs) are small signaling molecules that are involved in signaling with other plants and soil microbes and in plant growth and development. Although the functional roles of SLs are well characterized, less is known about the evolution of SL biosynthesis in seed plants. Zhou et al . leveraged a synthetic biology approach to identify the function of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP722C, that catalyzes a critical step in the conversion of carlactonoic acid (CLA) to canonical SLs. CYP722A, an evolutionary predecessor of CYP722C, converts CLA into a noncanonical SL, 16-hydroxy-CLA, that is primarily detected in shoots and involved in control of shoot branching. 16-hydroxy-CLA is converted to other likely bioactive forms of SLs by two enzymes, so its biosynthesis by CYP722A is proposed to be a critical step in the evolution of canonical SLs. —Ankit Walia Strigolactones (SLs) are methylbutenolide molecules derived from β-carotene through an intermediate carlactonoic acid (CLA). Canonical SLs act as signals to microbes and plants, whereas noncanonical SLs are primarily plant hormones. The cytochrome P450 CYP722C catalyzes a critical step, converting CLA to canonical SLs in most angiosperms. Using synthetic biology, we investigated the function of CYP722A , an evolutionary predecessor of CYP722C . CYP722A converts CLA into 16-hydroxy-CLA (16-OH-CLA), a noncanonical SL detected exclusively in the shoots of various flowering plants. 16-OH-CLA application restores control of shoot branching to SL-deficient mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana and is perceived by the SL signaling pathway. We hypothesize that biosynthesis of 16-OH-CLA by CYP722A was a metabolic stepping stone in the evolution of canonical SLs that mediate rhizospheric signaling in many flowering plants.},

  abstract     = {In addition to host defense, the immune system aids homeostasis within and between tissues. Šestan et al . found a role for immune cells in regulating blood glucose levels in mice. Upon fasting, a type of innate lymphoid cell called ILC2s increased in number in the pancreas and contributed to the production of glucagon, a hormone required to prevent blood sugar levels from becoming extremely low. ILC2s migrated to the pancreas from the gut in a process dependent on the activation of neurons that innervate the gut from areas of the brain associated with glucose sensing. Cytokines produced by ILC2s could induce pancreatic cells to express glucagon. —Sarah H. Ross The immune system shapes body metabolism, while interactions between peripheral neurons and immune cells control tissue homeostasis and immunity. However, whether peripheral neuroimmune interactions orchestrate endocrine system functions remains unexplored. After fasting, mice lacking type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) displayed disrupted glucose homeostasis, impaired pancreatic glucagon secretion, and inefficient hepatic gluconeogenesis. Additionally, intestinal ILC2s were found in the pancreas, which was dependent on their expression of the adrenergic beta 2 receptor. Targeted activation of catecholaminergic intestinal neurons promoted the accumulation of ILC2s in the pancreas. Our work provides evidence that immune cells can be regulated by neuronal signals in response to fasting, activating an inter-organ communication route that promotes pancreatic endocrine function and regulation of blood glucose levels.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive cancer that can develop in the brain and spinal cord. Immune cells are frequently found in the GBM microenvironment, but their role in tumor development and progression is not clear. Jackson et al . performed a large-scale analysis to characterize the transcriptional and phenotypic features of immune cells called myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) in human GBM. Profiling studies revealed myeloid populations that specifically accumulated in aggressive, high-grade IV GBM, as opposed to low-grade gliomas. One myeloid population, E-MDSCs, defined as an early progenitor subset, was highly proliferative and associated with up-regulation of metabolic and hypoxia pathways. E-MDSCs localized with a “stem-like” tumor population, and ligand-receptor analysis revealed that tumor cells produced chemokines that that were linked to E-MDSC accumulation in the tumor microenvironment and suppression of T cell proliferation. —Priscilla N. Kelly The role of glioma-associated myeloid cells in tumor growth and immune evasion remains poorly understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of immune and tumor cells from 33 gliomas, identifying two distinct myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations in isocitrate dehydrogenase–wild-type (IDT-WT) glioblastoma: an early progenitor MDSC (E-MDSC) population with up-regulation of metabolic and hypoxia pathways and a monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) population. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated that E-MDSCs geographically colocalize with metabolic stem-like tumor cells in the pseudopalisading region. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed cross-talk between these cells, where glioma stem-like cells produce chemokines attracting E-MDSCs, which in turn produce growth factors for the tumor cells. This interaction is absent in IDH-mutant gliomas, associated with hypermethylation and repressed gene expression of MDSC-attracting chemokines. Our study elucidates specific MDSCs that may facilitate glioblastoma progression and mediate tumor immunosuppression.},

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a key part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis known for regulating gonadal function. It was previously thought that members of the TGFβ family called activins, which are produced in the gonads, are key drivers of FSH synthesis, but the literature was not entirely consistent. Ongaro et al . have found that myostatin plays a role in driving FSH expression in mice and rats independently of activins (see the Perspective by Steenwinkel and Pangas). It is important to know if the pathway is the same for humans given current efforts to apply myostatin inhibitors for the treatment of muscle-wasting disorders. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Myostatin is a paracrine myokine that regulates muscle mass in a variety of species, including humans. In this work, we report a functional role for myostatin as an endocrine hormone that directly promotes pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis and thereby ovarian function in mice. Previously, this FSH-stimulating role was attributed to other members of the transforming growth factor–β family, the activins. Our results both challenge activin’s eponymous role in FSH synthesis and establish an unexpected endocrine axis between skeletal muscle and the pituitary gland. Our data also suggest that efforts to antagonize myostatin to increase muscle mass may have unintended consequences on fertility.},

Using extensive biochemical assays, Zhang et al . showed that Teneurin-3 mediates synapse formation through obligatory presynaptic-homodimer assembly, which then forms trans-synaptic heterodimers with postsynaptic latrophilin. The cytoplasmic domain of Teneurin-3 could recruit phase-separated presynaptic scaffold proteins, allowing the authors to reconstitute a synaptic junction complex composed of pre- and postsynaptic phase-separated scaffolds that were recruited to the Teneurin-3-latrophilin assembly. These results provide valuable insights for fully understanding the mechanistic basis of synapse formation. —Mattia Maroso Synapses are organized by trans-synaptic adhesion molecules that coordinate assembly of pre- and postsynaptic specializations, which, in turn, are composed of scaffolding proteins forming liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates. Presynaptic teneurins mediate excitatory synapse organization by binding to postsynaptic latrophilins; however, the mechanism of action of teneurins, driven by extracellular domains evolutionarily derived from bacterial toxins, remains unclear. In this work, we show that only the intracellular sequence, a dimerization sequence, and extracellular bacterial toxin–derived latrophilin-binding domains of Teneurin-3 are required for synapse organization, suggesting that teneurin-induced latrophilin clustering mediates synaptogenesis. Intracellular Teneurin-3 sequences capture liquid-liquid phase-separated presynaptic active zone scaffolds, enabling us to reconstitute an entire synaptic junction from purified proteins in which trans-synaptic teneurin-latrophilin complexes recruit phase-separated pre- and postsynaptic specializations.},

Appropriate spatiotemporal stimulation has the potential to evoke complex somatosensorial experiences. —Mattia Maroso Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of somatosensory cortex evokes tactile sensations whose properties can be systematically manipulated by varying stimulation parameters. However, ICMS currently provides an imperfect sense of touch, limiting manual dexterity and tactile experience. Leveraging our understanding of how tactile features are encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we sought to inform individuals with paralysis about local geometry and apparent motion of objects on their skin. We simultaneously delivered ICMS through electrodes with spatially patterned projected fields (PFs), evoking sensations of edges. We then created complex PFs that encode arbitrary tactile shapes and skin indentation patterns. By delivering spatiotemporally patterned ICMS, we evoked sensation of motion across the skin, the speed and direction of which could be controlled. Thus, we improved individuals’ tactile experience and use of brain-controlled bionic hands.},

  abstract     = {Diet has long been hypothesized as a driver of change among hominins, especially with regard to the increase in brain size. However, identifying diet in early hominins has been difficult because of the diagenic loss of organic matter in collagens older than 200,000 years. Lüdecke et al . looked at carbon and nitrogen isotopes bound to tooth enamel in fauna from an approximately 3.5-million-year-old site that includes several Australopithecus fossils. Dietary niches reconstructed based on these fossils showed that the Australopithecus individuals had diets very similar to both contemporaneous and modern herbivores but different from carnivores. Thus, consumption of meat in these early hominins did not pave the way to humanizing traits such as larger brains. —Sacha Vignieri Incorporation of animal-based foods into early hominin diets has been hypothesized to be a major catalyst of many important evolutionary events, including brain expansion. However, direct evidence of the onset and evolution of animal resource consumption in hominins remains elusive. The nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14 ratio of collagen provides trophic information about individuals in modern and geologically recent ecosystems (<200,000 years ago), but diagenetic loss of this organic matter precludes studies of greater age. By contrast, nitrogen in tooth enamel is preserved for millions of years. We report enamel-bound organic nitrogen and carbonate carbon isotope measurements of Sterkfontein Member 4 mammalian fauna, including seven Australopithecus specimens. Our results suggest a variable but plant-based diet (largely C 3 ) for these hominins.

Wild et al . used biophysical models based on data collected from the field over three decades to predict the influence of climate increases on the energy budgets of lizard species in Africa and Australia. They found that species in Africa experienced a mismatch between their energetic needs and their ability to acquire resources, whereas those in Australia did not. In both cases, species behavior and ecology could mediate this squeeze. Notably, nocturnal species may benefit from warmer nights. —Sacha Vignieri Climate warming can induce a cost-of-living “squeeze” in ectotherms by increasing energetic expenditures while reducing foraging gains. We used biophysical models (validated by 2685 field observations) to test this hypothesis for 10 ecologically diverse lizards in African and Australian deserts. Historical warming (1950–2020) has been more intense in Africa than in Australia, translating to an energetic squeeze for African diurnal species. Although no net impact on Australian diurnal species was observed, warming generated an energetic “relief” (by increasing foraging time) for nocturnal species. Future warming impacts will be more severe in Africa than in Australia, requiring increased rates of food intake (+10% per hour active for diurnal species). The effects of climate warming on desert lizard energy budgets will thus be species-specific but potentially predictable.},

Amorphous polymers tend to be stickier but also weaker, whereas crystalline ones are poor at flowing and filling surface irregularities, which is key to forming a strong bond.

Because P3HBs are able to be produced by bacteria and can be biodegradable, it may be possible to produce these adhesives in a sustainable way. —Marc S.

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) is a biorenewable and biodegradable alternative to conventional plastics, but microbial P3HB, which has a stereoperfect stereomicrostructure, exhibits no adhesion. In this study, by elucidating the fundamental relationship between chemocatalytically engineered P3HB stereomicrostructures and adhesion properties, we found that biodegradable syndio-rich P3HB exhibits high adhesion strength and outperforms common commercial adhesives, whereas syndiotactic, isotactic, or iso-rich P3HB shows no measurable adhesion. The syndio-rich stereomicrostructure brings about desired thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties of P3HB that enable strong adhesion to a range of substrates tested, including aluminum, steel, glass, and wood, and its performance is insensitive to molar mass and reprocessing or reuse.},

Radolinski et al . conducted a field experiment in an Austrian montane grassland to determine the effects of these changes on soil water. Under drought, elevated CO 2 , and warming, plants reduced transpiration, conserving water. Plants treated in this way (but not those with only one manipulated factor) used a larger proportion of recently precipitated water from large pores and with little mixing, showing that future drought will likely fundamentally change how water moves in soil. —Bianca Lopez Soil water sustains terrestrial life, yet its fate is uncertain under a changing climate. We conducted a deuterium labeling experiment to determine whether elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), warming, and drought impact soil water storage and transport in a temperate grassland. Elevated CO 2 created a wetter rootzone compared with ambient conditions, whereas warming decreased soil moisture. Soil water remained well mixed in all global change treatments except for summer drought combined with warming and elevated CO 2 . These combined treatments caused the grassland to conserve water and restricted soil water flow to large, rapidly draining pores without mixing with small, slowly draining pores.

  abstract     = {The photoactive phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) is usually stabilized with other cations or anions that can segregate over time. Zhang et al . show that iodine helps to form corner-sharing lead-iodine species that improve stability, and that its subsequent decalation improves film quality. Solar cells made with these films had power conversion efficiencies greater than 24% and retained 99% of that efficiency after more than 1100 hours of operation at 85°C. —Phil Szuromi Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) is considered the most promising composition for high-performing single-junction solar cells. However, nonalloyed α-FAPbI 3 is metastable with respect to the photoinactive δ-phase. We have developed a kinetic modulation strategy to fabricate high-quality and stable nonalloyed α-FAPbI 3 films, assisted by cogenetic volatile iodine intercalation and decalation. The intercalation of iodine facilitated the formation of corner-sharing Pb-I framework building blocks and reduced the kinetic barrier for α-FAPbI 3 formation, whereas the iodine decalation improved the final perovskite film quality in terms of composition purity and overall homogeneity. Solar cells based on this nonalloyed α-FAPbI 3 (free of other extrinsic composition ions) achieved a power conversion efficiency of >24%. The devices also exhibited excellent durability, retaining 99% of their original power conversion efficiency after operating for more than 1100 hours at 85° ± 5°C under illumination.},

  abstract     = {Droughts are increasing in frequency and severity worldwide as climate warms. The question is, are the longest-lasting and most severe of these, called “megadroughts,” also happening more often and, if so, where? Chen et al . used a morphological approach to identify megadroughts globally over the past 40 years and applied drought and plant-greenness indices to determine their impacts on vegetation (see the Perspective by Hoover and Smith). The authors concluded that megadroughts also are increasing in occurrence, frequency, and severity on a global scale, and identified the regions where the vegetation is highly susceptible to these episodes. —Jesse Smith Persistent multiyear drought (MYD) events pose a growing threat to nature and humans in a changing climate. We identified and inventoried global MYDs by detecting spatiotemporally contiguous climatic anomalies, showing that MYDs have become drier, hotter, and led to increasingly diminished vegetation greenness. The global terrestrial land affected by MYDs has increased at a rate of 49,279 ± 14,771 square kilometers per year from 1980 to 2018. Temperate grasslands have exhibited the greatest declines in vegetation greenness during MYDs, whereas boreal and tropical forests have had comparably minor responses. With MYDs becoming more common, this global quantitative inventory of the occurrence, severity, trend, and impact of MYDs provides an important benchmark for facilitating more effective and collaborative preparedness toward mitigation of and adaptation to such extreme events.},

  abstract     = {Architected materials are engineered such that the structure of the base elements affects the mechanical properties. This engineering provides the ability to tune the materials’ response to stresses. Zhou et al . present a new family called polycatenated architected materials that link together wireframe elements into three-dimensional structures (see the Perspective by Tawfick and Arretche). The design strategy allows for tailored mechanical responses that are useful for developing stimuli-responsive or energy-absorbing systems, along with morphing architectures. —Brent Grocholski Architected materials derive their properties from the geometric arrangement of their internal structural elements. Their designs rely on continuous networks of members to control the global mechanical behavior of the bulk. In this study, we introduce a class of materials that consist of discrete concatenated rings or cage particles interlocked in three-dimensional networks, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general design framework that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particle concatenations and geometries. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses, which can be controlled by their catenation topologies. At larger strains, PAMs behave like lattices and foams, with a nonlinear stress-strain relation. At microscale, we demonstrate that PAMs can change their shapes in response to applied electrostatic charges. The distinctive properties of PAMs pave the path for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems, and morphing architectures.},

  abstract     = {A mechanically interlocked two-dimensional polymer forms as a layered solid that can be exfoliated in common organic solvents. Bardot et al . found that a molecule with four extended aromatic groups crystallizes in a layered structure supported by hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups. Infiltration of dialkyldichlorosilane was used to form siloxane linkages that created macrocyclic mechanical interlocks at every repeat unit. The addition of 2.5% by weight of this material to poly(ether imide) fibers increased their tensile modulus by 45% and ultimate stress by 22%. —Phil Szuromi Mechanical bonds arise between molecules that contain interlocked subunits, such as one macrocycle threaded through another. Within polymers, these linkages will confer distinctive mechanical properties and other emergent behaviors, but polymerizations that form mechanical bonds efficiently and use simple monomeric building blocks are rare. In this work, we introduce a solid-state polymerization in which one monomer infiltrates crystals of another to form a macrocycle and mechanical bond at each repeat unit of a two-dimensional (2D) polymer. This mechanically interlocked 2D polymer is formed as a layered solid that is readily exfoliated in common organic solvents, enabling spectroscopic characterization and atomic-resolution imaging using advanced electron microscopy techniques. The 2D mechanically interlocked polymer is easily prepared on multigram scales, which, along with its solution processibility, enables the facile fabrication of composite fibers with Ultem that exhibit enhanced stiffness and strength.},

Extreme but short-term droughts (<1 year) can have a wide range of consequences, depending on the severity and timing of the drought as well as an ecosystem’s resistance ( 3 , 4 ). However, as a drought extends to a multiyear event, these ecological effects can amplify because short-lived buffering from physiological adaptations or water storage may weaken, leading to longer-lasting results ( 4 ). On page 278 of this issue, Chen et al . ( 5 ) report that increasing precipitation anomalies and atmospheric moisture demands are leading to multiyear droughts with growing impacts on vegetation.

  abstract     = {Cartilage is considered to be a mostly cell-free tissue made of copious extracellular matrix. Ramos et al . describe the embryonic development, gene expression, biochemistry, physiology, and biomechanics of lipid-filled cartilage in mice (see the Perspective by Hermosilla Aguayo and Selleri). This “fatty cartilage” forms from lipochondrocytes found in the face, neck, and chest of phylogenetically diverse mammals. It can adopt intricately patterned shapes and has life-long stability and elastic properties because of its large lipid vacuoles within numerous long-lived cells having little extracellular matrix. These findings hold promise for advancing our understanding of form-to-function relationships in skeletal tissues. —Stella M. Hurtley Conventionally, the size, shape, and biomechanics of cartilages are determined by their voluminous extracellular matrix. By contrast, we found that multiple murine cartilages consist of lipid-filled cells called lipochondrocytes. Despite resembling adipocytes, lipochondrocytes were molecularly distinct and produced lipids exclusively through de novo lipogenesis. Consequently, lipochondrocytes grew uniform lipid droplets that resisted systemic lipid surges and did not enlarge upon obesity. Lipochondrocytes also lacked lipid mobilization factors, which enabled exceptional vacuole stability and protected cartilage from shrinking upon starvation. Lipid droplets modulated lipocartilage biomechanics by decreasing the tissue’s stiffness, strength, and resilience. Lipochondrocytes were found in multiple mammals, including humans, but not in nonmammalian tetrapods. Thus, analogous to bubble wrap, superstable lipid vacuoles confer skeletal tissue with cartilage-like properties without “packing foam–like” extracellular matrix.},

Innate preference for social interaction with male or female conspecifics is a critical component in determining survival and reproduction success. Wei et al . studied same versus opposite sex social interaction in mice, showing that both male and female animals exhibit female social preference in normal conditions but switch to male preference when under survival threat (see the Perspective by Joo and Tye). The switch is mediated by activation of specific populations of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. The results identify sex-specific VTA-mediated neuronal circuits critical for determining sex preference. —Mattia Maroso Sociosexual preference is critical for reproduction and survival. However, neural mechanisms encoding social decisions on sex preference remain unclear. In this study, we show that both male and female mice exhibit female preference but shift to male preference when facing survival threats; their preference is mediated by the dimorphic changes in the excitability of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (VTA DA ) neurons. In males, VTA DA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate female preference, and those to the medial preoptic area mediate male preference. In females, firing-pattern (phasic-like versus tonic-like) alteration of the VTA DA -NAc projection determines sociosexual preferences. These findings define VTA DA neurons as a key node for social decision-making and reveal the sexually dimorphic DA circuit mechanisms underlying sociosexual preference.},

Although they have been in clinical use for several years, the molecular binding mechanisms of mAbs to endogenous CD20 are unclear, as is how antibody binding activates the immune system to kill B cells. Ghosh et al . developed a method for fast volumetric fluorescence imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution that reveals the accumulation of CD20/mAb complexes on the microvilli of polarized B cells. The results show that the classification criterion of anti-CD20 mAbs based on their receptor cross-linking efficiency needs revision. Such high-end imaging techniques should help in the development of improved immunotherapies. —Stella M. Hurtley Elucidating the interaction between membrane proteins and antibodies requires whole-cell imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution. Lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy offers fast volumetric imaging but suffers from limited spatial resolution. DNA-based point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) achieves molecular resolution but is restricted to two-dimensional imaging owing to long acquisition times. We have developed two-dye imager (TDI) probes that enable ~15-fold faster imaging. Combining TDI-DNA-PAINT and LLS microscopy on immunological B cells revealed the oligomeric states and interaction of endogenous CD20 with the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab. Our results demonstrate that CD20 is abundantly expressed on microvilli that bind mAbs, which leads to an antibody concentration–dependent B cell polarization and stabilization of microvilli protrusions. These findings could aid rational design of improved immunotherapies targeting tumor-associated antigens.},

  abstract     = {Adaptation to different environments can include responding to a myriad of pressures, from diseases to differences in water abundance. Of the great apes, chimpanzees are most similar to humans in that they inhabit a range of environments from savannahs to rainforests. Ostridge et al . sequenced exomes from 388 chimpanzees using fecal samples to investigate how selection has acted on these animals. Signatures of selection differed by environment, with forest-dwelling chimpanzee populations bearing variants in genes associated with disease resistance. This study demonstrates the utility of environmentally collected DNA in an endangered species and provides insights into adaptation in our closest living relative. —Corinne Simonti How populations adapt to their environment is a fundamental question in biology. Yet, we know surprisingly little about this process, especially for endangered species, such as nonhuman great apes. Chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, are particularly notable because they inhabit diverse habitats, from rainforest to woodland-savannah. Whether genetic adaptation facilitates such habitat diversity remains unknown, despite it having wide implications for evolutionary biology and conservation. By using newly sequenced exomes from 828 wild chimpanzees (388 postfiltering), we found evidence of fine-scale genetic adaptation to habitat, with signatures of positive selection in forest chimpanzees in the same genes underlying adaptation to malaria in humans. This work demonstrates the power of noninvasive samples to reveal genetic adaptations in endangered populations and highlights the importance of adaptive genetic diversity for chimpanzees.},

Whether these constraints affect brain activity—and, if they do, how—is unclear. Lanzarini et al . developed a wireless system for recording neurons in the premotor cortex while monkeys performed natural actions in both restrained and freely moving conditions. Neurons encoded the same actions differently in the two conditions, with the freely moving context showing a more complex neuronal activity compared with the restrained setting. Allowing animals to move freely while studying the neurophysiology of behavior will allow a richer and more physiological characterization of the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. —Mattia Maroso The current understanding of primate natural action organization derives from laboratory experiments in restrained contexts (RCs) under the assumption that this knowledge generalizes to freely moving contexts (FMCs). In this work, we developed a neurobehavioral platform to enable wireless recording of the same premotor neurons in both RCs and FMCs. Neurons often encoded the same hand and mouth actions differently in RCs and FMCs. Furthermore, in FMCs, we identified cells that selectively encoded actions untestable during RCs and others that displayed mixed selectivity for multiple actions, which is compatible with an organization based on cortical motor synergies at different levels of complexity. Cross-context decoding demonstrated that neural activity in FMCs is richer and more generalizable than in RCs, which suggests that neuroethological approaches are better suited to unveil the neural bases of behavior.},

Ren et al . describe the development of a family of aryl amine polymers with pendent fluorocarbon side chains for organic solvent reverse osmosis. The authors synthesized fluorine containing poly(arylene amine) polymers to fabricate supported thin-film composite membranes with a thickness of 0.2 to 0.3 micrometers. The advantage of these membranes is the suppression of swelling, which typically occurs when polymer membranes are exposed to organic solvents. Membranes were tested for a range of hydrocarbon mixtures that mimic the feed in a Fischer-Tropsch process. —Marc S. Lavine We explored the potential for membrane materials to reduce energy and carbon requirements for the separation of aliphatic hydrocarbon feedstocks and products. We developed a series of fluorine-rich poly(arylene amine) polymer membranes that feature rigid polymer backbones with segregated perfluoroalkyl side chains. This combination imbues the polymers with resistance to dilation induced by hydrocarbon immersion without the loss of solution-based membrane fabrication techniques. These materials exhibit good separation of liquid-phase alkane isomers at ambient temperatures. The integration of these polymeric membranes into fuel and chemical feedstock separation processes was investigated in a series of experiments. Technoeconomic analyses based on these experiments indicate that the best-performing membrane materials can substantially reduce the energy costs and associated carbon emissions of hydrocarbon separations (two to 10 times, depending on product specifications).},

Liu et al . have developed a tin sulfide–based material that has high thermoelectric efficiency around room temperature. The authors accomplished this feat by aligning four valence bands, which improved the electrical properties at the appropriate temperatures for building a cooling device. This approach resulted in a maximum cooling difference of almost 50 K, making this Earth-abundant material potentially attractive for cooling applications. —Brent Grocholski Thermoelectrics have been limited by the scarcity of their constituent elements, especially telluride. The earth-abundant, wide-bandgap ( E g ≈ 46 k B T ) tin sulfide (SnS) has shown promising performance in its crystal form. We improved the thermoelectric efficiency in SnS crystals by promoting the convergence of energy and momentum of four valance bands, termed quadruple-band synglisis. We introduced more Sn vacancies to activate quadruple-band synglisis and facilitate carrier transport by inducing SnS 2 in selenium (Se)–alloyed SnS, leading to a high dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT ) of ~1.0 at 300 kelvin and an average ZT of ~1.3 at 300 to 773 kelvin in p-type SnS crystals. We further obtained an experimental efficiency of ~6.5%, and our fabricated cooler demonstrated a maximum cooling temperature difference of ~48.4 kelvin at 353 kelvin.

Varanasi et al . investigated whether organ-specific metabolites in the TME affect tumor progression and antitumor immune responses in liver cancer (see the Perspective by Goessling). Bile acids are produced in the liver and are required for the digestion and absorption of lipids. Analysis of the enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis revealed elevated levels of the bile acid–conjugating enzyme BAAT (bile acid-CoA:amino acid N -acyltransferase) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Using experimental models of liver cancer, deletion of BAAT improved the antitumor immune responses. Primary bile acids could accumulate in T cells and induce DNA damage, whereas certain secondary bile acids impaired T cell function. Dietary supplementation with ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) boosted T cell function and enhanced immunosurveillance. —Priscilla N. Kelly The metabolic landscape of cancer greatly influences antitumor immunity, yet it remains unclear how organ-specific metabolites in the tumor microenvironment influence immunosurveillance. We found that accumulation of primary conjugated and secondary bile acids (BAs) are metabolic features of human hepatocellular carcinoma and experimental liver cancer models. Inhibiting conjugated BA synthesis in hepatocytes through deletion of the BA-conjugating enzyme bile acid–CoA:amino acid N -acyltransferase (BAAT) enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses, reduced tumor growth, and sensitized tumors to anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) immunotherapy. Furthermore, different BAs regulated CD8 + T cells differently; primary BAs induced oxidative stress, whereas the secondary BA lithocholic acid inhibited T cell function through endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was countered by ursodeoxycholic acid. We demonstrate that modifying BA synthesis or dietary intake of ursodeoxycholic acid could improve tumor immunotherapy in liver cancer model systems.},

These layers blocked ion migration and minority charge carriers. Small-area PSCs and larger modules had power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26% and 20%, respectively. The PSCs showed high stability, including a 4% loss in PCE after 1200 hours of operation at 85°C. —Phil Szuromi One of the primary challenges in commercializing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is achieving both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and sufficient stability. We integrate wafer-scale continuous monolayer MoS 2 buffers at the top and bottom of a perovskite layer through a transfer process. These films physically block ion migration of perovskite into carrier transport layers and chemically stabilize the formamidinium lead iodide phase through strong coordination interaction. Effective chemical passivation results from the formation of Pb-S bonds, and minority carriers are blocked through a type-I band alignment. Planar p-i-n PSCs (0.074 square centimeters) and modules (9.6 square centimeters) with MoS 2 /perovskite/MoS 2 configuration achieve PCEs up to 26.2% (certified steady-state PCE of 25.9%) and 22.8%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Future rises in sea level will depend primarily on the rate at which the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets discharge their ice into the sea, and that rate depends critically on the flow properties of the temperate ice that exists near the beds and within the margins of the fastest-flowing ice streams. Schohn et al . present results from the world’s largest ice-deformation apparatus revealing how shear deformation in temperate ice occurs. This information is crucial for enabling numerical models to accurately predict the flow speeds of these glaciers and their contributions to sea-level rise. —Jesse Smith Accurately modeling the deformation of temperate glacier ice, which is at its pressure-melting temperature and contains liquid water at grain boundaries, is essential for predicting ice sheet discharge to the ocean and associated sea-level rise. Central to such modeling is Glen’s flow law, in which strain rate depends on stress raised to a power of n = 3 to 4. In sharp contrast to this nonlinearity, we found by conducting large-scale, shear-deformation experiments that temperate ice is linear-viscous ( n ≈ 1.0) over common ranges of liquid water content and stress expected near glacier beds and in ice-stream margins. This linearity is likely caused by diffusive pressure melting and refreezing at grain boundaries and could help to stabilize modeled responses of ice sheets to shrinkage-induced stress increases.},

  abstract     = {The quantity and relative longevity of structural materials used in the built environment could make them attractive for carbon dioxide removal. Although many of these materials are currently net carbon dioxide emitters, Van Roijen et al . outline how several of them could help lock up carbon for decades (see the Perspective by Bataille). Transitioning to carbon storage can be accomplished with relatively minor changes to the composition, such as using carbon-rich aggregates in concrete or biomass fiber–based brick. Implementing all of the modifications suggested by the authors could sequester roughly half of yearly carbon dioxide emissions and may be an important tool for getting to net zero emissions. —Brent Grocholski Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions likely entails not only lowering emissions but also deploying carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) removal technologies. We explored the annual potential to store CO 2 in building materials. We found that fully replacing conventional building materials with CO 2 -storing alternatives in new infrastructure could store as much as 16.6 ± 2.8 billion tonnes of CO 2 each year—roughly 50% of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in 2021. The total storage potential is far more sensitive to the scale of materials used than the quantity of carbon stored per unit mass of materials. Moreover, the carbon storage reservoir of building materials will grow in proportion to demand for such materials, which could reduce demand for more costly or environmentally risky geological, terrestrial, or ocean storage.},

  abstract     = {Tropical forests are highly diverse but are vulnerable to tree harvesting for timber and forest clearing for agriculture. Marsh et al . studied how logging affects tropical forests using a standardized, replicated design across a gradient of land-use intensity in Borneo. The authors measured variables related to environmental changes, tree functional traits, ecosystem functions, and biodiversity of multiple taxa in plots with medium- or high-intensity logging, oil palm plantations, and old growth forests. Biodiversity was generally highest in old growth forests and significantly lower on oil palm plantations. Logging affected the environment, but biodiversity and ecosystem functions only showed strong responses to total forest conversion. These results demonstrate the complexity of land-use impacts on ecosystems. —Bianca Lopez The impacts of degradation and deforestation on tropical forests are poorly understood, particularly at landscape scales. We present an extensive ecosystem analysis of the impacts of logging and conversion of tropical forest to oil palm from a large-scale study in Borneo, synthesizing responses from 82 variables categorized into four ecological levels spanning a broad suite of ecosystem properties: (i) structure and environment, (ii) species traits, (iii) biodiversity, and (iv) ecosystem functions. Responses were highly heterogeneous and often complex and nonlinear. Variables that were directly impacted by the physical process of timber extraction, such as soil structure, were sensitive to even moderate amounts of logging, whereas measures of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning were generally resilient to logging but more affected by conversion to oil palm plantation.},

  abstract     = {Much can be said about what a species ate based on the form of their teeth. In Australia, it has been hypothesized that the extinction of many large marsupial species by about 40,000 years ago may have been due to a narrow diet in the face of a changing climate. Arman et al . looked at extant and extinct kangaroo species using a tooth microwear approach and concluded that most species were generalists, not specialist grazers or browsers, and thus were adapted to deal with climate-driven vegetation changes. Thus, their demise was likely not driven by climate change, leaving humans as the probable cause. —Sacha Vignieri Identifying what drove the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions on the continents remains one of the most contested topics in historical science. This is especially so in Australia, which lost 90% of its large species by 40,000 years ago, more than half of them kangaroos. Determining causation has been obstructed by a poor understanding of their ecology. Using dental microwear texture analysis, we show that most members of Australia’s richest Pleistocene kangaroo assemblage had diets that were much more generalized than their craniodental anatomy implies. Mixed feeding across most kangaroos pinpoints dietary breadth as a key behavioral adaptation to climate-driven fluctuations in vegetation structure, dispelling the likelihood that late Pleistocene climatic variation was a primary driver of their disappearance.},

Liu et al . report a new topological phase, an axion insulator, in which the unidirectional current paths are confined to the edges (or hinges) of their material. The authors showed that they could reroute the transport paths with a change in the structure shape and demonstrated braiding of the paths in more complex geometries. Their axion insulator was developed in a photonic crystal platform operating in the microwave regime but could be shrunk to shorter wavelengths, providing a powerful platform to probe exotic topological physics in three-dimensional structures. —Ian S. Osborne Axions, hypothetical elementary particles that remain undetectable in nature, can arise as quasiparticles in three-dimensional crystals known as axion insulators. Previous implementations of axion insulators have largely been limited to two-dimensional systems, leaving their topological properties in three dimensions unexplored in experiment. Here, we realize an axion insulator in a three-dimensional photonic crystal and probe its topological properties. Demonstrated features include half-quantized Chern numbers on each surface that resembles a fractional Chern insulator, unidirectional chiral hinge states forming topological transport in three dimensions, and arithmetic operations between fractional and integer Chern numbers. Our work experimentally establishes the axion insulator as a three-dimensional topological phase of matter and enables chiral states to form complex, unidirectional three-dimensional networks through braiding.},

  abstract     = {Plants often defend themselves from herbivores by producing toxic compounds. In some environments, being able to make use of such protected plants provides a key advantage. Klure et al . looked at two species of southwestern wood rat that have evolved to eat toxic creosote bushes. In both cases independently, duplications of genes controlling biotransformation enzymes have facilitated the rats’ use of these plants as food. This ability likely gives these animals an advantage in regions where creosote has become more common over time. Such duplications may more broadly facilitate adaptation. —Sacha Vignieri How mammalian herbivores evolve to feed on chemically defended plants remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the adaptation of two species of woodrats ( Neotoma lepida and N. bryanti ) to creosote bush ( Larrea tridentata ), a toxic shrub that expanded across the southwestern United States after the Last Glacial Maximum. We found that creosote-adapted woodrats have elevated gene dosage across multiple biotransformation enzyme families. These duplication events occurred independently across species and substantially increase expression of biotransformation genes, especially within the glucuronidation pathway. We propose that increased gene dosage resulting from duplication is an important mechanism by which animals initially adapt to novel environmental pressures.},

Until recently, no effective therapy was available for patients with advanced liver cancer. Immunotherapy, which harnesses the body’s immune system, in combination with antiangiogenic treatments that cut off the blood supply to tumors, has radically changed the treatment landscape ( 3 ). However, success is often limited, with only one in four patients typically responding to treatment. On page 192 of this issue, Varanasi et al.

  abstract     = {Cartilage is a strong, flexible connective tissue that serves vital support functions in the vertebrate skeletal system. In addition to giving structure to parts of the body, such as the nose, ears, and larynx, cartilage protects bones and joints by absorbing shock and reducing friction ( 1 – 3 ). Current human histology and anatomy textbooks list three types of cartilage—hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage—that vary in their morphological features, locations in the body, and biomechanical functions ( 1 – 3 ). All three types consist of specialized cartilage cells called chondrocytes and a firm yet pliable extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in collagen, proteoglycans, and elastin fibers. On page 154 of this issue, Ramos et al . ( 4 ) report the distinctive properties of another type of cartilage characterized by large lipid vacuoles that were first observed more than 150 years ago ( 5 , 6 ). The discovery may have implications for regenerating cartilages.},

Using an antigen-agnostic screening strategy, Dacon et al . investigated the nonreplicating prehepatic sporozoite stage in a hunt for new molecular antimalarial targets. Ten monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that did not recognize recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CSP) were identified in human samples; these mABs only recognized CSP expressed and cleaved at the N terminus by the parasite itself. Subsequent pyroglutamylation exposed a previously unknown, nonrepetitive, and conserved epitope. Apart from the direct value of the mAbs as therapeutics, alternative processing of CSP antigen could supply new research leads, as well as next-generation malaria vaccines. —Caroline Ash The most advanced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against malaria target the central repeat region or closely related sequences within the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Here, using an antigen-agnostic strategy to investigate human antibody responses to whole sporozoites, we identified a class of mAbs that target a cryptic PfCSP epitope that is only exposed after cleavage and subsequent pyroglutamylation (pGlu) of the newly formed N terminus. This pGlu-CSP epitope is not targeted by current anti-PfCSP mAbs and is not included in the licensed malaria vaccines. MAD21-101, the most potent mAb in this class, confers sterile protection against Pf infection in a human liver–chimeric mouse model. These findings reveal a site of vulnerability on the sporozoite surface that can be targeted by next-generation antimalarial interventions.},

  abstract     = {Although pediatric cancers are relatively rare, they are an important cause of childhood deaths, and their biology is not as well understood as that of adult malignancies. The early age of onset of these tumors suggests that genetics may play a major role in their development, but only a small subset of pediatric cancer patients have been found to have germline mutations so far. By examining genetic data from children with cancer, their parents, and unrelated controls, Gillani et al . determined that structural variants, a less well-studied type of germline changes, also contribute to the risk of solid tumors, particularly neuroblastoma (see the Perspective by Hehir-Kwa and Macintyre). This disease was associated with alterations in neurodevelopmental genes, particularly in males for reasons that are not yet understood. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Pediatric solid tumors are a leading cause of childhood disease mortality. In this work, we examined germline structural variants (SVs) as risk factors for pediatric extracranial solid tumors using germline genome sequencing of 1765 affected children, their 943 unaffected parents, and 6665 adult controls. We discovered a sex-biased association between very large (>1 megabase) germline chromosomal abnormalities and increased risk of solid tumors in male children. The overall impact of germline SVs was greatest in neuroblastoma, where we uncovered burdens of ultrarare SVs that cause loss of function of highly expressed, mutationally constrained genes, as well as noncoding SVs predicted to disrupt chromatin domain boundaries. Collectively, we estimate that rare germline SVs explain 1.1 to 5.6% of pediatric cancer liability, establishing them as an important component of disease predisposition.},

Although this trait is likely beneficial in preventing assortative mating, its origins and genetic bases are not well understood. Groh et al . mapped this trait in several walnut varieties to two structural variants that encompass the gene TPPD1 , which underlies flower development in other plant species. Curiously, they found that this locus is not responsible for heterodichogamy in a related species of pecans, which suggests potential evolutionary turnover of this trait across these genera. —Corinne Simonti Balanced mating type polymorphisms offer a distinct window into the forces shaping sexual reproduction strategies. Multiple hermaphroditic genera in Juglandaceae, including walnuts ( Juglans ) and hickories ( Carya ), show a 1:1 genetic dimorphism for male versus female flowering order (heterodichogamy). We map two distinct Mendelian inheritance mechanisms to ancient (>37 million years old) genus-wide structural DNA polymorphisms. The dominant haplotype for female-first flowering in Juglans contains tandem repeats of the 3′ untranslated region of a gene putatively involved in trehalose-6-phosphate metabolism and is associated with increased cis gene expression in developing male flowers, possibly mediated by small RNAs. The Carya locus contains ~20 syntenic genes and shows molecular signatures of sex chromosome–like evolution. Inheritance mechanisms for heterodichogamy are deeply conserved, yet may occasionally turn over, as in sex determination.},

The reaction hinges on sulfenylnitrenes derived from stable precursors.

We harness the distinct reactivity of sulfenylnitrenes, which insert a single nitrogen atom to transform readily available pyrroles, indoles, and imidazoles into synthetically challenging pyrimidines, quinazolines, and triazines, respectively. Our additive-free method for skeletal editing employs easily accessible, benchtop-stable sulfenylnitrene precursors over a broad temperature range (−30 to 150°C). This approach is compatible with diverse functional groups, including oxidation-sensitive functionalities such as phenols and thioethers, and has been applied to various natural products, amino acids, and pharmaceuticals.

We know much about bird migration but a lot less about bat migration, given the difficulty of monitoring large-scale movements of nocturnal animals. Hurme et al . used tiny, highly advanced satellite tags to monitor the spring migration of noctules, which are small insectivorous bats (see the Perspective by McGuire). They found that female bats largely took advantage of warm nights and fronts to migrate to their maternity roosts. However, they showed considerable flexibility, with some individuals waiting until later to begin their journeys and thus incurring an energetic cost. —Sacha Vignieri Long-distance migration, common in passerine birds, is rare and poorly studied in bats. Piloting a 1.2-gram IoT (Internet of Things) tag with onboard processing, we tracked the daily location, temperature, and activity of female common noctules ( Nyctalus noctula ) during spring migration across central Europe up to 1116 kilometers. Over 3 years, 71 bats migrated tens to hundreds of kilometers per night, predominantly with incoming warm fronts, which provided them with wind support. Bats also showed unexpected flexibility in their ability to migrate across a wide range of conditions if needed. However, females leaving toward the end of the season showed higher total activity per distance traveled, a possible cost for their flexible migration timing.},

Wang et al . used a combination of data and models to estimate daily burn severity by ecozone and identify the key drivers of burn severity (see the Perspective by Gan). They found that fuel aridity was the most influential driver of burn severity, that summer months were more likely to experience severe burning, and that an increase in the number of days conducive to high-severity burning occurred over the past four decades, especially during the period from 2001 to 2020. The extraordinarily active 2023 fire season displayed a similar spatial structure of burning but extreme escalations in burn severity. —Jesse Smith Canada has experienced more-intense and longer fire seasons with more-frequent uncontrollable wildfires over the past decades. However, the effect of these changes remains unknown. This study identifies driving forces of burn severity and estimates its spatiotemporal variations in Canadian forests. Our results show that fuel aridity was the most influential driver of burn severity, summer months were more prone to severe burning, and the northern areas were most influenced by the changing climate. About 6% (0.54 to 14.64%) of the modeled areas show significant increases in the number of days conducive to high-severity burning during 1981 to 2020, most of which were found during 2001 to 2020 and in the spring and autumn.

  abstract     = {The vestibulo-ocular reflex circuit is responsible for stabilizing images on the retina in response to head and body tilts. Leary et al . investigated the role of external sensory feedback on the development of this circuit in zebrafish larvae. The authors show that vestibular neurons reach mature responses before the development of gaze behavior and that gaze stabilization develops normally in congenitally blind fish. They found that the rate-limiting process determining the appearance of gaze stabilization was the development of neuromuscular junctions between motor neurons and eye muscles. This study thus uncovers unexpected aspects of the relationship between the maturation of brain circuits and the associated behavior. —Mattia Maroso Vertebrates stabilize gaze using a neural circuit that transforms sensed instability into compensatory counterrotation of the eyes. Sensory feedback tunes this vestibulo-ocular reflex throughout life. We studied the functional development of vestibulo-ocular reflex circuit components in the larval zebrafish, with and without sensation. Blind fish stabilize gaze normally, and neural responses to body tilts mature before behavior. In contrast, synapses between motor neurons and the eye muscles mature with a time course similar to behavioral maturation. Larvae without vestibular sensory experience, but with mature neuromuscular junctions, had a strong vestibulo-ocular reflex. Development of the neuromuscular junction, and not sensory experience, therefore determines the rate of maturation of an ancient behavior.},

  abstract     = {The world, both natural and human, is full of inequities, and researchers have long desired to understand to what degree differences arise from “luck” (otherwise called contingency). Testing for this effect is extremely challenging across all systems given the variability of environments an organism is born into. Zipple et al . performed an experiment that equalized both the environment and genotype in mice within a semiwild, yet consistent, enclosure. They found that small contingent events were amplified across a mouse’s lifetime, leading to competitive advantage overall. However, this effect only occurred in male mice, who compete for resources, whereas it was not seen in females, who do not. —Sacha Vignieri Contingency (or “luck”) in early life plays an important role in shaping individuals’ development. By comparing the developmental trajectories of functionally genetically identical free-living mice who either experienced high levels of resource competition (males) or did not (females), we show that competition magnifies early contingency. Male resource competition results in a feedback loop that magnifies the importance of early contingency and pushes individuals onto divergent, self-reinforcing life trajectories, while the same process appears absent in females. Our results indicate that the strength of sexual selection may be self-limiting, and they highlight the potential for contingency to lead to differences in life outcomes, even in the absence of any underlying differences in ability (“merit”).},

  abstract     = {Modification of proteins by covalent phosphorylation is a primary mechanism for signal processing in biological systems. Yang et al . developed a system to use the modularity of such systems for the design of synthetic biochemical signaling based on phosphorylation rather than genetic circuitry. Combining various protein domains, they designed synthetic kinase-, substrate-, and phosphorylation-dependent interaction domains to create synthetic circuits that could sense and amplify an external signal and activate expression of a transgene. For example, in human T cells, such a circuit could sense tumor necrosis factor–α and maintain controlled cytokine secretion. Rapid regulation and reversibility of phosphorylation-based signals and programmed protein-protein interactions offer the opportunity for versatile design and modeling of circuits that could be useful for a range of therapeutic and diagnostic applications. —L. Bryan Ray Protein phosphorylation signaling networks have a central role in how cells sense and respond to their environment. We engineered artificial phosphorylation networks in which reversible enzymatic phosphorylation cycles were assembled from modular protein domain parts and wired together to create synthetic phosphorylation circuits in human cells. Our design scheme enabled model-guided tuning of circuit function and the ability to make diverse network connections; synthetic phosphorylation circuits can be coupled to upstream cell surface receptors to enable fast-timescale sensing of extracellular ligands, and downstream connections can regulate gene expression. We engineered cell-based cytokine controllers that dynamically sense and suppress activated T cells. Our work introduces a generalizable approach that allows the design of signaling circuits that enable user-defined sense-and-respond function for diverse biosensing and therapeutic applications.},

Khan et al . grew noncrystalline thin films of niobium phosphide—a material that is a topological semimetal as a crystalline material—as nanocrystals in an amorphous matrix. For films with 1.5-nanometer thickness, this material was more than twice as conductive as copper. —Phil Szuromi The electrical resistivity of conventional metals such as copper is known to increase in thin films as a result of electron-surface scattering, thus limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400°C. In films thinner than 5 nanometers, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microhm centimeters for 1.5-nanometer-thick NbP) is up to six times lower than the resistivity of our bulk NbP films, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically about 100 microhm centimeters). The NbP films are not crystalline but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is caused by conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics beyond the limitations of conventional metals.},

At ambient or subambient temperatures, these crystals undergo a phase transition with a relatively large barocaloric effect using relatively low pressure. This material family is large and the structures are tunable, adding flexibility to finding appropriate property combinations for cooling applications. —Brent Grocholski Barocaloric (BC) materials offer the potential for highly energy-efficient refrigeration by generating heat absorption through the effect of pressure on a solid-solid phase transition. However, very few of the known materials have the required phase transition in the temperature regions necessary for domestic refrigeration or air conditioning. We introduce organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) as a new family of BC materials. OIPCs display subambient transition temperatures, so-called “colossal” entropy changes (92 to 240 joules per kilogram per kelvin), and a high sensitivity to pressure, up to 23.7 kelvin per kilobar. The BC responses achieved with these prototype OIPC-BCs are tunable through structural modification of the ions; this wide matrix of possible combinations of structure and function indicates the scope of OIPCs as a new class of material for efficient and sustainable cooling technologies.},

After 2800 hours of operation at a current density of 1 ampere per square centimeter, the catalyst Ta 0.1 Ru 0.9 O 2– x exhibited almost constant voltage, with a decay rate less than ~14 microvolts per hour. —Phil Szuromi The iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction used industrially (in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers) is scarce and costly. Although ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) is a promising alternative, its poor stability has hindered practical application. We used well-defined extended surface models to identify that RuO 2 undergoes structure-dependent corrosion that causes Ru dissolution. Tantalum (Ta) doping effectively stabilized RuO 2 against such corrosion and enhanced the intrinsic activity of RuO 2 . In an industrial demonstration, Ta-RuO 2 electrocatalyst exhibited stability near that of IrO 2 and had a performance decay rate of ~14 microvolts per hour in a 2800-hour test.

Fukuda et al . found that pituitary endocrine cells of Japanese rice fish respond to light stimulation. Exposure of melanotrophs to ultraviolet light increased calcium influx in these cells, resulting in melanocyte-secreting hormone release. Fish lacking the photoreceptor protein Opn5m showed reduced melanogenesis, which suggests that nonvisual photoreceptors might serve as an ultraviolet light protection mechanism. —Mattia Maroso The recent discovery of nonvisual photoreceptors in various organs has raised expectations for uncovering their roles and underlying mechanisms. In this work, we identified a previously unrecognized hormone-releasing mechanism in the pituitary of the Japanese rice fish (medaka) induced by light. Ca 2+ imaging analysis revealed that melanotrophs, a type of pituitary endocrine cell that secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone, robustly increase the concentration of intracellular Ca 2+ during short-wavelength light exposure. Moreover, we identified Opn5m as the key molecule that drives this response. Knocking out opn5m attenuated melanogenesis by reducing tyrosinase expression in the skin. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which direct reception of short-wavelength light by pituitary melanotrophs triggers a pathway that might contribute to protection from ultraviolet radiation in medaka.},

In contrast to adult cancers, in which exogenous mutagens or age-accumulated DNA damage can drive tumor development ( 1 ), childhood cancers lack the extended time frame needed to amass the mutations required for tumorigenesis by those routes. Therefore, endogenous mutagenic processes are a likely source for cancer-enabling mutations in pediatric cancers. Yet the detailed biological processes leading to tumorigenesis in these cancers remain mostly unknown. On page 39 of this issue, Gillani et al. ( 2 ) report that rare germline structural variants (SVs), which are a family of large DNA rearrangements that vary in size from 50 to millions of nucleotides, are a risk factor for pediatric extracranial solid tumors. The findings suggest that germline SVs may contribute to early genome instability in these cancers and could inform the design of targeted therapies.},

  abstract     = {They are small, only come out at night, are silent (to humans), and can fly hundreds of kilometers a night. These factors make studying migrating bats particularly difficult. But overcoming these challenges opens opportunities to better understand migration, a widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom. Comparative studies across taxa can offer insights into general rules that govern how animals interact with their environments, and species-specific studies can provide key information for developing effective conservation strategies. On page 97 in this issue of Science , Hurme et al . ( 1 ) report the use of new Internet of Things technology to investigate movement patterns of migratory bats, the influence of weather, and trade-offs that bats face in decisions about the timing and energetic cost of long-distance flights.},

  abstract     = {Traditional vapor compressors for residential and industrial cooling create a vicious cycle: Cooling contributes to global warming, which then demands more cooling. These systems are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions because of their limited efficiency and direct leaks of harmful hydrofluorocarbons from billions of appliances worldwide ( 1 ). Solid-state cooling systems are emerging alternatives that provide more sustainable solutions. They use either the thermoelectric effect to convert electric energy to temperature difference or the caloric effect, which allows reversible temperature changes in response to external stimuli. However, existing solid-state cooling systems are limited by the lack of proper materials. On page 56 of this issue, Piper et al. ( 2 ) describe a family of organic ionic plastic crystals that exhibit a pressure-driven caloric effect. This potentially large group of materials could provide energy-efficient cooling at low temperatures suitable for residential and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Wildfire occurrence and scale worldwide have risen over recent decades, with the most destructive wildfires in North America taking place in the past decade ( 1 , 2 ). Alleviating wildfire effects requires in-depth understanding of what propels them, which informs better assessment of risks and consequential societal impacts. On page 91 of this issue, Wang et al . ( 3 ) report the key drivers of burn severity—a measure of fire-induced change in vegetation and soil—by building a model using daily fire growth data collected in the past two decades. This analysis reveals the importance of regional characteristics on the ecological effects of intense fires, which corroborates recent conclusions by Jones et al . ( 4 ) on global forest fires and by Balch et al . ( 5 ) on fast-spreading wildfires in the US. Together, these studies identify different drivers of wildfire effects at the national and global levels that could help develop region-specific risk maps for wildfires.},
