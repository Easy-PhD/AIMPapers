  abstract     = {Mutant RAS drives the growth of various cancers, and mutant-selective drugs are approved or under development for clinical use. Sealover et al. identified differential and complementary engagement of downstream MAPK and PI3K pathways among mutant and wild-type RAS members that demanded a combined approach to effectively stunt tumor development. In KRAS-mutant cells, for example, inhibition of PI3K, which was activated by wild-type HRAS and NRAS more than by mutant KRAS, was synergistically cytotoxic with a KRAS-mutant–specific inhibitor. The findings reveal the critical contribution of wild-type RAS family members in cancer cells with mutant RAS and the need for therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target both. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Mutated RAS proteins activate downstream effector pathways (RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT) to drive oncogenic transformation and progression. Because RAS family members differentially engage these pathways, combined inhibition of both pathways is required to effectively treat RAS -mutated cancers. Here, we found that this was due to signaling contributed by wild-type RAS family members that activated an effector pathway that was poorly engaged by the mutant RAS family member. Wild-type KRAS and NRAS promoted RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in cells expressing mutant HRAS, whereas wild-type HRAS and NRAS promoted PI3K-AKT signaling in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Combining inhibitors targeting the poorly engaged RAS effector pathways with inhibitors targeting the mutant RAS resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in a manner that depended on wild-type RAS expression. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib blocked mutant HRAS-PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors in HRAS -mutated cells, whereas KRAS G12C inhibitors blocked mutant KRAS-MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors in KRAS G12C -mutated cells. Synergy was abolished in MEFs lacking all RAS proteins and in cancer cell lines in which nonmutated RAS family members were deleted. Our data highlight the critical role of wild-type RAS family members in supporting mutant RAS signaling and its importance as a therapeutic cotarget in RAS -mutated cancers.},

Fallone et al. found that IL-15 and IL-18 synergized to activate the complex mTORC1, which resulted in increased proliferation and function of both mouse and human NK cells. IL-15 and IL-18 stimulated mTORC1 activity through distinct pathways not previously implicated in its regulation. The combination of IL-15 and IL-18 improved the survival of mice engrafted with tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of NK cell–based cancer immunotherapy. —Wei Wong The multiprotein complex mTORC1 is essential for the increase in protein synthesis and bioenergetic metabolism that supports the proliferation of many cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, which are important innate effectors of the antitumoral response. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation in NK cells by interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-18, which promote NK cell function and are components of a cytokine cocktail used to preactivate NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IL-15 activated mTORC1 through the PI3K/Akt/ERK pathway, whereas IL-18 signaled through the p38 effectors MK2 and MK3 in both murine and human primary NK cells. Both pathways synergized to promote NK cell proliferation and effector functions in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Moreover, both pathways operated independently of the inhibitor TSC and the activator Rheb, revealing a noncanonical mode of mTORC1 activation by cytokines. Treating mice with IL-15 and IL-18 in combination led to increased NK cell numbers and improved antitumoral activity, suggesting that this cytokine combination could be exploited to enhance NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.},

  abstract     = {Amphetamine is a stimulant that is used to treat various neurological disorders. It is also misused and induces changes in the gut microbiome. Mabry et al. found that Fusobacterium nucleatum in the guts of flies enhanced the psychomotor effects of amphetamine by increasing the amount of dopamine transporters in the brain. F. nucleatum produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that inhibits chromatin-modifying enzymes called HDACs. Manipulating this axis in flies suggested that butyrate increased the expression of the gene encoding the dopamine transporter through HDAC1 inhibition, thus enhancing dopamine-motivated behaviors. The findings reveal a potentially targetable gut-brain axis to treat amphetamine use disorder. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Amphetamines are psychostimulants that are commonly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and are prone to misuse. The pathogenesis of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) is associated with dysbiosis (an imbalance in the body’s microbiome) and bacterially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are implicated in the gut-brain axis. Amphetamine exposure in both rats and humans increases the amount of intestinal Fusobacterium nucleatum , which releases SFCAs. Here, we found that colonization of gnotobiotic Drosophila melanogaster with F. nucleatum or supplementing the flies’ diet with the SCFA butyrate enhanced the psychomotor and reward properties of amphetamine. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs), and knockdown of HDAC1 recapitulated the effects induced by F. nucleatum or butyrate. The enhancement in amphetamine-induced behaviors was mediated by an increase in the amount of released dopamine that resulted from amphetamine-induced reversal of dopamine transporter (DAT) function, termed nonvesicular dopamine release (NVDR). The magnitude of amphetamine-induced NVDR was partially mediated by an increase in DAT abundance stimulated at a transcriptional level, and the administration of F. nucleatum or butyrate enhanced NVDR by increasing DAT expression. The findings indicate that F. nucleatum supports AUD through epigenetic regulation of dopamine signaling and identify potential targets for AUD treatment.},

Okeoma et al . analyzed the contents of vesicles from donors and identified proteins that interacted with the viral transcriptional activator Tat and the human transcription factor NF-κB subunit p65. Only a few proteins interacted with both factors, and those proteins interacted with larger networks of transcriptional, RNA processing, and epigenetic regulators. These findings may lead to new therapeutics to more durably suppress or even eradicate HIV infection. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Replication of HIV-1 requires the coordinated action of host and viral transcription factors, most critically the viral transactivator Tat and the host nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This activity is disrupted in infected cells that are cultured with extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in human semen, suggesting that they contain factors that could inform the development of new therapeutics. Here, we explored the contents of semen-derived EVs (SEVs) from uninfected donors and individuals with HIV-1 and identified host proteins that interacted with HIV Tat and the NF-κB subunit p65. Integrative network and pathway enrichment analyses of these complexes revealed associations with an array of biological functions regulating gene expression. Several proteins in SEVs bound to both Tat and NF-κB p65: the scaffolding and cell signaling regulatory protein AKAP9, the G protein signaling regulator ARHGEF28, the epigenetic reader BRD2, the small nuclear RNA processor INTS1, and the transcription elongation inhibitor NELFB. When complexed with p65, NELFB also interacted with HEXIM1, another transcription elongation inhibitor, suggesting that SEVs may inhibit HIV-1 propagation through multiple networks of transcriptional activation and repression.

  abstract     = {Tumor cells can escape drug-induced quiescence, reenter the cell cycle, and slowly proliferate in a state of drug-tolerant persistence that impairs treatment success. Using single-cell tracking techniques, Nangia et al. found that mTORC1-mediated increases in the amount of the cell-cycle protein cyclin D1 drove escape from standard BRAF and MEK inhibitors in cultured BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. Reducing cyclin D1 in melanoma cells or blocking mTORC1 signaling in melanoma and lung cancer cells reduced the proportion of cells that cycled under drug pressure in culture. Thus, mTORC1 signaling enables cells in drug-induced quiescence to reenter the cell cycle, which may impair long-term drug efficacy. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli In BRAF -mutant melanoma cells treated with inhibitors of the kinases BRAF and MEK, a subset of cells rapidly and nongenetically adapts to escape drug-induced quiescence and reenters the cell cycle. Here, we investigated the mechanisms enabling this drug escape by computationally reconstructing single-cell lineages from time-lapse imaging data, linking dynamic signaling pathways to distinct cell-cycle fate outcomes. We found that reactivation of the MEK substrate ERK was necessary but not sufficient to drive escape; rather, the activity of the protein complex mTORC1 was also required to promote cell growth and protein synthesis in drug-treated cells destined for cell-cycle reentry. ERK and mTORC1 signaling converged to increase the abundance of cyclin D1 protein, a critical bottleneck for cell-cycle commitment under drug pressure. In cells in which endogenous cyclin D1 was fluorescently tagged using CRISPR, the subset that escaped drug treatment exhibited marked accumulation of cyclin D1 at least 15 hours before cell-cycle reentry, enabling early prediction of future drug escape. Cyclin D1 thus represents both an early biomarker and potential therapeutic target for suppressing drug escape in melanoma. We observed a similar mTORC1-driven mechanism underlying escape in lung cancer cells, but not colon cancer cells, highlighting partial generalizability across cancer types.},

  abstract     = {Although opioids block nociceptive signaling, their prolonged use increases pain sensitivity and promotes analgesic tolerance. These adverse effects involve the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 in sensory neuron terminals in the spinal cord. Jin et al . found that morphine treatment increased the coupling of mGluR5 to Gα q in the spinal cords of rodents and that Gα q was required for morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation and synaptic trafficking. Inhibition or knockdown of Gα q reduced morphine-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. Thus, Gα q might be targeted to improve the analgesic effects of these drugs while reducing the need for dose escalation. —Annalisa M. VanHook Opioids relieve pain by activating μ-opioid receptors (MORs), which inhibit communication between pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) and the spinal cord. However, prolonged opioid use can paradoxically lead to increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) and reduced analgesic efficacy (tolerance), partly because of the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) at the central terminals of primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Here, we identified a critical role for the G protein Gα q in this paradox. Pharmacological inhibition of Gα q in rats reversed morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation, synaptic trafficking, and activity at sensory neuron terminals and reduced morphine-induced excitatory nociceptive input to spinal dorsal horn neurons. Morphine enhanced Gα q coupling specifically to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dimers in the spinal cord. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of Gα q in dorsal root ganglion neurons in mice normalized NMDAR-related changes and prevented NMDAR-mediated synaptic potentiation triggered by MOR activation. In addition, either pharmacological or genetic disruption of Gα q signaling enhanced morphine’s analgesic effects while reducing hyperalgesia and tolerance. These findings reveal that Gα q signaling contributes to opioid-induced NMDAR hyperactivity at nociceptor central terminals by promoting MOR-mGluR5 cross-talk. Targeting this pathway may improve the safety and efficacy of opioid-based pain management.},

One of these, YoaI, mediated cross-talk between the PhoR-PhoB and EnvZ-OmpR two-component signaling systems, which control cellular responses to phosphate starvation and osmotic stress, respectively. These findings expand the known repertoire of stress-induced small proteins that regulate bacterial adaptive signaling. —Annalisa M. VanHook Bacterial small proteins (≤50 amino acids) are an emerging class of regulators that modulate the activity of signaling networks that enable bacterial adaptation to stress. The Escherichia coli genome encodes at least 150 small proteins, most of which are functionally uncharacterized. We identified and characterized 17 small proteins induced in E . coli during magnesium (Mg 2+ ) starvation using ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and transcriptional reporter assays. Several of these were transcriptionally activated by the PhoQ-PhoP two-component signaling system, which is crucial for Mg 2+ homeostasis. Deletion or overexpression of some of these small proteins led to growth defects and changes in cell size under low-Mg 2+ conditions, indicating physiological roles in stress adaptation. The small transmembrane protein YoaI, which was transcriptionally induced by the phosphate-responsive PhoR-PhoB signaling pathway, increased in abundance under Mg 2+ limitation independently of yoaI transcription or PhoQ-PhoP signaling. YoaI activated a third signaling system, EnvZ-OmpR, which mediates responses to osmotic stress. Overall, this study establishes an initial framework for understanding how small proteins contribute to bacterial stress adaptation by facilitating cross-talk between different signaling systems. Our results suggest that these proteins play broader roles in coordinating stress responses, reflecting the interconnected nature of cellular stress networks rather than strictly compartmentalized pathways responding to specific stressors.},

  abstract     = {Amylin is a peptide hormone that suppresses appetite by activating its receptors (AMYRs), which are heterodimers of the calcitonin receptor, a GPCR, and one of three accessory proteins, RAMP1 to RAMP3. Given that analogs of amylin and calcitonin are in development as therapeutics for obesity, Gostynska et al. sought to better understand the dynamics of AMYR subunit interactions. Through experiments with detergent-solubilized receptors, tagged proteins in live cells, and signaling assays, they found that amylin and calcitonin differentially affected AMYR subunit assembly and disassembly in a RAMP-specific manner. These findings have implications for drug discovery and provide insights into the regulation of GPCR signaling by RAMPs. —John F. Foley Three amylin receptors (AMYRs) mediate the metabolic actions of the peptide hormone amylin and are drug targets for diabetes and obesity. AMY 1 R, AMY 2 R, and AMY 3 R are heterodimers consisting of the calcitonin receptor (CTR), a G protein–coupled receptor, paired with a RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3 accessory subunit, respectively, which increases amylin potency. Here, we found that the AMYRs had distinct basal subunit equilibria that were modulated by peptide agonists and determined the extent of cAMP signaling downstream of receptor activation. By developing a biochemical assay that resolves the AMYR heterodimers and free subunits, we found that the AMY 1 R and AMY 2 R subunit distributions favored free CTR and RAMPs and that rat amylin promoted association of the constituent subunits of AMY 1 R and AMY 2 R. The agonist αCGRP also induced AMY 1 R subunit association. A stronger interaction between the CTR and the RAMP3 transmembrane domains yielded a more stable AMY 3 R, and human and salmon calcitonin agonists promoted AMY 3 R dissociation. Similar changes in subunit association and dissociation were observed in live-cell membranes, and G protein coupling and cAMP signaling assays showed how these changes altered signaling. Our findings have implications for AMYR biology and drug development and reveal regulation of heteromeric GPCR signaling through subunit interaction dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), longer relapse-free survival is correlated to the use of β-blockers, cardiovascular drugs that inhibit β 2 -adrenergic receptors (β 2 ARs). Lam et al. found that the transcription factor Hox-C12 coupled β 2 ARs to proinvasive cAMP and calcium signaling but in a manner seemingly unlinked to transcription. HOXC12 expression in tumors correlated with worse survival in patients, suggesting that it might have utility as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Noradrenaline released from sympathetic neurons accelerates cancer metastasis by activating β 2 -adrenergic receptors (β 2 -adrenoceptors) on tumor cells to promote invasion. We previously showed that the β 2 -adrenoceptor promotes invasive behavior in a metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line by activating a cAMP- and calcium-mediated feedforward loop. Here, we found this mechanism in most TNBC lines that have an active β 2 -adrenoceptor. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic datasets revealed HOXC12 , which encodes a developmental homeobox transcription factor, as the most discriminating gene separating cell lines with the feedforward loop and those without it. The high expression of HOXC12 did not correlate with transcriptional changes in integral proteins associated with cAMP or calcium signaling, and immunostaining showed cytosolic localization of Hox-C12, suggesting that it played a nontranscriptional role. Knocking out HOXC12 prevented β 2 -adrenoceptor–mediated calcium signaling and invasion in cultured TNBC cells. In basal breast cancers, HOXC12 expression in tumors negatively correlated with overall and disease-free survival in patients. These findings identify a key mediator, Hox-C12, in the coordination of invasion driven by cAMP and calcium signaling in β 2 -adrenoceptor–responsive TNBC cells.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that drives drug resistance and is not uniform among malignant cells in a tumor. Barbeau et al. used mutual information calculations to determine the relationship between signaling activity and EMT marker intensity obtained by single-cell imaging analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and tumors. These calculations revealed that EMT heterogeneity in response to growth factors or chemotherapeutics that induce EMT was driven primarily by variations in the activity of the kinase ERK and, when ERK activation was inhibited, by variations in the activity of the related kinase JNK. These findings were robust when mutual information calculations included other signaling molecules and were not uncovered by a bulk biochemical approach or other mathematical approaches. Thus, the addition of ERK inhibitors to PDAC therapy could minimize EMT-induced chemoresistance. —Wei Wong Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs heterogeneously among carcinoma cells to promote chemoresistance. Identifying the signaling pathways involved will nominate drug combinations to promote chemoresponse, but cell population–level studies can be misleading, and single-cell transcriptomics are limited to indirect ontology-based inferences. To understand EMT heterogeneity at a signaling protein level, we combined iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging of pancreas cancer cells and tumors and mutual information (MI) analysis. Focusing first on mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, MI indicated that cell-to-cell variation in ERK activity determined EMT heterogeneity in response to different growth factors and chemotherapeutics but that JNK compensated when MEK was inhibited. Population-level models could not capture these experimentally validated MI inferences. The dominant role of ERK was consistently indicated by MI even when the analysis was expanded to include seven potential EMT-regulating signaling nodes. More generally, this work provides an approach for studying multivariate signaling-phenotype relationships based on protein measurements in any setting.},

In various cancer cell lines, knockdown of EPIC1 stimulated the production of dsRNA from retroelements and an antiviral-like type I IFN response that activated immune cells. EPIC1 inhibited the expression of LINE, SINE, and LTR retroelements that were also repressed by EZH2, suggesting a potential role for the EPIC1-EZH2 interaction in regulating dsRNA production. In a humanized mouse model, in vivo delivery of EPIC1-targeting oligonucleotides enhanced dsRNA accumulation in breast cancer xenografts, reduced tumor growth, and increased the infiltration of T cells and inflammatory macrophages into tumors. Furthermore, EPIC1 knockdown improved the therapeutic efficacy of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in the humanized mouse model.

  abstract     = {Sensory neurons in the tumor microenvironment contribute to pain and disease progression. Restaino et al. found that they also cooperate with tumors to suppress antitumor immunity (see the Focus by Boyd and Borniger). Melanoma and head and neck cancer cells in culture and murine tumors in vivo actively recruited sensory neurons, which in turn induced the differentiation and recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and enhanced tumor-induced suppression of infiltrating T cells. This multicellular cross-talk was mediated through feedforward secretory mechanisms involving small extracellular vesicles from tumor cells and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 from neurons. The findings identify an active role for sensory neurons in the tumor microenvironment to facilitate immune escape. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) released from tumors recruit nociceptor neurons to the tumor bed. Here, we found that ablating these neurons in mouse models of head and neck carcinoma and melanoma reduced the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Moreover, sEV-deficient tumors failed to develop in mice lacking nociceptor neurons. We investigated the interplay between tumor-infiltrating nociceptors and immune cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and melanoma. Upon exposure to cancer-derived sEVs, mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons secreted increased amounts of substance P, IL-6, and injury-associated neuronal markers. Patient-derived sEVs sensitized DRG neurons to capsaicin, implying enhanced nociceptor responsiveness. Furthermore, nociceptors cultured with sEVs induced an immunosuppressed state in CD8 + T cells. Incubation with conditioned medium from cocultures of neurons and cancer cells resulted in increased expression of markers of MDSCs and suppressive function in primary bone marrow cells, and the combination of neuron-conditioned medium and cancer sEVs promoted checkpoint receptor expression on T cells. Together, these findings reveal that nociceptor neurons facilitate CD8 + T cell exhaustion and bolster MDSC infiltration into HNSCC and melanoma. Consequently, targeting nociceptors may provide a strategy to disrupt detrimental neuroimmune cross-talk in cancer and potentiate antitumor immunity.},

Kabella et al. analyzed the proteomes of KRAS-mutant human cancer cell lines treated with drugs that inhibit specific oncogenic forms of KRAS, its upstream regulators, or its downstream effectors. Oncogenic KRAS signaling in all cell lines was mainly mediated by the downstream kinases MEK and ERK, and inhibition of proliferation was associated with changes in posttranslational modifications rather than in protein abundance. The findings offer new insights into shared and cell type–specific oncogenic KRAS signaling and may guide strategies for developing combinatorial treatments to overcome KRAS inhibitor resistance. —Annalisa M. VanHook Mutations that activate the small GTPase KRAS are a frequent genetic alteration in cancer, and drug discovery efforts have led to inhibitors that block KRAS activity. We sought to better understand oncogenic KRAS signaling and the cytostatic effects of drugs that target this system. We performed proteomic analyses to investigate changes in protein abundance and posttranslational modifications in inhibitor-treated human KRAS-mutant pancreatic (KRAS G12C and G12D) and lung cancer (KRAS G12C) cells. The inhibitors used target these mutant forms of KRAS, the downstream effectors MEK and ERK, and the upstream regulators SHP2 and SOS1. Comparisons of phosphoproteomes between cell lines revealed a core KRAS signaling signature and cell line–specific signaling networks. In all cell lines, phosphoproteomes were dominated by different degrees of autonomous, oncogenic KRAS activity. Comparison of phosphoproteomes after short and long drug exposures revealed the temporal dynamics of KRAS-MEK-ERK axis inhibition that resulted in cell cycle exit. This transition to a quiescent state occurred in the absence of substantial proteome remodeling but included broad changes in protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. The collective data reveal insights into oncogenic KRAS signaling, place many additional proteins into this functional context, and implicate cell cycle exit as a mechanism by which cells evade death upon KRAS signaling inhibition.},

Knockdown or inhibition of USP5 attenuated mast cell activation and allergic responses in mice, suggesting that targeting USP5 might provide an alternative strategy for the treatment of allergic diseases. —John F.

We found that USP5 knockdown inhibited the IgE-induced release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine from mast cells and attenuated allergic inflammation in mice. USP5 interacted with FcεRIγ in mast cells, leading to its deubiquitylation and stabilization. In addition, USP5 reversed the K48-linked polyubiquitylation of FcεRIγ. USP5 knockdown in mast cells or HEK293T cells increased the binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b to FcεRIγ, leading to an increase in FcεRIγ polyubiquitylation and degradation.

Deeper profiling predicted a synergistic combination for cells with a secondary RAF1 mutation. The findings demonstrate the utility of cell-sorted screening for drug development and set the stage for getting ahead of RAS(ON) inhibitor resistance. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Therapy-induced acquired resistance limits the clinical effectiveness of mutation-specific KRAS inhibitors in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we investigated whether broad-spectrum, active-state RAS inhibitors meet similar limitations. We found that KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines were sensitive to the RAS(ON) multiselective RAS inhibitor RMC-7977, given that treatment resulted in RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibition; halted proliferation; and, in some cases, induced apoptosis. RMC-7977 initially reduced the activity of a compartment-specific, dual-color reporter of ERK activity, with reporter reactivation emerging after long-term dose escalation. These drug-resistant cell populations exhibited distinct patterns of phospho-protein abundance, transcriptional activities, and genomic mutations, including a Y71H mutation in KRAS and an S257L mutation in RAF1. Transgenic expression of KRAS G13D, Y71H or RAF1 S257L in drug-sensitive CRC cells induced resistance to RMC-7977. CRC cells that were resistant to RMC-7977 and harboring RAF1 S257L exhibited synergistic sensitivity to concurrent inhibition of RAS and RAF. Our findings demonstrate the power of reporter-assisted screening together with single-cell analyses for dissecting the complex landscape of therapy resistance.

The protein phosphatase PTP1B becomes more active and abundant in obesity, leading Sun et al. to investigate its role in cardiac metabolism and function in response to excessive dietary fat. When fed a high-fat diet, mice lacking PTP1B in cardiomyocytes retained greater cardiac function. Moreover, cardiomyocytes in these mice accumulated less lipid and maintained fatty acid oxidation for energy production instead of switching to glucose utilization, which becomes dominant during pathological stress. These results identify PTP1B as a potential target to mitigate the cardiovascular complications of a high-fat diet. —Wei Wong Cardiomyocytes (CMs) normally use fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as their primary energy source. In response to pathological stress, the substrate preference of CMs switches from FAO to glucose metabolism, leading to the development of heart failure. Obesity increases this pathological risk of cardiovascular disease. We focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an inhibitor of insulin signaling, the abundance and activity of which are increased in brain, muscle, and adipose tissues in obese and/or diabetic animals and in obese human patients. We generated mice with CM-specific deficiency in PTP1B ( PTP1B fl/fl ::ꭤMHC Cre/+ ) to investigate the CM-specific role of PTP1B in response to cardiac dysfunction induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Although no physiological or functional cardiac differences were observed at baseline, PTP1B fl/fl ::ꭤMHC Cre/+ mice were protected against development of cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiac steatosis induced by HFD feeding. Metabolomics data revealed that hearts with CM-specific deletion of PTP1B had increased FAO and lipolysis but reduced glucose metabolism. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics analyses and mechanistic studies identified an axis involving the kinases PKM2 and AMPK downstream of PTP1B in the heart, which collectively acted to promote FAO and suppress lipogenesis. Together, these results suggest that CM-specific deletion of PTP1B prevents a substrate switch from FAO to glucose metabolism, protecting the heart against the development of HFD-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {The oncogenic fusion proteins BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL drive hematologic malignancies through the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase ABL. Both fusion proteins are sensitive to ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but Muratcioglu et al. found that only BCR-ABL was sensitive to the allosteric ABL inhibitor asciminib, which stabilizes ABL in an autoinhibited conformation. In lymphoid and myeloid cells, BCR-ABL primarily formed dimers, whereas TEL-ABL formed higher-order oligomers in which ABL trans-autophosphorylation disrupted the autoinhibited conformation. Thus, the fusion partner can determine the sensitivity of oncogenic ABL fusion proteins to allosteric ABL inhibition. —Annalisa M. VanHook Chromosomal translocations that fuse ABL1 to BCR or TEL cause human leukemias. In BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL fusion proteins, oligomerization and loss of an autoinhibitory myristoylation site in the SH3 domain of ABL lead to increased ABL tyrosine kinase activity. We assessed the ability of asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL that binds to the myristoyl-binding site in the ABL kinase domain, to inhibit these fusion proteins. Although the ABL components of the two fusion proteins have identical sequences, asciminib was much less effective against TEL-ABL than it was against BCR-ABL in cell-growth assays. In contrast, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and ponatinib, were equally effective against both fusion proteins. A helix in the ABL kinase domain that closes over bound asciminib was required for the sensitivity of BCR-ABL to the drug but had no effect on that of TEL-ABL, suggesting that the native autoinhibitory mechanism that asciminib engages in BCR-ABL is disrupted in TEL-ABL. Single-molecule microscopy demonstrated that BCR-ABL was mainly dimeric in cells, whereas TEL-ABL formed higher-order oligomers, which promoted trans-autophosphorylation, including of a regulatory phosphorylation site (Tyr 89 ) in the SH3 domain of ABL. Nonphosphorylated TEL-ABL was intrinsically susceptible to inhibition by asciminib, but phosphorylation at Tyr 89 disassembled the autoinhibited conformation of ABL, thereby preventing asciminib from binding. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation determines whether an ABL fusion protein is sensitive to allosteric inhibition.},

  abstract     = {Flaviviruses can cause fatal infections of the CNS; thus, a better understanding of flaviviral pathogenesis could help to identify potential therapeutic targets. Noting that the kinase RIPK3 plays a proinflammatory role in neurons during flavivirus infection, Lindman et al . used mouse models to investigate its role in astrocytes, which help to maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During flavivirus infection of mice, RIPK3 stimulated the expression of Serpina3N in astrocytes, which limited immune cell recruitment into the CNS by promoting BBB integrity, thus increasing survival. Together, these findings suggest that astrocytic RIPK3 promotes host protection during CNS viral infections. —John F. Foley Flaviviruses pose a substantial threat to public health because of their ability to infect the central nervous system (CNS). Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is a central coordinator that promotes neuroinflammation during viral infection of the CNS, a role that occurs independently of its canonical function in inducing necroptosis. Here, we used mouse genetic tools to induce astrocyte-specific deletion, overexpression, and chemogenetic activation of RIPK3 to demonstrate an anti-inflammatory function for astrocytic RIPK3. RIPK3 activation in astrocytes promoted host survival during flavivirus encephalitis by limiting immune cell recruitment to the CNS. Despite inducing a proinflammatory transcriptional program, astrocytic RIPK3 restrained neuroinflammation by increasing the abundance of the protease inhibitor SerpinA3N, which preserved blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced leukocyte infiltration, and improved survival outcomes during flavivirus encephalitis. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for astrocytic RIPK3 in suppressing pathologic neuroinflammation.},

  abstract     = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates signals from factors that both stimulate (exogenous growth factors) and are essential for (intracellular nutrients and energy) cellular growth. Activation of the protein kinase mTOR within mTORC1 results in the phosphorylation of downstream substrates that collectively stimulate biomass accumulation to drive cell growth. Many upstream signals, especially growth factors, regulate mTORC1 by inducing the phosphorylation of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) subunit of the TSC protein complex, a conserved brake on mTORC1 activation and its promotion of cell growth. Cryo–electron microscopy studies of the TSC protein complex have revealed that this phosphoregulation of TSC2 occurs almost exclusively on residues in loops that are outside of the evolutionarily conserved core structural elements and that did not resolve in these structures. These phosphorylation-rich unstructured loops evolved with metazoans, suggesting that the regulation of mTORC1 by diverse growth factors likely evolved with the emergence of complex body plans and diverse cell types to coordinate cell growth and metabolism within and across distinct tissues. Unlike the core structure of TSC2, these loops lack disease-associated missense mutations. These features suggest that the regulatory loops on TSC2 are more amenable to evolutionary changes that enable diverse signals to converge on the TSC protein complex to regulate mTORC1.},

Levey et al. investigated whether MDM2 ablation in endothelial cells affected signaling mediated by norrin, which is important for blood-CNS barrier development and function. Genetic knockout of MDM2 in endothelial cells in mice shortly after birth led to reduced endothelial cell proliferation, defects in retinal vasculature development, and impaired norrin signaling. Inducing endothelial cell–specific deficiency of MDM2 in adult mice resulted in leaky retinal blood vessels and increased expression of proinflammatory factor–encoding mRNAs. These results suggest that ocular edema may be an unwanted side effect of MDM2 inhibitors. —Wei Wong Norrin-induced activation of β-catenin–dependent signaling through the receptor frizzled4 in endothelial cells (ECs) is essential for establishing and maintaining blood-CNS barrier function. We sought to determine how this pathway is modulated under stress or disease conditions. Specifically, we investigated the role of p53 in endothelial blood-CNS barriers because increased abundance of the transcription factor p53 in ECs correlates with leaky CNS blood vessels in type 2 diabetes. Using transcriptomic, cell-based, and mouse genetic approaches, we identified interplay between p53 and its negative regulator MDM2 and norrin/frizzled4 signaling. Mice with an EC-specific ablation of Mdm2 showed decreased norrin/frizzled4 signaling, reduced EC proliferation and retinal angiogenesis, and disrupted blood-retina barrier function, all of which were largely restored by concurrent Trp53 deletion. Decreased norrin/frizzled4 signaling and inhibition of EC proliferation in response to p53 were associated with reduced expression of the condensin I complex component non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH). This study identifies a regulator of norrin/frizzled4 signaling and suggests that the clinical use of MDM2 inhibitors might impair the blood-CNS barrier. In addition, NCAPH may be a downstream effector of p53 in ECs and a candidate gene for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), which is caused by defects in norrin signaling.},

Gauron et al . analyzed databases of familial AD and found a missense mutation in PKCη, K65R, that exhibited strong linkage with a recessively inherited risk variant of the gene. The mutation did not substantially alter the biochemical activity of PKCη but rather concentrated it to the Golgi apparatus, thus altering the kinase’s interactome. Further investigation will determine whether targeting this kinase or its altered interactions has therapeutic potential for carriers of the variant. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–associated genomic variants has provided powerful insight into disease etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AD have successfully identified previously unidentified targets but have almost exclusively used additive genetic models. Here, we performed a family-based GWAS of a recessive inheritance model using whole-genome sequencing from families affected by AD. We found an association between AD risk and the variant rs7161410, which is located in an intron of the PRKCH gene encoding protein kinase C eta (PKCη). In addition, a rare PRKCH missense mutation, K65R, was in linkage disequilibrium with rs7161410 and was present in homozygous carriers of the rs7161410 risk allele. In vitro analysis revealed that the catalytic rate, lipid dependence, and peptide substrate binding of the purified variant were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type kinase. However, cellular studies revealed that the K65R PKCη variant had reduced cytosolic activity and, instead, enhanced localization and signaling at the Golgi. Moreover, the K65R variant had altered interaction networks in transfected cells, particularly with proteins involved in Golgi processes such as vesicle transport. In human brain tissue, the AD-associated recessive genotype of rs7161410 was associated with increased expression of PRKCH , particularly in the amygdala.

Jaimon et al. tested the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2 in a mouse model of early stage, LRRK2 mutation–associated PD. Dietary supplementation with MLi-2 for 3 months restored cilia formation in striatal neurons and astrocytes and their production of ciliary signaling–dependent neuroprotective factors that increased markers of regeneration in nigral dopaminergic neurons. The findings show that MLi-2 treats a disease-relevant cellular deficit caused by LRRK2 mutation that might be therapeutic in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Parkinson’s disease is associated with activating mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which suppresses primary cilia formation in cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons and astrocytes in the striatum. As a result, there is a decrease in the production of neuroprotective glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NRTN), which normally support the viability of dopaminergic neurons. MLi-2 is a brain-penetrant, selective, and now experimental inhibitor of LRRK2. Here, we found that dietary administration of MLi-2 to young LRRK2-mutant mice for 3 months restored primary cilia formation and Hedgehog signaling in both cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons and astrocytes. The treatment also restored the Hedgehog-responsive expression of Gdnf and Nrtn in the neurons. Cilia were also restored on cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus, where their loss correlates with severity of motor impairment in patients. Furthermore, MLi-2 increased the density of fine striatal dopaminergic processes and decreased the amount of stress-associated Sonic Hedgehog RNA expression in nigral dopaminergic neurons. Thus, pathogenic LRRK2-driven cilia loss is reversible in postmitotic neurons and astrocytes, which suggests that early administration of specific LRRK2 inhibitors may therapeutically benefit patients.},

Pathak et al. found that loss of the ER Ca 2+ sensor STIM2 in CRC correlated with poor prognosis in patients and enhanced both progression and metastasis of xenografts in mice. STIM2 loss was associated with increased ER Ca 2+ content, transcriptional reprogramming and metabolic rewiring dependent on the ER stress transcription factor ATF4, and mitochondrial remodeling. These effects were specific to loss of STIM2, did not involve its role in store-operated Ca 2+ entry, and were not replicated by loss of the structurally and functionally homologous STIM1. Thus, STIM2 loss may be a biomarker of more aggressive CRC. —Wei Wong The large amounts of calcium (Ca 2+ ) stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the controlled release of this Ca 2+ store into the cytosol regulate many cellular functions, and altered ER Ca 2+ homeostasis induces ER stress. Stromal-interacting molecules 1 and 2 (STIM1/2) are homologous ER-resident Ca 2+ sensors that synergistically activate cytosolic Ca 2+ influx through Orai channels to promote Ca 2+ -dependent changes in gene expression and ER Ca 2+ refilling. Here, we demonstrated that reduced abundance of STIM2, but not that of STIM1, was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). STIM2-deficient CRC cells showed enhanced ER Ca 2+ content in a manner dependent on the ER Ca 2+ pump SERCA2, increased expression of genes associated with protein translation, and transcriptional and metabolic rewiring. STIM2 deficiency in CRC xenografts led to increased tumor size, invasion, and metastasis. STIM2 loss activated the expression of genes involved in ER stress responses in a manner dependent on the chaperone BiP and the transcription factor ATF4 and independent of Orai channels.

Gas5 complexes supported excitatory transmission and spine growth in hippocampal neurons, and Gas5 abundance in the brain was decreased in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. The findings provide further insight into the spatial regulation of synaptic plasticity. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Changes in the transcriptome are critical in shaping the structural plasticity of neurons, which underpins learning and long-term memory storage. Here, we explored the effect of two opposing, plasticity-associated pathways—cAMP second-messenger signaling and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1 and mGluR5) signaling—on the transcriptome in hippocampal neurons and how these pathways operate in distinct and coordinated manners to induce structural changes. Integration of transcriptome data and molecular pathway analysis identified central “hub” genes that were rapidly induced by cAMP and/or mGluR1/5 in hippocampal neurons. These included the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Gas5, whose expression was induced specifically by cAMP and which was targeted to dendrites by the kinesin motor protein KIF1A. In the dendrites, Gas5 interacted with various proteins and coding and noncoding RNAs associated with synaptic function and plasticity, and these interactions were altered by cAMP signaling. Gas5 interacted with the microRNA miR-26a-5p and sequestered it from several of its mRNA targets associated with neuronal function and whose translation was induced by cAMP. Gas5 was critical for excitatory synaptic transmission induced by cAMP but not those induced by mGluR1/5. Furthermore, Gas5 deficiency impaired dendritic branching and synapse morphology, and Gas5 abundance was decreased in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.

Knockout of CXCR4 selectively in erythroblasts inhibited erythrocyte generation in mice. These findings indicate that CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling promotes erythropoiesis, suggesting that it should be investigated for the treatment of erythrocyte pathologies. —John F. Foley The chemokine CXCL12 signals through its receptor CXCR4 to induce the migration of all leukocyte types and multiple other cell types. Here, we report that CXCR4 is expressed in mouse erythroblasts, the bone marrow erythroid precursors, in which it stimulates erythrocyte generation instead of chemotaxis. CXCR4 signaling promoted homeostatic erythroblast maturation and increased the expression of genes mainly involved in metabolism and chromatin organization. Consequently, genetic depletion of CXCR4 in erythroblasts inhibited late erythropoiesis and diminished bone marrow erythroid outputs. Binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 stimulated its rapid endocytosis and translocation together with Gα i or phosphorylated β-arrestin1 into distinct intracellular compartments, including the nuclear envelope and nucleus. CXCL12 signaling promoted erythroblast elongation and the condensation and excentric positioning of nuclei and stimulated rapid perinuclear Ca 2+ transients that immediately preceded erythroblast enucleation.

  abstract     = {Inflammation and adaptive changes in cell metabolism and gene expression are all associated with neuropathic pain. Deng et al. found that these factors are linked together in a mechanism induced by the growth factor amphiregulin. In mice, peripheral nerve injury increased the secretion of amphiregulin from sensory neurons and associated glia. The EGFR ligand amphiregulin stimulated glycolytic metabolism and lactate production in the neurons, resulting in histone lactylation that enhanced the expression of pain- and inflammation-associated genes. Blocking this pathway reduced mechanical and thermal sensitivity in mice, suggesting a potential strategy to treat nerve injury–associated pain in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The genesis of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury is associated with changes in gene expression and cell metabolism in sensory neurons and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Here, we connected glycolytic metabolism induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin (AREG) to histone lactylation and changes in gene expression that promote chronic neuropathic pain. In both male and female mice subjected to peripheral nerve injury, the mRNA and protein abundance of AREG and its receptor EGFR was increased in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). AREG-EGFR signaling induced glycolytic metabolism by activating the kinase PKM2. An increase in the glycolytic byproduct lactate facilitated lactylation of the histone lysines H3K18 and H4K12 by the lactyltransferase p300 in DRG neurons. These modifications promoted the expression of genes encoding various proinflammatory and pronociceptive proteins that contribute to the development and maintenance of pain. Deletion or knockdown of AREG or pharmacologically inhibiting EGFR, PKM2, or p300 alleviated neuropathic pain in mice and attenuated the injury-induced hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons. Targeting this metabolically driven epigenetic mechanism may be a way to treat neuropathic pain in patients.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical forces cause some transmembrane proteins to be cleaved by proteases. Activation of the receptor Notch depends on cleavage of its juxtamembrane domain in response to force generated by the endocytosis of ligands presented on the surface of neighboring cells. Baker et al . screened juxtamembrane domains from other proteins for their ability to support Notch activation in fruit flies. Diverse domains, including some from contact-dependent signaling proteins, enabled Notch activation in a manner that depended on ligand endocytosis and on the activity of the ADAM10 protease Kuzbanian. The findings expand the repertoire of domains that can act as force-dependent proteolytic switches under physiological conditions and suggest that proteolysis may contribute to various cell contact–dependent signaling mechanisms. —Annalisa M. VanHook Notch proteins are single-pass transmembrane receptors activated by sequential extracellular and intramembrane cleavages to release the cytosolic domains that function as transcription factors. Transmembrane ligands of the Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) family activate Notch on neighboring cells by exerting a pulling force across the intercellular ligand-receptor bridge. This force is generated by Epsin-mediated endocytosis of the ligand into the signal-sending cell and results in the extracellular cleavage of the force-sensing negative regulatory region (NRR) of the receptor by an ADAM10 protease on the signal-receiving cell. Here, we used chimeric Notch and DSL proteins to screen for other domains that could function as ligand-dependent proteolytic switches in place of the NRR in the developing Drosophila melanogaster wing. The domains that could functionally substitute for the NRR in vivo derived from diverse source proteins, varied in sequence, and had different predicted structures, yet all depended on cleavage that was catalyzed by the Drosophila ADAM10 homolog Kuzbanian (Kuz) and stimulated by Epsin-mediated ligand endocytosis. The large sequence space of protein domains that can serve as force-sensing proteolytic switches suggests a widespread potential role for force-dependent, ADAM10-mediated proteolysis in other cell contact–dependent signaling mechanisms.},

Li et al. found that expression of the gene encoding the IL-20R subunit β ( IL20RB ) in PDAC was enabled by a mutant-p53/KRAS–dependent mechanism. IL20RB expression was repressed by the transcription factor TAp63α. However, mutations in p53 or KRAS increased the abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, which directed the degradation of TAp63α, thus derepressing IL20RB . This TRIM21-dependent axis promoted the features of advanced PDAC in culture and in mice and directly linked metastatic drivers in PDAC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive tumor and frequently has mutations in the transcription factor p53. TAp63α is a member of the p53 protein family that is generally tumor suppressive in various other p53-mutant or p53-deficient cancers. Here, we found that TAp63α inhibited cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and migration in several p53-mutant PDAC cell lines. TAp63α transcriptionally repressed IL20RB (which encodes a subunit of the interleukin-20 receptor), potentially by inducing the methylation of its promoter. However, mutations in p53 or KRAS that are common in PDAC increased the abundance of the E3 ligase TRIM21, which promoted the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TAp63α. Thus, the degradation of TAp63α enabled increases in IL20RB expression and formation of IL-20 receptors, resulting in the activation of downstream JAK1-STAT3 signaling that stimulated the proliferation, EMT, migration, and in vivo metastatic seeding of PDAC cells. Our findings identify a signaling axis involving TRIM21, TAp63α, and IL-20RB in PDAC progression.},

  abstract     = {The perception of pain by a class of sensory neurons called nociceptors requires the nucleotide cyclic GMP (cGMP). Gerninghaus et al. determined the pain perception pathway involving cGMP produced by the receptor guanylyl cyclase Npr2 in nociceptors. Mice with a sensory neuron–specific deficiency of Npr2 had impaired responses to noxious heat sensing and were resistant to pain sensitization, a phenomenon that contributes to chronic pain. Activation of Npr2 by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) led to the phosphorylation of a protein called CRP4, and CRP4-deficient mice showed increased pain sensitization. Thus, this pain signaling pathway may provide targets for alleviating acute and chronic pain. —Wei Wong Natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (Npr2; also termed guanylyl cyclase B) is a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase that is highly abundant in nociceptors. Here, we investigated the role of production of cyclic GMP (cGMP) by Npr2 in pain processing. Adult mice with a deletion of Npr2 specifically in nociceptive sensory neurons exhibited deficits in noxious heat sensing, which can activate the nonselective cation channels TRPV1 and TRPA1. In parallel, Npr2-deficient mice showed a reduction in TRPV1-mediated nocifensive behavior and Ca 2+ influx into sensory neurons. Furthermore, Npr2-deficient mice had considerably reduced hypersensitivity after hindpaw injection of TRPA1 and TRPV1 activators or after hindpaw injection of complete Freund adjuvant, a model of persistent inflammatory pain. These results indicate that Npr2 contributes to the pain sensitization that can lead to chronic pain. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that the endogenous Npr2 ligand, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), enhanced the excitability of nociceptive sensory neurons through Npr2. CNP/Npr2 signaling led to the phosphorylation of cysteine-rich LIM-only protein 4 (CRP4), a substrate of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I. Behavioral and electrophysiological analyses using CRP4-deficient mice revealed that CRP4 limited CNP/Npr2-mediated pain sensitization. Our findings reveal a role for CNP/Npr2 signaling in sensory neurons in acute nociceptive and chronic pain and suggest that CRP4 is a downstream target that attenuates pain sensitization.},

Shah et al. found that YAP promoted cell motility by inducing a switch in the activity of Rho family GTPases. YAP-TEAD4 complexes mediated the induction of TRIO, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activated Rac1 and consequently inhibited RhoA, resulting in increased cell migration and invasion. This mechanism drove the infiltration of patient-derived glioblastoma cells across the mouse brain, and markers of this mechanism correlated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. The findings provide insight into the role of YAP in regulating cell behavior in health and disease. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Delineating the mechanisms that control the movement of cells is central to understanding diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes. The transcriptional coactivator YAP is important during development and associated with cancer metastasis. Here, we found that YAP promoted cell migration by modulating a Rho family guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) switch involving Rac1 and RhoA, which are key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics. YAP transcriptionally transactivated the gene encoding the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor TRIO by directly binding to its intronic enhancer. This led to the activation of Rac1 and inhibition of RhoA, which increased cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. This YAP-dependent program was observed across many cell types, including human breast epithelial cells and astrocytes, but it was particularly enhanced in a patient-specific manner in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor. Additionally, YAP-TRIO signaling activated STAT3, a transcription factor implicated in invasive growth in cancer, suggesting potential for cross-talk with this pathway to exacerbate invasive behavior. Clinically, hyperactivation of YAP, TRIO, and STAT3 gene signatures in GBM were associated with poor survival outcomes in patients. Our findings suggest that the YAP-TRIO-Rho-GTPase signaling network regulates invasive cell spread in both physiological and pathological contexts.},

SMAD2, but not SMAD3, underwent dynamic palmitoylation that promoted its phosphorylation and activation, as well as its interaction with the transcription factor STAT3, leading to T H 17 cell generation in vitro. In a mouse model of T H 17 cell–dependent multiple sclerosis, disruption of the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle of SMAD2 reduced both the number of T H 17 cells and disease severity, suggesting that targeting this pathway may treat T H 17 cell–dependent inflammatory diseases. —John F. Foley The transcriptional regulators SMAD2 and SMAD3 share the same primary signaling pathway in response to the cytokine TGFβ. However, whereas SMAD2 stimulates the differentiation of naive CD4 + T cells into proinflammatory T helper 17 cells (T H 17 cells), SMAD3 stimulates the differentiation of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (T reg cells). Here, we report a dynamic SMAD2-specific posttranslational modification important for T H 17 cell differentiation. SMAD2, but not SMAD3, was reversibly S-palmitoylated at cysteine-41 and cysteine-81 by the palmitoyltransferase DHHC7 and depalmitoylated by the acyl protein thioesterase APT2. As a result, SMAD2 was recruited to intracellular membranes where its linker region was phosphorylated, leading to its interaction with the transcriptional regulator STAT3. Nuclear translocation of the SMAD2-STAT3 complex induced the expression of their target genes that promoted T H 17 cell differentiation. Perturbation of SMAD2-STAT3 binding by inhibiting the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle suppressed T H 17 cell differentiation and reduced disease severity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, the S-palmitoylation–depalmitoylation cycle mediated by DHHC7 and APT2 specifically regulates SMAD2, providing insights into the functional differences between SMAD2 and SMAD3 and the distinct role of SMAD2 in T H 17 cell differentiation.

VanHook G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane detectors of extracellular signals that activate heterotrimeric G proteins to regulate intracellular responses. Because there are only 16 Gα proteins that can couple to GPCRs, variation in a single Gα can affect the function of numerous receptors.

Gα s is encoded by an imprinted gene, resulting in the mutant form of Gα s being the only version of the protein present in certain tissues, which leads to tissue-specific disease manifestations. By integrating data from three-dimensional structures, GPCR–G protein coupling specificity, transcriptomics, biophysics, and molecular dynamics with systems pharmacology modeling, we identified GPCRs whose signaling could be altered by Gα s mutations in the kidney, a tissue involved in the pathophysiology of PHPIc. Analysis of G protein activation by the parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R) revealed that L388R impaired Gα s interaction with the receptor, whereas E392K reduced the receptor-induced activation of heterotrimeric G s . This indicates that different signal transduction steps can be altered by specific Gα s mutants associated with the same disease. These findings highlight the importance of investigating mutation-specific perturbations in GPCR signaling to suggest patient-specific treatment strategies. Furthermore, our methods provide a blueprint for interrogating GPCR signaling diversity in different physiological and pathophysiological contexts.},

  abstract     = {In response to a specific type of anticancer kinase inhibitors, a gain-of-function mutation in the small GTPase Rac1 results in the persistent formation of subcellular protrusions called lamellipodia, which are linked to inactivation of the tumor suppressor merlin and cellular proliferation. Weiss et al. found that mutant Rac1 activity and merlin inactivation were localized to a microdomain within lamellipodia in cancer cells treated with one of these kinase inhibitors. Displacement of merlin from lamellipodia prevented its inactivation, and merlin suppressed cancer cell proliferation by limiting lamellipodia formation and Rac1 localization to microdomains in lamellipodia. These results explain how merlin-inactivating lamellipodia are maintained in cancer cells exposed to inhibitors that target specific growth-promoting kinases. —Wei Wong The extension of lamellipodia, which are thin, fanlike projections at the cell periphery, requires the assembly of branched actin networks under the control of the small GTPase Rac1. In melanoma, a hyperactive P29S Rac1 mutant is associated with resistance to inhibitors that target the kinases BRAF and MAPK and with more aggressive disease because it sequesters and inactivates the tumor suppressor merlin (encoded by NF2 ) inside abnormally large lamellipodia. Here, we investigated how these merlin-inactivating lamellipodia are maintained using quantitative, live cell imaging of cell morphology and signaling dynamics. We showed that Rac1 and merlin activity were regulated in spatially confined regions or microdomains within the lamellipodium. The role of merlin as a proliferation-limiting tumor suppressor required its ability to inhibit lamellipodial extension and to locally inhibit Rac1 signaling. Conversely, local inactivation of merlin in lamellipodia released these restraints on morphology and signaling, leading to enhanced proliferation. Merlin and Rac1 are thus in a morphologically and dynamically regulated double-negative feedback loop, a signaling motif that can amplify and stabilize modest stimuli of lamellipodia extensions that enable melanoma to sustain mitogenic signaling under growth challenge. This represents an example of how acute oncogenicity is promoted by collaborations between cell morphological programs and biochemical signaling.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically induced activation of the kinase ERK is important for epithelial homeostasis and morphogenesis. Houtekamer et al. found that ERK was activated upon stretching of cultured epithelial monolayers (see the Focus by Potoczky and Yap). Stretch-induced ERK activation was driven by ligand-mediated activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and depended on the adherens junction protein E-cadherin and the activation of ADAM proteases that mediate the shedding of EGFR ligands. These findings demonstrate that mechanical tension transmitted through cell-cell junctions can elicit ERK activation by promoting EGFR ligand shedding. —Annalisa M. VanHook The behavior of cells is governed by signals originating from their local environment, including mechanical forces exerted on the cells. Forces are transduced by mechanosensitive proteins, which can impinge on signaling cascades that are also activated by growth factors. We investigated the cross-talk between mechanical and biochemical signals in the regulation of intracellular signaling networks in epithelial monolayers. Phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses on epithelial monolayers subjected to mechanical strain revealed the activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a predominant strain-induced signaling event. Strain-induced EGFR-ERK signaling depended on mechanosensitive E-cadherin adhesions. Proximity labeling showed that the metalloproteinase ADAM17, an enzyme that mediates shedding of soluble EGFR ligands, was closely associated with E-cadherin. A probe that we developed to monitor ADAM-mediated shedding demonstrated that mechanical strain induced ADAM activation. Mechanically induced ADAM activation was essential for mechanosensitive, E-cadherin–dependent EGFR-ERK signaling. Together, our data demonstrate that mechanical strain transduced by E-cadherin adhesion triggers the shedding of EGFR ligands that stimulate downstream ERK activity. Our findings illustrate how mechanical signals and biochemical ligands can operate within a linear signaling cascade.},

  abstract     = {Because chronically underactive or overactive neurons impair brain function, chronic changes in neural activity are limited by a feedback mechanism called homeostatic synaptic scaling. Peterson et al. found that inhibiting RNA editing supports homeostatic upscaling and synaptic strengthening. In stimulated mouse cortical neurons, the RNA editor ADAR2 changed a glutamine residue in the pore-facing region of the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) to an arginine. When the stimulus was stopped, ADAR2 abundance and function were decreased, resulting in the incorporation of more unedited GluA2 into AMPARs, which rendered them Ca 2+ permeable, thus increasing synaptic strength. This mechanism was observed in the visual cortices of dark-reared mice, revealing a posttranscriptional mechanism in homeostatic scaling. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a negative feedback mechanism through which neurons modify their synaptic strength to counteract chronic increases or decreases in activity. In response to activity deprivation, synaptic strength is enhanced by increasing the number of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), particularly Ca 2+ -permeable AMPARs, at the synapse. Here, we found that this increase in Ca 2+ -permeable AMPARs during homeostatic upscaling was mediated by decreased posttranscriptional editing of GRIA2 mRNA encoding the AMPAR subunit GluA2. In cultured neurons, activity deprivation resulted in increases in the amount of unedited GluA2, such that its ion channel pore contains a glutamine (Q) codon instead of arginine (R), and in the number of Ca 2+ -permeable AMPARs at the synapse. These effects were mediated by a splicing factor–dependent decrease in ADAR2 abundance and activity in the nucleus. Overexpression of ADAR2 or CRISPR-Cas13–directed editing of GluA2 transcripts blocked homeostatic upscaling in activity-deprived primary neurons. In mice, dark rearing resulted in decreased Q-to-R editing of GluA2-encoding transcripts in the primary visual cortex (V1), and viral overexpression of ADAR2 in the V1 blocked the induction of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. The findings indicate that activity-dependent regulation of GluA2 editing contributes to homeostatic synaptic plasticity.},

O’Boyle et al. analyzed more than 300,000 bacterial serine-threonine kinases and classified them into kinase and pseudokinase families based on shared similarities in their catalytic domains. Many families were characterized by the presence of a unique set of additional functional domains. The analysis also identified features that distinguished bacterial from eukaryotic serine-threonine kinases. This atlas is a resource for understanding the evolution of bacterial serine-threonine kinases and may inform efforts to develop new antibiotics. —Annalisa M.

A deeper understanding of how bacterial STKs differ from their eukaryotic counterparts and how they have evolved to regulate diverse bacterial signaling functions is crucial for advancing the discovery and development of new antibiotic therapies. Here, we classified more than 300,000 bacterial STK sequences from the NCBI RefSeq nonredundant and UniProt protein databases into 35 canonical and seven pseudokinase families on the basis of the patterns of evolutionary constraints in the conserved catalytic domain and flanking regulatory domains. Through statistical comparisons, we identified features distinguishing bacterial STKs from eukaryotic STKs, including an arginine residue in a regulatory helix (C helix) that dynamically couples the ATP- and substrate-binding lobes of the kinase domain. Biochemical and peptide library screens demonstrated that evolutionarily constrained residues contributed to substrate specificity and kinase activation in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis kinase PknB. Together, these findings open previously unidentified avenues for investigating bacterial STK functions in cellular signaling and for developing selective bacterial STK inhibitors.},

However, Ferris et al. found that, in the mouse brain, this role was extended to mural cells called pericytes that reside on the transitional blood vessel segments between arterioles and capillaries (see also the Focus by Earley). The constriction of transitional pericytes in response to increased intravascular pressure required TRPC3. This cation channel is used in transitional pericytes but not smooth muscle cells, making it a potential target to alleviate impairments in cerebrovascular flow associated with aging or neurodegenerative diseases. —Wei Wong Cerebral autoregulation ensures constant blood flow, an essential condition of brain health. A fundamental parameter of the brain circulation is the dynamic regulation of microvessel diameter to allow for adjustments in resistance to blood pressure changes. Pericytes are a family of mural cells that wrap around the capillary endothelium and contribute to the dynamic control of capillary diameter. We sought to determine whether and how brain pericytes constrict in response to blood pressure elevation with in vivo two-photon microscopy, electrophysiology, and ex vivo arteriolar-capillary myography of mice with conditional mural cell knockout or with expression of a genetically encoded Ca 2+ indicator. In first- to fourth-order capillaries, pericytes displayed a rapid and measurable response to pressure by decreasing luminal diameter, depolarizing membrane potentials, and increasing cytoplasmic Ca 2+ signaling. Pharmacological and imaging approaches revealed that transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) and voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels were sequentially activated to promote fast constriction. Genetic ablation of TRPC3 resulted in decreased currents, loss of membrane depolarization, and near-complete ablation of the generation of tone over a standard pressure curve in transitional pericytes but not in upstream arterioles. Together, our findings identify TRPC3 channel activation as critical for proximal pericyte depolarization and contraction in response to pressure, highlighting the signaling differences between arteriolar and capillary blood flow regulation.},

  abstract     = {Obesity perturbs many metabolic processes. Morita et al. constructed a network revealing regulatory relationships between different types of molecules based on omic data collected from the livers of normal and obese mice during food deprivation. The starvation-responsive metabolic network had a similar structure in normal and obese mouse livers. However, the metabolic network in obese mouse livers was wired around different key molecules and showed temporal and pattern disruptions. These defects may help to explain how obesity negates the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting. Together, these results highlight how obesity dysregulates metabolic responses, particularly in the liver, to nutrient deprivation. —Wei Wong Adaptation to starvation is a multimolecular and temporally ordered process. We sought to elucidate how the healthy liver regulates various molecules in a temporally ordered manner during starvation and how obesity disrupts this process. We used multiomic data collected from the plasma and livers of wild-type and leptin-deficient obese ( ob / ob ) mice at multiple time points during starvation to construct a starvation-responsive metabolic network that included responsive molecules and their regulatory relationships. Analysis of the network structure showed that in wild-type mice, the key molecules for energy homeostasis, ATP and AMP, acted as hub molecules to regulate various metabolic reactions in the network. Although neither ATP nor AMP was responsive to starvation in ob / ob mice, the structural properties of the network were maintained. In wild-type mice, the molecules in the network were temporally ordered through metabolic processes coordinated by hub molecules, including ATP and AMP, and were positively or negatively coregulated. By contrast, both temporal order and coregulation were disrupted in ob / ob mice. These results suggest that the metabolic network that responds to starvation was structurally robust but temporally disrupted by the obesity-associated loss of responsiveness of the hub molecules. In addition, we propose how obesity alters the response to intermittent fasting.},

  abstract     = {Cancer can reemerge years after treatment of the primary tumor. This phenomenon is attributed to a prolonged state of cell cycle arrest called dormancy, with relapse emerging when tumor cells awaken and reenter the cell cycle. Drago-Garcia et al. identified a set of steroid- and growth factor–regulated transcription factors called OVOLs that promoted dormancy in breast cancer cells. OVOLs induced the transition of mesenchymal tumor cells to a dormant epithelial state and supported dormancy by stimulating selective autophagy but induced changes that enabled the accumulation of oxidative stress and DNA damage that can reawaken dormant cells. The findings provide insight into the factors regulating tumor dormancy and relapse. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Cellular plasticity mediates tissue development as well as cancer growth and progression. In breast cancer, a shift to a more epithelial phenotype (epithelialization) underlies a state of reversible cell growth arrest called tumor dormancy, which enables drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis. Here, we explored the mechanisms driving epithelialization and dormancy in aggressive mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells in three-dimensional cultures. Overexpressing either of the epithelial lineage-associated transcription factors OVOL1 or OVOL2 suppressed cell proliferation and migration and promoted transition to an epithelial morphology. The expression of OVOL1 (and of OVOL2 to a lesser extent) was regulated by steroid hormones and growth factors and was more abundant in tumors than in normal mammary cells. An uncharacterized and indirect target of OVOL1/2, C1ORF116 , exhibited genetic and epigenetic aberrations in breast tumors, and its expression correlated with poor prognosis in patients. We further found that C1ORF116 was an autophagy receptor that directed the degradation of antioxidant proteins, including thioredoxin. Through C1ORF116 and unidentified mediators, OVOL1 expression dysregulated both redox homeostasis (in association with increased ROS, decreased glutathione, and redistribution of the transcription factor NRF2) and DNA damage and repair (in association with increased DNA oxidation and double-strand breaks and an altered interplay among the kinases p38-MAPK, ATM, and others). Because these effects, as they accumulate in cells, can promote metastasis and dormancy escape, the findings suggest that OVOLs not only promote dormancy entry and maintenance in breast cancer but also may ultimately drive dormancy exit and tumor recurrence.},

A subtype of this cancer is characterized by the presence of immature mesenchymal (MES) cells, which are resistant to standard treatments, including retinoic acid therapy. Nguyen et al. screened small-molecule activators of the microRNA miR-124, which drives differentiation in neuroblastoma cells, and identified PP121, a drug that inhibits tyrosine and phosphoinositide kinases. In combination with the BDNF-activating drug bufalin, PP121 inhibited the proliferation and enabled the differentiation of retinoic acid–resistant MES neuroblastoma cell lines. This work provides an additional strategy for differentiating treatment-resistant MES cells associated with high-risk neuroblastomas. —Amy E. Baek Tumor cell heterogeneity in neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer arising from neural crest–derived progenitor cells, presents clinical challenges. Unlike adrenergic (ADRN) neuroblastoma cells, neuroblastoma cells with a mesenchymal (MES) identity are resistant to chemotherapy and retinoid therapy, which contributes to relapses and treatment failures. We explored whether up-regulation of the neurogenic, tumor suppressor microRNA miR-124 could promote the differentiation of retinoic acid–resistant MES neuroblastoma cells. Leveraging our screen for miRNA-modulatory small molecules, we identified and validated the tyrosine and phosphoinositide kinase inhibitor PP121 as a robust inducer of miR-124. Combining PP121 and BDNF-activating bufalin synergistically arrested proliferation and promoted the sustained differentiation of MES/heterogeneous SK-N-AS cells over several weeks. This protocol also resulted in the differentiation of multiple MES neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines. RNA-seq analysis of differentiated MES/heterogeneous SK-N-AS cells revealed the replacement of the ADRN core regulatory circuitry with circuitries associated with chromaffin cells and Schwann cell precursors. Furthermore, differentiation was associated with inhibition of the CDK4/CDK6 pathway and activation of a transcriptional program that correlated with improved outcomes for patients with neuroblastoma. Our findings suggest an approach with translational potential to induce the differentiation of therapy-resistant cancers of the nervous system. Moreover, these long-lived, differentiated cells could be used to study mechanisms underlying cancer biology and therapies.},

  abstract     = {The development of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) involves the selective pruning of muscle fiber–innervating axons such that only one axon innervates each muscle fiber. Van der Hoorn et al. monitored translation, the process of active protein synthesis from mRNAs, in motor neurons in early postnatal mice and characterized the “translatome” that emerges and changes during synaptic pruning. The results highlight the role of neural metabolism and posttranscriptional regulation in muscle innervation. They also provide a foundation from which to explore the physiology of normal NMJ development and may provide clues to the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disease. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The developmental sculpting of neuromuscular circuitry in early postnatal life occurs through the process of synapse elimination: Supernumerary axon inputs are gradually eliminated from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), resulting in each muscle fiber being innervated by a single axon terminal. Here, we investigated the molecular pathways underlying this process using a ChAT-RiboTag mouse model in which we isolated ribosome-bound mRNAs in motor neurons during synapse elimination in vivo. Analysis of these mRNAs using translating ribosome affinity purification followed by RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) revealed dynamic changes in the motor neuron translatome over the first 2 weeks of life, which were largely independent of parallel transcriptional changes and correlated with the progressive elimination of supernumerary inputs. Bioinformatic analysis identified distinct clusters of transcripts that were translated at specific time points during synapse elimination. Treating mice with two small molecules that were predicted to independently target the proteins or pathways encoded by the transcript cluster associated with neural metabolism increased the rate of synapse elimination in vivo. Together, these data provide a cell type–specific overview of temporal modifications occurring in the motor neuron translatome during synapse elimination, revealing rapid and dynamic responses to postnatal developmental cues.},

  abstract     = {Continual efferocytosis, the process by which macrophages perform repeated rounds of ingesting damaged or dead cells, is important for resolving inflammation and for removing damaged tissue. Lipid-laden foam cells accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques because the ability of macrophages to clear these cells diminishes over time. Kojima et al. found that the antipsychotic drug thiothixene stimulated mouse and human macrophages to ingest both apoptotic cells and lipid-loaded macrophages. Thiothixene stimulated efferocytosis by antagonizing dopamine signaling and by stimulating expression of the gene encoding the key continual efferocytosis driver arginase 1. The findings suggest the possibility of using this clinically approved drug to treat pathologies that result from the accumulation of damaged cells. —Annalisa M. VanHook Stimulating efferocytosis, the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages, has been proposed as a method to eliminate dying or dead cells that accumulate and contribute to diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and infection. Toxicity related to the off-target clearance of healthy tissue has led to the premature termination of multiple clinical programs for proefferocytic therapies. To identify potential proefferocytic therapies with established risk profiles, we screened ~3000 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drugs and other well-characterized compounds for their capacity to stimulate efferocytosis. We found that the antipsychotic drug thiothixene stimulated efferocytosis of apoptotic and lipid-laden cells by mouse and human macrophages and enhanced the continual efferocytosis of apoptotic cells. Consistent with thiothixene’s suppressive effects on dopaminergic signaling, dopamine potently inhibited efferocytosis in a manner that was only partially reversed by thiothixene. The prophagocytic effects of thiothixene in mouse macrophages depended on increased expression of the gene encoding the retinol-binding protein receptor Stra6L, which, in turn, promoted the production of the continual efferocytosis stimulator arginase 1. Our findings demonstrate that dopamine inhibits efferocytosis in macrophages and identify thiothixene, a generic, FDA-approved antipsychotic drug that has been in use for more than 50 years, as a promising candidate for promoting continual efferocytosis and the removal of diseased tissue.},

Highly metabolically active cells, such as neurons, enter a catabolic state during periods of sleep loss, which consequently disrupts physiological functioning. Specific to the central nervous system, sleep loss results in impaired synaptogenesis and long-term memory, effects that are also characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe how sleep deprivation increases resting energy expenditure, leading to the development of a negative energy balance—a state with insufficient metabolic resources to support energy expenditure—in highly active cells like neurons. This disruption of energetic homeostasis alters the balance of metabolites, including adenosine, lactate, and lipid peroxides, such that energetically costly processes, such as synapse formation, are attenuated. During sleep loss, metabolically active cells shunt energetic resources away from those processes that are not acutely essential, like memory formation, to support cell survival. Ultimately, these findings characterize sleep loss as a metabolic disorder.},

  abstract     = {In contrast with proliferating cells, the activation of the RHIM domain–containing kinase RIPK3 in neurons does not induce necroptosis but rather an antiviral transcriptional response. Kofman et al. investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this response. In cortical neurons, the RIPK3-dependent transcriptional response required other RHIM domain–containing proteins, RIPK1 and TRIF, that are also critical for necroptosis in proliferating cells. Fibroblasts rendered resistant to necroptosis produced a RIPK3-dependent transcriptional signature upon viral infection similar to that of virally infected neurons. Thus, the signaling output of RIPK3 requires other RHIM domain–containing proteins and induces cell death in proliferating cells and antiviral transcription in nonproliferating cells. —Wei Wong Neurons are postmitotic, nonregenerative cells that have evolved fine-tuned immunological responses to maintain life-long cellular integrity, including resistance to common programmed cell death pathways such as necroptosis. We previously demonstrated a necroptosis-independent role for the key necroptotic kinase RIPK3 in host defense against neurotropic flavivirus infection. Here, we show that RIPK3 activation had distinct outcomes in primary cortical neurons when compared with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection or after sterile activation. We found that RIPK3 activation did not induce neuronal death but instead drove antiviral gene transcription after ZIKV infection. Although RIPK3 activation in MEFs induced cell death, ablation of downstream cell death effectors unveiled a RIPK3-dependent transcriptional program that largely overlapped with that observed in ZIKV-infected neurons. In death-resistant MEFs, RIPK3-dependent transcription relied on interactions with the RHIM domain–containing proteins RIPK1 and TRIF, similar to the requirements for the RIPK3-dependent antiviral transcriptional signature in ZIKV-infected neurons. These findings suggest that the pleotropic functions of RIPK3 are largely context dependent and that in cells that are resistant to cell death, RIPK3 acts as a mediator of inflammatory transcription.},

Luebbers et al. developed an optical biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that directly measures the endogenous activation of Gα i subunits in response to GPCR stimulation in both cell lines and mouse astrocytes. In a neuronal cell line, experiments with Gα i bONE-GO revealed that several neuropeptides classified as full agonists of opioid receptors instead behaved as partial agonists. Unlike biosensors typically used to measure GPCR activation, Gα i bONE-GO does not depend on exogenously expressed receptors or G proteins and can be deployed in many cell types using a single expression construct. —Annalisa M. VanHook The activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a mechanism broadly used by eukaryotes to transduce signals across the plasma membrane and a target for many clinical drugs. Many optical biosensors commonly used for measuring GPCR-stimulated G protein activity rely on exogenously expressed GPCRs and/or G proteins, which compromise readout fidelity. Biosensors that measure endogenous signaling may interfere with the signaling process under investigation or have a limited dynamic range of detection, hindering applicability. Here, we developed an optical BRET-based biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that detects endogenous GTP-bound (active) Gα i upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs more robustly than existing sensors of endogenous activity. Its design leverages the Gα i -binding protein GINIP as a high-affinity and specific detector of Gα i -GTP. We optimized this design to prevent interference with downstream G i -dependent signaling and to enable implementation in different experimental systems having endogenous GPCRs, including adenosine receptors in primary astroglial cells and opioid receptors in cell lines. In a neuronal cell line, Gα i bONE-GO revealed activation profiles indicating that several natural opioid neuropeptides acted as partial agonists, in contrast with their characterization as full agonists using biosensors that depend on exogenously expressed receptors and G proteins. The Gα i bONE-GO biosensor is a direct and sensitive detector of endogenous activation of Gα i proteins by GPCRs in different experimental settings but does not interfere with the subsequent propagation of signaling.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers suppress immune surveillance and resist immune-targeted therapies. Chen et al. found that antitumor immunity and treatment might be improved by harnessing an antibody associated with the autoimmune disease lupus. The antibody, called 4H2, was taken up into cells where it bound to endogenous (“self”) RNA to recruit and activate the nucleic acid sensor cGAS, which initiated inflammatory signaling that was cytotoxic to brain, lung, and breast cancer cells in culture but not to normal breast epithelial cells. In mice with glioblastomas, 4H2 localized to the tumor microenvironment after systemic administration, improved animal survival in a T cell–dependent manner, and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, demonstrating its potential for treating patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Nucleic acid–mediated signaling triggers an immune response that is believed to be central to the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we found that a cell-penetrating, SLE-associated antiguanosine autoantibody may present therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment. The autoantibody entered cells through a nucleoside salvage-linked pathway of membrane transit that avoids endosomes and lysosomes and bound to endogenous RNA in live cells. In orthotopic models of glioblastoma, the antibody localized to areas adjacent to necrotic tumor cells and promoted animal survival in a manner that depended on T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that antibody binding to nucleic acids activated the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), thereby stimulating immune signaling and cGAS-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, the autoantibody could carry and deliver functional RNA into tumor, brain, and muscle tissues in live mice when administered locally. The findings establish a collaborative autoantibody–nucleic acid interaction that is translatable to strategies for nonviral gene delivery and immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Because the STAT family of transcriptional regulators induces the expression of genes involved in antiviral signaling, they are often targeted by viruses to suppress immune responses. Activation of STATs by tyrosine phosphorylation induces their dimerization, and STAT dimers can assemble into tetramers with different transcriptional properties. Sugiyama et al . solved the cryo-EM structure of a tetrameric form of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 in complex with DNA, showing how interactions between N-terminal domains of the protein supported the dimerization of STAT1 dimers. Biochemical analyses and modeling further indicated how the rabies virus P-protein specifically targets STAT1 tetramers, suggesting a potential mechanism of immune evasion. —John F. Foley Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members mediate signaling in the Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT pathway and are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in dimerization through reciprocal interactions between the phosphotyrosine and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (pY-STAT) then translocates to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding antiviral proteins. Although the active and functional forms of STATs are conventionally considered to be dimers, STATs can undergo higher-order oligomerization, which is implicated in regulating transcriptional activity. We present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the tetrameric form of intact pY-STAT1 in complex with DNA, which indicates that interactions between the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) of STAT1 induce oligomerization. The tetrameric structure revealed a compact conformation with a previously uncharacterized binding interface: Two DNA-bound dimers are twofold symmetrically aligned to transform into a tandem DNA-binding model without NTD dimer separation. Moreover, biochemical analyses indicated that the rabies virus P-protein selectively targeted tetrameric pY-STAT1. Combined with data showing which regions contribute to the interaction between pY-STAT1 and the P-protein, we constructed a binding model explaining how P recognizes the pY-STAT1 tetramer. These data provide insight into how pathogenic viruses target signaling pathways that mediate the host immune response.},

  abstract     = {In prostate cancers, the abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4 is inversely correlated with response to the antiandrogen (also known as an androgen receptor inhibitor) enzalutamide. Zhang et al. found that PDCD4 is repressed by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which enabled the activity of cell survival pathways that are androgen independent. In prostate cancer cell lines, PLK1 promoted the degradation of PDCD4, which released a brake on c-MYC, stimulating its activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and metabolic pathways that reduced cellular dependence on androgen receptor signaling and thus reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Treatment with the Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib restored enzalutamide sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that this may be an effective strategy in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (also known as an antiandrogen), is used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Tumors often acquire resistance to enzalutamide. Tumor progression and enzalutamide resistance are associated with decreased abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4. In normal dividing cells, PDCD4 abundance is low when that of the kinase PLK1 is high. In this study, we found that PLK1 acted on PDCD4 to promote enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells in culture and in mice via a mechanism that revealed an effective combination therapy. PLK1 phosphorylated PDCD4 at Ser 239 , leading to its degradation and consequently inducing the transcriptional activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by c-MYC. Hh signaling supports tumor cell proliferation and stemness by inducing the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15), which promotes the metabolic clearance of drugs and steroid hormones. Thus, this pathway may circumvent androgen receptor dependence, thereby reducing cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide. Knocking down UGT2B15 enhanced enzalutamide-induced cell apoptosis and growth arrest in a PDCD4-dependent manner. Combining enzalutamide with the clinically approved Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant cell cultures and xenografts in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism of PLK1-mediated enzalutamide resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance in prostate cancer.},

The kinase ATM is a major initial response protein that facilitates the activation of other repair proteins. Alonso-Marañón et al. found that ATM complexes are directed to sites of damage by the protein NEMO, a regulatory subunit in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (see also the Focus by Perkins). In cells exposed to ultraviolet light or a chemotherapeutic, NEMO bound to ATM in complex with the NF-κB–associated protein IKKα and directed the complexes to damaged DNA to promote efficient repair. Increased expression of NEMO-encoding transcripts in colorectal cancers correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis, suggesting that NEMO may predict tumors that could be effectively treated with DNA repair inhibitors. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The DNA damage repair kinase ATM is phosphorylated by the NF-κB pathway kinase IKKα, resulting in enhanced DNA damage repair through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Thus, inhibition of IKKα enhances the efficacy of cancer therapy based on inducing DNA damage. Here, we found a role for the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO in DNA damage repair mediated by ATM and IKKα. Exposure to damaging agents induced the interaction of NEMO with a preformed ATM-IKKα complex, which was required to target active ATM and IKKα to chromatin for efficient DNA damage repair but not for activating ATM. Recognition of damaged DNA by the IKKα-NEMO-ATM complex was facilitated by the interaction between NEMO and histones and depended on the ADP ribosylation of histones by the enzyme PARP1. NEMO-deficient cells showed increased activity of the kinase ATR, and inhibition of ATR potentiated the effect of chemotherapy in cells lacking NEMO or IKKα. Bioinformatic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets demonstrated that the expression of genes encoding IKKα, NEMO, and ATM correlated with poor patient prognosis, suggesting that the mechanism linking these three elements may be clinically relevant.},

Wang et al. investigated the role of the deacetylating enzyme sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) in adipose tissue macrophages in regulating norepinephrine amounts in brown adipose tissue. Obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet was exacerbated by SIRT6 deficiency in macrophages. SIRT6 decreased the promoter acetylation and expression of genes encoding a norepinephrine transporter and an enzyme that degrades norepinephrine. Thus, SIRT6 in macrophages prevents the degradation of norepinephrine, thereby ensuring the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue and limiting obesity in mice. —Wei Wong Brown and beige adipocytes dissipate energy to generate heat through uncoupled respiration, and the hormone norepinephrine plays an important role in stimulating brown fat thermogenesis and beige adipocyte development in white adipose depots. Increasing energy expenditure by promoting the function and development of brown and beige fat is a potential approach to treat obesity and diabetes. Here, we investigated the effects of macrophage sirtuin 6 (SIRT6 ) on the regulation of the norepinephrine content of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and on obesity in mice. Myeloid SIRT6 deficiency impaired the thermogenic function of BAT, thereby decreasing core body temperatures because of reduced norepinephrine concentrations in BAT and subsequently leading to cold sensitivity. In addition, the oxygen consumption rate was reduced, resulting in severe insulin resistance and obesity. Furthermore, macrophage SIRT6 deficiency inhibited BAT thermogenesis after cold exposure or norepinephrine treatment and cold exposure–induced increases in markers of lipid metabolism and thermogenesis in white adipose tissue. Myeloid-specific SIRT6 deficiency promoted H3K9 acetylation in the promoter regions and the expression of genes encoding the norepinephrine-degrading enzyme MAOA and the norepinephrine transporter SLC6A2 in macrophages in BAT, leading to norepinephrine degradation and obesity.

In response to LPS, GCN5 mediated the induction of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and the inflammatory mediators COX-2 and iNOS in microglia. Further investigation in cultured microglial cells revealed that GCN5 was activated downstream of the innate immune receptor TLR4 to acetylate Lys 310 in the NF-κB subunit p65, thereby enabling the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the resulting inflammatory response.

Schwartz and Sternberg developed a screening method on the basis of genome sequencing that does not require the recovery of viable animals. Using this approach, they identified mutations that partially suppressed the lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor receptor homolog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . The suppressing mutations included those that affected genes encoding regulators of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rho and nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage. This method can be used to screen for modifiers that may suppress a phenotype in only a subset of tissues but do not fully restore function to enable the recovery of fertile adults. —Annalisa M. VanHook Suppressor screens can identify genetic modifiers of biochemical pathways but generally require that the suppressed mutant be viable and fertile. We developed a screening method that obviated this requirement and enabled the identification of mutations that partially suppressed the early developmental arrest and lethality caused by loss of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ortholog LET-23 in Caenorhabditis elegans . We chemically mutagenized animals carrying the loss-of-function allele let-23 ( sy15 ), recovered let-23 ( sy15 ) homozygotes that escaped early developmental arrest but were nevertheless inviable, and sequenced their genomes. Testing of candidate causal mutations identified 11 genes that, when mutated, mitigated the early lethality caused by loss of EGF signaling. These included genes encoding homologs of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras ( let-60 ), which is a downstream effector of LET-23, and of regulators of the small GTPase Rho, including the homolog of the phosphotyrosine-binding protein TENSIN ( tns-1 ). We also recovered suppressing mutations in genes encoding nuclear proteins that protect against DNA damage, including the homolog of MutS homolog 4 ( him-14 ). Genetic experiments were consistent with the repression of Rho activity or the activation of the DNA damage response compensating for the loss of EGF signaling. This sequencing-based, whole-animal screening method may be adapted to other organisms to enable the identification of mutations for which the phenotype does not allow the recovery of viable animals.},

  abstract     = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is made up of multicellular contacts referred to as the neurovascular unit (NVU) that mediate the exchange of fluid and nutrients in the brain. Sona et al. found that tight control of the abundance of the phosphatase PTEN in excitatory neurons is critical to the postnatal development of the NVU in mice. Mice lacking the mRNA regulator Ago2 in glutamatergic neurons had decreased NVU development and defective BBB integrity. These effects were mediated through loss of Ago2-dependent suppression of Pten , leading to decreases in signaling that support neuronal survival and migration. Thus, Ago2 in excitatory neurons supports brain development through formation of the BBB. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Proper formation of the complex neurovascular unit (NVU) along with the blood-brain barrier is critical for building and sustaining a healthy, functioning central nervous system. The RNA binding protein argonaute2 (Ago2) mediates microRNA (miRNA)–mediated gene silencing, which is critical for many facets of brain development, including NVU development. Here, we found that Ago2 in glutamatergic neurons was critical for NVU formation in the developing cortices of mice. Glutamatergic neuron–specific loss of Ago2 diminished synaptic formation, neuronal-to-endothelial cell contacts, and morphogenesis of the brain vasculature, ultimately compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Ago2 facilitated miRNA targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( Pten ) mRNA, which encodes a phosphatase that modulates reelin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt signaling within the glutamatergic subpopulation. Conditionally deleting Pten in Ago2 -deficient neurons restored Akt2 phosphorylation as well as postnatal development and survival. Several mutations in AGO2 impair small RNA silencing and are associated with Lessel-Kreienkamp syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. When expressed in a neuronal cell line, these human AGO2 loss-of-function variants failed to suppress PTEN, resulting in attenuated PI3K-Akt signaling, further indicating that dysregulation of Ago2 function may contribute to both impaired development and neurological disorders. Together, these results identify Ago2 as central to the engagement of neurons with blood vessels in the developing brain.},

  abstract     = {The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) ensures appropriate chromosome-microtubule attachments during mitosis and includes the kinase Aurora-B and the microtubule-binding protein Borealin. The ubiquitin ligase APC/C and its cofactor Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1 ) can trigger the degradation of the CPC in somatic cells, but its activity is constitutively low during mitosis in stem cells. Tsunematsu et al. investigated the stability of the CPC in human embryonic carcinoma (hEC) cells. In hEC cells undergoing mitosis, a stable CPC depended on the low activity of APC/C Cdh1 , and depletion of Aurora-B and Borealin by APC/C Cdh1 resulted in spontaneous hEC cell differentiation. These findings indicate a mechanism of holding hEC cells in a pluripotent state on the basis of APC/C Cdh1 activity. —Amy E. Baek Human embryonic carcinoma (hEC) cells are derived from teratocarcinomas, exhibit robust proliferation, have a high differentiation potential, are the malignant counterparts of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and are considered hESC-like. The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), made up of the microtuble binding protein Borealin, the kinase Aurora-B, the CPC-stabilizing inner centromere protein (INCENP), and the inhibitor of apoptosis family member Survivin, regulates cell division and is active exclusively during mitosis in somatic cells. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its cofactor Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1 ) is a ubiquitylating complex that catalyzes the degradation of Aurora-B and Borealin in somatic cells but has low activity during interphase in hESCs. Here, we found that Borealin and Aurora-B exhibited sustained stability throughout the cell cycle of hEC cells due to low APC/C Cdh1 activity. In contrast with somatic cells, CPC activity persisted across the cell cycle of hEC cells because of diminished APC/C Cdh1 activity. Disrupting the CPC complex by depleting its constituents triggered spontaneous differentiation in hEC cells. As hEC cells differentiated, APC/C Cdh1 activation curtailed CPC activity. Inactivating the CPC by pharmacologically inhibiting Aurora-B induced hEC cell differentiation by activating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Hence, APC/C Cdh1 -mediated termination of CPC activity triggered hEC cell differentiation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for the CPC in governing hESC cell fate.},

  abstract     = {The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) is a G protein–coupled receptor that regulates fluid balance and can be activated by the ligands arginine vasopressin and oxytocin. Teixeira et al. found that sustained V 2 R signaling depended on the identity of the activating ligand but was independent of receptor internalization by the scaffolding protein β-arrestin. V 2 R-induced signaling occurred primarily at the plasma membrane, and its duration depended on the residence time of the ligand on the receptor, which was longer after activation with arginine vasopressin than with oxytocin. Moreover, V 2 R internalization into endosomes induced by β-arrestin helped to terminate V 2 R signaling due to ligand dissociation from V 2 R caused by acidified endosomal pH. These results show that the overall duration of V 2 R signaling at the plasma membrane is determined by ligand residence time on the receptor. —Wei Wong The canonical model of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling comprises G protein activation at the plasma membrane, followed by receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment, which leads to receptor desensitization and endocytosis. However, the activation of some GPCRs results in sustained G protein signaling from intracellular compartments in a manner reportedly dependent on β-arrestin and receptor endocytosis. The vasopressin type 2 receptor (V 2 R) can be activated by two structurally similar hormones, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin, both of which stimulate the production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In this study, we showed that sustained V 2 R signaling and endosomal Gα s (stimulatory G protein alpha subunit) translocation could occur without β-arrestin–mediated receptor endocytosis and was primarily controlled by the residence time of the ligand on the receptor. β-Arrestin had opposing effects on sustained signaling: It facilitated receptor internalization into endosomes, where it activated Gα s , and promoted cAMP production from this compartment. However, β-arrestin–mediated receptor endocytosis also induced ligand dissociation due to the acidic endosomal environment, thereby limiting the signal. Overall, our data suggest that signals originating at the plasma membrane play a dominant role in sustained V 2 R signaling stimulated by arginine vasopressin.},

Funk et al. found that these oncogenes can be disrupted in HNSCCs by targeting the kinase LZK, another commonly overexpressed protein encoded by MAP3K13 . LZK stabilized c-MYC through kinase-dependent activity, whereas LZK stabilized mutant p53 through a kinase-independent physical interaction. A PROTAC drug that degraded LZK resulted in the destabilization of both proteins, and a catalytic inhibitor of LZK slowed the growth of MAP3K13 -amplified HNSCCs in mice, highlighting LZK as a target for treating HNSCC. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The worldwide annual frequency and lethality of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not improving, and thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Approximately 70% of HNSCC cases have either amplification or overexpression of MAP3K13 , which encodes the kinase LZK. Here, we found that LZK is a therapeutic target in HNSCC and that small-molecule inhibition of its catalytic function decreased the viability of HNSCC cells with amplified MAP3K13 . Inhibition of LZK suppressed tumor growth in MAP3K13 -amplified xenografts derived from HNSCC patients. LZK stabilized the transcription factor c-MYC through its kinase activity and gain-of-function mutants of p53 in a kinase-independent manner. We designed a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that induced LZK degradation, leading to decreased abundance of both c-MYC and gain-of-function p53, and reduced the viability of HNSCC cells. Our findings demonstrate that LZK-targeted therapeutics, particularly PROTACs, may be effective in treating HNSCCs with MAP3K13 amplification.},

We know that an individual’s risk for addiction is determined by interactions between genetics and environment and that only a minute fraction of chemical agents share the ability to act on this vulnerability to induce a state of addiction. Repeated exposure to these drugs causes addiction through repeated activation of dopaminergic transmission (and many other actions) in the brain, inducing changes at the molecular, cellular, and synaptic levels that, over time, rewire the circuitry throughout the limbic system. In this Review, I discuss how we are gaining a clearer picture of this drug-induced plasticity—some of which is shared by all addictive drugs, whereas other aspects are specific to certain drug classes—and of the ways in which these adaptations mediate the range of behavioral abnormalities that define the addicted state. Despite the challenges, there is reason for optimism in translating this rich biological understanding of addiction into improved treatments for the many individuals burdened by this illness around the world.},

  abstract     = {Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that acts on its G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) to stimulate appetite and food intake. Signal transduction by GPCRs requires activation of intracellular G proteins in a process involving transient conformational changes in both the receptor and the Gα subunit. Mannes et al . developed synthetic peptides that mimicked the stabilizing effect of Gα q -containing heterotrimers on the active conformation of the ghrelin receptor. Biochemical assays using these peptidomimetics demonstrated that G protein coupling allosterically increased the receptor’s affinity for ghrelin and that G protein activation occurred through a series of distinct interactions with the receptor. The findings demonstrate that G protein activation is a multistep process that may also affect the sensitivity of the ghrelin receptor. —Annalisa M. VanHook G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is a dynamic process involving various conformational intermediates in addition to those captured in static three-dimensional structures. Here, we used newly developed G protein peptidomimetics to characterize the interactions of the ghrelin receptor (GHSR) with G proteins. Coupling to the G protein peptidomimetic not only affected the conformational features of the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor where the G protein binds but also allosterically affected the extracellular ligand-binding pocket. These conformational and allosteric changes increased the affinity of G protein–coupled GHSR for the endogenous agonist ghrelin. In addition, our data identified different complexes along the G protein activation pathway that differed in the engagement of the Gα q C-terminal helix. Given that this helix is the main link between the activated receptor and the Gα nucleotide-binding pocket, these findings suggested a stepwise process involving distinct states in GPCR-catalyzed G protein activation. Collectively, our results provide evidence for the dynamic behavior of GPCR–G protein signaling complexes, with such dynamics most likely contributing to signaling selectivity and/or efficacy.},

The interaction of R-RAS2 with ITAMs facilitated GDP-GTP exchange in the nucleotide binding pocket of R-RAS2 to induce R-RAS2 activation. Thus, ITAMs act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors that ensure basal R-RAS2 signaling in lymphocytes. —Annalisa M. VanHook The small GTPase R-RAS2 regulates homeostatic proliferation and survival of T and B lymphocytes and, when present in high amounts, drives the development of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In normal and leukemic lymphocytes, R-RAS2 constitutively binds to antigen receptors through their immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and promotes tonic activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying this direct interaction and its consequences for R-RAS2 activity. R-RAS2 exhibited direct, high-affinity interactions with ITAM peptides derived from B and T cell receptors through a proline-rich sequence in the hypervariable domain of R-RAS2. In resting T and B cells, the presence of antigen receptors at the plasma membrane was sufficient to promote the activation of R-RAS2 and PI3K, and mutations that abolished the interaction of R-RAS2 with ITAMs reduced R-RAS2 signaling. Binding to ITAMs increased GDP-GTP exchange on R-RAS2 through a mechanism distinct from that by which conventional cytosolic guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate RAS proteins. These results define antigen receptors as noncanonical GEFs involved in the basal activation state of R-RAS2 in lymphocytes. Such a mechanism may underlie the leukemic transformation of B cells that occurs when wild-type R-RAS2 is present in high amounts.},

Lai et al . developed an adult fly model of manganese-induced parkinsonism and found that altered metabolism of biotin (also known as vitamin B 7 ) mediated the metal’s neurotoxicity. Manganese exposure reduced the amount of “free” or bioavailable biotin, which resulted in neuronal loss and mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in the brain and impaired motor function. Supplementing the flies’ diet with biotin alongside manganese exposure prevented these effects. The cellular effects were reproduced in cultured human dopaminergic neurons. The findings suggest that supplementary biotin may be a preventive intervention for at-risk individuals. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Chronic exposure to manganese (Mn) induces manganism and has been widely implicated as a contributing environmental factor to Parkinson’s disease (PD), featuring notable overlaps between the two in motor symptoms and clinical hallmarks. Here, we developed an adult Drosophila model of Mn toxicity that recapitulated key parkinsonian features, spanning behavioral deficits, neuronal loss, and dysfunctions in lysosomes and mitochondria. Metabolomics analysis of the brain and body tissues of these flies at an early stage of toxicity identified systemic changes in the metabolism of biotin (also known as vitamin B 7 ) in Mn-treated groups. Biotinidase-deficient flies showed exacerbated Mn-induced neurotoxicity, parkinsonism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Supplementing the diet of wild-type flies with biotin ameliorated the pathological phenotypes of concurrent exposure to Mn. Biotin supplementation also ameliorated the pathological phenotypes of three standard fly models of PD. Furthermore, supplementing the culture media of human induced stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated midbrain dopaminergic neurons with biotin protected against Mn-induced mitochondrial dysregulation, cytotoxicity, and neuronal loss. Last, analysis of the expression of genes encoding biotin-related proteins in patients with PD revealed increased amounts of biotin transporters in the substantia nigra compared with healthy controls, suggesting a potential role of altered biotin metabolism in PD. Together, our findings identified changes in biotin metabolism as underlying Mn neurotoxicity and parkinsonian pathology in flies, for which dietary biotin supplementation was preventative.},

  abstract     = {Interferon signaling induced by activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent weapon in the cellular antiviral arsenal. In addition to stimulating interferon signaling, STING also activates the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Rui et al. found that STING-mediated activation of NF-κB inhibited the replication of DNA and RNA viruses in cultured cells independently of interferon induction. Two unrelated proteins from HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 selectively prevented STING from activating NF-κB and promoted viral replication. These findings demonstrate that STING-dependent activation of NF-κB may play a broad antiviral role in cells and that viruses have evolved mechanisms for interfering with it. —Annalisa M. VanHook Activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway by cytosolic DNA leads to the activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Although many viruses produce proteins that inhibit IRF3-dependent antiviral responses, some viruses produce proteins that inhibit STING-induced NF-κB activation without blocking IRF3 activation. Here, we found that STING-activated, NF-κB–dependent, and IRF3-independent innate immunity inhibited the replication of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the RNA virus coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), and the retrovirus HIV-1. The HIV-1 nonstructural protein Vpu bound to STING and prevented it from interacting with the upstream NF-κB pathway kinase inhibitor of NF-κB subunit β (IKKβ), thus blocking NF-κB signaling. This function of Vpu was conserved among Vpu proteins from diverse HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus strains and was distinct from its action in disrupting other host antiviral pathways. Furthermore, the ORF3a protein from the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 also promoted viral replication by interacting with STING and blocking STING-induced activity of NF-κB but not of IRF3. These findings demonstrate that diverse viral proteins have convergently evolved to selectively inhibit NF-κB–mediated innate immunity downstream of STING activation, suggesting that targeting this pathway may represent a promising antiviral strategy.},

  abstract     = {The tyrosine kinase BTK is important for lymphocyte function. BTK binds to phosphatidylinositols in the plasma membrane through its pleckstrin- and tec-homology (PH-TH) domains, the dimerization of which can increase BTK activity. Eisen et al . analyzed how PH-TH dimerization contributes to BTK signaling in Ramos B cells and Jurkat T cells. Their mutagenesis assays revealed that PH-TH module dimerization and BTK kinase activity were both required for BTK signaling in Jurkat cells, but not in Ramos cells. This work provides insight into the noncatalytic roles of BTK in lymphocytes. —Amy E. Baek Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a major drug target in immune cells. The membrane-binding pleckstrin homology and tec homology (PH-TH) domains of BTK are required for signaling. Dimerization of the PH-TH module strongly stimulates the kinase activity of BTK in vitro. Here, we investigated whether BTK dimerizes in cells using the PH-TH module and whether this dimerization is necessary for signaling. To address this question, we developed high-throughput mutagenesis assays for BTK function in Ramos B cells and Jurkat T cells. We measured the fitness costs for thousands of point mutations in the PH-TH module and kinase domain to assess whether dimerization of the PH-TH module and BTK kinase activity were necessary for function. In Ramos cells, we found that neither PH-TH dimerization nor kinase activity was required for BTK signaling. Instead, in Ramos cells, BTK signaling was enhanced by PH-TH module mutations that increased membrane adsorption, even at the cost of reduced PH-TH dimerization. In contrast, in Jurkat cells, we found that BTK signaling depended on both PH-TH dimerization and kinase activity. Evolutionary analysis indicated that BTK proteins in organisms that evolved before the divergence of ray-finned fishes lacked PH-TH dimerization but had active kinase domains, similar to other Tec family kinases. Thus, PH-TH dimerization is a distinct feature of BTK that evolved to exert stricter regulatory control on kinase activity as adaptive immune systems gained increased complexity.},

  abstract     = {Macrophages adapt to prior exposure to pathogens, in part, by undergoing epigenetic changes mediated by the formation of stimulus-specific enhancers. The associated histone modifications and changes in transcription factor activity generate an immune memory that determines responses to subsequent exposures to the same stimuli. Through signaling network analysis and epigenomic profiling of primary mouse macrophages deficient in distinct transcription factors, Chavez et al. determined the temporal and combinatorial effects of different members of the IRF family of transcription factors on epigenetic remodeling. Together, these findings show how IRF1 acts in combination with other transcription factors to mediate epigenetic reprogramming in macrophages. —John F. Foley Macrophages exposed to immune stimuli reprogram their epigenomes to alter their subsequent functions. Exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes widespread nucleosome remodeling and the formation of thousands of de novo enhancers. We dissected the regulatory logic by which the network of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) induces the opening of chromatin and the formation of de novo enhancers. We found that LPS-activated IRF3 mediated de novo enhancer formation indirectly by activating the type I interferon (IFN)–induced ISGF3. However, ISGF3 was generally needed to collaborate with IRF1, particularly where chromatin was less accessible. At these locations, IRF1 was required for the initial opening of chromatin, with ISGF3 extending accessibility and promoting the deposition of H3K4me1, marking poised enhancers. Because IRF1 expression depends on the transcription factor NF-κB, which is activated in infected but not bystander cells, IRF-regulated enhancers required activation of both the IRF3 and NF-κB branches of the innate immune signaling network. However, type II IFN (IFN-γ), which is typically produced by T cells, may also induce IRF1 expression through the STAT1 homodimer GAF. We showed that, upon IFN-γ stimulation, IRF1 was also responsible for opening inaccessible chromatin sites that could then be exploited by GAF to form de novo enhancers. Together, our results reveal how combinatorial logic gates of IRF1-ISGF3 or IRF1-GAF restrict immune epigenomic memory formation to macrophages exposed to pathogens or IFN-γ–secreting T cells but not bystander macrophages exposed transiently to type I IFN.},

  abstract     = {Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is common, lifelong, and often in a latent state with periodic reactivation. It is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease and dementia in some individuals, as are repeated head injuries like concussions. Cairns et al. found that latent HSV-1 was reactivated by repeated mechanical injury to mimic concussions in a three-dimensional human brain tissue model. This mechanism triggered the aggregation of β amyloid and other pathological features associated with neurodegenerative diseases in a manner dependent on the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. The findings directly link two risk factors in a mechanism that may contribute to dementia-related disease. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the brains of APOE4 carriers increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously found that latent HSV-1 in a three-dimensional in vitro model of APOE4 -heterozygous human brain tissue was reactivated in response to neuroinflammation caused by exposure to other pathogens. Because traumatic brain injury also causes neuroinflammation, we surmised that brain injury might similarly reactivate latent HSV-1. Here, we examined the effects of one or more controlled blows to our human brain model in the absence or presence of latent HSV-1 infection. After repeated, mild controlled blows, latently infected tissues showed reactivation of HSV-1; the production and accumulation of β amyloid and phosphorylated tau (which promotes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration); and activated gliosis, which is associated with destructive neuroinflammation. These effects are collectively associated with AD, dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and were increased with additional injury but were absent in mock-infected tissue. Blocking the cytokine IL-1β prevented the induction of amyloid and gliosis in latently infected monolayer cultures after scratch wounding. We thus propose that after repeated mechanical injuries to the brain, such as from direct blows to the head or jarring motions of the head, the resulting reactivation of HSV-1 in the brain may contribute to the development of AD and related diseases in some individuals.},
