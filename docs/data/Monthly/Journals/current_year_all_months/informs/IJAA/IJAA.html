  abstract = {Freight transportation marketplace rates are typically challenging to forecast accurately. However, these forecasted rates impact a company’s overall costs and play a key role in the management of the company’s shipping network and the procurement of supply on the open marketplace. In this work, we develop a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and build a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and, hence, translates the forecasting problem into a linear regression, and the signature kernel, which allows for comparing efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon middle-mile trucking operations with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models even during periods of extreme disruption, such as the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020 and the onset of the Ukraine conflict in early 2022. Furthermore, our technique captures the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold with an estimated annualized savings of more than $50 million per year since 2021.

  abstract = {Efficient last-mile logistics is the key underpinning for sustainable e-commerce growth. As the final leg of delivery services, last-mile delivery is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that requires careful operational planning and execution. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel zoning optimization framework that determines the assignment of customer locations to last-mile delivery stations for Ninja Van, a leading logistics service provider in Southeast Asia, to improve operational efficiency and work equity. The main technical development is a data-driven zoning optimization model that integrates the additively weighted Voronoi diagram and vehicle routing problem through a subgradient algorithm. The algorithm exploits the primal-dual formulation of the partitioning problem and is flexible enough to handle practical delivery scenarios with varying vehicle capacities and travel speeds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first zoning optimization model that considers general multivehicle zones with uncertain demand, and these are the main contextual features of Ninja Van and many other logistics companies. The zoning algorithm we develop provides preferable theoretical guarantees. The implementation of the new zoning system at Ninja Van led to an average reduction of 6.6% in the work span for the delivery stations and a 3.5% reduction in driver delivery times. In addition to the monetary benefits from the shortened work hours, the new zoning system contributed to improved worker welfare by balancing workloads and limiting overtime. This zoning optimization also brought transparency and valuable insights into the management of delivery stations and drivers at Ninja Van.

  abstract = {This paper presents data-driven approaches for integrated assortment planning and inventory allocation that significantly improve fulfillment efficiency at JD.com, a leading e-commerce company. JD.com uses a two-level distribution network that includes regional distribution centers (RDCs) and front distribution centers (FDCs). Selecting products to stock at FDCs and then, optimizing daily inventory allocation from RDCs to FDCs are critical to improving fulfillment efficiency, which is crucial for enhancing customer experiences. For assortment planning, we propose efficient algorithms to maximize the number of orders that can be fulfilled by FDCs (local fulfillment). For inventory allocation, we develop a novel end-to-end algorithm that integrates forecasting, optimization, and simulation to minimize lost sales and inventory-transfer costs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches, increasing local order fulfillment rates by 0.54%, and our inventory allocation algorithm increases FDC demand satisfaction rates by 1.05%. Considering the high-volume operations of JD.com, with millions of weekly orders per region, these improvements yield substantial benefits beyond the company’s established supply chain system. Implementation across JD.com’s network has reduced costs, improved stock availability, and increased local order fulfillment rates for millions of orders annually.

  abstract = {Heritage railways are railway operations that are not mainstream and serve as a reminiscence of past railways to build a cultural and national identity. They are among the main forms of heritage tourism. The heritage railway industry differs fundamentally from other forms of tourism and travel because of the significantly large fraction of volunteers in its workforce; additionally, heritage railways are of an extremely smaller scale than mainstream railways, with lower annual revenues. Although the regular railway industry extensively uses mathematical decision-making technologies for its daily operations, there is little evidence and few case studies demonstrating such value for heritage railways. Among the first of such studies, we present our experiences in using mathematical optimization models that improved the workforce allocation at a premier UK-based heritage railway company: Swanage Railways. Our collaboratively developed optimization models show four hours of reduction in weekly overtime for some employees during emergencies. If volunteers are efficiently integrated into the workforce, we find a reduction in overall workload by 26.7% for some of the existing employees. Finally, our models present a potential to reduce staffing costs by up to 35% if an hourly wage system is used instead of a fixed salary system. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Collaborations between researchers and businesses can significantly benefit both parties. However, it can be challenging for researchers to form lasting ties with businesses. The challenge is particularly salient for early career researchers who have yet to build track records and for new technology ventures that must carefully allocate their scarce resources. Our purpose is to articulate the benefits and key success factors of such researcher-venture collaborations. We do so with a case study of a now-prominent European crowdinvesting platform with which we have collaborated since its nascence. Our collaboration yielded significant impact for academia by advancing scholarly knowledge and for the venture through both concrete and intangible benefits. In addition to data and insight, the collaboration also introduced new practices in the venture’s data-driven decision making. Building on our experiences and interviews with key managers, we propose seven key success factors for mutually beneficial researcher-venture collaborations: pursuing collaborations proactively, cultivating agility, being physically present, respecting business priorities, communicating results promptly, translating research to business language, and leveraging institutional backing. We offer practical guidance for early career researchers on how to build successful collaborations with technology ventures. The study provides insights for ventures into the benefits of collaborating with researchers. History: This paper was refereed.

We developed a unique method to overbook surgeon blocks: assigning more OR block time than we have OR capacity available, to improve OR access. The challenge lies in managing the process of overbooking and ensuring fairness so that no one surgeon is more affected by overbooking compared with others. Using mixed-integer quadratic programming, we enable block overbooking while applying a consistent definition of fairness. This effort was implemented into routine operations through our simplified process, and it was deployed as a web tool for the surgical staff to manage and communicate decisions. Overbooking blocks contributed an additional 2% and 3.5% to OR utilization at the two campuses where it was deployed. This work enables surgeons, scheduling managers, and surgical leadership to manage operating room use beyond physical capacity, reliably and optimally. History: This paper was refereed.},

Instructors can turn problem sets into AI tutoring sessions: a custom-made GPT guides a student through the problems and the student uploads the chatlog for their homework submission. Instructors can assign different labs to each section of a class and have each section create AI assistants to help the other sections work through their labs. This tutorial advocates the natural language programming (NLP) paradigm, in which students articulate desired data transformations with a spoken language, such as English, and then use AI to generate the corresponding computer code.

  abstract = {Rehabilitation care consists of a wide variety of treatments organized in appointment series for individual and group therapy. Blueprint scheduling is a tactical approach to support appointment booking at the operational level. A blueprint schedule prescribes both the timing of group therapy sessions and the allocation of therapist and treatment room capacity to these sessions and thus defines which appointment types can be booked on which time slots. It facilitates providing treatment at the right time, by the right therapist(s), at a suitable location, and with a therapy load equally spread over day and week. This paper presents a structured generic approach for tactical capacity planning in multidisciplinary rehabilitation care. The generic approach includes optimization of a blueprint schedule using mixed-integer linear programming that was integrated in a decision support tool. We applied our approach in the rehabilitation center of Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. The resulting blueprint schedule enables Sint Maartenskliniek to meet demand for rehabilitation care at the right time, by the right therapist(s), and at a suitable location while spreading the therapy load. Our approach can be applied in similar multidisciplinary care settings, potentially improving quality of care, quality of labor, and costs of care. History: This paper was refereed.

  abstract = {Previous research describes 10 contextual complications that exist in the application of applying analytical models and how they impact the models and modeling approaches themselves. These complications are pervasive and, because they affect the constructs of the modeler, must be better understood by practitioners who implement such models and researchers in order to increase the robustness, appropriateness, and usefulness of the models themselves. This research surveys the extent of the presence of these factors and the extent to which they affected modeling efforts in 76 different published applications via an author survey. It finds that the factors are pervasive and their importance to the appropriateness and success of the modeling efforts is high. Further, it finds a strong interaction factor between them, with underlying business and project constructs on which the factors align. As a result, it seems that a line of research geared toward identifying and overcoming these factors would aid in the application of analytical models and demonstrate the applied value of the profession. For practitioners, it is of high value to be aware of and consider these contextual factors when implementing models in order to improve their probability of success.

  abstract = {In this research, our objective is to review the northbound transportation network from the United States to Canada for a major Canadian courier company and assess the efficiency of intermediate gateway locations. The aim is to streamline transshipment operations in the United States and reduce lead times on the Canadian side of the supply chain. We develop an integer programming formulation that takes into account hundreds of possible gateway locations in U.S. cities and demand from thousands of U.S. customers shipping to Canada as options for gateway facilities to perform the following: (i) ensure that gateways are assigned in a cost-effective manner and possibly consolidate gateways based on the customer list and shipping volumes, (ii) assign gateways to customers based on their respective destinations, and (iii) route an optimal number of trucks from gateways to major destinations in Canada. Our formulation led to four main reconfigurations that initiated a series of comprehensive analyses of the business processes at the company, which, in turn, resulted in four actionable recommendations. These recommendations were assessed by the company’s key decision makers with respect to their operational costs and other considerations and were estimated to yield a cost savings of around US$782,767 per year. According to our industrial partner, the realized cost savings after implementation surpassed the estimated amount by nearly US$500,000. History: This paper was refereed. Funding: E.

Therefore, through a university-industry collaboration, we have identified (1) modernizing the optimization engine in paratransit scheduling software suites, and (2) incorporating alternative service providers in paratransit service optimization as two critical steps in overcoming some challenges in paratransit practice. We thus developed a nested decomposition method in which a column generation–based solution approach is embedded in a temporal decomposition framework. Additionally, we integrated alternative service types, such as accessible taxis, in paratransit scheduling and designed a reoptimization procedure. The new optimization methods were implemented in a software suite of IT Curves and deployed in paratransit operations in the Washington, DC, metro area. It was found that the improved optimization engine, relative to the legacy, led to significant improvements in key operational metrics and yielded substantial operating cost reductions (approximately 15%). The fruitful collaboration not only showcases the potential for advanced algorithms to significantly enhance the financial sustainability of paratransit services but also reflects the importance of bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application in transit vehicle routing.

  abstract = {This tutorial paper discusses underrepresented practical perspectives in the operations research literature, which primarily focuses on theoretical advancements rather than documenting successful real-world applications. Drawing on experience in academia, business, and humanitarian organizations, the authors identify seven crucial—yet often overlooked—components essential for a successful analytics implementation. These components are change management, data management, model selection and validation, project management, promotion and advocacy, scoping, and software. Despite the prevalence of analytics research, these components are seldom discussed in academic literature, leaving a gap between theory and practice in analytics. We emphasize the importance of these components to achieve impactful analytics interventions and call for a more comprehensive approach to analytics research. By bridging the gap between hard analytics (mathematical modeling) and soft analytics (practical implementation), the tutorial highlights the need for scholars and practitioners to collaborate and exchange insights for more effective real-world applications of analytics.

  abstract = {Conducting a spend analysis of procurement practices is a challenging task for manufacturers. It requires deciphering large-scale spend data in the form of unstructured texts and identifying opportunities for savings. This process relies on procurement experts’ know-how and is often performed manually, a laborious task often leading to missed savings opportunities. Automating spend analysis through natural language processing and machine learning presents several challenges, such as (i) a lack of true detailed category labels for suppliers, (ii) a lack of sufficiently large sets of training data, (iii) hierarchical taxonomies that vary across manufacturers, and (iv) the reduced accuracy of hierarchical categorization algorithms beyond two levels. Our novel three-component classification model tackles these issues, facilitating the automation of spend analysis and the replication of procurement experts’ decision-making processes. By processing input data composed of unstructured spend texts from Cranswick PLC, a leading UK food producer, our model delivers accurate supplier categorizations that pinpoint areas ripe for substantial savings. This approach not only shows greater accuracy compared with existing benchmark models but also aids in identifying key product categories and suppliers for cost-saving initiatives. By simulating the application, we project that our method could bring annual savings of £16 million to £22 million ($20 million to $28 million) for Cranswick PLC, illustrating the significant advantages of automating spend analysis.

  abstract = {Because of a constant increase in the variety and number of parts required for assembly, part provision to the border of line requires careful orchestration. Therefore, every part must be assigned to the most suitable feeding policy, determining logistical in-house processes, presorting degree, and load carrier sizing. This assignment allows effective space management at the border of line while avoiding unnecessary intralogistics activities. Furthermore, timely part delivery necessitates decisions on vehicle type selection and delivery frequencies. In this research, we adapt an existing optimization model to the specific case of a machinery manufacturing company, validating the model for practical usage. The model aims to achieve cost minimization through optimal part feeding policy and vehicle type selection decisions, considering various constraints related to space availability at the border of line and the capacity of transportation vehicles. Our results reveal that the optimal assignment reduces costs by 56% compared with the company’s current assignment. Although the optimal assignment requires additional capacity investments for the company, we also test various restrictive solutions by adding practically relevant constraints. The latter still results in minimum cost savings of 23%, compared with the current assignment. Besides the cost benefits, the number of different line feeding policies is reduced. This streamlines the process, making it more conducive to automation. History: This paper was refereed. Funding: Financial support from Universiteit Gent is gratefully acknowledged.},

  abstract = {A preliminary estimation of construction costs is a crucial operation of any project related to civil engineering. An accurate estimation ensures a proper management of the available funds and helps the project managers in their decision-making processes. For instance, it is common that specific subtasks of the project are delegated to private subcontractors. Through a call for tenders, each eventual subcontractor has the opportunity to propose a bid with a price for supplying the service. Because the call is generally public, a competition may arise between subcontractors. This impacts the price proposed by the competitors to get the contract. In order to select a subcontractor, the project manager needs to have an accurate idea of a reasonable price for the subtask given. A price higher than expected is undesirable, but a price significantly lower than expected may also result in poor quality of service. The project manager must also be able to explain to stakeholders why a price is suited and justify why a specific subcontractor has been selected. Providing an estimation that is both accurate and transparent is a hard problem for the project manager. A growing trend is to leverage machine learning for this estimation, but designing a model that is both accurate and explainable is still a challenge. Another difficulty is that an approach that is accurate for estimating the cost of a subtask may not be efficient for another one. Based on this context, this paper introduces a framework for estimating construction costs while tackling both challenges. It is based on six machine learning models and on Shapley additive explanations. This project was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility, a public agency responsible for transport infrastructure in Quebec, Canada. Experiments were carried out on real data, covering historical road construction costs of 11,646 contracts and eight subtasks from 2014 to 2021. Results show that the framework is able to surpass the accuracy of human estimations by up to 31.56% while being able to adequately explain how the estimations have been obtained.

The focus is on addressing a variant of the vehicle routing problem faced by Delhivery, a leading logistics company in India, to improve its midmile operations. The problem involves enhancing a complex distribution network with more than 3,000 locations, which can be closely described as a multidepot fleet size and mix site-dependent asymmetric distance-constrained vehicle routing problem with time windows. The study also considers the geographic scope of the network, which has not been previously explored in the literature. A novel mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented along with a powerful hybrid evolutionary search algorithm that has been tested in many real-world routing problems. Additionally, a novel insertion algorithm that significantly reduces computational time is introduced. Furthermore, the capabilities of the algorithm are expanded to determine the optimal locations for new hubs within Delhivery’s network. The proposed algorithm achieves significant cost savings of nearly 7.3% and offers various managerial advantages. The algorithm converges rapidly and automates the entire planning and operations process, resulting in improved overall efficiency. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Framework agreements (FAs) are procurement mechanisms used in private and public organizations by which a central procurement agency selects an assortment of products, typically through auctions, and then affiliated organizations can purchase from the selected assortment as needs arise. In Chile’s central procurement agency (ChileCompra), FAs accounted for 23% of the procurement expenditures during 2018–2019. However, descriptive analysis of purchase transaction data suggests that some FAs exhibited low levels of competition in the auctions used to select the suppliers, which could potentially result in larger government expenditures. We collaborated with ChileCompra to redesign FAs to enhance competition introducing two important changes: (i) standardize the product catalog using natural language processing algorithms and (ii) use this product standardization to induce more competition in the auctions to select suppliers. These changes were implemented through an experimental approach in a redesigned food FA to measure its impact, showing that inducing more intense competition in the auction stage reduced transaction prices by 8%. This pilot study ultimately led ChileCompra to implement a similar design in all its FAs, and many of the improvements in the design of the FAs were included in the new regulation on government purchases. If we were to extrapolate the savings from our pilot redesign to all these FAs, the total savings would amount to around $74 million in 2022. History: This paper was refereed.

The day-to-day planning of up to 15,000 long-distance rides was previously a complex and daunting task split over dozens of subcontractors. Transvision, CQM, and Geodan developed an optimization solution that combines the rides into efficient taxi routes. Starting in January 2020, this solution significantly improved the mobility challenge for elderly and disabled citizens, including (1) increased punctuality and a 50% improvement in passenger satisfaction, (2) savings of 15 million driving kilometers per year, and (3) combined financial savings for all stakeholders of 60 million euros over the years 2019 to 2023 and another total of 30 million euros projected for 2024 and 2025, according to conservative estimates. Daily planning in a single batch can range from 1,000 to 15,000 rides. To construct high-quality ride plans in reasonable time for this massive-scale operations research problem, we applied classical operations research techniques viewed through a modern lens. In this paper, we explain how practical large-scale dial-a-ride problems can be solved using high-quality heuristics that exploit the power of parallel processing. Furthermore, we present new and efficient techniques to perform the required millions to billions of calculations to determine distances and driving times on the Dutch road network. We overcome several practical challenges such as (1) aligning the interests of a vulnerable passenger group and over 60 different taxi operators, (2) aligning the software that interfaces with the various companies, and (3) adapting to changing regulations and ad hoc COVID-19 measures.},

  abstract = {In steel manufacturing, continuous annealing is a crucial heat treatment applied to cold-rolled steel strips to achieve a prescribed temperature, which will ensure quality in terms of mechanical properties. However, controlling this process is challenging because of slow furnace temperature dynamics, significant time delays, frequent changes in the steel mass flow rate, target annealing temperature changes induced by steel grade transitions, and multivariable interactions within the furnace zones. To address these challenges, Tata Steel, India, with consultancy support from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, developed a novel model predictive control (MPC) technology-based solution for a continuous annealing furnace, which produces automotive grade steels. The dynamic model was developed using data from both perturbation trials and scraping historical processes. We then converted the model to a discrete-time state-space form and used it to formulate an optimal control problem over a moving time window. The solution generates optimal furnace setpoints by solving this finite-horizon optimal control problem each minute, ensuring smooth temperature transitions during steel grade changes while avoiding operational constraint violations. Tata Steel successfully implemented an MPC-based real-time supervisory optimal control solution, which became fully operational in January 2023. The implementation of the solution has led to a significant improvement in the proportion of annealed products meeting the premium quality band (±5°C of the target temperature), increasing from 30% (manually operated) to 50% (MPC operated), thereby ensuring better uniformity of properties. Furthermore, an 8% reduction in products outside the widest band (±15°C) has prevented the reprocessing of 13,000 tons of material from one line alone, annually. We have seen a consistent 8% reduction in specific fuel consumption per ton of steel. When considering Tata Steel’s current installations and those under commissioning, these improvements translate to savings of US$2.5 million and a reduction of 10,000 tons of CO 2 emissions annually.},

This initiative combines advanced analytics and operations research with employee engagement to optimize product life cycles of special buys products. The solution components include (1) multiperiod mixed-integer optimization (MIP) models for product order decisions to warehouses; (2) XGBoost classification for store product allocation (SAM); (3) a proprietary algorithm (ANA) for just-in-time reallocations between stores; (4) a multiperiod dynamic programming model (DAVE) developed in 2021 for nationwide inventory clearance; (5) an advanced version for inventory clearance, the DAVE stochastic dynamic programming model (DAVE SDP), introduced in 2023; (6) a multivariate regression model for budget allocations for markdowns on small product leftover quantities for incorporating store employee involvement; and (7) a smartphone application (Market-Whispering) to engage 50,000 employees in product selection. This paper focuses on the MIP, which optimizes the decision on stock order quantities to warehouses. We examine this in conjunction with ANA and DAVE because of their significant influence on operational efficiency. For DAVE, we examine two variants: the reference model DAVE and DAVE SDP. The project faced coordination challenges and required a strategic shift from decentralized to centralized approaches. Proprietary software for the special buys product range improved operational efficiency, positively impacting the daily operations of 40,000 store employees, and led to annual savings of several million euros in Germany.},

Halfspace and Molslinjen jointly developed and deployed a successful forecasting and revenue management toolbox for the data-driven operation of ferries in Denmark since 2020. This has resulted in $2.6–3.2 million yearly savings (and a total of $5 million savings as of December 2023), a significant reduction in the number of delayed departures and average delays, and a 3% reduction in fuel costs and emissions. This toolbox relies on some of the latest advances in machine learning for forecasting and in analytics approaches to revenue management. The potential for generalizing our toolbox to the global ferry industry is significant, with an impact on both revenues and environmental, societal, and governance criteria.},
