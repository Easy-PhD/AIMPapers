  abstract     = {This paper compares the optimal investment problems based on monotone mean-variance (MMV) and mean-variance (MV) preferences in a Lévy market with an untradable stochastic factor. It is an open question proposed by Trybuła and Zawisza. Using the dynamic programming and Lagrange multiplier methods, we get the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations corresponding to the two investment problems. The equations are transformed into a new-type parabolic equation, from which the optimal strategies under both preferences are derived. We prove that the two optimal strategies and value functions coincide if and only if an important market assumption holds. When the assumption is violated, MMV investors act differently from MV investors. Thus, we conclude that the difference between continuous-time MMV and MV portfolio selections is due to the discontinuity of the market. In addition, we derive the efficient frontier and analyze the economic impact of the jump diffusion risky asset. We also provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the validity of the assumption in real financial markets.

The main result gives sufficient conditions for the absence of a duality gap and the existence of dual solutions in a locally convex space of random variables. It implies, in particular, the necessity of scenario-wise optimality conditions that are behind many fundamental results in operations research, stochastic optimal control, and financial mathematics. Our analysis builds on the theory of Fréchet spaces of random variables whose topological dual can be identified with the direct sum of another space of random variables and a space of singular functionals. The results are illustrated by deriving sufficient and necessary optimality conditions for several more specific problem classes. We obtain significant extensions to earlier models, for example, on stochastic optimal control, portfolio optimization, and mathematical programming.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new Langevin dynamics based algorithm, called the extended tamed hybrid ε -order polygonal unadjusted Langevin algorithm (e-TH ε O POULA), to solve optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, which naturally appear in real-world applications such as quantile estimation, vector quantization, conditional value at risk (CVaR) minimization, and regularized optimization problems involving rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the e-TH ε O POULA algorithm. More precisely, under the conditions that the stochastic gradient is locally Lipschitz in average and satisfies a certain convexity at infinity condition, we establish nonasymptotic error bounds for e-TH ε O POULA in Wasserstein distances and provide a nonasymptotic estimate for the expected excess risk, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small. Three key applications in finance and insurance are provided, namely, multiperiod portfolio optimization, transfer learning in multiperiod portfolio optimization, and insurance claim prediction, which involve neural networks with (Leaky)-ReLU activation functions. Numerical experiments conducted using real-world data sets illustrate the superior empirical performance of e-TH ε O POULA compared with SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics), TUSLA (tamed unadjusted stochastic Langevin algorithm), adaptive moment estimation, and Adaptive Moment Estimation with a Strongly Non-Convex Decaying Learning Rate in terms of model accuracy.

  abstract     = {Stochastic Gradient (SG) is the de facto iterative technique to solve stochastic optimization (SO) problems with a smooth (nonconvex) objective f and a stochastic first-order oracle. SG’s attractiveness is due in part to its simplicity of executing a single step along the negative subsampled gradient direction to update the incumbent iterate. In this paper, we question SG’s choice of executing a single step as opposed to multiple steps between subsample updates. Our investigation leads naturally to generalizing SG into Retrospective Approximation (RA), where, during each iteration, a “deterministic solver” executes possibly multiple steps on a subsampled deterministic problem and stops when further solving is deemed unnecessary from the standpoint of statistical efficiency. RA thus formalizes what is appealing for implementation—during each iteration, “plug in” a solver—for example, L-BFGS line search or Newton-CG— as is , and solve only to the extent necessary. We develop a complete theory using relative error of the observed gradients as the principal object, demonstrating that almost sure and L 1 consistency of RA are preserved under especially weak conditions when sample sizes are increased at appropriate rates. We also characterize the iteration and oracle complexity (for linear and sublinear solvers) of RA and identify a practical termination criterion leading to optimal complexity rates. To subsume nonconvex f , we present a certain “random central limit theorem” that incorporates the effect of curvature across all first-order critical points, demonstrating that the asymptotic behavior is described by a certain mixture of normals. The message from our numerical experiments is that the ability of RA to incorporate existing second-order deterministic solvers in a strategic manner might be important from the standpoint of dispensing with hyper-parameter tuning.

  abstract     = {Dividing a multilayered cake under nonoverlapping constraints captures several scenarios (e.g., allocating multiple facilities over time where each agent can utilize at most one facility simultaneously). We establish the existence of an envy-free multidivision that is nonoverlapping and contiguous within each layer when the number of agents is a prime power, solving partially an open question by Hosseini et al. [Hosseini H, Igarashi A, Searns A (2020) Fair division of time: Multi-layered cake cutting. Proc. 29th Internat. Joint Conf. Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) , 182–188; Hosseini H, Igarashi A, Searns A (2020) Fair division of time: Multi-layered cake cutting. Preprint, submitted April 28, http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13397 ]. Our approach follows an idea proposed by Jojić et al. [Jojić D, Panina G, Živaljević R (2021) Splitting necklaces, with constraints. SIAM J. Discrete Math. 35(2):1268–1286] for envy-free divisions, relying on a general fixed-point theorem. We further design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the two-layer, three-agent case, with monotone preferences. All results are actually established for divisions among groups of almost the same size. In the one-layer, three-group case, our algorithm is able to deal with any predetermined sizes, still with monotone preferences. For three groups, this provides an algorithmic version of a recent theorem by Segal-Halevi and Suksompong [Segal-Halevi E, Suksompong W (2021) How to cut a cake fairly: A generalization to groups.

  abstract     = {Online advertising has motivated interest in online selection problems. Displaying ads to the right users benefits both the platform (e.g., via pay-per-click) and the advertisers (by increasing their reach). In practice, not all users click on displayed ads, while the platform’s algorithm may miss the users most disposed to do so. This mismatch decreases the platform’s revenue and the advertiser’s chances to reach the right customers. With this motivation, we propose a secretary problem where a candidate may or may not accept an offer according to a known probability p . Because we do not know the top candidate willing to accept an offer, the goal is to maximize a robust objective defined as the minimum over integers k of the probability of choosing one of the top k candidates, given that one of these candidates will accept an offer. Using Markov decision process theory, we derive a linear program for this max-min objective whose solution encodes an optimal policy. The derivation may be of independent interest, as it is generalizable and can be used to obtain linear programs for many online selection models. We further relax this linear program into an infinite counterpart, which we use to provide bounds for the objective and closed-form policies. For p ≥ p * ≈ 0.6 , an optimal policy is a simple threshold rule that observes the first p 1 / ( 1 − p ) fraction of candidates and subsequently makes offers to the best candidate observed so far.

We prove that the core of housing markets respects improvement in the following sense: given an allocation in the core of H in which agent a receives a house h , if the value of the house owned by a increases, then the resulting housing market admits an allocation in its core in which a receives either h or a house that a prefers to h ; moreover, such an allocation can be found efficiently.

  abstract     = {The minimization of nonlower semicontinuous functions is a difficult topic that has been minimally studied. Among such functions is a Heaviside composite function that is the composition of a Heaviside function with a possibly nonsmooth multivariate function. Unifying a statistical estimation problem with hierarchical selection of variables and a sample average approximation of composite chance constrained stochastic programs, a Heaviside composite optimization problem is one whose objective and constraints are defined by sums of possibly nonlinear multiples of such composite functions. Via a pulled-out formulation, a pseudostationarity concept for a feasible point was introduced in an earlier work as a necessary condition for a local minimizer of a Heaviside composite optimization problem. The present paper extends this previous study in several directions: (a) showing that pseudostationarity is implied by (and thus, weaker than) a sharper subdifferential-based stationarity condition that we term epistationarity; (b) introducing a set-theoretic sufficient condition, which we term a local convexity-like property, under which an epistationary point of a possibly nonlower semicontinuous optimization problem is a local minimizer; (c) providing several classes of Heaviside composite functions satisfying this local convexity-like property; (d) extending the epigraphical formulation of a nonnegative multiple of a Heaviside composite function to a lifted formulation for arbitrarily signed multiples of the Heaviside composite function, based on which we show that an epistationary solution of the given Heaviside composite program with broad classes of B-differentiable component functions can in principle be approximately computed by surrogation methods.

  abstract     = {We consider multipopulation Bayesian games with a large number of players. Each player aims at minimizing a cost function that depends on this player’s own action, the distribution of players’ actions in all populations, and an unknown state parameter. We study the nonatomic limit versions of these games and introduce the concept of Bayes correlated Wardrop equilibrium, which extends the concept of Bayes correlated equilibrium to nonatomic games. We prove that Bayes correlated Wardrop equilibria are limits of action flows induced by Bayes correlated equilibria of the game with a large finite set of small players. For nonatomic games with complete information admitting a convex potential, we prove that the set of correlated and of coarse correlated Wardrop equilibria coincide with the set of probability distributions over Wardrop equilibria and that all equilibrium outcomes have the same costs. We get the following consequences. First, all flow distributions of (coarse) correlated equilibria in convex potential games with finitely many players converge to mixtures of Wardrop equilibria when the weight of each player tends to zero. Second, for any sequence of flows satisfying a no-regret property, its empirical distribution converges to the set of distributions over Wardrop equilibria, and the average cost converges to the unique Wardrop cost.

  abstract     = {We study a network formation game where n players, identified with the nodes of a directed graph to be formed, choose where to wire their outgoing links in order to maximize their PageRank centrality. Specifically, the action of every player i consists in the wiring of a predetermined number d i of directed out-links, and her utility is her own PageRank centrality in the network resulting from the actions of all players. We show that this is a potential game and that the best response correspondence always exhibits a local structure in that it is never convenient for a node i to link to other nodes that are at incoming distance more than d i from her. We then study the equilibria of this game determining necessary conditions for a graph to be a (strict, recurrent) Nash equilibrium. Moreover, in the homogeneous case, where players all have the same number d of out-links, we characterize the structure of the potential-maximizing equilibria, and in the special cases d = 1 and d = 2, we provide a complete classification of the set of (strict, recurrent) Nash equilibria. Our analysis shows in particular that the considered formation mechanism leads to the emergence of undirected and disconnected or loosely connected networks.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the optimal dividend problem with capital injection and ratcheting constraint with nondecreasing dividend payout rate. Capital injections are introduced in order to eliminate the possibility of bankruptcy. Under the Cramér–Lundberg risk model, the problem is formulated as a two-dimensional stochastic control problem. By applying the viscosity theory, we show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution to the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. In order to obtain analytical results, we further study the problem with finite ratcheting constraint, where the dividend rate takes only a finite number of available values. We show that the value function under general ratcheting can be approximated arbitrarily closely by the one with finite ratcheting. Finally, we derive the expressions of value function when the threshold-type finite ratcheting dividend strategy with capital injection is applied, and we show the optimality of such a strategy under certain conditions of concavity. Numerical examples under various scenarios are provided at the end. Funding W.

It is well-known that spectral functions can be expressed as a composite function of symmetric functions and eigenvalue functions. We establish several second-order properties of spectral functions when their associated symmetric functions enjoy these properties. Our main attention is given to characterize parabolic regularity for this class of functions. It was observed recently that parabolic regularity can play a central rule in ensuring the validity of important second-order variational properties, such as twice epi-differentiability. We demonstrates that for convex spectral functions, their parabolic regularity amounts to that of their symmetric functions. As an important consequence, we calculate the second subderivative of convex spectral functions, which allows us to establish second-order optimality conditions for a class of matrix optimization problems.

The class of functions we consider are defined as compositions of low-dimensional nonlinear functions with affine functions. Extended formulations describing the convex hull of such sets can easily be constructed via disjunctive programming although a direct application of this method often yields prohibitively large formulations, whose size is exponential in the number of variables. In this paper, we propose a new disjunctive representation of the sets under study, which leads to compact formulations with size exponential in the dimension of the nonlinear function but polynomial in the number of variables. Moreover, we show how to project out the additional variables for the case of dimension one, recovering or generalizing known results for the convex hulls of such sets (in the original space of variables). Our computational results indicate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of solvers in structured problems.

  abstract     = {We study the interplay between inventory replenishment policies and information sharing in the context of a two-tier supply chain with a single supplier and a single retailer serving an independent and identically distributed Gaussian market demand. We investigate how the retailer’s inventory policy impacts the supply chain’s cumulative expected long-term average inventory costs C in two extreme information-sharing cases: (a) full information sharing and (b) no information sharing. To find the retailer’s inventory policy that minimizes C , we formulate an infinite-dimensional optimization problem whose decision variables are the MA( ∞ ) coefficients that characterize a stationary ordering policy. Under full information sharing, the optimization problem admits a simple solution and the optimal policy is given by an MA(1) process. On the other hand, to solve the optimization problem under no information sharing, we reformulate the optimization from its time domain formulation to an equivalent z -transform formulation in which the decision variables correspond to elements of the Hardy space H 2 . This alternative representation allows us to use a number of results from H 2 theory to compute the optimal value of C and characterize a sequence of ϵ -optimal inventory policies under some mild technical conditions. By comparing the optimal solution under full information sharing and no information sharing, we derive a number of important practical takeaways. For instance, we show that there is value in information sharing if and only if the retailer’s optimal policy under full information sharing is not invertible with respect to the sequence of demand shocks. Furthermore, we derive a fundamental mathematical identity that reveals the value of information sharing by exploiting the canonical Smirnov–Beurling inner–outer factorization of the retailer’s orders when viewed as an element of H 2 . We also show that the value of information sharing can grow unboundedly when the cumulative supply chain costs are dominated by the supplier’s inventory costs. Funding: R.

Specifically, we define dynamic uncertainty sets designed explicitly for discrete stochastic processes over a finite time horizon. These dynamic uncertainty sets capture the uncertainty surrounding stochastic processes and models, accounting for factors such as distributional ambiguity. Examples of uncertainty sets include those induced by the Wasserstein distance and f -divergences. We further define dynamic robust risk measures as the supremum of all candidates’ risks within the uncertainty set. In an axiomatic way, we discuss conditions on the uncertainty sets that lead to well-known properties of dynamic robust risk measures, such as convexity and coherence. Furthermore, we discuss the necessary and sufficient properties of dynamic uncertainty sets that lead to time-consistencies of dynamic robust risk measures. We find that uncertainty sets stemming from f -divergences lead to strong time-consistency whereas the Wasserstein distance results in a new time-consistent notion of weak recursiveness. Moreover, we show that a dynamic robust risk measure is strong time-consistent or weak recursive if and only if it admits a recursive representation of one-step conditional robust risk measures arising from static uncertainty sets.

Through developing an equivalent Lagrangian function-like primal-dual saddle point system for the VI model in question, we introduce an augmented Lagrangian primal-dual method, called ALAVI (Augmented Lagrangian Approach to Variational Inequality) in the paper, for solving a general constrained VI model. Under an assumption, called the primal-dual variational coherence condition in the paper, we prove the convergence of ALAVI. Next, we show that many existing generalized monotonicity properties are sufficient—though by no means necessary—to imply the abovementioned coherence condition and thus are sufficient to ensure convergence of ALAVI. Under that assumption, we further show that ALAVI has in fact an o ( 1 / k ) global rate of convergence where k is the iteration count. By introducing a new gap function, this rate further improves to be O ( 1 / k ) if the mapping is monotone. Finally, we show that under a metric subregularity condition, even if the VI model may be nonmonotone, the local convergence rate of ALAVI improves to be linear. Numerical experiments on some randomly generated highly nonlinear and nonmonotone VI problems show the practical efficacy of the newly proposed method. Funding: L. Zhao and D.

Given a stochastic process modeling the value of an asset, one player observes and can act on the process continuously, whereas the other player can act on it only periodically at independent Poisson arrival times. The first one to stop receives a reward, different for each player, whereas the other one gets nothing. We study how each player balances the maximization of gains against the maximization of the likelihood of stopping before the opponent. In such a setup driven by a Lévy process with positive jumps, we not only prove the existence but also explicitly construct a Nash equilibrium with values of the game written in terms of the scale function.

  abstract     = {We study a class of polynomial optimization problems with a robust polynomial matrix inequality (PMI) constraint where the uncertainty set itself is also defined by a PMI. These can be viewed as matrix generalizations of semi-infinite polynomial programs because they involve actually infinitely many PMI constraints in general. Under certain sum-of-squares (SOS)-convexity assumptions, we construct a hierarchy of increasingly tight moment-SOS relaxations for solving such problems. Most of the nice features of the moment-SOS hierarchy for the usual polynomial optimization are extended to this more complicated setting. In particular, asymptotic convergence of the hierarchy is guaranteed, and finite convergence can be certified if some flat extension condition holds true. To extract global minimizers, we provide a linear algebra procedure for recovering a finitely atomic matrix-valued measure from truncated matrix-valued moments. As an application, we are able to solve the problem of minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of a polynomial matrix subject to a PMI constraint. If SOS convexity is replaced by convexity, we can still approximate the optimal value as closely as desired by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs and certify global optimality in case that certain flat extension conditions hold true. Finally, an extension to the nonconvexity setting is provided under a rank 1 condition.

  abstract     = {By adopting a distributional viewpoint on law-invariant convex risk measures, we construct dynamic risk measures (DRMs) at the distributional level. We then apply these DRMs to investigate Markov decision processes, incorporating latent costs, random actions, and weakly continuous transition kernels. Furthermore, the proposed DRMs allow risk aversion to change dynamically. Under mild assumptions, we derive a dynamic programming principle and show the existence of an optimal policy in both finite and infinite time horizons. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for the optimality of deterministic actions. For illustration, we conclude the paper with examples from optimal liquidation with limit order books and autonomous driving.

  abstract     = {Robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used for applications of dynamic optimization in uncertain environments and have been studied extensively. Many of the main properties and algorithms of MDPs, such as value iteration and policy iteration, extend directly to RMDPs. Surprisingly, there is no known analog of the MDP convex optimization formulation for solving RMDPs. This work describes the first convex optimization formulation of RMDPs under the classical sa-rectangularity and s-rectangularity assumptions. By using entropic regularization and exponential change of variables, we derive a convex formulation with a number of variables and constraints polynomial in the number of states and actions, but with large coefficients in the constraints. We further simplify the formulation for RMDPs with polyhedral, ellipsoidal, or entropy-based uncertainty sets, showing that, in these cases, RMDPs can be reformulated as conic programs based on exponential cones, quadratic cones, and nonnegative orthants. Our work opens a new research direction for RMDPs and can serve as a first step toward obtaining a tractable convex formulation of RMDPs.

Although the latter can be understood as the limiting case of the former, the derivation of optimality conditions requires substantially different approaches. We apply them to a linear elliptic partial differential equation with random inputs. In the probabilistic case, we rely on the spherical-radial decomposition of Gaussian random vectors in order to formulate fully explicit optimality conditions involving a spherical integral. In the almost sure case, we derive optimality conditions and compare them with a model based on robust constraints with respect to the (compact) support of the given distribution.

Agents equipped with norm-based preferences that use a norm to measure the distance from their ideal policy vote sequentially and issue by issue via simple majority. If the underlying norm is generated by an inner product—such as the Euclidean norm—then the voting outcome is order independent if and only if the issues are orthogonal. If the underlying norm is a general one, then the outcome is order independent if the basis defining the issues to be voted upon satisfies the following property; for any vector in the basis, any linear combination of the other vectors is Birkhoff–James orthogonal to it. We prove a partial converse in the case of two dimensions; if the underlying basis fails this property, then the voting order matters.

  abstract     = {Computing the maximum size of an independent set in a graph is a famously hard combinatorial problem that has been well studied for various classes of graphs. When it comes to random graphs, the classic Erdős–Rényi–Gilbert random graph G n , p has been analyzed and shown to have the largest independent sets of size Θ ( log n ) with high probability (w.h.p.) This classic model does not capture any dependency structure between edges that can appear in real-world networks. We define random graphs G n , p r whose existence of edges is determined by a Markov process that is also governed by a decay parameter r ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] . We prove that w.h.p. G n , p r has independent sets of size ( 1 − r 2 + ε ) n log n for arbitrary ε > 0 . This is derived using bounds on the terms of a harmonic series, a Turán bound on a stability number, and a concentration analysis for a certain sequence of dependent Bernoulli variables that may also be of independent interest. Because G n , p r collapses to G n , p when there is no decay, it follows that having even the slightest bit of dependency (any r < 1 ) in the random graph construction leads to the presence of large independent sets, and thus, our random model has a phase transition at its boundary value of r = 1. This implies that there are large matchings in the line graph of G n , p r , which is a Markov random field. For the maximal independent set output by a greedy algorithm, we deduce that it has a performance ratio of at most 1 + log n ( 1 − r ) w.h.p. when the lowest degree vertex is picked at each iteration and also show that, under any other permutation of vertices, the algorithm outputs a set of size Ω ( n 1 / 1 + τ ) , where τ = 1 / ( 1 − r ) and, hence, has a performance ratio of O ( n 1 2 − r ) .

  abstract     = {In practice, optimization models are often prone to unavoidable inaccuracies because of dubious assumptions and corrupted data. Traditionally, this placed special emphasis on risk-based and robust formulations, and their focus on “conservative” decisions. We develop, in contrast, an “optimistic” framework based on Rockafellian relaxations in which optimization is conducted not only over the original decision space but also jointly with a choice of model perturbation. The framework enables us to address challenging problems with ambiguous probability distributions from the areas of two-stage stochastic optimization without relatively complete recourse, probability functions lacking continuity properties, expectation constraints, and outlier analysis. We are also able to circumvent the fundamental difficulty in stochastic optimization that convergence of distributions fails to guarantee convergence of expectations. The framework centers on the novel concepts of exact and limit-exact Rockafellians, with interpretations of “negative” regularization emerging in certain settings. We illustrate the role of Phi-divergence, examine rates of convergence under changing distributions, and explore extensions to first-order optimality conditions. The main development is free of assumptions about convexity, smoothness, and even continuity of objective functions. Numerical results in the setting of computer vision and text analytics with label noise illustrate the framework.

This optimization problem can be used to recover a planted rank-one tensor from noisy observations. We formulate rank-one BTF as the problem of minimizing a linear function over a highly structured multilinear set. Leveraging on our prior results regarding the facial structure of multilinear polytopes, we propose novel linear programming relaxations for rank-one BTF. We then establish deterministic sufficient conditions under which our proposed linear programs recover a planted rank-one tensor. To analyze the effectiveness of these deterministic conditions, we consider a semirandom model for the noisy tensor and obtain high probability recovery guarantees for the linear programs. Our theoretical results as well as numerical simulations indicate that certain facets of the multilinear polytope significantly improve the recovery properties of linear programming relaxations for rank-one BTF.

Breakthroughs occur when market conditions become favorable enough, exceeding a threshold value that is ex ante unknown to the firm. The Markov state variables for the optimal investment policy are the current market conditions and their historic maximum, and the firm optimally invests in the stand-alone technology only when market conditions deteriorate enough after reaching a maximum. The path-dependent return required for investing in the stand-alone technology is always higher than if no technological breakthroughs could occur and can take arbitrarily large values following certain histories.

Information acquisition is costly for the expert and crucially not verifiable by the principal. The expert is compensated by the principal with a menu of state-contingent payments. We provide a full characterization of the set of all menus that implement (respectively, strictly implement) each signal. Moreover, we provide a closed-form characterization for the expected cost for the cheapest such menu, which we call proxy cost of the signal. Surprisingly, in general, the proxy cost is neither increasing in the Blackwell order nor posterior separable, even when the expert’s cost function is posterior separable itself. Subsequently, we study the full-agency problem (by introducing a downstream decision), thus endogenizing the signal. We show that there is always an optimal signal that can be strictly implemented, meaning that it is without loss of generality to exogenously restrict attention to strict implementation. As a result, similarly to Bayesian persuasion, the complexity of the principal’s optimal signal is bounded by the cardinality of the state space. Finally, we present some applications of interest.

This format has recently been adopted by the Professional Darts Corporation. Depending on the seedings of the players used for each of the knockout tournaments, players can meet in the various rounds (e.g., first round, second round … semifinal, final) of the knockout tournaments. Following a fairness principle of treating all players equal, we identify an attractive property of an SKCl each pair of players should potentially meet equally often in each of the rounds of the SKC. If the seedings are such that this property is indeed present, we call the resulting SKC stable . In this note, we formalize this notion, and we address the following question. Do there exist seedings for each of the knockout tournaments such that the resulting SKC is stable? We show using a connection to the Fano plane that the answer is yes for eight players, and we prove that the resulting SKC is unique up to permutations of the players. We further prove that stable SKCs exist for any numbers of players that are a power of two, and we provide stable schedules for competitions on 16 and 32 players. Funding: The research of F.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a strongly convex stochastic optimization problem and propose three classes of variable sample-size stochastic first-order methods: (i) the standard stochastic gradient descent method, (ii) its accelerated variant, and (iii) the stochastic heavy-ball method. In each scheme, the exact gradients are approximated by averaging across an increasing batch size of sampled gradients. We prove that when the sample size increases at a geometric rate, the generated estimates converge in mean to the optimal solution at an analogous geometric rate for schemes (i)–(iii). Based on this result, we provide central limit statements, whereby it is shown that the rescaled estimation errors converge in distribution to a normal distribution with the associated covariance matrix dependent on the Hessian matrix, the covariance of the gradient noise, and the step length. If the sample size increases at a polynomial rate, we show that the estimation errors decay at a corresponding polynomial rate and establish the associated central limit theorems (CLTs). Under certain conditions, we discuss how both the algorithms and the associated limit theorems may be extended to constrained and nonsmooth regimes. Finally, we provide an avenue to construct confidence regions for the optimal solution based on the established CLTs and test the theoretical findings on a stochastic parameter estimation problem.

We then extend this method to an asymptotic setting. Next, we apply this method to compute confidence intervals for the true solution of a stochastic variational inequality given a solution to a sample average approximation (SAA) problem for the general situation in which the asymptotic distribution of SAA solutions is piecewise normal.

Optimal strategies involve the optimization of observation times as well as the subsequent action values. We consider the finite horizon and discounted infinite horizon problems as well as an extension with parameter uncertainty. By including the time elapsed from observations as part of the augmented Markov system, the value function satisfies a system of quasivariational inequalities (QVIs). Such a class of QVIs can be seen as an extension to the interconnected obstacle problem. We prove a comparison principle for this class of QVIs, which implies the uniqueness of solutions to our proposed problem. Penalty methods are then utilized to obtain arbitrarily accurate solutions.

  abstract     = {We initiate the study of episodic reinforcement learning (RL) under adversarial corruptions in both the rewards and the transition probabilities of the underlying system, extending recent results for the special case of multiarmed bandits. We provide a framework that modifies the aggressive exploration enjoyed by existing reinforcement learning approaches based on optimism in the face of uncertainty by complementing them with principles from action elimination. Importantly, our framework circumvents the major challenges posed by naively applying action elimination in the RL setting, as formalized by a lower bound we demonstrate. Our framework yields efficient algorithms that (a) attain near-optimal regret in the absence of corruptions and (b) adapt to unknown levels of corruption, enjoying regret guarantees that degrade gracefully in the total corruption encountered. To showcase the generality of our approach, we derive results for both tabular settings (where states and actions are finite) and linear Markov decision process settings (where the dynamics and rewards admit a linear underlying representation). Notably, our work provides the first sublinear regret guarantee that accommodates any deviation from purely independent and identically distributed transitions in the bandit-feedback model for episodic reinforcement learning.

Our general setting allows for multiple exercise rights—that is, optimal multiple stopping—for a robust evaluation that accounts for model uncertainty with a dominated family of priors and for general reward processes driven by multidimensional jump-diffusions. Our approach relies on first establishing robust martingale dual representation results for the multiple stopping problem that satisfy appealing almost sure pathwise optimality properties. Next, we exploit these theoretical results to develop upper and lower bounds that, as we formally show, not only converge to the true solution asymptotically, but also constitute genuine prelimiting upper and lower bounds.

We show a γ + 1 / 2 + O ( 1 / γ ) price of anarchy for liquid welfare when valuations are additive. This is in stark contrast to sequential second-price auctions, where the resulting liquid welfare can be arbitrarily smaller than the maximum liquid welfare, even when γ = 1 . We prove a lower bound of γ on the liquid welfare loss under the given assumption in first-price auctions. Our liquid welfare results extend when buyers have submodular valuations over the set of items they win across iterations with a slightly worse price of anarchy bound of γ + 1 + O ( 1 / γ ) compared with the guarantee for the additive case.

Moreover, they illuminate p -cones as a curious example of a class of objects that possess properties in three dimensions that they do not in four or more. Using our error bounds, we analyse least squares problems with p -norm regularization, where our results enable us to compute the corresponding Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz exponents for previously inaccessible values of p . Another application is a (relatively) simple proof that most p -cones are neither self-dual nor homogeneous. Our error bounds are obtained under the framework of facial residual functions, and we expand it by establishing for general cones an optimality criterion under which the resulting error bound must be tight.

The agent’s problem is to seek for optimal effort given the compensation scheme proposed by the principal over a random horizon. Then, given the optimal agent’s response, the principal determines the best compensation scheme in terms of running payment, retirement, and lump-sum payment at retirement. A golden parachute is a situation where the agent ceases any effort at some positive stopping time and receives a payment afterward, possibly under the form of a lump-sum payment or of a continuous stream of payments. We show that a golden parachute only exists in certain specific circumstances. This is in contrast with the results claimed by Sannikov, where the only requirement is a positive agent’s marginal cost of effort at zero. In the general case, we prove that an agent with positive reservation utility is either never retired by the principal or retired above some given threshold (as in Sannikov’s solution). We show that different discount factors induce a facelifted utility function , which allows us to reduce the analysis to a setting similar to the equal-discount rates one. Finally, we also confirm that an agent with small reservation utility does have an informational rent, meaning that the principal optimally offers him a contract with strictly higher utility than his participation value.},

  abstract     = {Consider a system of identical server pools where tasks with exponentially distributed service times arrive as a time-inhomogeneous Poisson process. An admission threshold is used in an inner control loop to assign incoming tasks to server pools, while in an outer control loop, a learning scheme adjusts this threshold over time to keep it aligned with the unknown offered load of the system. In a many-server regime, we prove that the learning scheme reaches an equilibrium along intervals of time when the normalized offered load per server pool is suitably bounded and that this results in a balanced distribution of the load. Furthermore, we establish a similar result when tasks with Coxian distributed service times arrive at a constant rate and the threshold is adjusted using only the total number of tasks in the system. The novel proof technique developed in this paper, which differs from a traditional fluid limit analysis, allows us to handle rapid variations of the first learning scheme, triggered by excursions of the occupancy process that have vanishing size. Moreover, our approach allows us to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the system with Coxian distributed service times without relying on a fluid limit of a detailed state descriptor.

This estimator can be seen as a least squares estimator subject to an upper bound on some measure of smoothness. Another useful estimator is the one that minimizes the degree of smoothness subject to an upper bound on the average of squared errors. We prove that these two estimators are computable as solutions to quadratic programs, establish the consistency of these estimators and their partial derivatives, and study the convergence rate as n → ∞ .

  abstract     = {It is well-known that the McCormick relaxation for the bilinear constraint z = xy gives the convex hull over the box domains for x and y . In network applications where the domain of bilinear variables is described by a network polytope, the McCormick relaxation, also referred to as linearization, fails to provide the convex hull and often leads to poor dual bounds. We study the convex hull of the set containing bilinear constraints z i , j = x i y j where x i represents the arc-flow variable in a network polytope, and y j is in a simplex. For the case where the simplex contains a single y variable, we introduce a systematic procedure to obtain the convex hull of the above set in the original space of variables, and show that all facet-defining inequalities of the convex hull can be obtained explicitly through identifying a special tree structure in the underlying network. For the generalization where the simplex contains multiple y variables, we design a constructive procedure to obtain an important class of facet-defining inequalities for the convex hull of the underlying bilinear set that is characterized by a special forest structure in the underlying network. Computational experiments conducted on different applications show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving the dual bounds obtained from alternative techniques.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with composite optimization problems having the objective function formed as the sum of two terms; one has a Lipschitz continuous gradient along random subspaces and may be nonconvex, and the second term is simple and differentiable but possibly nonconvex and nonseparable. Under these settings, we design a stochastic coordinate proximal gradient method that takes into account the nonseparable composite form of the objective function. This algorithm achieves scalability by constructing at each iteration a local approximation model of the whole nonseparable objective function along a random subspace with user-determined dimension. We outline efficient techniques for selecting the random subspace, yielding an implementation that has low cost per iteration, also achieving fast convergence rates. We present a probabilistic worst case complexity analysis for our stochastic coordinate proximal gradient method in convex and nonconvex settings; in particular, we prove high-probability bounds on the number of iterations before a given optimality is achieved. Extensive numerical results also confirm the efficiency of our algorithm.

  abstract     = {A robust-to-dynamics optimization (RDO) problem is an optimization problem specified by two pieces of input: (i) a mathematical program (an objective function f : R n → R and a feasible set Ω ⊆ R n ) and (ii) a dynamical system (a map g : R n → R n ). Its goal is to minimize f over the set S ⊆ Ω of initial conditions that forever remain in Ω under g . The focus of this paper is on the case where the mathematical program is a linear program and where the dynamical system is either a known linear map or an uncertain linear map that can change over time. In both cases, we study a converging sequence of polyhedral outer approximations and (lifted) spectrahedral inner approximations to S . Our inner approximations are optimized with respect to the objective function f , and their semidefinite characterization—which has a semidefinite constraint of fixed size—is obtained by applying polar duality to convex sets that are invariant under (multiple) linear maps. We characterize three barriers that can stop convergence of the outer approximations to S from being finite. We prove that once these barriers are removed, our inner and outer approximating procedures find an optimal solution and a certificate of optimality for the RDO problem in a finite number of steps. Moreover, in the case where the dynamics are linear, we show that this phenomenon occurs in a number of steps that can be computed in time polynomial in the bit size of the input data. Our analysis also leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for RDO instances where the spectral radius of the linear map is bounded above by any constant less than one. Finally, in our concluding section, we propose a broader research agenda for studying optimization problems with dynamical systems constraints , of which RDO is a special case. Funding: O.

  abstract     = {This paper provides a finite-time analysis of linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithms with fixed step size, a core method in statistics and machine learning. LSA is used to compute approximate solutions of a d -dimensional linear system A ¯ θ = b ¯ for which ( A ¯ , b ¯ ) can only be estimated by (asymptotically) unbiased observations { ( A ( Z n ) , b ( Z n ) ) } n ∈ N . We consider here the case where { Z n } n ∈ N is an a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables sequence or a uniformly geometrically ergodic Markov chain. We derive p th moment and high-probability deviation bounds for the iterates defined by LSA and its Polyak–Ruppert-averaged version. Our finite-time instance-dependent bounds for the averaged LSA iterates are sharp in the sense that the leading term we obtain coincides with the local asymptotic minimax limit. Moreover, the remainder terms of our bounds admit a tight dependence on the mixing time t mix of the underlying chain and the norm of the noise variables. We emphasize that our result requires the LSA step size to scale only with logarithm of the problem dimension d . Funding: The work of A. Durmus and E.

  abstract     = {The traveling tournament problem (TTP) is a hard but interesting sports scheduling problem inspired by Major League Baseball, which is to design a double round-robin schedule such that each pair of teams plays one game in each other’s home venue, minimizing the total distance traveled by all n teams ( n is even). In this paper, we consider TTP-2 (i.e., TTP under the constraint that at most two consecutive home games or away games are allowed for each team). In this paper, we propose practical algorithms for TTP-2 with improved approximation ratios. Because of the different structural properties of the problem, all known algorithms for TTP-2 are different for n /2 being odd and even, and our algorithms are also different for these two cases. For even n /2, our approximation ratio is 1 + 3 / n , improving the previous result of 1 + 4 / n . For odd n /2, our approximation ratio is 1 + 5 / n , improving the previous result of 3 / 2 + 6 / n . In practice, our algorithms are easy to implement. Experiments on well-known benchmark sets show that our algorithms beat previously known solutions for all instances with an average improvement of 5.66%.

We start by establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of a stationary opinion distribution on any fixed graph, and then provide an increasingly detailed characterization of its behavior by considering a sequence of directed random graphs having a local weak limit. Our most explicit results are obtained for graph sequences whose local weak limit is a marked Galton-Watson tree, in which case our model can be used to explain a variety of phenomena, for example, conditions under which consensus can be achieved, mechanisms in which opinions can become polarized, and the effect of disruptive stubborn agents on the formation of opinions.

  abstract     = {We consider the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) G I / G I / n queue and prove the first simple and explicit bounds that scale as 1 1 − ρ under only the assumption that interarrival times have finite second moment, and service times have finite 2 + ϵ moment for some ϵ > 0 . Here, ρ denotes the corresponding traffic intensity. Conceptually, our results can be viewed as a multiserver analogue of Kingman’s bound. Our main results are bounds for the tail of the steady-state queue length and the steady-state probability of delay. The strength of our bounds (e.g., in the form of tail decay rate) is a function of how many moments of the service distribution are assumed finite. Our bounds scale gracefully, even when the number of servers grows large and the traffic intensity converges to unity simultaneously, as in the Halfin-Whitt scaling regime. Some of our bounds scale better than 1 1 − ρ in certain asymptotic regimes. In these same asymptotic regimes, we also prove bounds for the tail of the steady-state number in service. Our main proofs proceed by explicitly analyzing the bounding process that arises in the stochastic comparison bounds of Gamarnik and Goldberg for multiserver queues. Along the way, we derive several novel results for suprema of random walks and pooled renewal processes, which may be of independent interest. We also prove several additional bounds using drift arguments (which have much smaller prefactors) and point out a conjecture that would imply further related bounds and generalizations. We also show that when all moments of the service distribution are finite and satisfy a mild growth rate assumption, our bounds can be strengthened to yield explicit tail estimates decaying as O ( exp ( − x α ) ) , with α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , depending on the growth rate of these moments.

Specifically, we prove a nonasymptotic error bound between the invariant measures of the approximate model from the algorithm and the limiting diffusion. To establish the error bound, we employ the recently developed Stein’s method for multidimensional diffusions, in which the regularity of Stein’s equation obtained by the partial differential equation (PDE) theory plays a crucial role. We further prove the central limit theorem (CLT) and the moderate deviation principle (MDP) for the occupation measures of the limiting diffusion of G / P h / n + G I queues and its Euler–Maruyama scheme. In particular, the variances in the CLT and MDP associated with the limiting diffusion are determined by Stein’s equation and Malliavin calculus, in which properties of a mollified diffusion and an associated weighted occupation time play a crucial role.

  abstract     = {We present a continuous-time stochastic model of an inventory system with record inaccuracy. In this formulation, demand is modeled by a point process and is observable only when it leads to sales. In addition to demand that can reduce the stock, an unobservable stochastic loss process can also reduce the stock. The retailer’s goal is to identify the restocking and auditing policy that minimizes the expected discounted cost of carrying a product over an infinite horizon. We analytically characterize the optimal restocking and jointly optimal auditing policy. We prove that the optimal restocking policy is a threshold policy. Our proof of this result is based on a coupling argument that is valid for any demand and loss model. Unlike the optimal restocking policy, the jointly optimal auditing policy is not of threshold type. We show that a complete proof of this statement cannot be obtained by solely resorting to the first-order stochastic dominance property of the Bayesian shelf stock distribution induced by the demand and loss process. Instead, our characterization of the jointly optimal auditing policy is based on proving that the dynamics of the shelf stock distribution constitute a (strictly) sign-regular kernel. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that characterizes the optimal policy of a complex control problem by establishing sign regularity of its underlying Markovian dynamics. Our theoretical results lead to a fast algorithm for computing the exact jointly optimal auditing/restocking policy over the problem’s entire state space. This enables comparative statics analysis, which allows us to determine how inventory record inaccuracy affects the economic significance of various cost drivers. This, in turn, allows us to determine when or, better, under what conditions auditing can be an effective tool for reducing the total cost.},

  abstract     = {We study the regret of offline reinforcement learning in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process (MDP). While existing analyses of common approaches, such as fitted Q -iteration (FQI), suggest root- n convergence for regret, empirical behavior exhibits much faster convergence. In this paper, we present a finer regret analysis that exactly characterizes this phenomenon by providing fast rates for the regret convergence. First, we show that given any estimate for the optimal quality function, the regret of the policy it defines converges at a rate given by the exponentiation of the estimate’s pointwise convergence rate, thus speeding up the rate. The level of exponentiation depends on the level of noise in the decision-making problem, rather than the estimation problem. We establish such noise levels for linear and tabular MDPs as examples. Second, we provide new analyses of FQI and Bellman residual minimization to establish the correct pointwise convergence guarantees. As specific cases, our results imply one-over- n rates in linear cases and exponential-in- n rates in tabular cases. We extend our findings to general function approximation by extending our results to regret guarantees based on L p -convergence rates for estimating the optimal quality function rather than pointwise rates, where L 2 guarantees for nonparametric estimation can be ensured under mild conditions.

  abstract     = {In reality, investors are uncertain about the dynamics of risky asset returns. Therefore, investors prefer to make robust investment decisions. In this paper, we propose an α-robust utility maximization problem under uncertain parameters. The investor is allowed to invest in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky asset. The uncertainty about the expected return rate is parameterized by a nonempty set. Different from most existing literature on robust utility maximization problems where investors are generally assumed to be extremely ambiguity averse because they tend to consider only expected utility in the worst-case scenario, we pay attention to the investors who are not only ambiguity averse but also ambiguity seeking. Under power utility, we provide the implicit function representations for the precommitted strategy, equilibrium strategy of the open-loop type, and equilibrium strategy of the closed-loop type. Some properties about the optimal trading strategies, the best-case and worst-case parameters under three different kinds of strategies, are provided.

  abstract     = {We propose and study a new multilevel method for the numerical approximation of a Gibbs distribution π on R d , based on (overdamped) Langevin diffusions. This method relies on a multilevel occupation measure, that is, on an appropriate combination of R occupation measures of (constant-step) Euler schemes with respective steps γ r = γ 0 2 − r , r = 0 , … , R . We first state a quantitative result under general assumptions that guarantees an ε-approximation (in an L 2 -sense) with a cost of the order ε − 2 or ε − 2 | log ε | 3 under less contractive assumptions. We then apply it to overdamped Langevin diffusions with strongly convex potential U : R d → R and obtain an ε-complexity of the order O ( d ε − 2 log 3 ( d ε − 2 ) ) or O ( d ε − 2 ) under additional assumptions on U . More precisely, up to universal constants, an appropriate choice of the parameters leads to a cost controlled by ( λ ¯ U ∨ 1 ) 2 λ ¯ U − 3 d ε − 2 (where λ ¯ U and λ ¯ U respectively denote the supremum and the infimum of the largest and lowest eigenvalue of D 2 U ). We finally complete these theoretical results with some numerical illustrations, including comparisons to other algorithms in Bayesian learning and opening to the non–strongly convex setting.

These parameters also allow us to study bicliques in general graphs. When maximizing the cardinality | A ∪ B | , one finds the stability number α ( G ) , well-known to be polynomial-time computable. When maximizing the product | A | · | B | , one finds the parameter g ( G ), shown to be NP-hard by Peeters in 2003, and when maximizing the ratio | A | · | B | / | A ∪ B | , one finds h ( G ), introduced by Vallentin in 2020 for bounding product-free sets in finite groups. We show that h ( G ) is an NP-hard parameter and, as a crucial ingredient, that it is NP-complete to decide whether a bipartite graph G has a balanced maximum independent set. These hardness results motivate introducing semidefinite programming (SDP) bounds for g ( G ), h ( G ), and α bal ( G ) (the maximum cardinality of a balanced independent set). We show that these bounds can be seen as natural variations of the Lovász ϑ-number, a well-known semidefinite bound on α ( G ) . In addition, we formulate closed-form eigenvalue bounds, and we show relationships among them as well as with earlier spectral parameters by Hoffman and Haemers in 2001 and Vallentin in 2020.

  abstract     = {One of the challenges for multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is designing efficient learning algorithms for a large system in which each agent has only limited or partial information of the entire system. Whereas exciting progress has been made to analyze decentralized MARL with the network of agents for social networks and team video games, little is known theoretically for decentralized MARL with the network of states for modeling self-driving vehicles, ride-sharing, and data and traffic routing. This paper proposes a framework of localized training and decentralized execution to study MARL with the network of states. Localized training means that agents only need to collect local information in their neighboring states during the training phase; decentralized execution implies that agents can execute afterward the learned decentralized policies, which depend only on agents’ current states. The theoretical analysis consists of three key components: the first is the reformulation of the MARL system as a networked Markov decision process with teams of agents, enabling updating the associated team Q-function in a localized fashion; the second is the Bellman equation for the value function and the appropriate Q-function on the probability measure space; and the third is the exponential decay property of the team Q-function, facilitating its approximation with efficient sample efficiency and controllable error. The theoretical analysis paves the way for a new algorithm LTDE-N eural -AC, in which the actor–critic approach with overparameterized neural networks is proposed. The convergence and sample complexity are established and shown to be scalable with respect to the sizes of both agents and states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neural network–based MARL algorithm with network structure and provable convergence guarantee. Funding: X.

We focus on the marginal values, introduced by Mills in 1956 in the context of matrix games—that is, the directional derivatives of the value along any fixed perturbation. We provide a formula for the marginal values of a discounted stochastic game. Further, under mild assumptions on the perturbation, we provide a formula for their limit as the discount rate vanishes and for the marginal values of an undiscounted stochastic game.

In each time step, the platform updates a belief estimate of the parameter based on players’ strategies and realized payoffs using Bayes’ rule. Then, players adopt a generic learning rule to adjust their strategies based on the updated belief. We present results on the convergence of beliefs and strategies and the properties of convergent fixed points of the dynamics. We obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of globally stable fixed points. We also provide sufficient conditions for the local stability of fixed points. These results provide an approach to analyzing the long-term outcomes that arise from the interplay between Bayesian belief learning and strategy learning in games and enable us to characterize conditions under which learning leads to a complete information equilibrium.

We derive a formula that can be used to compute the policy gradient from (state, action, cost) information collected from sample paths of the MDP for each fixed parameterized policy. Unlike the traditional average cost problem, standard stochastic approximation theory cannot be used to exploit this formula. To address the issue, we introduce a truncated and smooth version of the risk-sensitive cost and show that this new cost criterion can be used to approximate the risk-sensitive cost and its gradient uniformly under some mild assumptions. We then develop a trajectory-based gradient algorithm to minimize the smooth truncated estimation of the risk-sensitive cost and derive conditions under which a sequence of truncations can be used to solve the original, untruncated cost problem.

However, their flexibility also incurs a substantial mathematical burden which is usually circumvented by using well-known generic distributional approximations or simulations. This article provides a novel approximation method that tailors the dynamics of a time-homogeneous Markov jump process to meet those of its time-inhomogeneous counterpart on an increasingly fine Poisson grid. Strong convergence of the processes in terms of the Skorokhod J 1 metric is established, and convergence rates are provided. Under traditional regularity assumptions, distributional convergence is established for unconditional proxies, to the same limit. Special attention is devoted to the case where the target process has one absorbing state and the remaining ones transient, for which the absorption times also converge. Some applications are outlined, such as univariate hazard-rate density estimation, ruin probabilities, and multivariate phase-type density evaluation. Funding: M. Bladt and O.

It turns out that the inf-convolution of several Λ VaR is still a Λ VaR under some mild condition. Moreover, we investigate the inf-convolution of one Λ VaR and a general monotone risk measure without cash additivity, including Λ VaR , expected utility, and rank-dependent expected utility as special cases. The expression of the inf-convolution and the explicit forms of the optimal allocation are derived, leading to some partial solution of the risk-sharing problem with multiple Λ VaR for general Λ functions. Finally, we discuss the risk-sharing problem with Λ VaR + , another definition of lambda value at risk.

  abstract     = {We study a class of zero-sum games between a singular controller and a stopper over a finite-time horizon. The underlying process is a multidimensional (locally nondegenerate) controlled stochastic differential equation (SDE) evolving in an unbounded domain. We prove that such games admit a value and provide an optimal strategy for the stopper. The value of the game is shown to be the maximal solution in a suitable Sobolev class of a variational inequality of min-max type with an obstacle constraint and a gradient constraint. Although the variational inequality and the game are solved on an unbounded domain, we do not require boundedness of either the coefficients of the controlled SDE or of the cost functions in the game.

  abstract     = {Motivated by resource allocation problems (RAPs) in power management applications, we investigate the existence of solutions to optimization problems that simultaneously minimize the class of Schur-convex functions, also called least-majorized elements. For this, we introduce a generalization of majorization and least-majorized elements, called ( a , b )-majorization and least ( a , b )-majorized elements, and characterize the feasible sets of problems that have such elements in terms of base and (bi-)submodular polyhedra. Hereby, we also obtain new characterizations of these polyhedra that extend classical characterizations in terms of optimal greedy algorithms from the 1970s. We discuss the implications of our results for RAPs in power management applications and derive a new characterization of convex cooperative games and new properties of optimal estimators of specific regularized regression problems. In general, our results highlight the combinatorial nature of simultaneously optimizing solutions and provide a theoretical explanation for why such solutions generally do not exist.},

Assuming that the samples are generated by a full rank matrix W * of the hidden network node weights, we obtain the following results. We establish that all full-rank approximately stationary solutions of the risk minimization problem are also approximate global optimums of the risk (in-sample and population). As a consequence, we establish that, when trained on polynomially many samples, the gradient descent algorithm converges to the global optimum of the risk minimization problem regardless of the width of the network when it is initialized at some value ν * , which we compute. Furthermore, the network produced by the gradient descent has a near zero generalization error. Next, we establish that initializing the gradient descent algorithm below ν * is easily achieved when the weights of the ground truth matrix W * are randomly generated and the matrix is sufficiently overparameterized. Finally, we identify a simple necessary and sufficient geometric condition on the size of the training set under which any global minimizer of the empirical risk has necessarily zero generalization error.

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in nonconvex minimax problems that is driven by an abundance of applications. Our focus is on nonsmooth, nonconvex-strongly concave minimax, thus departing from the more common weakly convex and smooth models assumed in the recent literature. We present proximal gradient schemes with either parallel or alternating steps. We show that both methods can be analyzed through a single scheme within a unified analysis that relies on expanding a general convergence mechanism used for analyzing nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problems. In contrast to the current literature, which focuses on the complexity of obtaining nearly approximate stationary solutions, we prove subsequence convergence to a critical point of the primal objective and global convergence when the latter is semialgebraic. Furthermore, the complexity results we provide are with respect to approximate stationary solutions. Lastly, we expand the scope of problems that can be addressed by generalizing one of the steps with a Bregman proximal gradient update, and together with a few adjustments to the analysis, this allows us to extend the convergence and complexity results to this broader setting.

  abstract     = {We propose a model uncertainty approach to heavy traffic asymptotics that allows for a high level of uncertainty. That is, the uncertainty classes of underlying distributions accommodate disturbances that are of order 1 at the usual diffusion scale as opposed to asymptotically vanishing disturbances studied previously in relation to heavy traffic. A main advantage of the approach is that the invariance principle underlying diffusion limits makes it possible to define uncertainty classes in terms of the first two moments only. The model we consider is a single-server queue with multiple job types. The problem is formulated as a zero sum stochastic game played between the system controller, who determines scheduling and attempts to minimize an expected linear holding cost, and an adversary, who dynamically controls the service time distributions of arriving jobs and attempts to maximize the cost. The heavy traffic asymptotics of the game are fully solved. It is shown that an asymptotically optimal policy for the system controller is to prioritize according to an index rule, and for the adversary, it is to select distributions based on the system’s current workload. The workload-to-distribution feedback mapping is determined by a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, which also characterizes the game’s limit value. Unlike in the vast majority of results in the heavy traffic theory and as a direct consequence of the diffusive size disturbances, the limiting dynamics under asymptotically optimal play are captured by a stochastic differential equation where both the drift and the diffusion coefficients may be discontinuous.

  abstract     = {We propose and study a new class of polynomial voting rules for a general decentralized decision/consensus system, and more specifically for the proof-of-stake protocol. The main idea, inspired by the Penrose square-root law and the more recent quadratic voting rule, is to differentiate a voter’s voting power and the voter’s share (fraction of the total in the system). We show that, whereas voter shares form a martingale process that converges to a Dirichlet distribution, their voting powers follow a supermartingale process that decays to zero over time. This prevents any voter from controlling the voting process and, thus, enhances security. For both limiting results, we also provide explicit rates of convergence. When the initial total volume of votes (or stakes) is large, we show a phase transition in share stability (or the lack thereof), corresponding to the voter’s initial share relative to the total. We also study the scenario in which trading (of votes/stakes) among the voters is allowed and quantify the level of risk sensitivity (or risk aversion) in three categories, corresponding to the voter’s utility being a supermartingale, a submartingale, and a martingale. For each category, we identify the voter’s best strategy in terms of participation and trading. Funding: W.

Each node is a rational agent and can strategically allocate any incoming flow to the outgoing edges. Given the strategy choices of all agents, a maximal circulation that adheres to the chosen allocation strategies evolves in the network. Each agent wants to maximize the amount of flow through his or her node. Flow allocation games can be used to express strategic incentives of clearing in financial networks. We provide a cumulative set of results on the existence and computational complexity of pure Nash and strong equilibria as well as tight bounds on the (strong) prices of anarchy and stability. Our results show an interesting dichotomy. Ranking strategies over individual flow units allows us to obtain optimal strong equilibria for many objective functions. In contrast, more intuitive ranking strategies over edges can give rise to unfavorable incentive properties.

From a methodological viewpoint, our framework resolves several fundamental limitations of existing uniform convergence and localization analysis approaches. It also provides improvements and some level of unification in the study of localized complexities, one-sided uniform inequalities, and sample-based iterative algorithms. In the so-called “slow rate” regime, we provide the first (moment-penalized) estimator that achieves the optimal variance-dependent rate for general “rich” classes; we also establish an improved loss-dependent rate for standard empirical risk minimization. In the “fast rate” regime, we establish finite-sample, problem-dependent bounds that are comparable to precise asymptotics. In addition, we show that iterative algorithms such as gradient descent and first order expectation maximization can achieve optimal generalization error in several representative problems across the areas of nonconvex learning, stochastic optimization, and learning with missing data.

The objective is to minimize the gap between the cumulative payoffs and the saddle point value of the aggregate payoff function, which we measure using a metric called saddle point regret (SP-Regret). The problem generalizes the online convex optimization framework, but here, we must ensure that both players incur cumulative payoffs close to that of the Nash equilibrium of the sum of the games. We propose an algorithm that achieves SP-Regret proportional to ln ( T ) T in the general case, and log ( T ) SP-Regret for the strongly convex-concave case. We also consider the special case where the payoff functions are bilinear and the decision sets are the probability simplex. In this setting, we are able to design algorithms that reduce the bounds on SP-Regret from a linear dependence in the dimension of the problem to a logarithmic one. We also study the problem under bandit feedback and provide an algorithm that achieves sublinear SP-Regret. We then consider an online convex optimization with knapsacks problem motivated by a wide variety of applications, such as dynamic pricing, auctions, and crowdsourcing. We relate this problem to the online saddle point problem and establish O ( T ) regret using a primal-dual algorithm.},
