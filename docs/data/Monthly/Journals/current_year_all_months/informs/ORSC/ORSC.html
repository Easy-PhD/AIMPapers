  abstract     = {This piece distills lessons for increasing the impact of social science research based on our work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Applied Cooperation Initiative, which facilitates collaborations between social scientists and practitioners to promote real-world prosocial behaviors. We describe an iterative model of collaboration—intervention, randomized trial, publication, and press—that has sustained a robust research pipeline, broadening the dissemination and application of findings. We highlight two promising directions for future research in organizational contexts: (i) adapting interventions to intraorganizational dynamics, in which norms and incentives differ from public settings, and (ii) developing strategies for establishing or reforming counterproductive norms that may hinder organizational performance. We conclude with recommendations for supporting translational research: introducing article types dedicated to translation, removing barriers to publishing practitioner-relevant review articles, streamlining institutional review board and legal processes, and funding cross-institutional collaborations.

  abstract     = {The business world has much to gain from the direct application of research findings to daily business operations. Nevertheless, a large gap remains between the work of business academics and that of business practitioners. With an eye toward closing that gap in applied science, medical publishing has three important lessons for business journals and scholars. First, borrow selectively from medical publishing’s best practices—most notably, by emphasizing evidence over discursive prose; seeing application of research findings as intrinsic to the very purpose of research; elevating the prominence of expert opinions on how and why to implement research; and accelerating research-publication timelines while maintaining rigor. Second, make novel innovations in publishing, such as academic–practitioner coauthorship, recruitment of carefully vetted practitioners to be on industry advisory boards to journals, and journal sponsorship of conferences where academics and practitioners freely exchange ideas. Third, explicitly encourage business researchers to see their published work as actually intending to influence business practices and societal well-being. Just as medical publishing aims, at its core, to improve people’s lives, business research should seek to make a concrete difference in people’s lived experiences.},

  abstract     = {Organizational researchers increasingly call for applied impact, yet institutional structures continue to privilege theoretical novelty over practical relevance. In contrast, engineering fields have built mechanisms that legitimize rigorously validated, usable contributions—often publishing proven solutions before fully developed theories. Drawing on our experiences in both engineering and organizational research, we examine how institutional design—not just individual motivation—shapes what counts as legitimate scholarship. We identify structural levers that support applied impact across three institutional pillars: cognitive (what counts as knowledge), normative (what confers prestige), and regulative (what gets published and rewarded). By analyzing how engineering disciplines use diverse publication formats, evaluation rubrics, and inclusive authorship norms, we outline feasible reforms for organizational research. We propose a framework for institutional redesign that expands the definition of scholarly value while preserving rigor.

  abstract     = {Numerous calls over decades have urged scholars to pursue research that is more relevant to problems faced by organizations and their members. Yet the relevance and impact of our field remains limited compared with other applied sciences. Whereas individual aspects of our research practice, such as expectations about methods, theoretical novelty, and motivating a study, are frequently discussed in our field, less attention is paid to the publication system. Our perspective is that to bring about a field-wide change would require us to identify and address the systemic sources of the issue. Accordingly, we compare publication systems across applied sciences, contrasting organization research with those of impactful applied sciences, such as health sciences, engineering, economics, and design science. We focus on four fundamental elements of publication systems: balance between evidence and theory, diversity of research types accommodated, system responsiveness to real-world challenges, and relationship between exploration and replication. These elements are interdependent, and understanding them together reveals how publication systems can enable or constrain what gets published and its impact, enabling us to identify pathways to reorient publication systems in our field to become a more impactful applied science.

  abstract     = {Women are consistently underrepresented in leadership roles. One contributor may be that women are generally less willing than equally-qualified men to enter competitions (e.g., for jobs or promotions). We draw from research on “stereotype reactance”—the idea that telling people about stereotyped expectations can encourage defiance—to propose and test whether telling women about the gender gap in competition entry can increase their willingness to compete. Our prediction contrasts with prior work on stereotype threat and descriptive norms suggesting that highlighting the gender competition gap might lead women to refrain from competing. In two incentive-compatible, preregistered online experiments, we find that informing women about the gender competition gap increases their likelihood of competing for higher pay, and this effect is mediated by stereotype reactance, consistent with our theorizing. Moreover, exposing both men and women to information about the gender competition gap closes the gap. We then test this informational intervention in a large-scale field experiment on an executive job search platform ( n = 4,245), examining whether telling women about the gender competition gap increases their willingness to compete for leadership roles relative to a control message that tells them about an identity-irrelevant competition gap. We find that relative to our control message, informing women about the gender gap in willingness to compete increases submitted job applications by over 20% on the day of condition assignment. This suggests that women’s willingness to compete is affected not just by confidence, but also by cultural expectations and motivation to defy stereotypical norms.

  abstract     = {This study investigates how market actors legitimize new categories that challenge the foundational understandings of established ones while simultaneously seeking to compete in the same market space. We analyze the development of the U.S. plant-based meat category from 2012 to 2019, focusing on how plant-based meat producers positioned their products as legitimate competitors within the meat category despite their nonanimal origins. We identify three key legitimation strategies used by entrepreneurs: reconfiguring the category basis by reframing the core attributes of meat from animal origin to shared biochemical components; creating experiential congruence by replicating the sensory qualities and social practices associated with traditional meat; and instilling value superiority by emphasizing health, environmental, and ethical benefits along with forward-thinking innovation. Our observations also lead us to theorize what we term category transmutation —a construct for understanding how the successful legitimation of a new category might reshape the meaning and boundaries of an existing one. We envision category transmutation as a process through which an existing category evolves to incorporate both traditional and new subcategories, thereby vertically modifying the category structure. This study advances our understanding of category dynamics and extends the role of cultural entrepreneurship beyond gaining legitimacy to reshaping category systems and market structures, with the potential to drive positive societal changes.},

  abstract     = {Effective strategy development, evaluation, and implementation starts with a comprehensive understanding of strategic problems. However, developing such an understanding is often challenging due to the complexity of such problems and because how they can be solved is not yet known. Managers often oversimplify these problems by focusing on a few symptoms and obvious causes. Research indicates that big picture, abstract thinking helps managers explore underlying causes more flexibly, but it can also lead to overlooking key symptoms that do not fit existing frameworks. Instead, concrete thinking is likely essential for individuals to identify the full range of symptoms characterizing strategic problems. Because symptoms are essential for fully understanding strategic problems—they are the building blocks for managers to build theories about causes—both concrete and abstract thinking may be necessary. Drawing on construal level theory, we propose a construal level shift model. The central claim of our model is that managers benefit from first adopting a low construal level (concrete) thinking when framing strategic problems to identify all relevant symptoms. The benefit of a high construal level (abstract) thinking lies in combining these symptoms more flexibly to theorize more comprehensively about the underlying causes. Two experimental studies and one correlational study, involving samples of working individuals, managers, and experienced executives, support our model. Our findings contribute to the behavioral and knowledge-based views of the firm, the theory-based view of strategy, and managerial cognition research.

  abstract     = {When an organization’s environment changes, communication between its members is essential for a timely response. However, past observational studies suggest that communication declines when an organization is exposed to an adverse environmental event. To understand why this might happen, I examine the effects of competition and scarcity—two common features of adverse events—on information sharing and seeking—the microfoundations of organizational communication. In the present study, interactive groups of experimental participants play a novel n -armed bandit game where they work as salespeople for companies that offer a lot of different products (The Sales Game). Some groups experience stable customer demand, while others are exposed to negative or positive demand shifts. Participants earn variable rewards based on their individual performance, and competition is induced in half of the groups through a small bonus based on relative performance. Participants can choose to exchange information with their peers throughout the task. When participants freely exchange information, the increase in individual performance-based rewards is larger than the tiny competitive bonus. But, participants exposed to this competition share information significantly less often than those who are not. This produces a pattern of communication network contraction consistent with prior observational studies of organizations exposed to adverse events. In contrast to prior research, scarcity (negative demand shifts) has no effect on information exchange. These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between competition, scarcity, and interpersonal communication in organizations. They also have important implications for the design of incentive schemes in modern firms.

For members of these organizations, such political dynamics might create new barriers to their ability to carry out collaborative activities. In a historical case study of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project—an unprecedented partnership between the space programs of the United States and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War—we identify how organizational members navigated the turbulent geopolitical environment. We found that collaborative meetings between organizational members were limited to a supervised space that ensured government oversight but created interactional barriers. Organizational members realized that their ability to overcome these challenges would require them to develop practices outside of the organization, using boundary work to carve out free space outside the purview of political supervision. The free space served as a laboratory in which they reconciled informational, techno-cultural, and ideological differences and created solutions to the challenges they faced in the supervised space through translation work. Our study theorizes how geopolitics complicates the interactional processes of cross-border partnerships and underscores the importance of free space for fostering collaboration amid geopolitical rivalry.

  abstract     = {Despite recent theorizing on the power of rhetorical histories, scholars have yet to consider the dynamics of organizational generations (i.e., collectives defined by temporally proximal organizational entry and shared experiences and memories of organizational events) involved in their creation and long-term effects. Based on a comparative case study of two union organizations that participated in failed initiatives, we produce a parallel process model of cross-generational historical branching explaining the divergent and long-term influences of using history strategically across generational lines. Our model unpacks how theoretically distinct forms of what has been deemed “historical myth” offered by senior generations, while harboring similar utility in building cross-generational support, underlie divergent outcomes regarding how members across generations respond to subsequent failure and, in turn, historically position the initiative. We further suggest these processes have a lingering impact on an organization’s willingness to engage in a subsequent initiative. Our theory sheds light on the ways in which historical myths shared across generational divides, in tandem with the cross-generational mnemonic communities they create, engender divergent, long-term, and potentially unexpected consequences.

  abstract     = {We explore how decision makers utilize external and internal knowledge in problems characterized by temporal complexity where there is a separation between action and outcome. Many strategic and organizational decisions have longer-term consequences, yet behavioral models of learning have underexplored this class of problems. Consequently, we do not know much about the role of external knowledge in tackling temporally complex problems, let alone how it interacts with internal knowledge from experiential learning processes. Our computational analyses show that, although having a greater level of external knowledge is generally advantageous, its positive impact diminishes notably or can even become negative when external knowledge is limited. Surprisingly, decision makers operating with limited external knowledge can perform worse than those without any external guidance at all. In a temporally complex problem, knowing what to do at any given point is not sufficient as one still needs to undertake a long sequence of actions before reaching the goal. In other words, external knowledge does not guarantee that optimal actions will be chosen in subsequent decision-making situations. This dynamic may lead the decision makers to overvalue actions that serve as stepping stones to the available external knowledge and undervalue alternative actions that may provide more desirable paths toward the goal.

  abstract     = {Knowledge workers are increasingly overworked, with negative consequences for both individuals and organizations. Pressures for long hours often come from clients, and the quantification of work has, in many cases, amplified these pressures. We examine when and how workers might rely upon quantification to limit overwork. We draw on data from a 21-month ethnography of information technology worker teams that develop software for clients in finance. We find that although these workers faced overwork pressures, they managed this tension through a process we label “concerted quantification.” This process has three steps. First, team members constructed quantified units based on disparate work tasks to coordinate on a specific set of tasks that would likely limit overwork. Second, workers leveraged these quantified units to create flexibility in when specific work tasks were performed, allowing workers to limit overwork when facing fluctuating work demands. Third, workers promoted quantified units to clients as a standard measure of performance, establishing the completion of these units as a key criterion for work success. Particular substantiations of common characteristics of knowledge work—team autonomy, task expertise, and shared quality norms—are conditions for concerted quantification. Overall, we find that quantifying processes (a) help teams determine an appropriate amount of work to take on without engaging in overwork and (b) set clients’ expectations for the amount of work to be completed. We contribute to research on overwork and quantification by highlighting how quantification can, under certain conditions, support workers in limiting overwork.},

  abstract     = {Humanitarian organizations assisting victims of armed conflict face fragmented and potentially conflicting temporal demands on strategy making. Annual donor funding requires detailed planning, unpredictable outbreaks of war and violence demand quick and flexible decisions, and long-term societal challenges must be addressed over the next decades. Few studies have examined how organizations can achieve temporal fit in such temporally complex environments without accepting internal fragmentation or decoupling from certain temporal demands. We draw on a longitudinal case study of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian organization with the mandate to aid victims of armed conflict, to explore this gap. We find that the ICRC has developed a repertoire of multiple distinct strategy processes tailored to the fragmented temporal demands. These processes include emergency responses, strategic planning, and long-term strategizing. Although each strategy process retained its distinctiveness, their loose coupling ensured a sufficient alignment of resource allocation in pursuit of the organization’s humanitarian mandate. Strong shared principles and an episodic activation of strategy processes helped to manage the inherent complexity of loose coupling. Thus, strategy process repertoires may form a capability supporting strategic decision making in temporally complex environments. Our study contributes to strategy process research by introducing loose coupling as a mechanism for integrating multiple strategy processes with different temporalities, complementing previous studies on strategy processes as a tightly coupled structural context. Furthermore, we advance theorizing on ambitemporality by analyzing how the loose coupling of internal temporal structures may help organizations cope with temporal complexity.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the relationship between the adoption of algorithmic recommendation tools and experiential learning. We argue that the adoption of an algorithmic recommendation tool will harm experiential learning in organizations by limiting knowledge retention and retrieval. We further argue that the adverse relationship between algorithmic tool adoption and experiential learning will be stronger in organizations operating in low-task-difficulty environments than those in high-task-difficulty ones because organizational members in such organizations are likely to rely more on algorithmic recommendations, experiencing higher skill erosion. In addition, the relationship will be stronger in organizations facing low task variety than in those with high task variety, as these organizations are likely to have more rigid routines and in turn experience higher routine disruption after adopting an algorithmic tool. We utilize data on the adoption of an algorithmic tool called a clinical decision support system (CDSS) in a sample of emergency departments in California and utilize a fixed-effects panel regression with control function to test our arguments. We find that the relationship between cumulative experience and mortality becomes significantly weaker after CDSS adoption, suggesting flatter learning curves. We also find evidence that the effect is moderated by task difficulty and task variety. Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16738 .},

On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less.

Reviewers make decisions under different types of cognitive load, such as the necessity to aggregate complex information and workload pressure. To cope with the stress, reviewers might use automatic biases to make decisions faster, which can result in lower organizational diversity. We explore the characteristics of reviewers in a particular setting—patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We leverage quasi-exogenous variation from the random assignment of patent examiners, allowing us to find the causal impact of applicant gender and examiner characteristics on the application success rate. We find evidence that applicants with more female-sounding names have a 3.6-percentage-point lower likelihood of patent approval. We find that a high workload of the examiner leads to a decrease in the likelihood that the patent application of a female inventor would be approved, consistent with theories on coping strategies when experiencing cognitive load. Our results extend to applications filed by teams of inventors. These results suggest that it is essential to manage the stress related to reviewers’ workloads to guarantee a variety of successful candidates.

This study examines the influence of metaphorical framing in corporate communication, particularly its effect on analyst reactions to firms’ acquisition announcements. We theorize and analyze the impact of metaphor families that either emphasize or downplay competition while considering the diverse source domains from which these metaphors originate. We propose a theoretical framework that integrates conceptual metaphor theory with the risk-as-feelings perspective, suggesting that certain metaphors can evoke visceral perceptions of danger. Our findings reveal that using metaphors in acquisition announcements generally elicits negative reactions. Notably, metaphors from the competition family, especially war-related ones signifying competitive aggression, evoke stronger adverse reactions. The detrimental impact of war language substantially diminishes in contexts where aggressive competition is expected. We contribute to strategic communication research by highlighting the contingent influence of metaphorical framing on audience reactions, emphasizing the importance of metaphor families, source domains, and contextual factors.

Using an archival study of the music industry and an online experiment with photographic galleries, we find that evaluations of individual elements (songs, photographs) are influenced by product-level fit (albums, galleries). Elements of misfit products are evaluated less favorably than they would have been otherwise. Moreover, this bias is exacerbated when the evaluation of the whole product is emphasized.

Impression management can generate interest but also heighten expectations beyond an innovation’s capabilities, creating a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and an innovation’s performance. To convince critical audiences, entrepreneurs need to not just manage impressions but also show how their innovations will integrate and work in situ. Yet, little research explains what happens when symbolic actions meet their limits. How do entrepreneurs respond when critical audiences challenge their symbolic actions? We examine how 28 digital health start-ups were challenged by a critical audience (buyers), revealing a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and the performance of their innovations. We examine how entrepreneurs managed this gap with buyers at 13 organizations and identify three pathways. Continuing to manage impressions obfuscated the discovery of integration work, widening the gap. Iterating with substantive adaptations did not sufficiently narrow the gap. Only entrepreneurs who recalibrated expectations were able to enlist buyers in the mutual discovery of integration work. These entrepreneurs shared the costs of narrowing the gap with buyers, despite earlier symbolic promises. We contribute to an emerging appreciation of the duality of symbolic actions by explaining what happens when entrepreneurs’ symbolic actions are challenged and how their responses can exacerbate or eradicate that challenge.

Grounded in regulatory focus theory and organizational learning theory, this study assesses how promotion and prevention contract framing influences suppliers’ exploration and exploitation activities. Survey data from 135 buyer-supplier relationship dyads reveals that promotion and prevention framing distinctly affect suppliers’ learning activities. Specifically, during the duration of the contract, (a) compared with prevention contract framing, promotion contract framing has a stronger positive impact on the supplier’s exploration learning activities; and (b) compared with promotion contract framing, prevention contract framing has a stronger negative impact on the supplier’s exploitation learning activities. This study also reveals how the portfolios and clusters of contract framing influence supplier learning activities. Finally, this study reveals that different learning activities result in varied outcomes for the buyer, with exploration boosting continuity and exploitation improving performance.

We argue that organizations can improve their ability to identify and comprehend knowledge from a distant knowledge category through learning associations made by a category link—a familiar tangible component previously used by somebody else in the distant knowledge category. We test our arguments using a sample of patents in which the material graphene is used as a component across diverse patent classes (i.e., knowledge categories). We find that increasing experience with category-linking graphene enables an organization to patent in increasingly distant graphene-linked patent classes and also increases the number of patents in such classes. We also find that the extent to which category-linking graphene is prominent in a distant knowledge category enhances the effect of graphene experience on a firm’s ability to absorb knowledge from the distant knowledge category. We, thus, present a novel internal mechanism by which an organization can absorb distant knowledge.},

  abstract     = {As the world of work continues to evolve, employees are increasingly seeking to do more than manage the bifurcated domains of work and home. Instead, amid greater demands at work alongside greater valuation of leisure, employees are striving to thrive at work without sacrificing their free time. To explore this tension, we adopt an agentic, blended, and future-oriented perspective of the work-nonwork interface and examine leisure-work synergizing as a unique practice for employees to find synergies between leisure and work. Drawing on foundational theorizing on workplace thriving, we theorize that strategically integrating work into leisure activities in an attempt to build work-relevant competencies can inspire (via self-assurance) and hinder (via fatigue) employee thriving at work. To test these predictions, we first conducted a series of validation studies to demonstrate the conceptual relationship among leisure-work synergizing and other work and nonwork constructs. Then, using an experience sampling design, we generally found support for the bolstering effects of leisure-work synergizing on thriving through self-assurance. Moreover, segmentation preference—a theoretical moderator related to this unique boundary blurring practice—significantly influenced the proposed relationship between leisure-work synergizing and fatigue. Taken together, our research expands our understanding of the work-nonwork interface and the utility of leisure activities for working adults, integrates work-nonwork research with positive psychology to reveal nonwork agents of thriving, and highlights a novel blended practice to help scholars and managers better understand how employees can “have their cake and eat it too.” Funding: This work was supported by Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia.},

In a matched sample of firms with and without GitHub activities, difference-in-differences models reveal a substantial increase in the likelihood of being funded after early stage startups engage with open source communities on GitHub. This relationship is weaker for firms that employ GitHub for internal development only. Startups developing novel technologies tend to benefit more from engaging with open source communities, unlike those in highly competitive environments. This heterogeneity highlights a potential trade-off between engaging with open source communities and appropriability. To provide insight regarding mechanisms, we classify startups’ technology use-cases on GitHub using machine learning and exploit data on product launches. Our results from these additional analyses support the notion that one important channel potentially driving our findings is the access to external knowledge for technology development provided by open source communities.

  abstract     = {Empirical laws and regularities, such as Klepper’s shakeout pattern for industry evolution or Gibrat’s law for firm size, have shaped our understanding of organizations. Despite decades of research into profit patterns, no such widely applicable empirical regularities have been found for the “dependent variable of strategy”: long-term value capture. This study reports the discovery of a simple law governing this variable’s distribution. A four-parameter normal log-normal (NLN) mixture distribution very well fits observed data of listed firms’ 20-year long-term profit (LTP). The distribution correctly describes, for instance, a remarkable asymmetry in value capture: fewer than 1% of all firms in the data set generated 73% of the total LTP. Though the NLN law applies across different industries, geographies, and time periods, its distributional parameters vary. These parameters provide a novel and precise description of differences across settings in economic outcomes, such as the rise of “superstars.” More broadly, the law’s discovery raises profound questions relating to competitive strategy, evolutionary path dependence, the structure of technological opportunity, and social inequality.

  abstract     = {Organizations and the decision makers within them are increasingly subject to inconsistent performance feedback—feedback that contains elements that are incompatible with each other—which can lead to multiple interpretations of performance feedback. When this occurs, decision makers often recode inconsistent performance feedback as successful and continue with their current strategies, which allows them to avoid any self-threat from negative elements of performance feedback but implies that they do not learn from inconsistent performance feedback because they do not change. In contrast, we explore whether decision makers can learn from inconsistent performance feedback. Leveraging over 10 years of complete behavioral records in an online community and a laboratory experiment, we study how decision makers respond to inconsistent performance feedback stemming from multiple evaluators who do not agree on performance quality. Consistent with prior work, we find that decision makers change their strategies less after inconsistent performance feedback. Departing from prior work, we show a corresponding increase in clarification efforts aimed at better understanding which performance strategies work well. Importantly, clarification efforts mediate improved future performance. Our results suggest that inconsistent performance feedback can trigger deeper learning and enhanced performance, contributing to performance feedback theory and research on the microfoundations of organizational learning.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing contests allow firms to seek ideas from external solvers to address their problems. This research examines solvers’ use of developmental feedback from different sources and of different constructiveness when generating ideas in contests. I theorize a source effect in solvers’ feedback use where they use seeker feedback more than peer feedback, even if both give identical suggestions for their ideas. I also show how the source effect affects solvers’ use of constructive and less constructive feedback from the respective sources. An insight is that compared with their use of peer feedback, solvers’ use of seeker feedback is more extensive at any level of, but less sensitive to, feedback constructiveness. An implication is that solvers may underuse constructive peer feedback and overuse less constructive seeker feedback. Such behaviors can be solver optimal (in terms of improving solvers’ winning prospects) but not seeker optimal (in terms of enhancing ideas for seekers’ problems), as constructive feedback is likely to improve idea quality, whereas less constructive feedback may hurt it. I propose a priming intervention of a feedback evaluation mechanism to mitigate the source effect in solvers’ feedback use—in a way, the intervention can cause solvers to behave more optimally for the seekers. A field survey and three online experiments test the theorizing and proposed intervention. I discuss the contributions and implications of this research for various stakeholders in crowdsourcing contests.

  abstract     = {It is widely believed that university and corporate research are complementary: companies invest in research in part to develop the capacity to absorb the knowledge emerging from universities. However, as we show in this paper, corporate research in the United States emerged when American universities were behind the world frontier in scientific research. Why, then, did for-profit businesses choose to invest in creating new knowledge, much of which could spill over to rivals, and whose conduct presented many managerial challenges? We argue that corporate research in America arose in the 1920s to compensate for weak university research, not to complement it. Using newly assembled firm-level data from the 1920s and 1930s, we find that companies invested in research because inventions increasingly relied on science but American universities were unable to meet their needs. Large firms close to the technological frontier and operating in concentrated industries were likely to invest in research, especially in scientific disciplines where American universities lagged behind the scientific frontier. Corporate science seems to have paid off, resulting in novel patents and high market valuations for firms engaged in research. Funding: A. Arora, S. Belenzon, and J.

  abstract     = {High-potential programs offer a swift path up the corporate ladder for those who secure a place on them. However, the evaluation of “potential” occurs under considerable uncertainty, creating fertile ground for gender bias. We document that men are more likely than women to be designated as high potential, and unpack how gendered responses to employees’ expressions of passion—one of the most commonly used criteria used in evaluating potential—both penalize women and advantage men in high-potential selection processes. First, and based on prior research on gender display rules, we suggest that expressions of passion are viewed as a less appropriate emotional display for women than men, giving rise to a female penalty. Second, and drawing on shifting standards theorizing, we posit that expressions of passion shift evaluators’ predictions of candidates’ diligence more meaningfully for men than women, creating a male advantage—particularly for men who are reasonably high but not exceptional performers. We provide supporting evidence across two studies examining placement into high-potential programs in a real talent review setting ( N = 796) and a preregistered experiment that uses videos featuring trained actors ( N = 1,366), supported by two supplementary studies ( N = 1,590). Taken together, this work sheds light on the ways the increasing emphasis on passion in contemporary workplaces may exacerbate gender inequalities. Progressing our understanding of gender bias beyond gendered reactions to criteria that penalize women (i.e., backlash), our work also unveils a novel and particularly pernicious form of gender bias driven by gendered inferences about passion that advantage men.

  abstract     = {In response to persistent gender inequality in corporate leadership, many countries have implemented board gender diversity reforms, either through legislation or by revising governance codes for board appointments. Whereas these reforms aim to enhance women’s representation and influence in leadership roles, their effects on corporate outcomes, such as innovation, remain unclear. This study develops a two-mechanism institutional contingency model to investigate how board gender diversity reforms affect firm innovation through representation and empowerment mechanisms. Using a unique hand-collected data set on worldwide board gender diversity reforms and a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design, we find that these reforms significantly improve innovation outcomes, with the empowerment mechanism having a stronger positive effect than the representation mechanism. Additionally, we show that rule-based reforms, although they are effective at increasing female board representation, often lead to symbolic compliance and tokenism, which limits their ability to enhance innovation. In contrast, comply-or-explain reforms, which emphasize empowerment and genuine engagement, yield more meaningful progress in firm innovation. Our findings also reveal that countries with higher prereform gender disparities and a larger pool of qualified female directors experience greater innovation gains following the implementation of these reforms. By distinguishing between the effects of representation and empowerment, this study provides a nuanced understanding of how gender diversity regulations can serve as catalysts for innovation and offers valuable insights for policymakers designing reforms to promote gender equality and economic outcomes.

  abstract     = {Despite extensive research on stigma, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how industry stigmatization progresses when constantly contested by resourceful incumbents. To shed light on this issue, we focus on the revealing case of the U.S. tobacco industry between 1980 and 2016. Combining structural topic modeling and discourse analysis to explore the extensive media discussions surrounding the industry, we find that stigmatization unfolds through three phases. These were each characterized by discursive struggles, which resulted in contested stigma extensions about establishing harm (1980–1992), assigning responsibility (1993–2010), and creating new norms (2011–2016). We develop a process model highlighting three key mechanisms in stigmatization processes: attention , which shifts focus to new issues and discussions; stigma construction work , where the stigmatizers use discursive strategies to establish stigma; and resistance work , where targets use discursive strategies to slow down stigmatization. The interplay of these mechanisms reveals that stigmatization is neither linear nor complete but characterized by partial and contested stigma extensions . While acknowledging the limitations of our case, our study advances research by showing how industry stigmatization persists even when challenged, opening new avenues for future research in related settings.

Drawing from interviews conducted with Black women executives, we examined how these women experience relational triggers that emphasize their differences from others because of their limited numbers at their level. Our findings indicate that Black women executives respond to these relational triggers by engaging in perspective-taking and status reflexivity to understand others’, and their own, perspectives on the identity and status differentials present in the interaction. Through an introspective process, these women assess and address gaps in how they believe their partners see them and how they see themselves, which prompts them to either reduce or maintain perceived gaps depending on the importance of the interaction partner. We also explore how reducing or maintaining the perceived gap ultimately influences how Black women think, feel, or behave toward their relational partner (i.e., relational valence) in ways that may shape how they interpret future interactions.

  abstract     = {A growing body of literature has sought to understand the strategic drivers of corporate activism, emphasizing the ideological composition of a firm’s workforce as its salient internal driver. Despite these advancements, however, the heterogeneity in its effect remains underexplored, leaving it unclear when employee ideology is more likely to translate into activism. I address this gap by considering competitors’ actions—another important driver uncovered in the scholarship—as a key source of heterogeneity. I examine how these actions can shape the external context in which a firm’s employees evaluate the value of its activism, thereby influencing the firm’s incentives to act on employees’ preferences. My central conjecture is that activism by so-called ideological opponents of a firm’s employee base will be a particularly strong driver of its own activism. This is because actions taken by competitors who hold stances opposite to those valued by a firm’s employees can create a temporal window during which the firm can gain enough employee appreciation for its activism—particularly counter-activism opposing the stance of the competitor. Leveraging the donation records of corporate foundations to advocacy nonprofits as a novel channel for studying corporate activism, I find support for this conjecture. Consistent with my theory, I further find that this effect is driven by firms whose employees hold homogeneous ideological preferences and arises primarily around issues with strong ideological contention.

  abstract     = {Scholarship regarding occupational gender segregation has almost exclusively focused on women’s experiences (e.g., as targets of discrimination in masculine domains), yet understanding factors that perpetuate men’s underrepresentation in traditionally feminine occupations is equally important. We examine a consequential dynamic early in the job search process in which individuals come to learn that an occupation that fits them is perceived as feminine versus masculine. Our research develops and tests the prediction that femininity or masculinity of occupations will exert a stronger impact on men’s (versus women’s) interest in them such that men will be less interested in gender-atypical occupations than women. Across five studies ( n = 4,477), we consistently observed robust evidence for this prediction among diverse samples, including high school students (Study 1), unemployed job seekers (Study 2), U.S. adults (Study 3), and undergraduates (Study 4) and using experimental and archival methods. We observed this asymmetry after controlling for alternative accounts related to economic factors (e.g., expected salary), suggesting that they alone cannot fully explain men’s lack of interest in feminine occupations as previously discussed in the literature. Further, we consistently observed that men, compared with women, show heightened sensitivity to gender-based occupational status, and this greater sensitivity explains men’s (versus women’s) reduced interest in gender-atypical occupations. Though past scholarship suggests that increasing pay is key to stoking men’s interest in feminine occupations, our research suggests that targeting men’s underlying psychological concern—sensitivity to gender-based occupational status—may be an underappreciated pathway to reducing gender segregation.

First, I find that an organization must lay the foundation for participatory improvisation by establishing alternative conventions (e.g., expect and embrace the unexpected). Second, these conventions facilitate mutual face work by both the organization and customers in response to disruptions, thereby protecting interactions from breakdowns. When alternative conventions are not established, participatory improvisation may be ineffective, and interactions may be severely threatened. These findings contribute to the literature on organizational improvisation by uncovering how organizations can foster participatory improvisation and how it unfolds in situ. They also reveal an alternate way for customer-facing organizations to achieve their goals beyond routinization.

  abstract     = {We develop a unified framework to examine the implications of two primary approaches to strategic decision making under uncertainty: designing and shaping future scenarios vis-à-vis testing theories about future scenarios. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial involving 308 early stage entrepreneurs, dividing them into three groups—design-based training, theory-based training, and a control group—and tracked them over approximately 1.5 years. Our findings reveal that both approaches reduce the need for information in decision making and lead to higher commitment rates. The design-based approach encourages action despite negative beliefs, resulting in less frequent and later project termination. In contrast, the theory-based approach promotes a more conservative termination rule, leading to earlier and more frequent project abandonment. Although the theory-based approach is associated with higher average performance upon survival, the design-based approach fosters breakthroughs for decision makers. In sum, the design-based approach is well-suited for innovative ventures that gather information to shape their environment, whereas the theory-based approach is optimal for pursuing high performance under lower degrees of uncertainty.

To address this oversight, I construct a typology composed of six dimensions of strong theory: importance, interestingness, actionability, generality, simplicity, and accuracy. This typology provides a lens to examine a vexing problem: the effort to increase the strength of a theory on one dimension will usually compromise its strength on others. Despite this reality, authors experience pressure in the review process to optimize theories on all six dimensions. I explain how the expectation to build theories that cannot possibly be built (what I call the fruitless search for unicorn theories) is driven by historical forces. The study of organizations emerged not from one source but from a half-dozen distinct traditions, including applied scientists who study time-sensitive problems, disciplinary scholars who identify universal laws of human behavior, and empiricists who prefer a tight link between concepts and measures. Review teams are often composed of referees who hail from different traditions and possess divergent views on theory. Even when each reviewer has concerns that are reasonable in isolation, authors often confront unrealistic expectations when reviewers’ preferences are aggregated. To mitigate this problem, I recommend that authors, reviewers, and editors (1) prioritize fewer dimensions in any single theory and (2) emphasize distinct dimensions in different theories on the same topic.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact that social movements have on firm innovation through private politics. We argue that firms strategically respond to private politics by investing in new technologies that address movement-advocated issues material to firms’ performance. Although both contentious private politics—when activists contentiously target firms—and cooperative private politics—when activists and firms collaborate—catalyze innovation, they do so in different ways. Contentious private politics increases the amount of innovation that firms undertake by drawing managerial attention to movement-advocated issues material to the firm, prompting search for solutions to those issues. Conversely, cooperative private politics provides firms access to new knowledge that encourages firms to search for solutions in areas more distant from their existing knowledge and in so doing, increase innovation involving distant recombination on material issues. We find support for our arguments in a matched sample of firms contentiously targeted and with activist collaborations on climate change issues and firms that were not targets of private politics on those issues but had otherwise similar histories of climate-related innovation and relationships with climate movements and other environmental movements. Supplementary analyses corroborate the mechanisms that undergird our theoretical predictions; contentious private politics is associated with more innovation closer to a firm’s expertise, whereas cooperative private politics is associated with innovations that draw on more distant knowledge. We also find that when collaboration follows contention, their respective impacts on innovation are reduced, which may result from firms seeking collaborations for their legitimacy-granting benefits after contention rather than the learning opportunities they offer.

  abstract     = {Despite the rise of digital platforms that connect rural entrepreneurs to urban customers, rural online businesses are hampered by a lack of talent. Some have pointed to the potentially enabling role of rural returnees. However, although international returnees bring valuable knowledge to businesses in their home countries, it is unclear how domestic returnees affect entrepreneurship in rural, underdeveloped parts of their country. We study this question using a natural experiment involving a regional policy change, which reduced the barriers for rural migrants to return home in one Chinese province but not in others. We find that, after the policy change, rural e-commerce businesses in the province that implemented the policy change enjoyed a 19% performance gain relative to those in other provinces. We theorize and test four mechanisms that may underlie the relationship between return migration and online entrepreneurship: knowledge transfer, demand spillover, de novo businesses, and financial support from returnees. Our results support the knowledge transfer mechanism, but we also find evidence of demand spillover. This study highlights the salience of return mobility and “return barriers” in shaping local entrepreneurship. It also suggests a novel approach toward fostering entrepreneurship in underdeveloped regions: policymakers and digital platforms may work together to pave the country roads that take people home.

Overcoming this sudden loss of achieved work identity is crucial for refugees’ future well-being and integration in the host country. In this study, we identify the behavioral and cognitive practices used by highly educated refugee entrepreneurs to resolve the incongruence between their selves and the host country environment and delineate core conditions that explain why only some complete these identity transformations successfully. Based on an in-depth ethnography at an incubator designed for refugees with entrepreneurial ambitions, we develop theory about how and when highly educated refugees’ past identities enable or constrain their ability to create new work identities in alignment with the new environment. Our findings reveal the critical role played by identity flexibility and a refugee’s attributions of premigration work attainments in this process. Surprisingly, we find that those who attribute prior career accomplishments internally—and are, thus, driven by self-perceptions of being resourceful and adaptive in the past—exhibit only limited identity flexibility. As a result, they struggle the most with reconstructing their identity in ways that aid their integration in the host country.

We utilize the staggered introduction of the U.S. visa waiver program (VWP) to 41 countries in 1988–2023, which substantially increased short-term visits to the United States. Following the introduction of the VWP, global pharmaceutical companies with R&D centers in VWP countries showed a significant increase in invention quantity and scope compared with those without R&D centers in VWP countries. Notably, we find that the benefits of short-term visits are greater when there is an intermediate knowledge distance between firms’ R&D centers in the United States and VWP countries. If R&D centers have similar knowledge bases, efficient knowledge flows can occur even without visits. For centers with very different knowledge bases, short-term visits do not provide enough time for sufficient knowledge flows. Benefits of short-term visits are also magnified when the cultural distance is greater between firms’ R&D centers. Our findings highlight that even short-term face-to-face interactions can enhance the sharing of tacit knowledge and subsequent invention, thereby offering important managerial and policy implications.

  abstract     = {Prior research on the performance effects of hiring immigrants has mainly considered people who choose to move to other countries. We shift attention to forced migrants (i.e., refugees) and study the relationship between their employment and firm performance. We focus on the specific labor market conditions that refugees face and theorize that performance improves among firms that hire refugees. We explain this relationship using two interconnected mechanisms that revolve around refugees’ limited outside options. First, as refugees have strong incentives to remain employed, they put extensive effort into their jobs, work long hours, and, thereby, reduce the employer’s labor costs related to worker turnover ( effort mechanism ). Second, as refugees are generally willing to accept low pay, hiring them reduces the employer’s labor costs related to salaries ( remuneration mechanism ). Moreover, we theorize that greater job insecurity at the hiring firm strengthens both mechanisms because it increases refugees’ perceived risk of being fired and their fear of being unemployed. We find support for our theoretical predictions in a matched sample of 27,782 firms in Denmark covering the period from 2001 to 2016.

  abstract     = {Prior research ascribes an important role to highly skilled immigrants in the production and diffusion of knowledge. However, little is known about their contributions to shaping the type and direction of organizational innovation. We aim to shed light on this question by investigating how newly hired foreign research and development (R&D) workers affect firm-level exploration. We argue that foreign R&D hires enable firms to overcome local search by making them aware of and providing access to novel knowledge tied to their home countries. We test this using a sample of 376 Danish R&D-active firms over the period from 2001 to 2013. Our findings reveal that newly hired foreign R&D workers contribute significantly more to exploration than other types of R&D workers within the firm. Moreover, we find support for the proposed mechanism and show that knowledge from the home countries of foreign hires shapes firms’ inventive output. Our results further suggest that the effect of foreign R&D hires is stronger for firms with a limited international search orientation and those with an incumbent R&D workforce with a shorter organizational tenure. These findings offer insights into a potential mechanism through which foreign R&D workers can shape firm-level exploration and the organizational contingencies that influence this relationship.

  abstract     = {Immigrant entrepreneurs are a major driver of economic growth, and their decisions about where to locate can greatly affect the entrepreneurial ecosystem of a country. Meanwhile, increasingly uncertain immigration environments might discourage immigrants from establishing new ventures in host countries. This paper exploits the unexpected result of the Brexit referendum to investigate the relationship between immigration uncertainty and the entry of immigrant-founded ventures of different quality. We propose a model of immigrant entrepreneurial entry and introduce a new measure of venture quality at founding. We find that a surge in uncertainty decreases the growth rate of new immigrant-founded firms by 3.2%. The reliance on other immigrant actors exacerbates the negative effect that uncertainty has on entry. Moreover, low- and high-quality firms are the most affected, while the effect for medium-quality firms is negligible. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that Brexit discouraged the entry of around 620 low-quality and 250 high-quality firms. Our model suggests that whereas founders of low-quality ventures might decide to take up employment, founders of high-quality ventures might be better off establishing their companies in another country.

But can they succeed in connecting others in their home and host environments? We investigate this question in the context of women in science in the developing world. We hypothesize that the extent to which such scholars facilitate connections will depend upon the extent to which their home and host country institutional environments support them in this brokerage role. Specifically, we propose that the effectiveness of female migrants as brokers is mitigated by national level gender parity, which we expect influences their level of legitimacy and opportunity for brokerage. Our analysis finds that female migrants in science are more likely to share international connections with non-migrants at home if their home countries and host countries have high levels of gender parity. We interpret these findings as providing evidence that institutional support is critical for migrant brokerage and the globalization of knowledge production.

This lack of dialogue is striking because organizations are often the central arena in which migrants interact with others and through which they impact society and the economy. We explain how scholars of migration and organizations can benefit each other by exploring two broad issues. First, we consider what an organizational lens can add to the existing migration literature. We argue that organizational heterogeneity plays an essential role in determining the causes and effects of migration. Second, we consider how taking migration seriously can yield theoretical advancements for organizational scholars. We present examples that introduce potentially novel theoretical concepts or that enrich existing theories.

However, little is known about benefits that may accrue to firms from ties with politician shareholders. We explore potential spillover benefits of such ties in the context of financially motivated shareholder activism (“financial activism”). Specifically, we examine whether financial activists are deterred from targeting firms owned by Democratic politicians, who tend to adopt a more interventionist and stakeholder-oriented stance toward economic regulation than Republicans. Based upon an analysis of S&P 1500 firms over a 15-year period, we find that the number of Democratic politician shareholders is negatively associated with a firm’s likelihood of being targeted by a financial activist. This relationship is stronger when Democratic politician shareholders are more publicly prominent and when firms have more Democratic-leaning boards. Our study shows that the benefits firms derive from politician shareholders spill over beyond the business-government interface into the domain of corporate governance.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth in the use of teams and multiple team membership has led more organizations to structure work around dynamic teams , characterized by short lifespans and fluid membership boundaries. This approach to organizing work makes it difficult for teams to work efficiently or to support the learning and growth of members. Given the importance of productivity and learning, we ask how these processes can be supported in dynamic teams. We do so in a randomized controlled field experiment conducted with 91 teams in a teaching hospital, a context in which physician trainees must learn while providing patient care in dynamic teams of care providers. We randomly assigned physician teams, or “core” teams, to launch their work with an intervention focused either on internal coordination among the core team members or on external coordination with a changing cast of external contributors such as nurses and specialists. We measured resulting levels of internal and external coordination over teams’ week-long lifespans and observed that external coordination was associated with improved team efficiency, whereas internal coordination was associated with improved individual learning.

We theorize why and when losing actors do not defer—even when they are supposed to. We hypothesize that when the losing actors categorize their relationship with an opponent as rivalrous beyond the current contest and may obtain some contest-specific gains independent of the focal encounter, they will not defer as much as expected. Unique data from Formula One racing prove strong support. Our findings contribute to research on deference as well as on competition and rivalry. Our study also has broader implications as it helps explain when people do not respect social norms while competing—be it for rewards, for promotions, or in elections.},

  abstract     = {Boomerangs, that is, rehires, should have advantages over other new hires when integrating into an organization due to their familiarity with the work context and their pre-existing relationships. However, research suggests that the effects of hiring boomerangs may not be straightforwardly positive. To better understand these effects, we investigate how boomerangs’ social integration into a work team differs from that of other new hires due to their pre-existing relationships and how those relationships shape their and incumbents’ competence and motivation to provide assistance for collective performance. We theorize and find that boomerangs, compared with new hires, exhibit more performance assistance toward incumbent former and incumbent new colleagues. In contrast, incumbent former colleagues do not direct their performance assistance toward boomerangs, contrary to our prediction, nor do incumbent new colleagues. This study contributes to the nascent literature on boomerangs and the literature on job mobility by finding evidence that prior relationships condition the behavior of both boomerangs and incumbents.

We find that slow learning with respect to belief updating, in conjunction with a strategy of exploration/exploitation heavily tilted toward exploitation, leads to an effective process of organizational adaptation in a wide variety of settings. This joint search strategy can be thought of as “cautious exploitation.” Belief updating proves to be a more effective catalyst to search, facilitating both the process of discovery of alternatives and persistence in favorable alternatives, than an explicit strategy of exploration. However, it is important to consider the boundary conditions around this finding. Problems of search differ in important respects: from settings that are primarily problems of discovery where the critical challenge is identifying a promising alternative, but its promise is self-evident once identified, to problems of evaluation where assessing the merit of alternatives that are identified is itself a challenge. We find that our conventional wisdom about the role of explicit strategies of exploration holds in settings that are primarily problems of discovery. However, when the evaluation of alternatives is problematic and assessed through experience with a given alternative, we find that the macrophenomenon of effective organizational search is best realized with slow rates of belief updating in conjunction with an explicit strategy of exploration/exploitation that is tilted to be highly exploitative.

Similarly, we find a higher rate of CEO dismissal when employees become less satisfied. Further, we investigate three factors that may amplify the role of employee satisfaction ratings in CEO evaluations: the importance of employees to financial performance, the board’s commitment to stakeholders, and the need to preserve firm reputation. We find some evidence that each of these three factors strengthens the relationship between employee satisfaction ratings and CEO evaluations. Finally, we exploit the staggered timing of first-time reviews on Glassdoor and use a difference-in-differences design to strengthen our inferences.

  abstract     = {We use evidence from a disruption of clinical documentation routines to propose a novel, predictive mechanism for routine dynamics based on path coherence . Path coherence refers to the continuity of situational attributes from one event to the next along a path, for example, a set of activities conducted by the same person has high actor coherence. Situational attributes include classic descriptors such as who, what, when, where, and why. To be recognized as a path, a minimal level of coherence is required, but path coherence can vary along a path. For example, in a medical clinic, typical paths flow from place to place (e.g., reception, waiting room, exam room) and involve different clinical staff (e.g., receptionist, nurse, physician). Using latent factor network models, we compare clinical documentation routines in five outpatient clinics before and after a technological disruption (an upgrade to the electronic health record system). We show that coherent paths are up to 14 times more likely to persist and up to 40 times more likely to form than less coherent paths. We use these findings to theorize about the role of path coherence in routine dynamics. Path coherence in narrative networks is like homophily in social networks, but with a completely different underlying mechanism. We discuss the implications of our findings for organizational path dependence, resilience, and inertia.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the interactive effect of organizational atypicality and accountability on evaluation. Prior research has shown that audience members sometimes react positively and other times negatively to atypical organizations or that the main effect of atypicality is not always consistent. We seek to further advance our understanding of this inconsistency in the assessment of atypical organizations. To do so, we focus on accountability, defined as a person’s expectation that they may be asked to justify their choices to others. We theorize that accountability will influence the assessment of atypical organizations because it causes evaluators to think about justifying their decisions and considering what their audience will find acceptable. We investigate two different ways in which accountability, by making others’ social expectations salient, shapes the effect of atypicality on appeal. First, when the preferences of the evaluator’s audience are implicit, we propose that accountability will strengthen the negative effect of atypicality on evaluation. Second, when the preferences of the evaluator’s audience are explicit, we propose that evaluators will conform to these preferences. When an evaluator is accountable to an audience that prefers typical organizations, atypicality will negatively affect evaluation. Conversely, when an evaluator is accountable to an audience that prefers atypical organizations, atypicality should positively affect evaluation. We tested these predications in five preregistered studies and found support for our predictions. These results help to explain variance in audience member’s reactions to atypicality and suggest that accountability plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of atypical organizations.

  abstract     = {Despite the psychological benefits of authenticity, Black employees within predominantly White organizations often face the dilemma of whether to downplay versus highlight their social identity. Our research introduces social uncertainty as a unifying lens to understand the reluctance of these employees to express their social identity. Highlighting the central role of social uncertainty also helps identify novel factors at both the organizational level (authenticity climates) and individual level (perspective-taking) that can encourage Black employees to engage in social identity affirmation—authentic expressions of the positive aspects of their social identity. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two survey studies, two experiments, qualitative interviews, as well as coded text responses to our experimental prompts. Across our studies, authenticity climates were associated with greater social identity affirmation by Black employees, and this relationship was strengthened when these employees engaged in perspective-taking. Consistent with our theorizing, social certainty mediated these direct and moderated effects. In addition, social identity affirmation increased Black employees’ organizational involvement. Our experimental studies offer causal evidence for the roles of both authenticity climates and Black employees’ perspective-taking, our qualitative interviews vividly illuminate our hypotheses, and our text response analyses provide insight into how authenticity climates operate. Overall, the current research highlights how organizations can help Black employees feel comfortable emphasizing and expressing their true selves by increasing their social certainty. These findings also have direct implications for organizational leaders, providing them with actionable strategies to create more inclusive environments.

  abstract     = {Prior research highlights that interim CEO successions are disruptive for firms. Yet boards appoint interim CEOs in order to focus on finding the right person to take over permanently, suggesting they may offer benefits to CEO selection. Considering these two views, this paper compares the firm performance of CEOs appointed following an interim period with that of CEOs appointed in a direct succession. We argue that, owing to the disruption caused by the interim appointment, firm performance under a CEO appointed following an interim period will be poorer than under a CEO appointed in a direct succession. However, we posit that, in circumstances in which obtaining and processing the information relevant to CEO selection is more difficult, the interim period may be particularly helpful in selecting the most fitting successor and ultimately weakening the associated performance penalty. Using a sample of CEO successions that occurred in S&P 1500 firms between the years 2002 and 2016, we find general support for our hypotheses. This paper, thus, demonstrates that the subsequent performance consequences of appointing an interim CEO depends on the difficulty of selecting the firm’s next permanent CEO.

Here, we consider the role of loyalty in facilitating networks of support for wrongdoers, examining whether the obligations of loyalty to direct ties (here, brokers) transfer through individuals’ social networks to their indirect ties, prompting them to support those indirect ties in moral dilemmas. Integrating research on brokering, loyalty, relational identity, and social norms, we propose that loyalty to a broker will prompt an individual to support an indirect tie accused of wrongdoing because loyalty activates one’s relational identity with the broker, which highlights the descriptive and relational injunctive norms associated with their role, leading them to view the broker’s request to support an indirect tie accused of wrongdoing as falling within the bounds of their loyalty-based obligations to the broker. Specifically, these norms reveal to the actor their benevolence-based trust in the broker, their value alignment with the broker, and relational concerns for not granting the broker’s request. We further demonstrate how a broker’s history of creating divisions between people moderates how the actor sees the broker and reduces their willingness to grant the request. Across 11 preregistered studies ( n = 2,249)—10 experiments and a field study—we found support for our hypotheses: the obligations of loyalty to brokers did indeed transfer to indirect ties accused of wrongdoing, regardless of the type of wrongdoing or strength of evidence presented against the accused.

  abstract     = {Existing research has shown that greater female membership on the board of directors has the potential to positively impact firm financial performance. However, the specific cognitive means through which these gender effects manifest remains unexplained. Our study sheds light on these cognitive means by examining how female board membership can influence chief executive officers (CEOs)’ attention allocation. We integrate the literatures on upper echelons, strategic attention, and gender-based information processing research and argue that because women tend to exhibit broader and more comprehensive information search and processing than men, female directors, through their interactions with CEOs and service on boards, will bring broader insights and perspectives to the boards than male directors. Further, we propose the relationship between the number of female directors and CEO strategic attention breadth is conditioned by three CEO characteristics that can exert influence on CEO-board information exchange: CEO gender, tenure, and overpayment. Specifically, we propose that boards comprised of more women will exert a greater effect on the strategic attention breadth of male CEOs and CEOs with longer tenure but will have a smaller effect on the strategic attention breadth of CEOs who are overpaid. Finally, we propose that CEO attention breadth mediates the relationship between the number of female directors and firm performance. We test our arguments using a sample of S&P 1500 firms and find broad support for our theorizing. Our study makes several key contributions to upper echelons and corporate governance, gender-based information processing, and executive attention research.

Using data from a variety of sources, including three randomized control trials and LinkedIn data, and focusing on female entrepreneurs who develop a value proposition targeting female consumers as a case of user entrepreneurs, this paper shows that exposure to a training that encourages entrepreneurs to develop theoretical maps about their business propositions and validate them with evidence prompts more radical pivots on their initial ideas compared with entrepreneurs with a value proposition that does not target women explicitly.

  abstract     = {Capital allocation research has long argued that divisions of multidivisional organizations may be relatively advantaged compared with standalone firms when external capital markets are less efficient. As a complement to this literature that largely focuses on deficiencies in the supply of external capital, we theorize about the effects of disruptions to internal capital markets. More specifically, we explore the impact of parent-level financial shocks on the growth of divisions. We first argue that the effects of a crisis in a parent country disrupt the supply of internal capital available to foreign divisions, resulting in significantly reduced asset growth in these divisions. Next, we offer an initial step toward developing comprehensive understanding of the contextual influences that may intensify or attenuate the effect of shocks by theorizing a broad set of moderators that consider the parent level, parent-division linkages, and the division level within multidivisional organizations. Analyses of 1,968 geographic divisions of multinational retailers across 92 host countries show that effects of parent financial crises on division investment depend on factors influencing the degree of parent exposure, shock transmission, and division adaptability.

  abstract     = {As a counterpoint to the prevailing normative view that CEO succession planning is universally wise, we develop a model of such endeavors as risky investments. Our model has three elements. First, we identify the potential costs of CEO succession planning, including opportunity costs associated with absorbing CEO and board attention, CEO-board conflict, and various forms of organizational disruption. Second, we identify and unpack the potential results of CEO succession planning, with explicit attention to the possibility that these results might be unfavorable. Specifically, expensively groomed executives may depart prior to succession; and groomed successors may perform no better, or even worse, than replacements obtained from the executive labor market, when needed. Third, we specify a slate of contingency conditions that substantially affect whether the various costs of CEO succession planning, and the likelihoods of unfavorable results, will be modest or considerable. We identify relevant contingencies at multiple levels: (a) incumbent CEO attributes, (b) firm attributes, (c) industry attributes, and (d) macro-environmental norms and institutions. No single contingency condition will necessarily make CEO succession planning an unpromising investment, but combinations might, prompting rational boards to balk at engaging in such endeavors. Our model has major implications for scholars, boards, governance watchdogs, and investors. Moreover, our analysis sheds indirect light on why many boards do not engage in CEO succession planning. It may not be due to their dereliction, as is typically asserted, but rather to their assessments that such initiatives do not make economic sense.},

  abstract     = {Although interpersonal networks are paramount for creativity, much prior work has considered their interpretation and activation to be unambiguous. In this paper, we instead draw on the notion that interpersonal networks exist primarily as subjective representations—that is, cognitive networks—to explore their influence on network mobilization. Through an inductive study in which we follow the elaboration of creative ideas in a small organization, we reconstruct how different cognitive networks channel individuals to enact specific network mobilization scripts—activating specific ties and adopting particular forms of interpersonal engagement. We identify two network mobilization scripts stemming from loose and cohesive cognitive networks, respectively. The script stemming from loose cognitive networks leads individuals to activate and engage with a few intimate colleagues bluntly and directly, whereas the one arising from cohesive cognitive networks prods the activation of a larger set of ties and a courteous demeanor. Although both network mobilization scripts facilitate the elaboration of ideas, their effectiveness is contingent on their resonance with the cognitive network of the individuals who enact them and with the network mobilization scripts enacted by the alters who are activated. By showing that individuals with different cognitive networks mobilize their networks differently, we contribute to both the cognitive network literature and the social side of the creativity literature.},

In this paper, we examine whether and how entrepreneurs benefit from adopting an evidence-based approach or a theory-and-evidence-based approach to decision making. We conducted a field experiment with Tanzanian agribusiness entrepreneurs by randomly assigning entrepreneurs to two different training conditions. We find that entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence–based condition have higher economic performance during the observation period following the intervention. We conjecture this result stems from differences in the types of changes enacted: entrepreneurs in the theory-and-evidence–based training make more coordinated changes that encompass both core and operational elements of their business models.

  abstract     = {Many of society’s grand challenges, like access to education, improved public health, and building smart infrastructure, occur in established fields, often ones where noncommercial logics matter. Grounded in a theory-building study of two well-matched EdTech ventures in the nascent MOOC market in the U.S. higher education field, we unpack their strategy formation processes. These ventures faced the dual problem of forming a successful strategy in a nascent market while changing an established field. Our primary contribution is a theoretical framework that identifies two distinct yet effective processes. One (Maverick) is a competitive, learning centric process , whereas the other (Diplomat) is a cooperative, diplomacy-centric one. Although distinct, these processes unexpectedly share the same decision weaving (i.e., hybrid) problem-solving structure that fits complex, novel problems like strategy formation. Broadly, we contribute to institutional theory and institutional entrepreneurship by introducing the diplomacy lens, its tactics, and firm performance. We contribute to learning theory and entrepreneurship by identifying the unique features of learning in established markets, including the limits to rapid experimentation and the value of collaborative learning for changing established fields. We add to practice by emphasizing the difficulty of achieving both commercial success and societal impact. Overall, we bridge the gap between institutional and commercial entrepreneurship.

  abstract     = {Remote work has dramatically transformed professional environments, sparking considerable scholarly interest in its impact on employees and organizations. Contributing to this burgeoning literature, we investigate how remote versus on-site work affects women’s experiences of gender discrimination. Given that work location can alter the gendered nature of interactions, we focus on everyday gender discrimination: slights and offenses that occur in interactions and are perceived by recipients as reflecting gender bias. Integrating gender frame theory and scholarship on virtual work, we argue that the gender frame tends to be less salient in remote settings. Thus, we predict that women experience less everyday gender discrimination when working remotely than on-site. Moreover, because the gender frame is likely to be more salient during on-site work for younger women and those who work with mostly men, we expect that these women experience a particularly pronounced reduction in everyday gender discrimination when working remotely. To test these predictions, we developed a new measure of everyday gender discrimination and conducted an original survey of 1,091 professional women who work in the same job both remotely and on-site. We find that women consistently report less everyday gender discrimination in remote versus on-site work. This effect is particularly pronounced for younger women and those who interact mainly with men. Overall, this study advances research on how work location shapes workers’ outcomes and experiences, enriches the literature on the trade-offs women face in virtual and on-site settings, and extends scholarship on the contextual factors shaping workplace discrimination.

  abstract     = {Leader emotional expressions have profound implications for team members. Research has established that how frequently leaders express positive and negative emotional expressions shapes team member performance through conveying critical social-functional information about team member social worth. Yet, this social-functional approach to emotions has not fully considered how the timing of leader emotional expressions during a team’s lifecycle can also shape the information conveyed to individual team members about their social worth. In this paper, we integrate the social-functional approach to emotions with imprinting theory to propose that the temporal context of leader emotional expressions has performance implications for individual team members through two distinct facets of social worth: respect and status. Specifically, our imprinting framework explains how positive leader emotional expressions during the early team phase have the most beneficial performance implications through imprinting respect in individual team members. We then propose that these positive implications are amplified by more-frequent-than-average negative leader emotional expressions during the midpoint phase. When filtered through earlier positive expressions, negative emotional expressions during the midpoint phase may signal opportunities for respect and status gains rather than respect and status losses. We find general support for our model in a preregistered four-wave longitudinal archival study of 9,968 team members on 234 consulting teams at a leading professional services company and a four-wave longitudinal field study at a NCAA Division 1 sports program including 245 student-athletes and 86 coaches on 20 varsity teams.

  abstract     = {Employees from marginalized groups frequently face low performance expectations based on group membership. Although past research shows several different reactions to these types of expectations, such as stereotype threat and stereotype reactance, scholars still know little about when and why low expectations spur individuals to not only try to prove themselves, but to seek to change expectations and opportunities for others like them. Addressing this discrepancy, I introduce trailblazing motivation, which captures the desire to set new precedents that open doors for others. I integrate self-determination theory and regulatory focus theory to identify group-based low expectations, moderated by a sense of belonging with one’s broad marginalized group, and core self-evaluations as key antecedents of trailblazing motivation. I hypothesize that trailblazing motivation will lead to not only greater persistence in one’s work—as with stereotype reactance—but also potentially riskier behaviors aimed at changing expectations for one’s broad group on a larger scale, including advocacy for other marginalized group members and diversity, equity, and inclusion–related issue selling. I test and find support for these hypotheses across a time-lagged survey study and a preregistered experiment. I also establish discriminant validity for trailblazing motivation from other responses to group-based low performance expectations. This research advances our understanding of the behavior of marginalized individuals at work by helping to explain (1) when and why people facing group-based low expectations go beyond seeking to prove their own abilities and also strive to effect change for their marginalized group as a whole and (2) how a closer connection to one’s marginalized group can drive people to increase opportunities for that broad group.

  abstract     = {Past research has examined the link between initiatives promoting entrepreneurship and compensation, but scholars have predominantly focused on earnings of individuals directly engaged in the founding process, such as founders, cofounders, and start-up employees. Shifting our focus to incumbent workers, we instead propose that a decline in the cost of entrepreneurship increases the variance in pay among incumbent workers who are not involved in entrepreneurial activities. We posit that, as entrepreneurship becomes a more attractive career option, due to institutional changes, the outside option value of entrepreneurship increases. The resulting increase in mobility threat will disproportionately benefit high earners or those employees who are more difficult to replace: As their bargaining power increases, incumbents will disproportionately reward these workers, especially when they are systematically more inclined to leave for entrepreneurship. We explore these arguments using a difference-in-differences methodology, based on the enactment of an entry reform that reduced the cost of entry in Portugal between 1995 and 2009. We find that an exogenous decrease in the administrative costs of establishing a new venture led to high earners capturing disproportionate rewards relative to low earners. We further show that this relationship was especially pronounced among high earners who (a) exhibited a higher ex ante propensity to transition into entrepreneurship; (b) had fewer credible outside options in paid employment; and (c) operated in industries with decentralized wage bargaining arrangements. By documenting the impact of institutional changes that promote entrepreneurship on incumbent workers’ pay, our study contributes to recent debates about the impact of entrepreneurship on individual earnings.

  abstract     = {Virtual teams are ubiquitous in the workplace, yet they experience frequent collaboration challenges. Successfully managing the team collaboration paradox, in terms of maintaining a unified team perspective and diverse individual perspectives, presents a potentially important lever to improve virtual team performance. However, scholars have conflicting opinions regarding whether such improvement is possible. We argue that team collaboration paradox management will positively relate to team performance over time and can be improved via a theory-based intervention. This intervention draws from theory on paradoxes for its content (paradoxical thinking) and team development interventions for its structure (general content knowledge, team-specific feedback, action-focused planning). Given the complexity of paradoxes, it is unclear whether a single training session could substantively improve their management; therefore, one intervention condition was comprised of a single training session and the other condition included a follow-up session. Analyzing two waves of multisource quantitative data from a sample of 76 virtual teams from 37 organizations, we find a positive relationship between team collaboration paradox management and team performance at both time periods. We also find that only the intervention condition with the follow-up session, as compared with untreated control teams, significantly improved how well teams managed the collaboration paradox and thereby facilitated subsequent changes in team performance. Supplementary qualitative insights from the intervention sessions illuminate the actions virtual teams took to improve their collaboration paradox management. These results have important implications for the paradox and teams literatures, as well as the managers and members of virtual teams.

  abstract     = {In searching for the sources of heterogeneity in organizational cultures, one possibility is that new ventures show a cultural spawning of incorporating elements from the culture of the organization that the founder left (the parent) when starting the new venture. Such a genealogical effect would explain why some organizational cultures remain different, despite the opportunities to learn cultural elements from other organizations. This study investigates whether and under what circumstances such cultural spawning occurs. We argue that cultural spawning occurs, but with varying strength, depending on the founder and the culture of the parent organization. Applying the cultural toolkit perspective, we predict that it is stronger when founders have a longer tenure in the parent organization, the parent culture is more internally coherent, and the parent culture is more atypical, compared with other organizations. These ideas were tested with a sample of U.S. technology startups in Crunchbase. Natural language processing of Glassdoor employee reviews was used to identify the cultural elements of the technology companies. The analysis demonstrates that cultural spawning occurs and reveals previously unexplored contingencies of cultural transmission through congruency and atypicality.

Identifying which subset is most promising is an error-prone exercise, and involving multiple decision makers may be prudent. This raises the question of how to most effectively aggregate their collective nous. Our model of organizational portfolio selection provides some first answers. We show that portfolio performance can vary widely. Delegating evaluation makes sense when organizations employ the relevant experts and can assign projects to them. In most other settings, aggregating the impressions of multiple agents leads to better performance than delegation. In particular, letting agents rank projects often outperforms alternative aggregation rules—including averaging agents’ project scores and counting their approval votes—especially when organizations have tight budgets and can select only a few project alternatives out of many.

  abstract     = {This study explores how Buddhist mindfulness as a self-reflective practice helps individuals respond to a paradox and ultimately dismantle it. To deeply immerse myself into this context, I conducted a nine-month ethnographic fieldwork in three Korean Buddhist temples that confront the paradox between the need for financial resources and spiritual values that disavow money. The findings show a series of cognitive mechanisms that reveal multiple roles of mindfulness, manifested as silence and skepticism of language. First, the monastic environment enables monks to become familiar with a life of silence that turns their attention to the inner mind from the external-empirical world. The silence serves as a mental buffer when monks switch between their sacred role and their business role. Over time, deep silence directs them to skepticism of language that triggers doubt on preexisting linguistic categories, boundaries, and separations. When the preexisting linguistic categories finally disappear in their mind, monks no longer rely on any differentiating or integrating tactic to navigate their paradox. In other words, they no longer perceive a paradox, which means the paradox has disappeared from their life. These cognitive mechanisms construct the monks’ worldview on contradictions, conflicts, and dualities, leading them from the experience of paradox to a unique mental state, the nonexperience of paradox. Integrating this mental state and the worldview of Buddhist monks with paradox research, this study theorizes a Buddhist mindfulness view of paradox.

  abstract     = {Helping practices that focus on returning members to their work tasks amid significant distress do little to attend to how they may be severely hindered by their own self-limiting responses to that distress. The focus of this study is on helping that attends to individuals limited in their responses to distress—individuals who inhabit, metaphorically, the narrows, a place of diminishment in which individuals are made smaller by accessing only specific parts of their selves. Through in-depth interviews with professionals working with individuals suffering from various distressing conditions, events, and situations, I develop generalizable theoretical insights about interpersonal holding as a specific form of helping dedicated to surfacing, expanding, and integrating aspects of individuals’ selves that have receded amid distress. The findings indicate a sequence of holding behaviors marked by three overlapping phases: holders coming alongside, linking up with, and guiding individuals in distress through narrowed intrapsychic spaces. This sequence is enabled, first, by the availability of individuals to interpersonal holding and second, by aspects of the holders that stabilize them during the complicated work of attending to the agentic selves of others. The study contributes to both the evolution of scholarship on distress helping in the context of resilience, loss, and role distress and to theory about interpersonal holding.},

  abstract     = {We examine whether investors value workforce gender diversity. Consistent with the view that investors believe workforce gender diversity can be valuable in major firms, we use event studies to demonstrate that U.S. technology firms and financial firms experience more positive stock price reactions when it is revealed that they have relatively higher (versus lower) workforce gender diversity numbers. For instance, we find that Google’s revelation of relatively low workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a negative stock price reaction, whereas eBay’s revelation of relatively high workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a positive stock price reaction. These stock price reactions are both economically and statistically significant; for example, we estimate that if a technology firm had revealed gender diversity numbers that were one standard deviation higher, its market valuation would have increased by $1.11 billion. Corroborating this plausibly causal field evidence, we also find positive investor reactions to workforce gender diversity in randomized experiments using Prolific participants with investing experience; these reactions seem to be underpinned by investors’ beliefs about potential upsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., reduced legal risks; increased creativity) but not by investors’ beliefs about potential downsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., increased conflict). Our findings highlight the importance of understanding investors’ intuitions or beliefs about major organizational phenomena such as workforce gender diversity. Our results also point toward a new type of business case for diversity, driven by investors: if major firms had more workforce gender diversity, investors may “reward” them with substantially higher valuations.

  abstract     = {A practice firmly entrenched in one period can experience decline or even deinstitutionalization in another. However, at the organization level, practice abandonment can be a slow process. Organizations may continue to use a practice that is in decline or out of date, coupling asynchronously with a prior institutional environment. In this paper we develop the concept of temporal miscoupling and examine the challenges of performing a practice under this condition. Drawing on a field study of a labor strike in Canada, we examine the difficulties of inhabiting the practice of striking—picketing a workplace—with eroding political, legal, and cultural support; declining familiarity with the practice; and fading narratives to motivate and justify the practice. We show how strikers developed extemporaneous resources that gave local meaning and form to the practice. These improvised resources supported the practice but distorted historical meanings and performances. Our study expands the analytical repertoire of inhabited institutionalism by problematizing the temporal lag between institutional conditions and organizational practices for the on-the-ground enactment of practices. The extemporaneous resources generated in the context of temporal miscoupling threaten future enactments, indicating an important role for practice enactment in processes of decline and revitalization.

  abstract     = {The recent wave of corporate scandals has necessitated a more systematic investigation of internal whistle-blowing as a potential way to prevent wrongdoing. Our understanding of whistle-blowing, however, has been hampered by a deep chasm that exists between employees’ intent to blow the whistle and their whistle-blowing behaviors. We argue that to fully bridge this gap, we need to consider employees’ cognitive states at the time of whistle-blowing intentions versus behaviors and to link these cognitive states to the ethical systems within the organization’s ethical infrastructure to understand which systems are more effective in cultivating whistle-blowing intentions and which systems help translate those intentions into behaviors. Across one multisource field study and one multiwave experiment, we found support for our arguments that top management values-based communication systems, which are more high construal (abstract), affect whistle-blowing intentions whereas ethical accountability systems and ethical retaliatory systems, which are more low construal (concrete), moderate the relationship between whistle-blowing intentions and behaviors. By linking ethical systems within the organization’s ethical infrastructure to the two stages (intentions and behaviors) of the whistle-blowing process and the accompanying cognitive states, we develop and empirically test a construal level theory of internal whistle-blowing.

  abstract     = {Previous literature offers conflicting findings on how the restrictiveness of the regulatory environment—the amount of rules that prohibit specific activities—affects innovation of firms. One camp suggests that restrictiveness circumscribes the range of available technological components and therefore decreases innovation. The other camp believes that restrictiveness can lead firms to seek new alternative technological components, which could increase innovation. In this article, we develop a new theory on regulation and innovation to reconcile these views, which we test using novel data on federal regulations and the patents of 1,242 firms, from 1994 to 2013. We find that restrictiveness can have both a negative and positive relationship with innovation output depending on the level of regulatory uncertainty and the innovation type in question.

  abstract     = {Organizational research has documented that scandals lead to negative aggregate stakeholder reactions. There is little reason to believe, however, that the effects of a scandal are homogenous across different types of engagement. We therefore compare the effects of a scandal on member engagement in two types of rites at normative organizations: rites of integration and rites of passage. Rites of integration focus on the community, celebrate organizational values, and help strengthen organizational identification; they are thus enacted more by core members. Rites of passage focus on the individual, celebrate transition between social roles, and require only occasional engagement; they are thus enacted by core and peripheral members. Because of these differences, we hypothesize that a normative organization’s implication in a scandal affects rites of passage more negatively than rites of integration, but that this effect depends on scandal prevalence among neighboring organizations, organizational age, and organizational size. We test our hypotheses in the context of a child abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Using yearly parish-level data from 1990 to 2010, we find that a parish’s implication in the scandal was associated with a larger decline in rites of passage (marriages, baptisms, and funerals) than in rites of integration (mass attendance). This difference was reversed with the increase in scandal prevalence. Furthermore, rites of integration were more resilient than rites of passage at older and larger parishes. To help rule in the plausibility of our organization-level theory, we present a simulation grounded in individual-level polling data from the context.

  abstract     = {The precipitous growth of remote work has given rise to a new phenomenon: the emergence of relocation incentive programs that localities use to compete for the physical presence of remote workers. Remote workers with high general human capital may create value for their new destinations and reverse net talent outflow from smaller cities in middle America and globally. However, localities seeking to attract, retain, and create value from remote workers face significant challenges because such workers may have a low attachment to their new destination. Analogizing these challenges to the problem of creating and capturing value from workers with general human capital, we argue that localities can benefit from using relocation incentive program by leveraging location-specific attributes that create value for the individual and the locality. We examined these ideas in the context of Tulsa Remote, a program that provides relocation incentives and a bundle of services to increase engagement and embeddedness in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We found that Tulsa Remote increased community engagement, real income, and entrepreneurship of remote workers, benefiting both the community and the individual. Tulsa Remote increased the worker’s willingness to stay, and local community engagement is a key driver of this relationship. This work thus suggests that location specificity enables localities to both create and capture value from remote workers.

  abstract     = {We conduct an experiment to examine how providing decision makers with high versus low peer performance information influences choices between exploration and exploitation. Previous work on organization-level learning suggests that a high-performing peer would fuel exploration, whereas a low-performing peer would dampen it. In line with this, we find that individuals who receive information about a high-performing peer explore more than those who receive information about a low-performing peer. However, we also find that compared to individuals with a low tendency to self-enhance, individuals with a high tendency to self-enhance are less likely to explore when receiving information about a high-performing peer. In fact, these individuals explore at levels comparable to those who receive information about a low-performing peer. We explain this behavioral pattern by demonstrating that as individuals learn and improve, information about a high-performing peer increasingly results in mixed performance feedback; under these conditions of relative interpretive flexibility, exploration is moderated by decision makers’ tendency to self-enhance. When these individual dynamics are aggregated, our data suggest that an organization that provides peer performance information may experience either the same or less exploration than an organization that does not, with the exact difference depending on its proportion of high self-enhancers. These insights into the contingencies and aggregate effects of how individuals interpret and respond to peer performance information are particularly relevant given recent interest in designing organizations that shape employee behavior through the provision of feedback rather than through traditional instruments of coordination and control, such as incentives or hierarchy.

Our results suggest that an increase in financial resources from selling a large winning lottery ticket reduces retailers’ tobacco sales to minors. Next, to rule in strain theory and to rule out alternative explanations, we leverage a second natural experiment, heterogeneity analysis, an alternate measure of misconduct, and an online randomized experiment. In doing so, we provide plausibly causal evidence on the relationship between a firm’s financial resources and its propensity for misconduct and provide potentially useful findings for policymakers and regulators.

However, exemplar similarity may also prompt unfavorable comparisons with exemplar firms, leading to lower analyst recommendations in the assessment stage. We further argue that category coherence, distinctiveness, and exemplar typicality influence the impact of exemplar similarity on firm evaluation.

The successful firms first use a learning process that begins with (1) focused attention on unit profitability (not growth), then broad (not narrow) learning, and finally active delay (not acceleration) of growth. They then use a capability-building process that (2) shifts to focused attention on unit-profitable growth, then makes long-term investments in profit-oriented capabilities, and finally leverages these capabilities into new products. In contrast, peers with focused attention on growth ironically fail to achieve it. Broadly, we contribute a process theory of exceptional growth that fills the gap between the growth of new firms in the entrepreneurship literature and the growth of mature firms in the strategy and organization theory literatures. Further, we add the importance of learning content —not just learning processes—to the entrepreneurship literature on new firm growth and a rare, novel, and grounded account of the origin of capabilities to the strategy literature on the resource-based view and mature firm growth.

Consequently, they are more likely to manage time by engaging in corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to achieve quick growth. In addition, these CEOs are more likely to engage in straightforward deals, acquiring targets that are private, divested, related, small, and using cash payment, because these types of transactions are quicker to complete, carry less risk, and generally come with good performance prospects. Using a sample of firms that underwent new CEO appointments between 1990 and 2017 and detailed employment contract data collected from SEC filings, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

We conducted a two-year qualitative field study at a hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic, examining the trajectories of 33 premeditated change ideas raised by frontline staff. By comparing ideas that persisted to become part of normal operations with those that failed to be selected or retained, we identified practices and conditions that promoted the selection and retention of frontline change ideas. Our study suggests that frontline change advocates can seed the long-term retention of “shovel-ready” ideas—as opposed to de novo ideas—after a jolt by rapidly and opportunistically deploying a novel set of practices before the brief window of opportunity created by lessened constraints and increased managerial receptivity closes. Prior theories of change largely assume frontline-driven change to be slow and continuous, proceeding in a one-off fashion; we explain how and when frontline change can instead occur in rapid, opportunistic bursts. This study advances theories of punctuated equilibrium and bottom-up change in organizations by unearthing an alternative way that change can be intentionally accomplished in organizations.

  abstract     = {The strategy literature highlights the critical role that managerial attention plays in shaping firms’ responses to industry change. However, attention to change alone is not sufficient to precipitate action. The context in which this attention is paid is also critical in determining the translation of attention to action as managers generally pay attention to multiple issues within their strategic agendas. We argue that attention to a competing issue and the breadth of managerial strategic attention impair the relationship between attention to a focal issue and related organizational action as these attentional constraints may lead to hesitancy or confusion at an individual level and reduced coordination at an organizational level. Realizing that at an organizational level, firms vary tremendously with respect to their sizes, resources, and by implication their overall attentional capacities, we argue that the negative moderation impacts of attention to a competing issue and the breadth of strategic attention on the attention to a focal issue–subsequent action relationship are larger for smaller firms. Studying the U.S. electric utility industry and the emerging new distributed electricity generation business model, we find broad support for our arguments and also important nuance. By melding theory, important details of our empirical setting, and intriguing empirical results, we develop greater insights into when and how the other strategic issues to which managers pay attention can shape the translation of managerial attention to a new business model into subsequent organizational action.

  abstract     = {Despite the growing availability of algorithm-augmented work, algorithm aversion is prevalent among employees, hindering successful implementations of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) aids. Applying a social comparison perspective, this article examines the adverse effect of employees’ high performance ranking on their preimplementation attitudes toward the integration of powerful AI aids within their area of advantage. Five studies, using a weight estimation simulation (Studies 1–3), recall of actual job tasks (Study 4), and a workplace scenario (Study 5), provided consistent causal evidence for this effect by manipulating performance ranking (performance advantage compared with peers versus no advantage). Studies 3–4 revealed that this effect was driven in part by employees’ perceived potential loss of standing compared with peers, a novel social-based mechanism complementing the extant explanation operating via one’s confidence in own (versus AI) ability. Stronger causal evidence for this mechanism was provided in Study 5 using a “moderation-of-process” design. It showed that the adverse effect of high performance ranking on preimplementation AI attitudes was reversed when bolstering the stability of future performance rankings (presumably counteracting one’s concern with potential loss of standing). Finally, pointing to the power of symbolic threats, this adverse effect was evident both in the absence of financial incentives for high performance (Study 1) and in various incentive-based settings (Studies 2–3). Implications for understanding and managing high performers’ aversion toward the integration of powerful algorithmic aids are discussed. Funding: This work was supported by the Coller Foundation.
