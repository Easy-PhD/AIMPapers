  abstract     = {Reference points form an essential element of organizations’ problemistic search and adaptation behavior. Yet, if search is triggered by shortfalls compared with peers but alternatives are discovered on the fly, it is not clear whether and when peer comparison leads to better search outcomes. We contribute to the literature by studying how reference points guide search and which outcomes they allow organizations to achieve. Specifically, we develop a model of search in complex landscapes in which agents’ search behavior is guided by an upper (aspiration-level) social reference point and a lower (survival-point) social reference point. In our model, agents move across a subjective “terraced” landscape that is a simplified transformation of the “real” one. The vertical positions and shapes of these terraces are determined by the agents’ reference points and change over time as a result of their own and their peers’ performance evolution. In turn, these terraces define the search space that is navigated and the outcomes that can be reached. We show that the upper and lower bounds play fundamentally different roles in the search process, with the upper bound being more important in the short run and the lower bound more important in the long run. Studying heterogeneous populations, we find that reference points drive dynamic trade-offs between how easily decision makers can reach their aspiration level and how much they benefit from doing so. We highlight the importance of both internal fit between reference points and external fit with environmental factors.

Second, we document the propensities for firms registering copyrights to be involved in copyright litigation. Third, we compare actual data on the incidence of copyright and patent registration with commonly used proxies: advertising and research and development expenditure.

Using a comprehensive longitudinal database of S&P 1500 firms, we test our theoretical predictions and find empirical support for most of our hypotheses except for the moderating effect of industry dynamism.

Such imprints help explain the varying constitutions across U.S. states, which in turn affect the present-day female representation in corporate leadership. Analyzing a firm-level data set supplemented by a state-level sample and extensive robustness checks, I find that the prevalence of Protestantism at the time of a U.S. state’s admission to the Union is positively related to female representation in the leadership teams of S&P 1500 firms. One mechanism for the persistence of the Protestant imprinting is state constitutions’ emphasis on equality issues. In addition, the historical Catholic immigration to different states, serving as a counter-imprinting force, has weakened this effect. My study contributes to imprinting theory by considering dynamics and developing a regional-level institutional imprinting perspective. I also contribute to a more nuanced understanding of historical antecedents and contemporary firm consequences of subnational institutions, tracing the persistent heterogeneities among firms to some deep historical roots.},

Yet, whether family CEOs promote or hinder innovation remains an open question. Given the importance of innovation as well as the ubiquity of family enterprises, this is a major gap. In this study, we focus on a large sample of Danish firms and examine the patenting performance (in terms of patent counts and citations) of these firms. We exploit the gender of departing CEOs’ first-born children to yield exogenous variations in the decision to appoint a family or professional CEO. Our difference-in-differences results indicate that appointing a family CEO leads to an increase in patent counts and citations relative to appointing a professional CEO. These effects are driven by incoming family CEOs who hold a university degree in engineering and, to a lesser extent, business. Appointing a family CEO also leads to fewer job terminations, which suggests that the increase in patenting might stem from higher job stability and tolerance for failure among employees. Our study has implications for the growing literature on the management of family firms and, more broadly, for strategy research on CEO succession.

We show that acquisition of these systems tends to result in higher royalty fees, especially in systems in which “entitlement constraints” bind more tightly, namely where multiunit franchising is emphasized and where franchise units are older. The implication is that relieving entitlement constraints may be an important motive for, or at least an additional benefit of, some acquisitions.},

  abstract     = {We investigate whether strengthened legal protection of trade secrets increases the likelihood of a firm being acquired. Stronger protection can make a firm more attractive for acquisition because of better safeguarding of trade secrets, but it may also increase information asymmetries that discourage potential acquirers. Using the staggered implementation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act in the United States, we show that stronger trade secret protection increases the likelihood of being acquired but also changes firms’ acquisition strategies more broadly depending on the distance between acquirer and target. Compared with domestic acquirers, foreign acquirers are only half as likely to make an acquisition, and they prefer to acquire minority rather than majority stakes. Both domestic and foreign acquirers are more likely to pursue stepwise acquisitions of a target as protection increases, consistent with a real options rationale. Further investigation suggests that, whereas increased trade secret protection increases information asymmetries for all acquirers, foreign acquirers as well as domestic acquirers located further away from a target are disproportionately affected.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine the antecedents of ownership rights within multiunit firms, focusing on the wedge between the control rights and cash-flow rights that parent companies hold over their subsidiaries. We argue that a key antecedent of a parent’s ownership rights in a subsidiary is the extent of the subsidiary’s interdependencies with the firm. Exploring two such interdependencies, we hypothesize that (1) the wedge between parents’ control and cash-flow rights is smaller for subsidiaries that are more closely related to the firm and (2) there is a U-shaped relationship between the extent of a firm’s multimarket contact in an industry and the wedge between parents’ control rights and cash-flow rights for subsidiaries that operate in that industry. We tested our predictions and found evidence supporting the first hypothesis and mixed results for the second in a sample of subsidiaries newly added to French manufacturing firms through acquisitions or de novo creations. In supplementary analyses, we also found that a subsidiary’s interdependencies are also associated with its hierarchical position within the firm’s formal authority structure.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the relationship between disagreement surrounding a startup proposition and its future success. I find that the more venture competition judges disagree on the quality of a startup, the more likely the startup is to succeed, particularly when its proposition is unique. To explain this correlation, I build on the notion that (i) entrepreneurs pursue opportunities based on their subjective beliefs and (ii) common opinion alone cannot be a source of competitive advantage. Therefore, value is disproportionately created and captured by founders with unconventional ideas that spark disagreement, and potential investors should harness disagreement as a predictor of success. I leverage data from 67 venture competitions to show that the empirical implications of this theoretical framework are supported by the data, whereas alternative explanations (e.g., that judges disagree more about risky ventures) are not. Additionally, I provide insights into which evaluators tend to disagree more often (e.g., former entrepreneurs) and which aspects of a startup (e.g., business model) are most polarizing. This work has broad implications for investors and institutions that strive to evaluate the potential of startup ideas.

In this study, we take advantage of the passage of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), which disseminated information through the publication of patent applications, to explore the impact of innovation disclosures on the design of technology acquisition contracts. Consistent with the view that an increase in the availability of information related to the broader technological landscape reduces the need for contractual protections in acquisition contracts, our analysis demonstrates that deals disproportionately affected by AIPA have less expansive MAC clauses and are less likely to feature contingent earnouts. These results provide new evidence linking the use of MAC clauses and earnouts with acquisitions subject to information frictions.},

  abstract     = {Shifting economic circumstances may suggest some degree of resource redeployment of capacity-constrained capabilities. However, a separate question remains as to how corporate actors operate within the space of this economic logic. While prior literature on diversification has tended to highlight the fungibility of resources as a basis for their redeployment, we point to an additional consideration of the complementarity of resources that makes allocation within the firm attractive, what we term a “new best use.” Further, we point to a potential tension as the economic logic suggested by this property of complementarity, and more generally interdependence with the firm’s other resources and activities, may make assessing what constitutes what we term the “new best use” of a resource challenging. The latent fungibility of a resource may differ from the range of reliable assessment of relative value creation. The allocation of resources and capabilities across a firm of any scale or scope is generally guided by the organizational and task structure of the enterprise. Building on these arguments, we consider two classes of factors that might impact the realization of the latent opportunities of resource redeployment. One is the “pipes” of organizational structures and grouping of business units and allocation of decision rights of specific managers to those units, and the other is the “prisms” of the various metrics of performance and value creation that may make resource use across different domains of the business more or less comparable.},

We argue that demand shocks that spur new technology adoption by niche users pull “hub” firms into country technology markets, despite ecosystem bottlenecks, thereby serving to “jumpstart” the process of ecosystem development and technology commercialization. By analyzing global electric vehicle markets over the period 2008–2017, we find that extreme weather events such as abnormal heat-related events spur adoption of electric vehicles by end users, thereby propelling automotive or hub firms’ entry into country technology markets, and the subsequent shift of their electric vehicle product portfolios toward the more radical version of the technology. Notably, such demand shocks propel firms’ commercialization strategy, despite ecosystem bottlenecks such as the lack of regulatory and economic inducements for adoption, relative absence of complements, and product market differences. After entry, entrant firms’ electric vehicle product portfolios transition from hybrids toward radical technology products and investments in complements, albeit contingent on their competitive market position in the legacy technology. We discuss the implications of these findings concerning the uptake of demand shocks, and their robustness to modeling choices, technological generations across extended timeframes, potential mediating forces, and boundary conditions owing to firm and country-market heterogeneity.
