  abstract     = {The capability of higher-ability managers to acquire and use resources more efficiently than lower-ability managers suggests a positive linear relation between labor investment efficiency (LIE) and managerial ability (MA). However, a puzzle emerges about how the best managers set themselves apart from their peers, calling into question the linearity of the relation between LIE and MA. We explore this puzzle by asking how the highest-ability managers achieve the highest performance levels. We then investigate this puzzle empirically by considering alternatives to a linear relation between LIE and MA. We begin with the distinction that managers achieve the highest performance when they combine efficient exploitation of existing products and services with successful exploration for innovations in products and services. This point is relevant to our puzzle because a firm’s labor needs for exploration are high and unpredictable. Thus, we expect the highest-ability managers to purposefully invest more than predicted by a model of optimal labor investment across firms. In contrast, we expect low-ability managers, who are less able to evaluate, forecast, and make efficient investments, to deviate more from predicted labor investment and vacillate between over- and underinvestment. We present evidence that supports our predictions of nonlinear relations between LIE and MA, with high-ability managers investing more than predicted and low-ability managers over- and underinvesting. We make and test related hypotheses about exploration (investment in research and development), and we probe further by relating future firm performance to over- and underinvestment in labor for different levels of MA.

We find that clear, explicit regulations significantly boost crowdfunding volumes in a global sample of digital finance. Using proxies to measure regulatory detail in three types of countries—countries that sometimes, always, or never had regulation—in a series of difference-in-difference regressions, we show a significant positive relation between regulatory clarity and the level of debt crowdfunding. There is little effect on the level of equity crowdfunding. Clear regulations appear to encourage the creation of new crowdfunding platforms rather than concentrating activity in existing ones.

  abstract     = {We establish the first axiomatic theory for diversification indices using six intuitive axioms: nonnegativity, location invariance, scale invariance, rationality, normalization, and continuity. The unique class of indices satisfying these axioms, called the diversification quotients (DQs), are defined based on a parametric family of risk measures. A further axiom of portfolio convexity pins down DQs based on coherent risk measures. The DQ has many attractive properties, and it can address several theoretical and practical limitations of existing indices. In particular, for the popular risk measures value at risk and expected shortfall, the corresponding DQ admits simple formulas, and it is efficient to optimize in portfolio selection. Moreover, it can properly capture tail heaviness and common shocks, which are neglected by traditional diversification indices. When illustrated with financial data, the DQ is intuitive to interpret, and its performance is competitive against other diversification indices.

However, in experimental settings with one-sided noncompliance extant empirical approaches may not produce the estimands a decision maker needs to solve the problem of interest. For example, these experimental designs are common in digital advertising settings but typical methods do not yield effects that inform the intensive margin: how many consumers should be reached or how much should be spent on a campaign. We propose a solution that combines a novel multicell experimental design with modern estimation techniques that enables decision makers to solve problems with an intensive margin. Our design is straightforward to implement and does not require additional budget. We illustrate our method through simulations calibrated using an advertising experiment at Facebook, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios and its advantage over direct optimization approaches.

  abstract     = {The renewed interest among managers and management researchers in stakeholder governance has also underscored the shortage of quantitative methods available for studying business firms as political systems. A critical problem for researchers applying coalition-based theories of organizational politics to observational data is that the units of analysis, coined “subcoalitions,” are often unobservable. This paper introduces subcoalition cluster analysis (SCA) as a new computational framework for analyzing intrafirm conflict that permits researchers to model groups of heterogeneous actors in terms of a smaller set of representative subcoalitions. The SCA approach to identifying latent fault-lines among groups of actors is based on widely held ideas in management research about the structure of intrafirm coalition politics, is computationally practicable in settings with many alternatives or actors, and can be straightforwardly applied to observational settings with incomplete data on actor preferences. We then apply SCA to two cases in which an organization characterized by multiple, partially inconsistent goals and stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences face a politically contested decision. In both cases, we first analyze preference data using SCA to identify the subcoalition structure that best characterizes the set of actors in the organization. We then use the SCA output as a dependent variable in an analysis of the predictors of subcoalition membership in the first case and as an independent variable in an analysis of the changing patterns of social influence in the second.

  abstract     = {We investigate whether and to what extent financial markets value and respond to operations management (OM)-related information in quarterly earnings calls directed toward financial market participants. We develop and use a novel construct called “stated OM focus” (SOMF) to mine the incidence of and emphasis on OM information in the quarterly earnings conference calls for a large cross-section of firms (S&P 1500) over a time frame of 15 years. We empirically establish the value-relevance of OM information as well as summarize and capture both explanatory and predictive aspects of the OM function’s contribution to firm value. We show that OM-related information disclosed by firms systematically, significantly, positively, and persistently affects abnormal stock returns after controlling for known covariates and controls (financial metrics, standard OM metrics, firm and time effects, and lexical-structure related) and after accounting for earnings surprise. Furthermore, we find evidence that firms’ stated OM focus bears significant predictive power in the short term. Long-short portfolios, created using a sorting signal derived solely from stated OM-focus information, predict future abnormal returns consistently over one, two and three months forward from the earnings call event. We show that the OM information metric is reliable and bears internal, external, and predictive validity. These findings offer useful implications for firms, financial market participants, and OM function stakeholders. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

Whereas such leveraged payouts privately benefit shareholders, leverage comes at the social cost of distorting their incentives, thereby lowering productivity and discouraging investment. If leverage is unregulated (for example, because of the presence of a shadow banking system), then the optimal monetary policy seeks to contain such socially costly leveraged payouts by stimulating investment in response to adverse shocks only up to a level below the first best. The optimal monetary policy may even consist of leaning against the wind, that is, not stimulating the economy at all, in order to fully contain leveraged payouts and maintain productive efficiency.

  abstract     = {Generative large language models (GLLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, are emerging as powerful tools for textual analysis tasks in accounting research. GLLMs can solve any textual analysis task solvable using nongenerative methods as well as tasks previously only solvable using human coding. Whereas GLLMs are new and powerful, they also come with limitations and present new challenges that require care and due diligence. This paper highlights the applications of GLLMs for accounting research and compares them with existing methods. It also provides a framework on how to effectively use GLLMs by addressing key considerations, such as model selection, prompt engineering, and ensuring construct validity. In a case study, I demonstrate the capabilities of GLLMs by detecting nonanswers in earnings conference calls, a traditionally challenging task to automate. The new GPT method achieves an accuracy of 96% and reduces the nonanswer error rate by 70% relative to the existing Gow et al. (2021) method. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing bias, replicability, and data sharing concerns when using GLLMs. Taken together, this paper provides researchers, reviewers, and editors with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and evaluate GLLMs for academic research.

  abstract     = {Despite utilizing technical prevention methods and enacting copyright protection legislation, digital piracy has remained a persistent problem. We examine policy remedies to digital piracy whereby the policymaker has to balance its budget between fines on detected pirates, subsidies for legal purchases, and restitution to the firm. In our model, users choose whether to subscribe, copy, or not use the good, a firm decides on subscription fee and quality, and a policymaker determines subsidies, fines, and restitution. We find that the firm’s subscription fee is always increasing in subsidies, fines, and restitution under a budget balance constraint. The impact of these policy instruments on the firm’s investment in quality depends on how user marginal utility is influenced by the quality of the good and how the policymaker redistributes fines back to society, if at all. Using two specific functional forms with additive and multiplicative utility, we explain how these factors come into play. With additive utility, fines increase the firm’s investment in quality. However, with multiplicative utility the firm’s investment in quality decreases with fines if fines are used alone or alongside subsidies. In contrast to prior research, findings of our general framework illustrate that imposing fines on detected pirates “can” be socially optimal when accounting for the policymaker’s budget balance. Our specific functional forms also serve as two instances where imposing fines is always welfare maximizing. Finally, we find that although the policymaker’s optimal intervention improves social welfare and mitigates digital piracy, it leads to a reduction in consumer surplus.

  abstract     = {Bankruptcy reforms that improve lenders’ ability to recover claims from financially distressed borrowers can mitigate zombie lending. However, we show that after a 2016 bankruptcy reform in India, lenders are reluctant to recognize zombie credit as nonperforming, impeding reform efficacy. A subsequent complementary regulation targeting lender discretion in recognizing nonperforming assets improves zombie recognition fivefold. The lender disincentive to recognize zombies arises from undercapitalized banks’ reluctance to realize loan losses and political economy frictions at state-owned banks. Resolving zombie credit allows lenders to redirect credit to healthy borrowers, but effects are muted at banks more exposed to zombie borrowers. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {The dynamics of random transitive delegations on a graph are of particular interest when viewed through the lens of an emerging voting paradigm: liquid democracy . This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations that they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing that they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of N = 168 participants, 62 delegation graphs, and over 11,000 votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm.

  abstract     = {The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.

  abstract     = {Investors have limited and time-varying attention. These constraints are heterogeneous across investors, which can create asymmetric information and adverse selection problems. We show how firms take these constraints into account: They release harder-to-process news in periods when investor attention is higher. We use an institutional discontinuity within the U.S. corporate filing system to measure these effects. Filings before 5:30 p.m. become available immediately, whereas filings after 5:30 p.m. only become visible the next morning and attract less attention. Firms release longer and more complex news just before the cutoff, giving investors the longest possible period to absorb the information before markets open. Firms experience faster price convergence and more liquidity after precutoff news despite their complexity, which is consistent with the additional attention that they attract. We outline a framework in which the need for investors to spread their attention across different ideas induces firms to file their more complex filings at times when investor attention is higher. Our results are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors pay more attention to complex news and in which firms with complex news time them to target investor attention.

  abstract     = {Decision makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real data sets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension d relative to commonly employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for “data-poor” instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance trade-off over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension d . Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real data sets. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

  abstract     = {We provide strong empirical evidence for time-series predictability of the intraday return on the aggregate market portfolio by exploiting lagged high-frequency cross-sectional returns on the factor zoo. Our results rely on the use of modern machine-learning techniques to regularize the predictive regressions and help tame the signals stemming from the zoo together with techniques from financial econometrics to differentiate between continuous and theoretically nonpredictable discontinuous high-frequency price increments. Using the predictions from the model estimated for the aggregate market portfolio in the formulation of simple intraday trading strategies for a set of highly liquid ETFs results in sizeable out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and alphas after accounting for transaction costs. Further dissecting the abnormal intraday returns, we find that most of the superior performance may be traced to periods of high economic uncertainty and a few key factors related to tail risk and liquidity, pointing to slow-moving capital and the gradual incorporation of new information as the underlying mechanisms at work.

  abstract     = {Satellite images of the parking lots of U.S. retail firms provide information about the firms’ future earnings, and the limited access to these images produces information asymmetry between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors. We construct a cloud-based information risk (CIR) measure to capture this satellite information risk and investigate its asset pricing performance. We find that CIR positively predicts future stock returns of retail firms in the cross-section and that the predictability cannot be explained by weather reasons. We provide evidence that CIR indeed captures the information asymmetry among investors. The profitability of short selling is more pronounced on clear days. The return predictability of CIR is more pronounced in preannouncement periods. During cloudy days, parking lot traffic data from satellite images are harder to obtain, and the retail store sales estimated using parking lot data are noisier. We further show that high CIR is associated with low liquidity and that the decrease in liquidity purchases is greater than the decrease in liquidity sales. Our empirical analyses suggest that information asymmetry is priced and that CIR affects equity premiums through the liquidity channel, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions from a noisy rational expectations equilibrium model under imperfect competition.

By focusing on price-directed search markets, we offer a novel perspective on the application of limited time offers by firms and their implications for social welfare. We build a search model where firms advertise dynamic pricing to influence a consumer’s search order. Across various model settings, we demonstrate that limited time offers serve as the most effective pricing tool for firms to achieve search prominence or implement search discrimination, with their impact on social welfare varying depending on the market context. In particular, although existing literature suggests that limited time offers are anticompetitive in markets where prices are unobservable presearch, our findings show that, in markets with observable prices, limited time offers can enhance social efficiency in certain cases by facilitating a socially optimal search order.

  abstract     = {Two-sided platforms rely on their recommendation algorithms to help visitors successfully find a match. However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch, which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits, a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit’s volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform’s recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this external traffic in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform’s problem as a special case of online matching, where (using VolunteerMatch terminology) volunteers arrive sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which has a finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform’s online algorithm selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating the performance of different algorithms, we refine the notion of competitive ratio by parameterizing it based on the amount of external traffic. After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly used algorithm that is optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm, adaptive capacity ( AC ), which accounts for matches differently based on whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower bound on AC ’s competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external traffic and that is close to (and, in some regimes, exactly matches) the parameterized upper bound we establish on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical study motivated by VolunteerMatch data where we demonstrate the strong performance of AC relative to current practice and further our understanding of the difference between AC and other commonly used algorithms.

  abstract     = {This paper studies category captaincy , a vertical relationship where retailers delegate shelf placement and pricing decisions of an entire product category to one of the leading manufacturers within that category. These contracts involve preferential treatment given to certain brands within the retailer. However, they are confidential, and empirical analysis has been limited. To study the prevalence and welfare impact of these contracts, I develop a novel approach to infer the presence of captaincy contracts based on preferential treatment in shelf placement and pricing. I first classify retailers into different captaincy types based on a brand × retailer specific quality of shelf placement inferred from a demand model. I then conduct pricing tests and find that captains, in line with theoretical predictions and industry anecdotes, eliminate double markups from their own products but not from competitor products. Comparative statics show that captaincy relationships increase the market share of the captain, but they can also increase consumer welfare by about 5% due to the elimination of double markups on the captain’s products.

  abstract     = {Urban infrastructure is vital for sustainable cities. In recent years, municipal governments have invested heavily in the expansion of bike lane networks to meet growing demand, promote ridership, and reduce emissions. However, reallocating road capacity to cycling is often contentious because of the risk of amplifying traffic congestion. In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment—including the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest—with the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago’s bike lane network. We estimate that adding 25 miles of bike lanes as prescribed by our model can lift cycling ridership from 3.6% to 6.1%, with at most a 9.4% increase in driving times. We also find that three intuitive heuristics for bike lane planning can lead to lower ridership and worse congestion outcomes, highlighting the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to urban infrastructure planning.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how having more White coworkers influences the subsequent retention and promotion of Black women relative to other race-gender groups. Studying 9,037 new hires at a professional services firm, we first document large racial turnover and promotion gaps: Even after controlling for observable characteristics, Black employees are 6.7 percentage points (32%) more likely to turn over within two years and 18.7 percentage points (26%) less likely to be promoted on time than their White counterparts. The largest turnover gap is between Black and White women, at 8.9 percentage points (51%). We argue that initial assignment to project teams is conditionally random based on placebo tests and qualitative evidence. Under this assumption, we show that a one-standard-deviation (20.8 percentage points) increase in the share of White coworkers is associated with a 15.8-percentage-point increase in turnover and an 11.5-percentage-point decrease in promotion for Black women. We refer to these effects as intersectional: Black women are the only race-gender group whose turnover and promotion are negatively impacted by White coworkers. We explore potential causal pathways through which these peer effects may emerge: Black women who were initially assigned to Whiter teams are subsequently more likely to be labeled as low performers and report fewer billable hours, both of which are predictors of higher turnover and lower promotion for all employees. Our findings contribute to the literature on peer effects, intersectionality, and the practice of managing race and gender inequality in organizations.

  abstract     = {A critical governance challenge for on-demand digital platforms is to increase the participation of their service providers. In this research, we design novel incentive structures by taking the unique features of on-demand digital platforms into account. In 12 micro randomized trials conducted in partnership with a major on-demand digital platform, we examine how combining monetary with nonmonetary incentives and providing them within a loss-aversion framework could motivate service providers to increase their participation levels. We show that in on-demand platforms the nonmonetary incentives inhibit the impact of monetary incentives on service provider participation once they are offered together. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional work settings, offering incentives within a loss-aversion framework only increases the effectiveness of nonmonetary incentives. We provide theoretical explanations and empirical examinations for these counterintuitive results. The insights from this research could be used by on-demand digital platforms to effectively mobilize and sustain their service providers’ participation to meet real-time stochastic demand.

  abstract     = {There is evidence that many people do not report their types truthfully in strategy-proof mechanisms. One of the leading explanations is mechanism complexity. We propose a novel way of describing any strategy-proof mechanism with the aim to reduce the ensuing cognitive load on players and, hence, to increase truthful reporting. The description highlights that a player is guaranteed to obtain a most preferred feasible allocation based on her reported type and that feasibility depends only on the other players’ reports. Optimality of truthful reporting should therefore become more “apparent.” We experimentally test this prediction using the top trading cycles mechanism for matching applicants to positions. The proposed description increases truth-telling. This increase positively interacts with subject numeracy. This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {We propose a new performance attribution framework that decomposes a constrained portfolio’s holdings, expected returns, variance, expected utility, and realized returns into components attributable to (1) the unconstrained mean-variance optimal portfolio; (2) individual static constraints; and (3) information, if any, arising from those constraints. A key contribution of our framework is the recognition that constraints may contain information that is correlated with returns, in which case imposing such constraints can affect performance. We extend our framework to accommodate estimation risk in portfolio construction using Bayesian portfolio analysis, which allows one to select constraints that improve—or are least detrimental to—future performance. We provide simulations and empirical examples involving constraints on environmental, social, and governance portfolios. Under certain scenarios, constraints may improve portfolio performance relative to a passive benchmark that does not account for the information contained in these constraints.

  abstract     = {Two-stage screening programs for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection typically involve a first-stage test that evaluates fecal-hemoglobin (f-Hb) concentration in stool samples, with positive results leading to a recommended second-stage diagnostic test (colonoscopy). We explore the design of the first-stage test—specifically the selection of f-Hb cutoffs to report test outcomes—to balance screening effectiveness (CRC and polyp detection) and efficiency (colonoscopy costs), considering that not all individuals follow up with a colonoscopy. We propose an information design model that integrates Bayesian persuasion with information avoidance to address this issue. The model is applied to the design of Singapore’s CRC screening program and calibrated using data from multiple sources, including a nationwide survey of 3,920 respondents in Singapore. Our findings indicate that under certain conditions, using a single cutoff maximizes follow-up adherence, whereas showing exact f-Hb readings optimizes detection effectiveness. Raising the cutoff to 39 μ g / g , as compared with the current practice, could detect 21% more CRC and polyp cases, reduce colonoscopies by 27%, and lower lifetime CRC risk by 11%. This adjustment would reduce public healthcare expenditure by S$20 million and individual spending by S$12 million on average in screening costs. Choosing appropriate cutoffs for the first-stage test can significantly enhance the screening effectiveness while efficiently managing colonoscopy demands. The prevalent practice of using lower cutoffs to achieve high sensitivity may lead to excessive unnecessary colonoscopies and reduced follow-up adherence.

  abstract     = {Businesses across industries, such as food delivery apps and GPS navigation systems, routinely provide customers with time estimates in inherently uncertain contexts. How does the format of these time estimates affect customers’ satisfaction? In particular, should companies provide customers with a point estimate representing the best estimate, or should they communicate the inherent uncertainty in outcomes by providing a range estimate? In eight preregistered experiments ( N = 5,323), participants observed time estimates provided by an app, and we manipulated whether the app presented the time estimates as a point estimate (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 45 minutes.”) or a range (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 40–50 minutes.”). After participants learned about the app’s prediction performance by sampling a set of past outcomes, we measured participants’ evaluation of the app. We find that participants judged the app more positively when it provided a range rather than a point estimate. These results held across different domains, different time durations, different underlying outcome distributions, and an incentive-compatible design. We also find that this preference is not simply due to people’s dislike of late outcomes, as participants also rated ranges more positively than conservative point estimates corresponding to the upper (i.e., later) bound of the range. These findings suggest that companies can increase customer satisfaction with realized time estimates by communicating the uncertainty inherent in these time estimates.

  abstract     = {GAAP’s “Management Approach” to segment reporting (ASC 280) requires firms to report segment profit/loss as the measure managers use when allocating resources internally across segments under the assumption that investors benefit from viewing segment performance through the eyes of management. We examine how segment performance measurement aligns with the way that investors use segment profit/loss measures externally. We first survey professional investors and find that they primarily use segment profit/loss to assess firm value and therefore desire measures focused on persistent income items that help predict future performance. Next, for a sample of public multi-segment firms from 2003 to 2018, we hand-collect details on the construction of firms’ segment profit/loss measures and compare them to the same firms’ valuation-focused measures (i.e., non-GAAP earnings and non-GAAP segment profit/loss). Relative to non-GAAP measures, ASC 280 segment profit/loss is significantly more likely to include less persistent items (e.g., restructuring charges) and exclude more persistent items (e.g., interest expense). ASC 280 segment profit/loss is also less predictive of future performance and less value relevant than non-GAAP measures. These differences are attributable to ASC 280 yielding segment profit/loss measures that focus on the controllability of items by segment managers instead of items’ persistence. Overall, ASC 280’s segment profit/loss exhibits misalignment between its internal use by managers (i.e., internal resource allocation) and its primary external use by investors (i.e., valuation), which limits its usefulness for investors. Our study informs market participants and standard setters considering the usefulness of segment disclosures. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.

  abstract     = {We examine how dimensions of information technology (IT) strategy affect the performance of young businesses, as well as dynamics as they age. Drawing from lifecycle theory and firm boundary research, we derive the relationship between age-based performance differences and IT sourcing decisions. We highlight the dynamic tension between outsourcing’s support for accessing frontier inputs in the short term and ownership’s advantages for developing organization-specific resources and capabilities over time. Leveraging a large panel of Census Bureau microdata from 2006 to 2014, we provide the first systematic evidence that young manufacturing establishments (both startups and new units of existing firms) disproportionately benefit from modern IT outsourcing (ITO). The young also enjoy productivity benefits from owned IT capital (ITK), despite high uncertainty, smaller operational scale, and less complementary organizational capital. Although these returns appear commensurate with those of older producers, they are conditional on survival, which is improved by ITO but harmed by ITK accumulation. Combining flexibility-related gains from ITK with vintage-related advantages in early ITK investment, the young are revealed to have significantly greater IT productivity than older incumbents. A large battery of tests supports a causal interpretation, as well as mechanisms rooted in mitigating the effects of uncertainty (as opposed to size- or cost-related reasons). These findings illuminate an often-overlooked pattern of young-business dynamism relevant to economic trends and management practices in an increasingly digital age.

  abstract     = {Many two-sided marketplaces rely on match recommendations to help customers find suitable service providers at suitable prices. This paper develops a tractable methodology that a platform can use to optimize its match recommendation policy to maximize the total value generated by the platform while accounting for the endogeneity of transaction prices, which are set by the providers based on supply and demand and can depend on the platform’s match recommendation policy. Despite the complications of price endogeneity, an optimal match recommendation policy has a simple structure and can be computed efficiently. In particular, an optimal policy always recommends the providers who deliver the highest conversion rates. Moreover, an optimal policy can be encoded simply in terms of the frequency of recommending each provider to each customer segment, without the need to encode which subsets of providers are to be recommended together. On the other hand, if the platform were to optimize its match recommendations without accounting for price endogeneity, then the resultant policy would be more complex, and the market is likely to get stuck at a strictly suboptimal outcome, even if the platform were to continually reoptimize its match recommendations after prices re-equilibrate.

We developed and estimated a model that provides a new measure of financial literacy and disentangles confidence from knowledge.

  abstract     = {With the increased frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks, policymakers and the private sector search for ways to counter this threat. One of the main initiatives suggested to achieve this goal is sharing cybersecurity-related information. Although the general belief is that information sharing can increase both industry profit and social welfare, it is unclear whether firms would voluntarily share such information. In this paper, we examine the incentives of firms to share cybersecurity-related information, how information sharing impacts investments in cyber resilience, and the aggregate impact on welfare. We find that firms only voluntarily share information in less competitive markets when the impact of the disruption is high. In all other cases, firms elect not to share information, despite potential welfare benefits. To facilitate information sharing, we investigate an exclusionary policy (i.e., sharing must be mutual) and demonstrate market conditions under which this policy incentivizes information sharing. However, when competition is intense, even the exclusionary policy is ineffective because it reduces industry profit. To inform stronger interventions, we examine firms being mandated to disclose their private cyberthreat information. We demonstrate that an opportunity does exist for such disclosure, particularly when the cost of investing in cyber resilience is high. However, policymakers must use caution with such a policy because applying this intervention when investment costs are not high leads to a steep reduction in welfare. This paper was accepted by D. J.

  abstract     = {This study investigates how tie formation shapes the production of user-generated content on social media, offering insights into enhancing user engagement and alleviating social media fatigue. We conceptualize tie formation as a relationship codevelopment process involving a tie initiator and a respondent. Drawing on social psychology literature, we propose a framework that traces how initiators’ social cognition evolves throughout this process—from proactively extending an inviting social tie to receiving a responsive one in return. Central to our framework is a perceptual mechanism we term relational resonance , which fosters intrinsic motivation and prompts initiators to adjust their content creation. Using data from YouTube, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify individual creators’ content adjustments, measured by changes in video volume and viewer engagement. Our results reveal that while initiators tend to reduce content production after receiving a responsive tie, the videos they create generate higher engagement, with “like” and “subscribe” rates increasing by 1.1 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. Remarkably, the receipt of a responsive tie leads to average weekly increases of 66 likes and 183 subscriptions even after accounting for the decrease in video volume, reinforcing the “quality over quantity” principle in content creation strategies. An online experiment further elucidates the mechanism underlying the observed adjustment behavior, providing robust validation for our proposed framework.

We model the revenue optimization of a publisher that auctions off advertising impressions to intermediary exchanges, which, in turn, run their own internal auctions among the advertisers they represent. We show that the resulting auction-of-auctions market arrangement suffers from a double marginalization problem: the multitier bid shading prompts the publisher to raise the reserve price above the level under the nonintermediated benchmark. The reserve distortion decreases channel efficiency as well as the profits of all channel members. Our findings also demonstrate that, in the auction of auctions, reserve price optimization is both more intricate and more important than in the direct mechanism: optimal reserves depend on the number of both exchanges and advertisers. Moreover, optimizing the reserve price given a fixed number of bidders may be more profitable than keeping the auction absolute and adding more bidders. Interestingly, we find that a simple scheme in which exchanges coordinate to charge their advertisers a fixed percentage commission perfectly coordinates the channel.

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of crowdfunding on venture capital (VC) investments in the presence of competition among VC firms. Our economic model comprises a startup, a crowdfunding platform, and two VC firms, each with its own perception of the startup’s potential. The startup seeks equity funding from the VC firms and decides on the size of its equity offer. If the VC firms decline to invest, the startup pivots to crowdfunding. Following the crowdfunding campaign, all firms update their beliefs about the startup’s likelihood of success based on the crowdfunding outcome, prompting the VC firms to revisit their investment decisions, now with a reduced equity offer if the crowdfunding outcome was positive. This study provides theoretical underpinnings at the firm level for the observed aggregate-level empirical relationships, both positive and negative, between crowdfunding and VC investments. Specifically, based on our model, the positive relationship, where increased crowdfunding activity leads to a rise in subsequent VC investments, is attributed to startups that fail to secure VC funding in the absence of a crowdfunding platform but succeed in attracting VC attention after a successful crowdfunding campaign. In contrast, the negative relationship is attributed to highly valued startups that could have secured VC funding without crowdfunding, but with crowdfunding, VC firms choose to defer their investment decision until after the crowdfunding campaign’s result is known; on the one hand, a successful crowdfunding outcome lowers their post-crowdfunding VC investment demand, and on the other hand, an unsuccessful outcome deters potential VC investors. Besides these relationships, we also identify another dynamic, where the option of accessing crowdfunding raises VC investment, even if the startup does not actually launch a crowdfunding campaign.

  abstract     = {Marketers rely on various online advertising channels to reach customers and are increasingly interested in multi-touch attribution , which evaluates the contribution of each touchpoint to a conversion. However, as the numbers of marketing channels and touchpoints increase, the attribution challenge becomes more intricate because of the complex interplay among different touchpoints within and across channels. Utilizing customer path-to-purchase data, this article addresses this challenge by developing a novel graphical point process framework to investigate the relational structure among various touchpoints. Based on this framework, we propose graphical attribution methods that allocate attribution scores to individual touchpoints or corresponding channels for each customer’s path to purchase. These scores are calculated using a probabilistic definition of removal effects. We evaluate the proposed methods and compare their performance with commonly used attribution models through extensive simulation studies and a real-world attribution application.

  abstract     = {We document the frequent use of stock lockup agreements in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) paid in stock and examine the corporate determinants and consequences of the use and duration of lockups. Lockup agreements prohibit target shareholders from selling shares issued by the acquirer as a means of payment for a prespecified period. We find support for the hypothesis that target shareholders agree to lockups to precommit to hold on to the acquirer’s stock if they believe the merger’s long-term fundamentals are strong. Consistent with our hypothesis, lockups come with larger acquirer announcement returns, particularly when acquirer valuations are high; ex ante, lockup adoption likelihood increases with acquirers’ valuation. Lockups also come with higher deal completion likelihood, shorter merger negotiations, and higher long-term operating performance. We conclude the market interprets lockups as a signal of strong fundamentals, particularly when acquirers’ valuations are high. This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.

  abstract     = {Product drops occur when a retailer releases a limited-edition product line on a specific date for a short period of time. Due to limited inventory of the product and the short sales horizon, a resale market emerges where products may resell at higher prices once the firm stocks out. The firm faces a central tradeoff: pricing too high may lead to a longer stockout time and future markdowns; pricing too low may lead to transfer of profits to resellers. Any firm in this position may ask, “How do resellers impact my profit?” To answer this question, we build a dynamic structural model that captures customer decisions to consume or strategically resell, as well as the firm’s intertemporal pricing decision in the presence of resellers. We estimate our model using a unique data set from a retailer of baby clothing with weekly product drops, where customers engage in a resale marketplace through Facebook groups. We find resale data collection and analysis is valuable to incorporate into pricing as firm profit increases by 8.8%, and reseller presence reduces firm profit by 5.8% even if resale data are used in pricing. These impacts are magnified by resale market growth, demonstrating that managers need to take action as resale markets gain wider adoption.

  abstract     = {This study examines the impact of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on the performance of mobile network operators (MNOs) in the presence of overlapping generations of wireless mobile network technologies (2G and 3 G). MVNOs distribute MNOs’ mobile services to customers without owning any spectrum or network infrastructures, either as a subsidiary (branded MVNOs) or delegated under wholesale agreements with MNOs (third-party MVNOs). We investigate MVNO value chain governance, that is, delegation, in the context of overlapping generations of technologies. Leveraging a proprietary data set, we design a quasi-experiment to analyze the impact of branded and third-party MVNOs in 2G and 3 G market expansion. Using first a difference-in-differences analysis and then dynamic propensity score matching, we find that an MNO’s 2G market share increases if the MNO launches a third-party MVNO, whereas its 3 G market share increases if it launches a branded MVNO. More importantly, the positive effects of branded MVNOs diminish over time, but those of third-party MVNOs become stronger over time. For managers challenged by managing overlapping generations of technologies, it is important to customize value chain governance for market expansion: to create branded MVNOs to explore new mobile technologies, and to delegate to third-party MVNOs to exploit existing technology markets when the technology market is mature.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the impact of the expansion of the U.S. Postal Service in the late 19th century on firm creation and performance. Utilizing newly digitized archival data on historic business establishments, post office locations, and road networks in California, our study identifies a positive relationship between the expansion of the Postal Service and the emergence of new firms. To address endogeneity concerns, we leverage an unexpected change in the Postal Service route network. Our findings suggest that the Postal Service played a significant role in facilitating firm entry by acting as a carrier of specialized knowledge rather than as a financial service or mass communication infrastructure. We further reveal that, although increased competition from new entrants generally exerted downward pressure on incumbent firms, those relying on specialized knowledge and public technology inputs significantly benefited from local Postal Service access. Taken together, our study underscores the critical role played by the Postal Service in knowledge diffusion and local economic development by enabling the sourcing of specialized knowledge and technologies from other geographies. Overall, our results contribute to a broader understanding of how communication and knowledge dissemination infrastructure can drive entrepreneurship and firm growth, carrying important implications for contemporary discussions on infrastructure development, its potential to stimulate entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and foster local economic communities.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of consumer heterogeneity on online ratings. Consumers differ in their experience, which can affect both their choices and ratings. Thus, biases in average ratings can arise when the opinions of experienced and novice users are aggregated. We first build a two-period model to characterize the biases’ drivers and consequences. We test our theory combining data from IMDb and MovieLens, two well-known movie ratings platforms. We proxy users’ experience with the total number of ratings posted on the platforms. First, using external measures of quality, such as the Academy awards and nominations, we show that, on both platforms, experienced users, on average, rate movies of higher quality compared with novices. Moreover, they post more stringent ratings than novices for more than 98% of movies. Combined, these imply a compression in aggregate ratings, and thus a bias against high quality movies. We then propose a simple, fixed-point algorithm to debias ratings. Our debiased ratings demonstrate the presence of ranking reversals for more than 8% of comparisons in our sample. As a result, our debiased ratings better correlate with external measures of quality. This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing.

  abstract     = {We study the reliable (uncapacitated) facility location (RFL) problem in a data-driven environment where historical observations of random demands and disruptions are available. Owing to the combinatorial optimization nature of the RFL problem and the mixed-binary randomness of parameters therein, the state-of-the-art RFL models applied to the data-driven setting either suggest overly conservative solutions or become computationally prohibitive for large- or even moderate-size problems. In this paper, we address the RFL problem by presenting an innovative prescriptive model aiming to balance solution conservatism with computational efficiency. In particular, our model selects facility locations to minimize the fixed costs plus the expected operating costs approximated by a tractable data-driven estimator, which equals to a probabilistic upper bound on the intractable Kolmogorov distributionally robust optimization estimator. The solution of our model is obtained by solving a mixed-integer linear program that does not scale in the training data size. Our approach is proved to be asymptotically optimal, and offers a theoretical guarantee for its out-of-sample performance in situations with limited data. In addition, we discuss the adaptation of our approach when facing data with covariate information. Numerical results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms several important RFL models with respect to both in-sample and out-of-sample performances as well as computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Many digital products follow an open-innovation model, wherein the open boundaries facilitate copying (forking) the codebase and creating new products, which may compete with the parents for user demand. Although a rich body of literature highlights the benefits of open source such as the availability of developers with diverse skill sets and accelerated innovation, the competition effects of forked products on the demand of their parents remain understudied. Using data from major cryptocurrencies and their forked products created between 2011 and 2021, we study how these entrants impact the demand for parent cryptocurrencies. We categorize cryptocurrencies as transaction or platform types. Transaction coins are primarily used for the exchange of goods and services, whereas platform coins offer additional capabilities such as hosting applications or third-party services. We find that parents with only transaction capabilities experience a negative impact on demand. Although popularity may shield the parents to a certain extent, the substitution effect is still dominant. However, popular coins with platform capabilities do not experience a decrease in demand when competing with forked entrants; an increase in smart contract transactions due to their compatibility with the competing forked products offsets the negative substitution effect observed for regular transactions. Our study underscores the competitive dynamics of open innovation and provides managerial insights for firms considering open models for product development. Our results highlight the importance of considering both substitution and complementarities when assessing the risks and benefits of the open-innovation model.

  abstract     = {In response to users’ evolving desire for choice and control over their personal data, numerous platforms across sectors have been updating privacy policies. Unlike public regulations that mandate uniform compliance, many platforms grant a more flexible time window for complementors to adopt privacy policies. Although several studies have examined the impact of privacy policies, the consequences of delayed policy adoption under time flexibility remain largely unexplored. This study is among the first to investigate the impact of apps delaying policy adoption in the context of a privacy policy change. The context of our research is the upgrade to Android version 6.0, which gave consumers more control over their personal data. Apps were given a three-year grace period to adopt the new privacy policy, during which apps that did not adopt the policy could still run on the latest Android version. We leverage this variation in policy adoption by apps to examine its impact on apps’ marketplace outcomes. By installing over 13,691 popular apps on emulators, we detect exactly when each app upgrades to version 6.0. We combine this unique data set with multiple data sets to quantify the impact of delaying the upgrade. We find that delaying the upgrade results in a significant loss of downloads and user ratings for apps. Frequently maintaining the apps without upgrading can only partially mitigate these declines. In further examining who delays upgrades and why, we find that apps that display in-app advertising and overreach for permissions are more likely to delay upgrading, suggesting a strategic trade-off between marketplace outcomes and the ability to collect data continuously. The findings of our study highlight the need to carefully consider participants’ potential strategic behaviors in designing policy implementation. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings. This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems.

  abstract     = {Marketplace companies rely heavily on experimentation when making changes to the design or operation of their platforms. The workhorse of experimentation is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, in which users are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. However, marketplace interference causes the stable unit treatment value assumption to be violated, leading to bias in the standard RCT metric. In this work, we propose techniques for platforms to run standard RCTs and still obtain meaningful estimates despite the presence of marketplace interference. We specifically consider a generalized matching setting, in which the platform explicitly matches supply with demand via a linear programming algorithm. Our first proposal is for the platform to estimate the value of global treatment and global control via optimization. We prove that this approach is unbiased in the fluid limit. Our second proposal is to compare the average shadow price of the treatment and control groups rather than the total value accrued by each group. We prove that this technique corresponds to the correct first order approximation (in a Taylor series sense) of the value function of interest even in a finite-size system. We then use this result to prove that, under reasonable assumptions, our estimator is less biased than the RCT estimator. At the heart of our result is the idea that it is relatively easy to model interference in matching-driven marketplaces because, in such markets, the platform mediates the spillover.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the direct and spillover effects on mobility caused by the staggered adoption of stay-at-home orders (SHOs) implemented by U.S. counties to contain COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declines by a third to a half as much as in the counties that implement the SHOs. Furthermore, these spillovers are concentrated in counties that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we also find that declines in internal mobility in the neighbor counties account for a much larger proportion of the overall decline in mobility than decreases in traffic originating in the treated counties. Together, these results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and voluntary social distancing. Based on our estimates and a simple model of staggered SHO adoption, we construct counterfactual scenarios that separate the impact of policy coordination from that of adoption timing. We find that staggered implementation of SHOs could yield mobility reductions that are larger than coordinated but delayed SHO adoption. This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {Traditionally, incentives to promote behavioral change are assigned rather than chosen. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically investigate the alternative approach of letting people choose their own incentives from a menu of increasingly challenging and rewarding options. When individuals are heterogeneous and have private information about their costs and benefits, we theoretically show that leaving them the choice of incentives can improve both adherence and welfare. We test the theoretical predictions in a field experiment based on daily meditation sessions. We randomly assign some participants to one of two incentive schemes and allow others to choose between the two schemes. As predicted, participants sort into schemes in (partial) agreement with the objectives of the policymaker. However, in contrast to our prediction, participants who could choose complete significantly fewer sessions than participants that were randomly assigned. Because the results are not driven by poor selection, we infer that letting people choose between incentive schemes may bring in psychological effects that discourage adherence.

  abstract     = {In portfolio optimization, the computational complexity of implementing almost stochastic dominance has limited its practical applications. In this study, we introduce an optimization framework aimed at identifying the optimal portfolio that outperforms a specified benchmark under almost second-degree stochastic dominance (ASSD). Our approach involves discretizing the return range and establishing both sufficient and necessary conditions for ASSD. We then propose a three-step iterative procedure: first, identifying a candidate portfolio; second, assessing its optimality; and third, refining the discretization scheme. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the portfolio identified through this iterative process improves with each iteration, ultimately converging to the optimal solution. Our empirical study, utilizing industry portfolios, demonstrates the efficacy of our approach by consistently identifying an optimal portfolio within a few iterations. Furthermore, comparative analysis against other decision criteria, such as mean-variance, second-degree stochastic dominance, and third-degree stochastic dominance, reveals that ASSD generally leads to portfolios with higher out-of-sample average excess returns but also entails increased variations and risks.

  abstract     = {We examine the effects of adoption of labor-replacing automation technology on corporate financing. Empirically, using Chinese firm-level panel data on deployment of industrial robots as an example of such automation, we find that robot adoption increases leverage and reduces cost of debt. We hypothesize that the underlying reason is that being a substitute for labor, automation provides a hedge against fluctuations in labor costs. A model based on this hedging argument delivers additional testable predictions concerning determinants of the relation between automation and corporate financing. These relations are borne out in the data, providing support for the proposed mechanism. Our evidence is inconsistent with alternative channels behind the observed relations.

  abstract     = {Although the importance of the second-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion is well established, the importance of higher-order risk attitudes has only recently begun to be recognized. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to directly measure higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion in an expected utility framework using choices between compound lotteries and show how it can be easily implemented in behavioral studies. Specifically, we provide a theoretical basis for using risk apportionment to reveal the intensity of higher-order risk attitudes, and then draw upon our theoretical results to develop a simple, systematic, and generalizable procedure for eliciting higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients. We demonstrate our approach in a laboratory experiment and find that the modal second-order, third-order, and fourth-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients are positive and small. Further, we find that degrees of risk aversion are positively correlated across orders. Additionally, we discuss alternative implementations of our procedure.

We then show that asset pricing factors are subject to flow-driven noise trader risk in that expected variation (covariation) of flow-induced noise trading strongly forecasts variance (covariance) of factor returns. Importantly, factor premia are higher when flow-driven noise trader risk is expected to be more salient. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

  abstract     = {We introduce the click-based MNL choice model, a framework for capturing customer purchasing decisions in e-commerce settings. Specifically, we augment the classical Multinomial Logit choice model by assuming that customers only consider the items they have clicked on before they proceed to compare their random utilities. In this context, we study the resulting assortment optimization problem, where the objective is to select a subset of products, made available for purchase, to maximize the expected revenue. Our main algorithmic contribution comes in the form of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem, showing that the optimal expected revenue can be efficiently approached within any degree of accuracy. To establish this result, we develop several technical ideas, including enumeration schemes and stochastic inequalities, which may be of broader interest. Using data from Alibaba’s online marketplace, we fit click-based MNL and latent class MNL models to historical sales and click data in a setting where the online platform recommends a personalized six-product display to each user. We propose an estimation methodology for the click-based MNL model that leverages clickstream data and machine learning classification algorithms. Our numerical results suggest that clickstream data are valuable for predicting choices and that the click-based MNL model can outperform standard logit-based models in certain settings.

  abstract     = {Industries and firms have diverse motives for adopting self-regulatory institutions. This research develops and tests propositions about one motive—exploiting opportunities to do business with reputation-sensitive buyers—as distinct from self-regulation to defend against regulatory or activist threats. To study the adoption and effects of self-regulation for reputation-sensitive buyers, we study the SA8000 socially responsible employment certification among large firms in China in the early 2000s. Using official longitudinal industrial microdata, we test hypotheses generated by this assumed motive for self-regulation and find that (a) despite concerns about the corruptibility of certification bodies, SA8000 adopters in China exhibited higher precertification worker wages than comparable nonadopters, (b) self-regulation led to increased employment and sales to foreign markets, where reputation-sensitive buyers are concentrated, (c) the positive effect on exports was greater than the (insignificant, negatively signed) effect on domestic sales, and (d) there is no evidence that self-regulation increased worker wages beyond the initial high start. Contrasting these findings with prior research on industry self-regulation for other motives, this study highlights how both adoption patterns and downstream effects differ according to the audience for self-regulation.

  abstract     = {We study the classic divide-and-choose method for equitably allocating divisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian agents. The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions of those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent values and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a common-value component). We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game and identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute equilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the distribution over the chooser’s value for each good follows a normal distribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of uniform distributions over intervals. A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates several striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the divider has a compelling “diversification” incentive in creating the chooser’s two options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider’s optimal strategy when preferences are known. In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of the divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players’ levels of knowledge about each other’s values, the correlations between the players’ values, and the number of goods being divided. Under fairly mild assumptions, we show that the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, whereas the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.

  abstract     = {We isolate the causal effect of changing the riskiness of choices on the gender gap in real world outcomes. We do so by exploiting a national reform to the regrade system of Norwegian universities that generated exogenous variation in the probabilities of the outcome of regrade requests. Using unique individual-level administrative data, we show that both the expected value of a regrade request, as well as the downside risk, increased substantially as a result of the policy. We then show how the ostensibly gender-neutral policy substantially increased gaps between men and women because they differed in their risk preferences and beliefs. Specifically, the exogenous change in the riskiness of requesting a regrade augmented the gender gap in regrade requests by 90%. We demonstrate that this has important implications for students through its impact on their grades. We disentangle the relative importance of mechanisms through auxiliary reduced-form analyses, structural estimation, and a supplemental laboratory experiment. Taken together, our mechanism analyses suggest that gender differences in risk preferences and loss aversion are not sufficient to explain the increased gender gap after the policy change, and that gender differences in confidence or beliefs are necessary to rationalize the data and more broadly consistent with the patterns we observe.

  abstract     = {Organizational learning often involves groups that learn from feedback on their decisions over time (also known as “learning by doing” or “learning from experience”). Although organizational learning is frequently assumed to resemble individual learning from experience, there is limited evidence to validate this assumption. Furthermore, groups in organizations often have centralized rather than decentralized decision making, but we know little about how they differ in learning from experience. Using a combination of experimental data and computational modeling, we compare individuals to groups that are either decentralized or centralized in their decision making. We find that centralized groups behave like hyper-individuals: They update and explore more than individuals (who, in turn, update and explore more than decentralized groups). Our evidence shows that not only do groups differ from individuals because of aggregation processes but also that individuals change their behaviors simply by virtue of being in a group (a context effect). Specifically, we find that participants assigned as leaders in centralized groups become proactive learners who seek novel information to learn by deviating from experience. Implications are drawn for how this might alter the way we conceptualize and model organizational learning. This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organization.

We show that the GDPR boosts demand for the service by allowing consumers with high privacy costs to buy the service without sharing data. The increased demand leads to a higher price but a smaller quantity of shared data. If the firm’s revenue is largely usage based rather than data based, then both the firm’s profit and consumer surplus increase after the GDPR, implying that the GDPR can be welfare improving. But if the firm’s revenue is largely from data monetization, then the GDPR can reduce the firm’s profit and consumer surplus. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

  abstract     = {“Shoppertainment” live streaming, a blend of entertainment and product selling, is becoming increasingly popular. In shoppertainment sessions, streamers face bandwidth constraints so balance between providing product information and entertainment (such as singing, dancing, and storytelling). We conceptualize a shoppertainment live streamer as a novel type of online retail platform that maximizes total commissions from selling a range of manufacturer products. Our study investigates how streamers can leverage entertainment bandwidth as a long-term strategy to influence manufacturers’ pricing decisions and consumers’ attendance, as well as purchasing behaviors. Our model reveals several intriguing findings. First, we find that higher entertainment bandwidth encourages more manufacturers to adopt a demand-oriented, low-pricing strategy to attract buyers rather than a margin-oriented, high-pricing strategy that appeals only to buyers who perceive a high likelihood of finding a suitable product. Second, we observe that an increase in entertainment bandwidth initially boosts consumer traffic to shoppertainment sessions, but this trend may reverse once the bandwidth becomes excessively high, indicating an inverted U-shaped relationship. Conversely, the streamer’s expected profit per attending consumer first decreases and then increases with higher entertainment bandwidth, forming a U-shaped relationship. Third, our results suggest that a commission-maximizing streamer facing bandwidth constraints should not exclusively focus on providing product information. Instead, it is advantageous to allocate significant bandwidth to entertainment, even with limited entertaining capability, and potentially beneficial to dedicate all bandwidth to entertainment if the capability is substantial. Lastly, we demonstrate that the streamer’s quality threshold moderates the impact of entertainment bandwidth on these dynamics. This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, information systems.

  abstract     = {Health technology assessments often inform decisions made by public payers, such as the UK’s National Health Service, as they negotiate the pricing of companies’ new health technologies. A common assessment mechanism compares the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the new health technology, relative to a standard of care, to a maximum threshold on the cost per quality-adjusted life year. In much research and practice, these assessments may not distinguish between cost-per-patient and negotiated price, effectively ignoring the value-based-pricing principle that better health outcomes merit higher prices. Other research makes this distinction, but it does not account for uncertainty in the ICER associated with clinical trial data that are limited in size and scope. This paper models the strategic behavior of a payer and a company as they price a new health technology, and it considers the use of conditional approval (CA) schemes whose post-marketing trials reduce ICER uncertainty before final pricing decisions are made. Analytical results suggest a very different view of the value-based pricing negotiations underlying these schemes: interim prices used during CA post-marketing trials should reflect cost-sharing for the CA scheme, not just cost-effectiveness goals for a treatment. Moreover, the types of caps on interim prices used by entities such as the UK Cancer Drugs Fund may hinder the development of new technologies and lead to suboptimal CA designs. We propose a new risk-sharing mechanism to remedy this. Numerical results, calibrated to approval data of an oncology drug, illustrate the issues in a practical setting.

  abstract     = {Existing research on online communities has primarily demonstrated that users are motivated by social rewards or social incentives such as positive social feedback and enhanced reputation. In contrast, this study examines how social penalties, or social disincentives , including negative social feedback and loss in reputation, influence online users’ voluntary contributions in the short and long term. We develop empirical models to investigate reviewers’ decisions on whether to contribute (i.e., review incidence decision) and how much to contribute (i.e., quality-adjusted review effort decision) over time. Using a state-space model, we capture the dynamics in reviewers’ latent review motivation that stems from both social incentives and social disincentives. Based on a unique data set from the Amazon review system, our analysis shows that, surprisingly, social disincentives increase reviewers’ motivations to contribute more frequently and devote more effort to contributions. Such effects prevail in both the short and long term. In addition, a reviewer’s real name identity and experience moderate the impact of social disincentives on a reviewer’s contribution decisions. We find that loss in reputation has more impact on less experienced reviewers and anonymous reviewers. Our policy simulation exercise suggests that not providing negative social feedback could diminish reviewers’ review propensity by 7.85% (2.39%) and review effort by 14.82% (4.50%) in the short term (long term). Not allowing reputation loss on a review site decreases reviewers’ review propensity by 2.82% (1.40%) and review effort by 7.52% (3.45%) in the short term (long term).

  abstract     = {In this paper, we use a novel natural experiment and Norwegian tax data to quantify the causal impact of unemployment risk on individual savings. By comparing individuals who live in the same area but face different increases in risk, we show that a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment rates increases safe assets by 1.3%. Reassuringly, this effect is driven by low-tenured workers, who face the highest increase in risk. Savings in risky financial assets remain unaffected, implying a decrease in the overall risky share of individual portfolios. We use two independent approaches, relying either on cross-sectional variation or time series variation, to quantify the importance of job loss risk in accounting for higher savings during recessions. Our results suggest that unemployment risk can explain 60%–80% of the recession-induced increase in safe assets. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

  abstract     = {Two-sided platforms (e.g., ride-sharing, freelance labor, and lodging) match customers and service providers. Customers can voice their satisfaction level through review/rating systems, which the platforms use to monitor and screen service providers. However, customers may misdirect complaints about platform-level features toward individual service providers. We examine the extent and consequences of this issue in the context of a large ride-sharing platform. We focus on surge pricing as the platform-level feature. Our findings are as follows. First, for an average trip, surge pricing makes it 1.13 times more likely for the driver to receive a complaint (either a low rating or a formal complaint). Second, complaints negatively impact a driver’s future income. Surge-induced complaints offset about 23% of a driver’s immediate gain from the surged fare. Third, after the platform adopted a policy to cap the magnitude of surge prices, the effect of surge on customer complaints reduced. The policy also led to more usage of the platform. The results suggest a close interaction between the pricing and review systems on ride-sharing platforms. More broadly, they point to the importance for online two-sided platforms to identify and address customer complaints about platform-level features that may have been misdirected to service providers.

  abstract     = {We examine how parity employee representation (PER) on corporate boards affects firms’ capital investments. In Germany, PER is legally mandated for firms with more than 2,000 domestic employees, but not for those below this threshold. Exploiting this discontinuity, we show that PER has heterogeneous effects on firms operating in diverse environments. For firms experiencing positive growth, PER increases their responsiveness to investment opportunities, suggesting that employee participation increases firms’ ability to exploit growth options. The effect through growth options is particularly salient in situations in which growth options are highly valuable. In contrast, for firms experiencing negative growth, PER reduces investment responsiveness, suggesting that employees resist the exercise of abandonment options. This effect is more pronounced in firms with high labor intensity, in which employees are likely to have a strong voice. Furthermore, operational risk moderates the effects of employee representation––the positive effect through growth options is attenuated in high-risk firms and the negative effect through abandonment options is exacerbated, thereby suggesting that employee board representatives are less interested in pursuing growth where businesses are relatively risky, and they protect their constituents more forcefully in high-risk environments. Moreover, the positive effect of PER on exploiting growth options is attenuated by collective bargaining agreements, while its effect through abandonment options is little affected. Evidence from stock price behavior further supports the viewpoint that employee representation affects capital investment. Our findings are relevant to policymakers as well as to firms’ various stakeholders. This paper was accepted by Eric So, accounting.

  abstract     = {Agricultural open burning, that is, the practice of burning crop residue in harvested fields to prepare land for sowing a new crop, is well recognized as a significant contributor to CO 2 and black-carbon emissions, and long-term climate change. Low-soil-tillage practices using an agricultural machine called the Happy Seeder, which can sow the new seed without removing the previous crop residue, have emerged as the most effective alternative to open burning. However, given the limited supply of Happy Seeders from the government, and the fact that farmers incur a significant yield loss if they delay sowing the new crop, farmers are often unwilling to wait to be processed by the Happy Seeder and, instead, burn their crop residue. We study how the government can use effective information-disclosure policies in the operation of Happy Seeders to minimize open burning. A Happy Seeder is assigned to process a group of farms. The government knows, but does not necessarily disclose, the Happy Seeder’s schedule at the start of the sowing season. We propose a class of information-disclosure policies, called dilatory policies , that provide no information to the farmers about the schedule until a prespecified switch period and then reveal the entire schedule afterward. We show that an optimal dilatory policy can significantly lower the number of farms burnt compared with that under the full-disclosure and the no-disclosure policies. Using data from the rice-wheat crop system in northwestern India, we demonstrate that the optimal dilatory policy can reduce CO 2 and black-carbon emissions by 17% on average. We also examine the impact of the government’s policy on the trade-off between environmental damage and farmers’ welfare. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

  abstract     = {Motivated by blockchain applications in the fresh produce industry, we consider a newsvendor problem in which a retailer faces stochastic and freshness-dependent consumer demand. The retailer can adopt blockchain technology to have more transparent information on the freshness of supply. We quantify the value of blockchain-enabled freshness transparency by deriving closed-form expressions for the retailer’s expected profit growth and food waste reduction brought by blockchain adoption. Using publicly available data, we provide a numerical example illustrating that for Walmart’s strawberry business in the United States (which is about only 4% of Walmart’s fresh produce sales), blockchain can increase annual profit by $ 60 million while eliminating 23 million pounds of food waste annually through operational improvements. Despite this substantial value for the retailer, blockchain adoption can decrease the expected profit of the retailer’s supplier. We design a family of threshold-type smart contracts contingent on a blockchain-based freshness consensus and examine when such contracts offer a win-win proposition to the retailer and the supplier. Moreover, when the retailer offers freshness-based price discounts, we find that less fresh supply leads to less food waste. In contrast, when the supplier adjusts the wholesale price based on freshness, less fresh supply causes more food waste. We also generalize our findings to the cases of (i) dual sourcing, (ii) noisy measurements in the Internet of Things sensors feeding data into blockchain, and (iii) the retailer’s culling processes.

We demonstrate that in the data-rich regime, the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm attains the optimal cumulative regret in the sample size dimension and a tight bound in the covariate dimension and the significant covariate dimension. In the data-poor regime, the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm maintains a tight regret upper bound. In addition, we develop a local linear approximation method, the two-step weighted Lasso procedure, to identify the minimax concave penalty (MCP) estimator for the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm when samples are not independent and identically distributed. Under this procedure, the MCP estimator can match the oracle estimator with high probability and converge to the true parameters at the optimal convergence rate. Finally, through experiments based on both synthetic and real data sets, we show that the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm outperforms other benchmarking algorithms in terms of cumulative regret and that the benefits of the G-MCP-Bandit algorithm increase in the data’s sparsity level and the size of the decision set.

  abstract     = {We study the data-integrated, price-setting newsvendor problem in which the price–demand relationship is described by some parametric model with unknown parameters. We develop the operational data analytics (ODA) formulation of this problem that features a data-integration model and a validation model. The data-integration model consists of a class of functions called the operational statistics. Each operational statistic maps the available data to the ordering decision. The validation model finds, among the set of candidate operational statistics, the ordering decision that leads to the highest actual profit, which is unknown because of the unknown demand parameters. This ODA framework leads to a consistent estimate of the profit function with which we optimize the pricing decision. The derived quantity and price decisions demonstrate robust profit performance even when the sample size is very small in relation to the demand variability. Compared with the conventional approach with which the unknown parameters are estimated and then the decisions are optimized, the ODA framework produces significantly superior performance in the mean, standard deviation, and minimum of the profit, suggesting the robustness of the ODA solution especially in the small-sample regime.

  abstract     = {In many different settings, requests for service can arrive in near or true simultaneity with one another. This creates batches of arrivals to the underlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for the batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a dangerous and deceptive stress on services, requiring a high amount of resources and exhibiting a fundamentally larger tail in those demands. This uncovers a service regime in which a system with large batch arrivals may have low utilization but will still have nontrivial waiting. Methodologically, these staffing results follow from novel large batch and large batch-and-rate limits of the multiserver queueing model. In the large batch limit, we establish the first formal connection between general multiserver queues and storage processes, another family of stochastic models. By consequence, we show that the batch scaled queue length process is not asymptotically normal and that, in fact, the fluid- and diffusion-type limits coincide. Hence, the (safety) staffing of this system must be directly proportional to the batch size just to achieve a nondegenerate probability of wait. In exhibition of the existence and insights of this large batch regime, we apply our results to data on Covid-19 contact tracing in New York City. In doing so, we identify significant benefits produced by the tracing agency’s decision to staff above national recommendations, and we also demonstrate that there may have been an opportunity to further improve the operation by optimizing the arrival pattern in the public health data pipeline.

  abstract     = {We study service systems with parallel servers and random customer arrivals and focus on the waiting cost of customers. Using a Markov decision process (MDP) modeling approach, we analytically characterize the structures of the optimal dynamic server assignment policies for two important systems, one consisting of multiple homogeneous servers and two classes of customers and the other consisting of two heterogeneous servers and multiple classes of customers. Based on the obtained results, we propose a threshold-type heuristic policy for the generalized system consisting of multiple heterogeneous servers and multiple classes of customers. To design such a heuristic policy, we first develop techniques for the performance evaluation of general threshold-type policies with any given threshold values. We then construct a path to search for the optimal threshold values. We compare the performance of the best threshold-type heuristic policy with that of the optimal policy and show that our proposed heuristic policy is computationally efficient yet generates great performance. To derive additional managerial insights, we compare the system under our threshold-type dynamic server assignment policy with other commonly seen and simple systems, such as the dedicated system and the work-conserving flexible priority system. The clear performance advantage observed from extensive numerical experiments demonstrates the importance and usefulness of dynamic server assignment control for systems serving multiple classes of customer arrivals. Finally, we extend our analysis to incorporate customer-dependent service rates and sojourn-time minimization performance metrics. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {This paper studies an information design problem of a retailer in a two-tier supply chain that procures a single type of product from a supplier. The supplier needs to decide on a production quantity by balancing the shortage cost and the excess inventory holding cost with respect to the retailer’s demand. The retailer’s demand is random, but the retailer receives an informative signal about the demand before the supplier sets the production quantity and places orders after learning the demand realization. The retailer wants to reduce the shortage cost, and to this end, the retailer can disclose information about the retailer’s signal to persuade the supplier to increase production levels. For this setup, we characterize the optimal information disclosure policy of the retailer and shed light on settings in which the retailer strictly benefits from carefully designed information disclosure policies relative to a full- or a no-disclosure policy.

  abstract     = {Prominent factor models are based on tradable factors that do not represent theoretically relevant risks. To address this issue, we develop a factor model that captures the risks to long-term investors present in the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). Empirically, we construct intertemporal risk factors as long-short portfolios based on stock exposures to dividend yield and realized variance. These tradable factors mimic news to long-term expected returns and volatility, and they offset part of the marginal utility increase in recessions induced by wealth declines. Our intertemporal factor model estimation implies significant risk prices that are consistent with the ICAPM restrictions under moderate risk aversion. Moreover, our model performs well relative to previous factor models in terms of its tangency Sharpe ratio and its pricing of key test assets, including single stocks, industry portfolios, and portfolios sorted on risk exposures and lagged anomalies.

In our framework, there is a conflict of interest between a principal and an agent over the course of action. When preferences are aligned over executing a course, the principal can selectively instruct the agent on a preferred course to steer the agent toward it. Because less able (less confident) agents are more responsive to instructions, hiring these types of agents can be beneficial. This steering role of instructions toward a course of action helps us understand why and when firms are reluctant to hire overqualified (high-ability) workers, how worker risk aversion can be valuable to an organization, why instructions, although more likely to be used, are less intense, in more uncertain environments, and why instruction-giving and incentive pay go hand-in-hand.

  abstract     = {We consider a stylized incentive management problem over an infinite time horizon, where the principal hires an agent to provide services to customers. Customers request service in one of two ways: either via an online or a traditional offline channel. The principal does not observe the offline customers’ arrivals, nor does she observe whether the agent exerts (costly) effort that can increase the arrival rate of customers. This creates an opportunity for the agent (i) to divert cash (that is, to under-report the number of offline customers and pocket respective revenues) and also (ii) to shirk (that is, not to exert effort), thus leading to a novel and thus far unexplored double moral hazard problem. To address this problem, we formulate a constrained, continuous-time, stochastic optimal control problem and derive an optimal contract with a simple intuitive structure that includes a payment scheme and a potential termination time of the agent. We enrich the model to allow the principal to either (i) dynamically adjust the prices for the services in both channels or (ii) monitor the agent. Both tools help the principal to alleviate the double moral hazard problem. We derive respective optimal strategies for using those tools that guarantee the highest profits. We show that the worse the agent’s past performance is, the lower the prices should be set and the more the principal should monitor the agent.

  abstract     = {Although prior research has primarily focused on the direct value of information technology (IT) and IT adoption by individuals and firms, this study explores the indirect value of IT in the form of public infrastructure technology. By exploiting a spatial discontinuity in water monitoring stations, we discover that firms located immediately upstream of water monitoring stations exhibit significantly lower levels of corruption than firms located immediately downstream. These findings are particularly noteworthy given that water monitoring stations have the potential to generate significant indirect value as they are not explicitly designed to mitigate corruption. Further analyses reveal that public infrastructure technology alone does not hold the key to mitigating corporate corruption. Instead, it is the synergistic interplay between public infrastructure technology and organizational change that drives the outcome. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the broader IT value landscape, emphasizing the indirect value of technological advancements in public infrastructure that were not originally intended for such benefit. Additionally, our findings highlight the benefits of leveraging existing infrastructure technology to address emerging societal needs. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

We conduct difference-in-differences analyses exploiting the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling on the Silicon Graphics case, which substantially raised the bar for filing securities class action (SCA) lawsuits as a shock. We document supporting evidence for the talent attraction hypothesis by showing improvements in newly recruited independent director quality following the ruling, but only for candidates who are previously not exposed to SCA litigation risk. The effects are stronger for firms facing greater litigation risk ex ante or smaller local supplies of director candidates. Results are more evident for experience-based quality dimensions. We also analyze a sample of voluntary independent director departures and find little support for the talent retention hypothesis, suggesting that more complex factors enter into a director’s continuation decision once a director is already exposed to SCA litigation risk. A policy implication is that liability protection can be useful in attracting more unexposed high-quality candidates to the pool of public boards but does little to attract high-quality candidates who are already in the pool of public firms.

  abstract     = {We analyze a unique chief financial officer (CFO) survey data set to examine capital allocation in firms. Top management is aware of agency and information problems at the divisional level and organizes the budgeting process to counteract managerial opportunism, employing systems of interconnected measures, including layers of approval, divisional budgets, reporting requirements, and compensation schemes. When making funding decisions, top management relies heavily on top-level nonfinancial information, such as the assessment of divisional managers’ abilities. However, substantial parts of the capital budget do not require top management approval as firms trade off the benefits and costs of decentralization, thereby deviating from the traditional paradigm of decentralized project initiation but centralized project approval. Even firms with active internal capital markets tilt capital allocation toward relatively even distributions, reflecting the use of capital allocation as a credible communication device. We also find that within-firm agency problems may result in capital rationing, that is, divisions’ restricted access to internal capital. CFOs also believe that integrating multiple businesses into an internal capital market results in tangible financial benefits, predominantly lower costs of capital and higher debt capacities. Thus, our findings also support coinsurance arguments suggesting that internal capital markets may improve access to external financing. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {Ninety-five percent of long-term municipal bonds have callable features, and yet, we find new evidence of a substantial fraction of local governments exercising these valuable options suboptimally, with significant delays—resulting in sizable losses. Using data from 2001 to 2019, we estimate that U.S. municipals lost over $26 billion from delayed refinancing, whereas the entire U.S. corporate sector, facing the same low interest-rate environment, lost only a comparatively modest $1.4 billion. We present evidence that these delays are related to gaps in localized debt monitoring. For instance, when a bond becomes callable in a month that is the fiscal year end of a local government—a particularly busy time for finance departments—the decision to call is delayed significantly longer. A significantly longer delay also occurs when a municipality is faced with waves of calls all coming due at once. These effects are magnified in smaller municipalities staffed with smaller finance departments. Moreover, the market for outside monitoring (e.g., underwriters) is a fractured one. It is characterized by extreme stickiness; 87% of a municipality’s bonds are issued with the same underwriter over our sample period. The usage of a less locally focused underwriter is associated with significantly greater delays. This paper was accepted by Tomasz Piskorski, finance.

Given the increasingly integrated nature of corporate data and control systems, a standard audit may have a positive effect on client firms’ other information systems, such as those that help prevent data breaches. In this paper, I provide evidence on whether and how auditors help prevent data breaches. Using plausibly exogenous improvements in auditing due to regulatory inspections and auditors’ cross-client learning, I find a decreased likelihood of data breaches among these auditors’ clients. Institutional insights gathered from interviews with accounting firm partners and industry professionals suggest two mechanisms for the role of auditors in preventing data breaches: the provision of relevant information and incentives for internal controls.

  abstract     = {We investigate how the incompleteness of an employment contract—discretionary and noncontractible effort—can affect an employer’s decision about cutting nominal wages. Using matched employer-employee payroll data from Great Britain linked to a survey of managers, we find support for the main predictions of a stylized theoretical framework of wage determination: nominal cuts are at most half as likely when managers believe that their employees have significant discretion over how they do their work, although the involvement of employees, via information sharing, reduces this correlation. We also describe how contract incompleteness and wage cuts vary across different jobs. These findings provide the first observational quantitative evidence that managerial beliefs about contractual incompleteness can account for their hesitancy over nominal wage cuts. This has long been conjectured by economists based on anecdotes, qualitative surveys, and laboratory and field experiments.

  abstract     = {We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and design new policies that enjoy both optimal regret expectation and light-tailed risk for regret distribution. We first find that any policy that obtains the optimal instance-dependent expected regret could incur a heavy-tailed regret tail risk that decays slowly with T . We then focus on policies that achieve optimal worst-case expected regret. We design a novel policy that (i) enjoys the worst-case optimality for regret expectation and (ii) has the worst-case tail probability of incurring a regret larger than any regret threshold that decays exponentially with respect to T . The decaying rate is proved to be optimal for all worst-case optimal policies. Our proposed policy achieves a delicate balance between doing more exploration at the beginning of the time horizon and doing more exploitation when approaching the end, compared with standard confidence-bound-based policies. We also enhance the policy design to accommodate the “any-time” setting where T is unknown a priori, highlighting “lifelong exploration”, and prove equivalently desired policy performances as compared with the “fixed-time” setting with known T . From a managerial perspective, we show through numerical experiments that our new policy design yields similar efficiency and better safety compared to celebrated policies. Our policy design is preferable especially when (i) there is a risk of underestimating the volatility profile, or (ii) there is a challenge of tuning policy hyper-parameters. We conclude by extending our proposed policy design to the stochastic linear bandit setting that leads to both worst-case optimality in terms of regret expectation and light-tailed risk on regret distribution.

  abstract     = {Although investor attention is fundamental to the efficient functioning of capital markets, it is also an elusive construct that researchers struggle to measure. In recent years, the search volume index (SVI) of ticker searches on Google has become a ubiquitous measure of investor attention, but the amount and effects of measurement error in ticker SVI are unknown. We investigate measurement error in ticker SVI using a data set of 2.7 billion website visits following Standard and Poor’s 500 firms’ ticker searches. We find that 69% of searches are unrelated to investing, that this measurement error is highly correlated with firm characteristics, and that this measurement error can easily generate false-positive or false-negative results in common settings. We go on to show that a modified version of SVI using both a firm’s ticker and the word “stock” (e.g., searches for “CAT stock,” which we label “ticker-stock SVI”) not only better captures the search terms that investors typically use, but also has considerably less measurement error that is largely uncorrelated with observable firm characteristics. Ticker-stock SVI produces better specified tests, and although researchers must still carefully consider the effects of measurement error, we recommend that ticker-stock SVI is used in place of ticker SVI in most settings. We provide a data set of ticker-stock SVI to facilitate future work. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivisan, accounting.

  abstract     = {Committees of experts are widely used to make decisions. We experimentally investigate the relationship between decision making in committees and the assessment of the ability of committee members by evaluators, comparing observed behavior with theoretical predictions. Treatments vary in whether members care only about a state-dependent project payoff or also about assessments and whether evaluators can base their assessments only on the decision the committee makes or also on cheap-talk statements made by committee members on their confidence in the committee decision. Evidence for the equilibrium predictions is mixed; for example, contrary to theory, committees with a concern for their assessment do not distort their decisions more than committees without, whereas in line with theory, evaluators give higher assessments to committees that take the risky decision rather than the riskless. We analyze whether evaluators rationally base their assessments on observed behavior of committees using an orthogonality test. In treatments with cheap-talk statements, assessments are quite rational; in treatments without, they are too low on average. We investigate whether committees best reply to expected project payoffs and, in treatments in which members’ payoffs also depend on assessments, to predicted assessments conditional on observed committee behavior. In all treatments, committees respond to the possibilities to raise expected payoffs but do not use them as much as predicted by theory. We conclude by showing that the amount of information about committee members’ abilities that ends up in assessments is considerably larger when evaluators observe committees’ decisions and statements rather than only decisions.

  abstract     = {On decentralized e-commerce platforms, search algorithms play a critical role in matching buyers and sellers. A typical search algorithm routinely refines and improves its catalog of data to increase search precision, but the effects of a more precise search are little known. We evaluate such effects via a 2019 quasiexperiment on a world-leading e-commerce platform in which the search algorithm refined some product categories into finer subgroups to allocate consumer queries to more relevant product listings. Our data cover millions of consumers’ search and purchase behaviors over six months across multiple search sessions and product categories, enabling us to investigate trade-offs over time and across categories. We find that a more precise search algorithm improves consumers’ click-through and purchase rates drastically and instantaneously, but it comes at the cost of a significant decrease in consumer engagement and unplanned purchases over a longer time horizon. On average, consumers who used to spend more time searching now conduct 5.5% fewer searches, spend 4.1% less time on the platform, and decrease their spending on related categories by 2.2% in the week after the search precision increases. Our examination of the mechanisms behind these consequences calls for more careful search algorithm designs that account for not only instant conversion based on search precision but also consumer engagement and sellers’ strategic responses in the longer horizon.

  abstract     = {We show how manufacturers can benefit from contracts that incentivize retailers to purchase multiple products from the same manufacturer. We isolate two effects: first, under standard contractual inefficiencies, which give rise to double marginalization, such contracts can increase channel profits (the “improved contractual efficiency” effect); second, when a weaker product is tied to a particularly strong “must-stock” product, such contracts can also reduce a retailer’s position and shift rent to the manufacturer (the “increased rent extraction” effect). To harness these effects, we show that it can even be profitable for the manufacturer to introduce a weak product that ultimately has the effect of foreclosing a rival’s more efficient substitute. Nevertheless, unless the tying product is sufficiently strong, the overall effect on welfare can still be positive, providing manufacturers with an efficiency rationale to use against common concerns held by antitrust agencies about such practices.

If delays apply uniformly to uninformed and informed traders, the level of delays does not affect information aggregation. Traders’ information acquisition incentives are, however, weaker in a market with longer delays. Therefore, the equilibrium fraction of informed traders is lower if delays are longer, establishing an inverse relationship between trading delays and price informativeness. We also show that risk premia and price dispersion tend to be nonmonotonic functions of the level of delays when information acquisition is endogenous.

  abstract     = {Quality knowledge spillovers can enhance the overall effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives. We study the presence and moderators of such spillovers in a multitask service setting, specifically in hospital inpatient care. Leveraging a national quality improvement regulation, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which offers partial incentives for hospitals to reduce readmissions, we employ difference-in-differences econometric models on a nationwide database and find positive quality spillovers in the healthcare sector. Our findings indicate that the implementation of HRRP led to a significant decrease in 30-day readmissions among patients with clinical conditions or insurance types that were not targeted by the policy. Additionally, we find that task similarity played a positive role in promoting quality spillovers, while a hospital’s operational focus on target patients (i.e., the proportion of hospital volume targeted by the policy) did not moderate these spillovers. Notably, we observe that hospitals achieved these quality improvements without increasing the intensity of care provided, and that meaningful improvements in quality were associated with up to a 3% reduction in hospitalization costs. This paper contributes novel insights into how regulators and policymakers can design narrow public policies and regulations that achieve broader results by exploiting the beneficial quality improvement spillovers of partial incentives.

  abstract     = {The data-driven newsvendor problem with features has recently emerged as a significant area of research, driven by the proliferation of data across various sectors such as retail, supply chains, e-commerce, and healthcare. Given the sensitive nature of customer or organizational data often used in feature-based analysis, it is crucial to ensure individual privacy to uphold trust and confidence. Despite its importance, privacy preservation in the context of inventory planning remains unexplored. A key challenge is the nonsmoothness of the newsvendor loss function, which sets it apart from existing work on privacy-preserving algorithms in other settings. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimating a privacy-preserving optimal inventory policy within the f -differential privacy framework, an extension of the classical ( ϵ , δ ) -differential privacy with several appealing properties. We develop a clipped noisy gradient descent algorithm based on convolution smoothing for optimal inventory estimation to simultaneously address three main challenges: (i) unknown demand distribution and nonsmooth loss function, (ii) provable privacy guarantees for individual-level data, and (iii) desirable statistical precision. We derive finite-sample high-probability bounds for optimal policy parameter estimation and regret analysis. By leveraging the structure of the newsvendor problem, we attain a faster excess population risk bound compared with that obtained from an indiscriminate application of existing results for general nonsmooth convex loss. Our bound aligns with that for strongly convex and smooth loss function. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed new method can achieve desirable privacy protection with a marginal increase in cost. This paper was accepted by J.

  abstract     = {Weaning patients from mechanical ventilators is a crucial decision in intensive care units (ICUs), significantly affecting patient outcomes and the throughput of ICUs. This study aims to improve the current extubation protocols by incorporating predictive information on patient health conditions. We develop a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process with predictions of future state to support extubation decisions. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and provide important insights into how predictive information can lead to different decision protocols. We demonstrate that adding predictive information is always beneficial, even if physicians place excessive trust in the predictions, as long as the predictive model is moderately accurate. Using a comprehensive data set from an ICU in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, we evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and demonstrate that incorporating predictive information can reduce ICU length of stay by up to 3.4% and, simultaneously, decrease the extubation failure rate by up to 20.3%, compared with the optimal policy that does not utilize prediction. These benefits are more significant for patients with poor initial conditions upon ICU admission. Both our analytical and numerical findings suggest that predictive information is particularly valuable in identifying patients who could benefit from continued intubation, thereby allowing for personalized and delayed extubation for these patients.

Structurally, I estimate a present bias parameter β of 0.82. Participants perceive others’ β to be 0.87, indicating substantial sophistication, contrasted with 1.03 for themselves, indicating full naïveté. At the individual level, asymmetric naïveté correlates with overoptimism regarding one’s own versus others’ task enjoyment and time availability.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the impacts of financial shocks on firm insurance, firm dynamics, and macroeconomic implications. A key departure from the literature is that firms provide wage insurance contracts to risk-averse workers in a long-term relationship. Such contracts endogenously impose a form of inflexible debt liability to firms, and make firms with limited financial net worth more vulnerable to shocks than others. In our model, firms have heterogenous productivity and financial net worth, and also firms face financial frictions. Search and matching in the labor market endogenously determines the value of wage contract, and thus the level of liability to the firm. We have three new findings: (1) The wage dynamics of the quantitative model are consistent with those in empirical studies, with significant insurance against firm-level idiosyncratic shocks, and also a weak comovement between aggregate wage and GDP when there are aggregate shocks. (2) Firms with limited financial resources are hit by financial shocks significantly more than others, with larger negative impacts on dividends, credit borrowing, firm value, and firm entry; the endogenous wage insurance also becomes more limited, and there are more separations. These impacts on both firms and workers are different from—and cannot be accounted for by—standard models with a representative firm or worker. (3) Quantitative exercises for the Great Recession in the United States suggest that aggregate productivity shocks and financial shocks play different roles; without financial shocks, we cannot account for the dynamics of financial variables, including the reduced credit borrowing, spikes in credit spreads, and large drops in dividend payments. Lastly, we provide microlevel empirical supports for our model implications. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {We provide robust evidence that rank-and-file employee stock options (R&F options) lead to lower work-related injury rates. This finding is consistent with the view that R&F options improve workplace safety by facilitating employee retention and cooperation. To establish causality, we employ difference-in-differences analysis around the passage of FAS 123R option expensing regulation and instrumental variable estimation. In cross-sectional analysis, we find that the documented effect is amplified among firms with higher labor mobility rates and among firms with greater scope for employee free riding. The results of supplemental analysis suggest that work-related injuries adversely impact firm performance and rule out reduced employee whistleblowing about workplace safety issues as an alternative mechanism driving our findings.

  abstract     = {This paper studies how competitive dynamics shape innovative firms’ voluntary disclosure of product quality information. Our empirical context is the pharmaceutical industry, where firms must decide whether to disclose private drug quality information acquired in clinical trials. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, we show that the approval of a competitor’s drug lowers the likelihood of a firm reporting its clinical trial results by 13%. We explore how these effects vary based on the project quality, competitor type, and firm experience. These findings suggest that strategic considerations play a role in firms’ disclosure decisions; in response to a competitor’s drug approval, firms may selectively withhold information to maintain and improve their competitive position.

We show that refund bonuses, which provide investors a payment if a fundraising campaign is unsuccessful, can signal project quality and help overcome the market failure in crowdfunding. Because strong projects have a lower risk of bonus payout, entrepreneurs with strong projects are more likely to offer bonuses. This signals high quality to investors, and due to their updated beliefs, this drives investment toward such projects.

  abstract     = {The growth of the influencer marketing industry warrants an empirical examination of the effect of posting sponsored videos on influencers’ reputations. We collected a novel data set of user-generated YouTube videos created by prominent English-speaking influencers in the beauty and style category. We extracted a rich set of theory-driven video features and used DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux reweighting to construct comparable treatment and control groups matched at the influencer-video level. The empirical analysis of the matched sample revealed a reputation-burning effect ; that is, posting a sponsored video, compared with posting an equivalent organic video, cost the influencers 0.19% of their reputation (operationalized as the number of subscribers). The reputation-burning effect was stronger among the influencers with larger audiences. An analysis of likes, comments, and comment texts revealed a larger gap in audience response between sponsored and organic videos among the influencers with larger (versus smaller) audiences. The reputation-burning effect was mitigated when a high fit existed between the sponsored content and the influencer’s “usual” content and when the promoted brand was less well known. Our study empirically tested the assumption of several theoretical works. Moreover, it contributes to the literature on influencer marketing and celebrity endorsements and provides managerial implications for influencers, brands, and social media platforms.

  abstract     = {We provide the first approximation algorithm for dynamic inventory management on a network with stochastic demand and backlogging. Specifically, under a mild cost condition, we prove the cost of a specially designed base-stock policy is less than 1.618 times the cost of an optimal policy. We develop a novel stochastic programming analysis to prove this result: We carefully calibrate two stochastic programs (providing upper and lower bounds on the optimal policy), and compare their objectives. The upper bound arises from a new class of base-stock policies we define to address the currently unresolved issue of how to assign and fulfill backlogs in a system with fulfillment flexibility. We show the optimal policy in this class takes a simple and intuitive form: backlogs are assigned to their lowest cost activities for replenishment, and the ordered resources for those activities are committed to the backlogs for fulfillment. Next, the lower bound stochastic program is derived through a novel cost accounting scheme that captures the tradeoff between current inventory decisions and future backlog decisions. We then exploit this tradeoff to bound the ratio of the two stochastic program objectives and prove our main result. We also demonstrate our policy’s practicality with numerical simulations that show it performs within 1% of optimal on average across a wide range of problem instances. Finally, we show that our techniques and results extend to more general settings, demonstrating their potential for broader applicability. Importantly, our approach extends to problems with lead times, where we prove an approximation guarantee for base-stock policies that is independent of both the lead time and network structure. Thus, our work provides the new managerial insight that properly designed base-stock policies can be effective in network settings.

  abstract     = {On-demand ride-sharing aims to fulfill riders’ transportation needs whenever and wherever they want. Although this service level appeals to riders, overall system efficiency can improve substantially if riders are willing to be flexible. Here, we explore riders’ flexibility in space via walking to more accessible pickup locations. Ride-sharing platforms have traditionally implemented dynamic walking to optimize rider pickup locations and rider-driver assignment jointly. We propose an alternative that we call static walking , which presents a predetermined pickup location to the rider before optimizing rider-driver assignment. Although dynamic walking enables more efficient matching of riders and drivers, we hypothesize that riders prefer static walking because of the certainty of the pickup location before booking the ride. Using simulations on Lyft data, we show that static walking can capture up to 96% of the value of dynamic walking in congested urban networks at a fixed adoption rate. Furthermore, experimentation on Lyft’s user interface suggests that providing riders with information on pickup location before an opt-in decision can increase walking adoption—to the extent that static walking may outperform dynamic walking overall. More broadly, this study highlights the importance of carefully designing flexibility mechanisms on platforms: a little flexibility goes a long way, especially when flexibility presents a barrier to adoption.

Using a novel data set of online job postings by accounting firms, we document substantial variation in the stated demand for auditors’ cognitive and social skills, suggesting that audit offices are not homogeneous in their preferences for such skills. We find a positive relation between audit quality and the prevalence of cognitive and social skills within an audit office’s job postings. This association is stronger for audit engagements that are more complex or require greater coordination, suggesting that cognitive and social skills are particularly important in engagements where effective communication and knowledge transfer, as well as sound professional judgment and skepticism, are needed. The association is also stronger for audit offices with greater investments in new technology, consistent with the complementary relation between cognitive and social skills and the use of technology.

  abstract     = {Restaurants are increasingly relying on on-demand delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats) to reach customers and fulfill takeout orders. Although on-demand delivery is a valuable option for consumers, whether restaurants benefit from or are being hurt by partnering with these platforms remains unclear. This paper investigates whether and to what extent the platform delivery channel substitutes restaurants’ own takeout/dine-in channels and the net impact on restaurant revenue. Empirical analyses show that restaurants overall benefit from on-demand delivery platforms—these platforms increase restaurants’ total takeout sales while creating positive spillovers to customer dine-in visits. However, the platform effects are substantially heterogeneous, depending on the type of restaurants (independent versus chain) and the type of customer channels (takeout versus dine-in). The overall positive effect on fast-food chains is four times as large as that on independent restaurants. For takeout, delivery platforms substitute independent restaurants’ but complement chain restaurants’ own takeout sales. For dine-in, delivery platforms increase both independent and chain restaurants’ dine-in visits by a similar magnitude. Therefore, the value of delivery platforms to independent restaurants mostly comes from the increase in dine-in visits, whereas the value to chain restaurants primarily comes from the gain in takeout sales. Further, the platform delivery channel facilitates price competition and reduces the opportunity for independent restaurants to differentiate with premium services and dine-in experience, which may explain why independent restaurants do not benefit as much from on-demand delivery platforms.

  abstract     = {We consider the common setting where one observes a large number of opinionated text documents and related covariates, such as the text of online reviews along with the date of the review and the author demographic information. In this setting it can be of interest to understand how the covariates determine the text composition, as well as the prevalence, sentiment, and/or discourse of various discussion themes. Yet, most topic modeling methods in the machine learning literature are designed to summarize the text for the purpose of exploratory analysis and not to perform this type of formal statistical inference. Further, topic modeling methods generally do not try to estimate the sentiment or discourse of discussion along separate topics that can be critical in business applications (e.g., for summarizing service or product quality). We develop a topic model called the structural topic and sentiment-discourse (STS) model that introduces a new document-level latent variable that captures the sentiment and/or discourse (termed as “sentiment-discourse”) for each topic, which modulates the word frequency within a topic. These latent topic sentiment-discourse variables are controlled by document-level covariates to allow for experimental control and regression analysis. We also introduce new computational methods to resolve scalability issues that have forced previous models to restrict to a small number of categorical covariates. We benchmark the STS model on three real-world data sets from surveys, blogs, and Yelp restaurant reviews around the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model recovers meaningful results including rich insights about how COVID-19 affects online reviews, demonstrating that the STS model can be useful for regression analysis with text data in addition to topic modeling’s traditional use of descriptive analysis.

  abstract     = {We investigate the effect of employing skilled immigrants on the competitive performance of organizations by studying European football (soccer) clubs in Germany, Italy, France, England, and Spain from 1990 to 2020. Microdata from this setting offers unusual transparency about players’ birthplaces and their contributions to organizational performance. Further, country-level rules govern how many immigrant players clubs can deploy. Using changes to these rules as the basis for instrumental variables, we find that the number of immigrant players in the club’s starting lineup has a positive local average treatment effect on the club’s performance. We show that this occurs for two related reasons. First, immigrants exhibit higher individual talent.

  abstract     = {I examine changes in chief executive officer (CEO) labor market outcomes following corporate environmental failures. CEOs of firms subject to Environmental Protection Agency enforcements experience a decline in labor market opportunities as outside directors and a higher likelihood of dismissal as CEOs. They also receive less shareholder support in directorial elections. These effects are mostly visible in recent years and in firms with significant socially responsible investments (SRIs), and they are robust to using state environmental regulations for identification. Shareholders exhibit particular concern over environmental violations that may subject firms to future legal liabilities. Overall, these results point to significant reputational repercussions of environmental failures to CEOs and the disciplinary role of SRIs. This paper was accepted by Camelia Kuhnen, finance.

  abstract     = {Expert workers make non-trivial decisions with significant implications. Experts’ decision accuracy is, thus, a fundamental aspect of their judgment quality, key to both management and consumers of experts’ services. Yet, in many important settings, transparency in experts’ decision quality is rarely possible because ground truth data for evaluating the experts’ decisions is costly and available only for a limited set of decisions. Furthermore, different experts typically handle exclusive sets of decisions, and thus, prior solutions that rely on the aggregation of multiple experts’ decisions for the same instance are inapplicable. We first formulate the problem of estimating experts’ decision accuracy in this setting and then develop a machine–learning–based framework to address it. Our method effectively leverages both abundant historical data on workers’ past decisions and scarce decision instances with ground truth labels. Using both semi-synthetic data based on publicly available data sets and purposefully compiled data sets on real workers’ decisions, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations of our method’s performance relative to alternatives. The results show that our approach is superior to existing alternatives across diverse settings, including settings that involve different data domains, experts’ qualities, and amounts of ground truth data. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to posit and address the problem of estimating experts’ decision accuracies from historical data with scarce ground truth, and it is the first to offer comprehensive results for this problem setting, establishing the performances that can be achieved across settings as well as the state-of-the-art performance on which future work can build.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of managing resources in shared micromobility systems (bike sharing and scooter sharing). An important task in managing such systems is periodic repositioning/recharging/sourcing of units to avoid stockouts or excess inventory at nodes with unbalanced flows. We consider a discrete-time model; each period begins with an initial inventory at each node in the network, and then, customers (demand) materialize at the nodes. Each customer picks up a unit at the origin node and drops it off at a randomly sampled destination node with an origin-specific probability distribution. We model the above network inventory management problem as an infinite horizon discrete-time discounted Markov decision process (MDP) and prove the asymptotic optimality of a novel mean-field approximation to the original MDP as the number of stations becomes large. To compute an approximately optimal policy for the mean-field dynamics, we provide an algorithm with a running time that is logarithmic in the desired optimality gap. Lastly, we compare the performance of our mean field-based policy with state-of-the-art heuristics via numerical experiments, including experiments using Austin scooter-sharing data.

  abstract     = {The rise of shadow banking and attendant financial fragility in China can be traced to intensified deposit competition following the 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC). A large, state-owned bank’s deposits from cross-border money inflows fell significantly following the GFC, and it supported the government’s fiscal stimulus more aggressively than other large banks by issuing larger volumes of new loans. Small and medium-sized banks with more branch-level overlaps with this large bank relied more on shadow banking and issued more wealth management products (WMPs)—short-maturity, off-balance-sheet substitutes for deposits. Greater amounts of WMPs created rollover risks for the issuers, as reflected by higher yields on new WMPs, higher borrowing rates in the interbank market, and lower stock-market performance during liquidity stress.

We find empirical evidence that the boycott had substantial and long-lasting consequences. First, consumer utility from the boycotted products decreased significantly, reflecting consumers’ strong willingness to take part in collective action. Second, our discrete choice demand model, which addresses both price endogeneity and product substitution, estimates that sales of the boycotted firm decreased by almost 8% or, equivalently, by 8.1 million liters during the 12-month postboycott period. Third, the boycotted firm’s sales and revenue decreases would have been more severe had the firm not cut prices after the boycott outbreak. Our findings emphasize top-level managers’ role in fostering an ethical organizational culture within the firm and taking proper and timely countermeasures to curb losses incurred by a boycott.

  abstract     = {We study platform financing in comparison with trade credit for lending to third-party sellers, considering scenarios where default risk is driven by external factors (exogenous) or influenced by the parties’ decisions (endogenous). Our findings indicate that under exogenous default risk, although platform financing exposes the platform to the seller’s default risk, it can enhance the seller’s sales by providing low-rate finance and reducing the wholesale price because the supplier remains isolated from default risk. Platform financing emerges in equilibrium, benefiting all parties, particularly in businesses facing significant default risk, high product costs, operating in small markets, or having a high commission rate. In cases of endogenous default risk, platform financing can mitigate the seller’s opportunistic behavior, either preventing or reducing default risk, and the effects of product costs and market uncertainty may become nonmonotonic. In certain scenarios, platform financing arises in equilibrium when the product cost is intermediate or sufficiently high but not in between and when market uncertainty is moderate but not low or high. We also explore the impacts of the seller’s initial capital and credit limits, providing valuable managerial insights. This paper was accepted by Jeannette Song, operations management.

  abstract     = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has proven effective in solving many inventory control problems with demand learning. However, it often faces the pitfall of an infeasible target inventory level that is lower than the current inventory level. Several recent works have been successful in resolving this issue in various inventory systems. However, their techniques are rather sophisticated and difficult to apply to more complicated scenarios, such as multiproduct and multiconstraint inventory systems. In this paper, we address the infeasible target inventory-level issue from a new technical perspective; we propose a novel minibatch SGD-based metapolicy. Our metapolicy is flexible enough to be applied to a general inventory systems framework covering a wide range of inventory management problems with myopic clairvoyant optimal policy. By devising the optimal minibatch scheme, our metapolicy achieves a regret bound of O ( T ) for the general convex case and O ( log T ) for the strongly convex case. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of our metapolicy, we apply it to three important inventory control problems, multiproduct and multiconstraint systems, multiechelon serial systems, and one-warehouse and multistore systems, by carefully designing application-specific subroutines. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our metapolicy enjoys competitive regret performance, high computational efficiency, and low variances among a wide range of applications.

For instance, it suggests that limiting government bailouts to interbank exposures can effectively reduce endogenous systemic risk. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

  abstract     = {We develop an economic model of autonomous vehicle (AV) ride-hailing markets, in which uncertain aggregate demand is served with a combination of a fixed fleet of AVs and a flexible pool of human drivers (HVs). Dispatch efficiencies increase with scale because of density effects. We analyze market outcomes in this setting under four market configurations, defined by two dispatch platform structures (common platform versus independent platforms) and two levels of supply competition (monopoly AV versus competitive AV). A key result of our analysis is that the lower cost of AVs does not necessarily translate into lower prices; the price impact of AVs is ambiguous and depends critically on both the dispatch platform structure and the level of AV supply competition. In the extreme case, we show that if AVs and HVs operate on independent dispatch platforms, there is a monopoly AV supplier, and labor supply elasticity is sufficiently high, then prices are even higher than in a pure-HV market. Indeed, to guarantee consistently lower prices (relative to a pure HV market) in all scenarios and under all supply and density elasticities, a common dispatch platform between AVs and HVs is required. Furthermore, competitive AVs lead to lower prices than monopoly AVs in every such scenario. Our results illustrate the critical role that market configuration plays in realizing potential welfare gains from AVs.

  abstract     = {By design, the Bitcoin protocol has a low throughput. The Lightning Network (LN) is a layer-two solution built to increase throughput by cryptographically securing commitments to transactions and only occasionally converting cumulative balances into on-chain transactions. LN channels enable payments between nodes connected by a path of channels. The payment flow through a channel determines its cost. Different channel topologies can support the same underlying flows but impose different costs. This paper obtains necessary conditions for cost-minimizing topologies by identifying local cost-reducing strategies. The first local strategy entails repositioning of channels. The second entails adding hubs to handle the flows of groups of nodes. The paper also evaluates the efficiency of a global configuration, obtaining bounds on the minimum cost topology and showing the unusual circumstances in which the cost minimal structure is a hub that connects to all other nodes.

  abstract     = {Seeking Alpha (SA) is the most popular crowdsourced social media platform specializing in the financial analysis of U.S. firms, and it attracts over 17 million visitors per month. We find that firm coverage initiation on SA significantly promotes corporate innovation activities. SA coverage promotes corporate innovation by disseminating innovation-related information about the covered firm to external investors, thereby alleviating the firm’s financial constraints. Moreover, firms with higher information asymmetry, firms facing greater product market competition, and firms having lower levels of managerial short-termism reveal a greater increase in innovation outcomes following SA coverage initiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that third party-generated information on specialized social media mitigates the information asymmetry between firms and investors on corporate innovation activities and encourages corporate innovation.

  abstract     = {Quality internet access is critical to participating in contemporary society. Unfortunately, many households—particularly those of low socioeconomic status and/or those in rural areas—do not have quality internet access. Some have no access, whereas others are reliant on their mobile data plans for internet access (i.e., they are “smartphone dependent”). This generates inequality in internet access and use. Given the smartphone dependence of many disadvantaged households, we explore whether improvements to mobile internet service can help reduce digital inequality. We focus on a specific improvement: access to unlimited mobile data. For access to unlimited data to help reduce digital inequality, it must generate larger data consumption increases for disadvantaged households than for advantaged ones, including for data likely to enhance welfare, such as online education content. It is not obvious that this will be the case. Accordingly, we use detailed subscriber-level data from a major telecommunications company to examine changes in the consumption of education and other content after subscribers switch to unlimited mobile data plans. We find that although all subscribers increase their consumption, the increases are significantly larger for disadvantaged subscribers, both for overall content and for education content. This is an important finding given that identifying programs that generate disproportionate data consumption increases for disadvantaged households—including for education and other “enhancing” content—is a necessary step for reducing digital inequality.

  abstract     = {An important debated topic in strategic management concerns the so-called “chief executive officer (CEO) effect,” which quantifies the impact that CEOs have on the performance of the firms that they lead. Prior literature has empirically investigated the CEO effect and found support for both theses: a significant effect and no effect at all. We note, however, that virtually all prior studies have relied on an empirical specification that leverages in-sample data, which could be unreliable in certain circumstances. In this paper, we utilize machine learning models and predictive analytics based on out-of-sample data to revisit the CEO effect. In particular, we operationalize the CEO effect as the gain in the out-of-sample predictive accuracy by adding the CEO information to the model input in addition to the firm information. By analyzing 1,245 firms and 1,779 CEOs over 20 years, we demonstrate that the results of the approach from the literature have limited external validity. More specifically, we convey that the analyses are purely based on in-sample data and that the predictive effects of CEOs are not substantive when out-of-sample test data sets are used. Although our main analysis relies on optimized distributed gradient boosting, we also conduct extensive robustness tests spanning close to 100 models with alternative algorithms and specifications, all of which yield consistent results.

  abstract     = {Although the significance of narrative thinking has been increasingly recognized by social scientists, very little empirical research has documented its consequences for economically significant outcomes. The current paper addresses this gap in one important domain: valuations. In three experiments, participants were given the opportunity to sell an item they owned (mug in Study 1, hat in Studies 2 and 3) using an incentive-compatible procedure (multiple price list). Prior to making selling decisions, participants were randomly assigned to either a narrative treatment, in which they were asked to tell the story of their item, or a list treatment, in which they were asked to list the characteristics of their item. The narrative treatment led to significantly higher selling prices and increased rates of participants refusing all offered prices. We further explore potential mechanisms, and the impact of different types of narratives, by analyzing self-reported classifications of, and employing natural language processing techniques on, participants’ narratives.

  abstract     = {We construct a comprehensive data set of medium- and large-sized industrial firms and research universities in China and examine how Chinese firms’ commercialization of their technologies is related to their experience in industry-university collaboration (IUC). We propose that firms’ IUC experience constitutes an inimitable complementary asset that facilitates their technology commercialization. Our empirical analyses show that firms generate more new product sales and produce more product-oriented patents when they have more patents that are coassigned to universities or when they have more academic publications coauthored with university staff in the past. Such a relation is strengthened when firms have higher absorptive capacity, when firms are in industries that depend more on basic science, and when firms are located closer to their collaborating universities. Additional tests point out four channels through which firms’ IUC experience benefits their technology commercialization: knowledge acquisition, talent recruiting, direct technology transfers, and technological complementarity.

The degree of overextrapolation is driven by the persistence of the underlying earnings process and other factors that affect representativeness heuristics, including trend, salience, and volatility. Experience and value diversity among corporate managers help mitigate this bias, whereas demographic diversity does not.

However, empirically, they both comove and are countercyclical. This paper builds a general equilibrium model and demonstrates that credit market frictions allow cross-sectional dispersion to drive time-varying macro uncertainty endogenously. In the model, as firm-level productivity becomes more dispersed, more firms are pushed to the left tail of the productivity distribution, resulting in more defaults and a depletion in aggregate net worth. This mechanism generates countercyclical leverage and aggregate volatility. The model implies that the government can inject equity in economic downturns to stabilize aggregate volatility.

  abstract     = {We study a robust selling problem where a seller attempts to sell one item to a buyer but is uncertain about the buyer’s valuation distribution. The existing literature shows that robust screening provides a stronger theoretical guarantee than robust deterministic pricing but at the expense of implementation complexity as it requires a menu of infinite options. Our research aims to find simple mechanisms to hedge against market ambiguity effectively. We develop a general framework for robust selling mechanisms with a finite menu (or randomization across finite prices). We propose a tractable reformulation that addresses various ambiguity sets of the buyer’s valuation distribution, including support, mean, and quantile ambiguity sets. We derive optimal selling mechanisms and corresponding performance ratios for different menu sizes, which show that even a modest menu size can deliver benefits similar to those achieved by the optimal robust mechanism with infinite options, establishing a favorable trade-off between theoretical performance and implementation simplicity. Remarkably, a menu size of merely two can significantly enhance the performance ratio compared with deterministic pricing.

We derive conditions in which the influencer is authentic during an early growth phase, but she becomes inauthentic once a large enough fraction of potential followers are aware of her.

If posts can go viral, the influencer initially is inauthentic as she hopes to go viral, she later becomes authentic to grow awareness rapidly, and she eventually becomes inauthentic again.

  abstract     = {We study the competition for partners in two-sided matching markets with heterogeneous agent preferences, with a focus on how the equilibrium outcomes depend on the connectivity in the market. We model random partially connected markets, with each agent having an average degree d in a random (undirected) graph and a uniformly random preference ranking over their neighbors in the graph. We formally characterize stable matchings in large random markets with small imbalance and find a threshold in the connectivity d at log 2 n (where n is the number of agents on one side of the market), which separates a “weak competition” regime, where agents on both sides of the market do equally well, from a “strong competition” regime, where agents on the short (long) side of the market enjoy a significant advantage (disadvantage). Numerical simulations confirm and sharpen our theoretical predictions, and demonstrate robustness to our assumptions. We leverage our characterizations in two ways: First, we derive prescriptive insights into how to design the connectivity of the market to trade off optimally between the average agent welfare achieved and the number of agents who remain unmatched in the market. For most market primitives, we find that the optimal connectivity should lie in the weak competition regime or at the threshold between the regimes. Second, our analysis uncovers a new conceptual principle governing whether the short-side enjoys a significant advantage in a given matching market, which can moreover be applied as a diagnostic tool given only basic summary statistics for the market. Counterfactual analyses using data on centralized high school admissions in a major U.S. city suggests that both our design insights and our diagnostic principle have practical value.

Our findings are robust when controlling for valuation uncertainties of low-priced stocks, including idiosyncratic volatility and firm age. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {This paper develops a new approach to volatility ambiguity and studies its implications for equilibrium consumption, portfolio choice, and asset prices. Our approach does not require equivalence between priors. The measure of ambiguity is based on the statistical confidence in the reference model that can be assessed with sample statistics. The approach is analytically tractable and amenable to empirical/calibration analysis. A stochastic discount pricing formula is given. At sensible levels of volatility ambiguity, the empirical regularity of equity premium and consumption growth in U.S. data can be the equilibrium outcome of our model featuring a relative risk aversion (RRA) coefficient within a reasonable range.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a framework for learning the most concise Markov decision process (MDP) model of a continuous state-space dynamic system from observed transition data. This setting is encountered in numerous important applications, such as patient treatment, online advertising, recommender systems, and estimation of treatment effects in econometrics. Most existing methods in offline reinforcement learning construct functional approximations of the value or the transition and reward functions, requiring complex and often not interpretable function approximators. Our approach instead relies on partitioning the system’s observation space into regions constituting states of a finite MDP representing the system. We discuss the theoretically minimal MDP representation that preserves the values and, therefore, the optimal policy of the dynamic system—in a sense, the optimal discretization. We formally define the problem of learning such a concise representation from transition data without exploration. Learning such a representation allows for enhanced tractability and, importantly, provides interpretability. To solve this problem, we introduce an in-sample property on partitions of the observation space we name coherence , and we show that if the class of possible partitions is of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, any coherent partition with the transition data converges to the minimal representation of the system with provable finite-sample probably approximately correct convergence guarantees. This insight motivates our minimal representation learning algorithm that constructs from transition data an MDP representation that approximates the minimal representation of the system. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through numerical experiments in both deterministic and stochastic environments as well as with real data.

  abstract     = {The ability to successfully target consumers has been substantially affected by recent developments in digital markets, such as improvements in tracking technologies or General Data Protection Regulation. In this paper, we set up a game theoretic model to examine the implications of such changes in targeting success on firms’ targeting strategies and profits. We explicitly consider that firms can target different consumer groups—that is, high- or low-valuation consumers—and that targeting is imperfect—that is, a firm may not reach the intended consumer. We find that a higher targeting success rate has a nonmonotone effect on firms’ profits—that is, lowering profits if targeting is rather imprecise but raising profits if targeting is relatively accurate. If the probability of successful targeting is low, firms target high-valuation consumers ( competition for cherries ). More fine-tuned targeting then amplifies competition and decreases profits. Instead, if targeting is sufficiently precise, more fine-tuned targeting increases profits because firms segment the market by targeting different consumer groups. Improvements in the targeting ability also have profound effects on the number of products a firm offers and on the profitability of offering products that appeal not only to a single consumer group. First, although increased targeting success raises the attractiveness of introducing an additional product, it also heats up competition. A firm may therefore optimally reduce the number of products it sells if targeting success increases. Second, if products have a broader appeal, market segmentation is more likely to occur. However, aggregate profits are lower compared with when products are narrow. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.

  abstract     = {One of a firm’s key strategic decisions is whether to concentrate its input purchases in a small number of suppliers versus spreading them among many suppliers. We propose that supplier concentration solves an interfirm free-riding problem: By internalizing externalities between suppliers, it incentivizes buyer-supplier cooperation. Guided by a simple theoretical model, we investigate this hypothesis on slot exchanges between major airlines and their outsourced regional airline partners during inclement weather, a setting where externalities between suppliers are ubiquitous. We find robust evidence that a regional airline engages in more frequent slot exchanges with its major airline partner when it operates a larger share of the major’s outsourced flights. We also find that this positive effect of concentration on mutual cooperation increases in the size of the externalities between regionals. Our results suggest that, in contrast with Porter’s classic five forces framework, supplier concentration can serve as a governance instrument for buyer-supplier collaborations. More broadly, our paper provides novel evidence on task concentration as a tool to solve free-riding problems in multiagent settings. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.

  abstract     = {The underrepresentation of women in traditionally male-dominated fields of study can generate a lack of role models for female students, influencing their career choices. We investigate whether having higher shares of female professors and classmates throughout undergraduate studies in economics affects female students’ labor market outcomes up to five years after graduation. To deal with self-selection into professors and peers, we exploit the assignment rule of students to course sections at the prestigious University of Sao Paulo and focus on mandatory courses. Our findings suggest that having more female peers and professors can positively impact female students’ labor outcomes by increasing their participation rates in the workforce and accumulated experience, particularly in course sections in which female students are underrepresented. We also investigate potential channels driving our results. We show that a higher share of female classmates can help female students stay attached to the job market early on by securing internships or formal work during university. Moreover, female students are more likely to choose higher paying and male-dominated occupations if they have access to more female peers. Overall, our study highlights the importance of gender diversity in male-dominated academic settings and its potential positive impact on female students’ career outcomes.

  abstract     = {Acquisitions by corporate entities have fueled the growth of chain organizations in healthcare. A chain is a multiunit firm under the same ownership and management providing similar services in different locations. Chain ownership has been credited with boosting firm performance in the retail and service sectors but has been criticized for prioritizing profits over the well-being of patients in the healthcare sector. This paper finds that chain ownership improves healthcare outcomes in the market for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Using novel data on U.S. fertility clinics and difference-in-differences methods, we find that IVF cycles increase by 27.2%, and IVF success rates increase by 13.6% after acquisition by a fertility chain. We provide evidence that fertility chains facilitate resource and knowledge transfers needed to enhance quality and expand the IVF market. For example, acquired clinics change IVF processes and procedures to achieve the IVF gold standard of simultaneously reducing higher-risk multiple births and increasing singleton births. We discuss how the fertility sector’s relatively minimal market frictions and information asymmetries may incentivize chain owners to invest in quality.

Channel testing shows that local agglomeration increases housing and mortgage demand as well as mortgage supply. The increase in mortgage loans is driven by purchases of larger houses and smaller down payments. Mechanism analyses document that local agglomeration affects mortgage loans by increasing career upward potential and providing downside protection. Specifically, we find that the impact of local agglomeration is stronger for skilled employees with enhanced prospects. In addition, local agglomeration weakens the negative relation between unemployment and mortgage loans, which supports the downside-protection role of local agglomeration. These results hold under instrumental variables analysis, difference-in-difference analysis, and a set of robustness checks.

Investors are 50% more likely to fund projects that their peers support and are 11.2% more likely to fund projects from regions where they share strong social ties, given a one-standard-deviation change in the variables. More influential peers exert a greater influence, especially in the case of riskier projects, and the peer effects are amplified in crowdfunding platforms that prioritize transparency and accountability. Social ties transmit information about economic conditions in project locations, and they complement the influence of peer effects. Furthermore, the social network effects affect project funding outcomes and can be particularly valuable in mitigating the adverse effects of natural disasters.

Using an extended Black-Scholes model incorporating the presence of stock return autocorrelation, we demonstrate that expected returns of both call and put options are increasing in the return autocorrelation coefficient of the underlying stock. Consistent with this insight, we find strong empirical support in the cross-section of average returns of equity options.

  abstract     = {We consider a class of online decision-making problems with exchangeable actions, where in each period a controller is presented an input type drawn from some stochastic arrival process. The controller must choose an action, and the final objective depends only on the aggregate type-action counts. Such a framework encapsulates many online stochastic variants of common optimization problems with knapsack, bin packing, and generalized assignment as canonical examples. In such settings, we study a natural model-predictive control algorithm. We introduce general conditions under which this algorithm obtains uniform additive loss (independent of the horizon) compared with an optimal solution with full knowledge of arrivals. Our condition builds on the recently introduced compensated coupling technique, providing a unified view of how uniform additive loss arises as a consequence of the geometry of the underlying decision-making problem. Our characterization allows us to derive uniform loss algorithms for several new settings, including the first such algorithm for online stochastic bin packing. It also lets us study the effect of other modeling assumptions, including choice of horizon, batched decisions, and limited computation. In particular, we show that our condition is fulfilled by the above-mentioned problems when the end of the time horizon is known sufficiently long before the end. In contrast, if at a late stage, there is still uncertainty about the end of the time horizon we show that such uniform loss guarantees are impossible to achieve. We use real and synthetic data to illustrate our findings. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

  abstract     = {Standard applications of the consumption-based asset pricing model assume that goods and services within the nondurable consumption bundle are substitutes. We estimate substitution elasticities between different consumption bundles and show that households cannot substitute energy consumption by consumption of other nondurables. As a consequence, energy consumption affects the pricing function as a separate factor. Variation in energy consumption betas explains a large part of the premia related to value, investment, and operating profitability. For example, value stocks are typically more energy intensive than growth stocks and thus riskier, because they suffer more from the oil supply shocks that also affect households.

  abstract     = {Multi-armed bandit has been well known for its efficiency in online decision-making in terms of minimizing the loss of the participants’ welfare during experiments (i.e., the regret). In clinical trials and many other scenarios, the statistical power of inferring the treatment effects (i.e., the gaps between the mean outcomes of different arms) is also crucial. Nevertheless, minimizing the regret entails harming the statistical power of estimating the treatment effect because the observations from some arms can be limited. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between efficiency and statistical power by casting the multi-armed bandit experimental design into a minimax multi-objective optimization problem . We introduce the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the situation in which neither the statistical power nor the efficiency can be improved without degrading the other. We derive a useful sufficient and necessary condition for the Pareto optimal solutions to the minimax multi-objective optimization problem. Additionally, we design an effective Pareto optimal multi-armed bandit experiment that can be tailored to different levels of the trade-off between the two objectives. Moreover, we extend the design and analysis to the setting where the outcome of each arm consists of an adversarial baseline reward and a stochastic treatment effect, demonstrating the robustness of our design. Finally, motivated by clinical trials, we examine the setting where the employed experiment must split the experimental units into a small number of batches, and we propose a flexible Pareto optimal design.

Management Sci. 68(8):6235–6249] presents experimental evidence showing that people have an intrinsic preference for diversification that is driven by risk aversion and loss aversion, with risk-averse and loss-averse individuals being more willing to pay for diversification. We document numerous discrepancies between the results reported in the paper and the results calculated from the experimental data. In particular, the data show that risk-averse individuals are actually less willing to pay for diversification, whereas the effect of loss aversion is nonmonotonic and not statistically significant.

  abstract     = {Press releases are a primary disclosure channel firms use to communicate with investors. However, firms can also use press releases to self-promote to improve their public image. Promotional press releases are, on average, significantly less value relevant than those focused toward investors. They also contain more positive and emotional language as well as less specific and financially oriented language. Based on theories of disclosure processing costs and investor attention, we predict and find that firms’ recent high usage of this disclosure channel to self-promote is associated with increased investor attention and more efficient reactions to subsequent investor-focused disclosures. This effect is concentrated in less visible firms, whereas promotional press releases appear to have no effect on the pricing efficiency of more visible firms. We also provide evidence consistent with media attention being one channel through which these effects operate. Our findings deepen our understanding of how firms use press releases as a disclosure channel and contribute to the literature on disclosure processing costs.

  abstract     = {We study endogenous merger decisions among three competing firms with asymmetric capacity: one large firm has ample capacity, and two small firms have limited capacity. Each firm can either operate independently or merge with another firm. Because of antitrust laws, all three firms merging is not permitted. When two firms merge, the merged entity and the remaining independent firm use the resulting capacity to capture their own “loyal buyers” and compete in price for price-sensitive “disloyal switchers.” We first consider a base model in which the size of loyal buyers for different firms is symmetric. We find that, in equilibrium, either there is no merger or the large firm will merge with a small firm as a “mixed merger.” We explain how this equilibrium structure is driven by the mergers’ impacts on market competition and firms’ pricing aggressiveness. Specifically, the mixed merger that can most effectively reduce price competition is the equilibrium under relatively competitive market conditions (i.e., the size of loyal buyers is small and capacity is large but limited). We also extend to the case with asymmetric size of loyal segments and show that two small firms merging (“small merger” structure) can be the equilibrium structure when the large firm has a much larger loyal segment than the small firms and the small firms’ capacity is sufficiently large. The impacts of mergers on social welfare and consumer surplus provide practical implications from the antitrust perspective. The antitrust agencies can approve a mixed merger to improve social welfare under certain conditions, but if the agencies pay more attention to consumer surplus, then mixed mergers should not be permitted. Small mergers, though sometimes not the equilibrium structures, can improve social welfare and consumer surplus. In such cases, the government can appropriately promote mergers that are beneficial for society and/or consumers by adopting some restrictive measures or offering incentives.

  abstract     = {Amid an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, a pressing issue is how to improve the efficiency of conservation with limited resources and information. Collecting data on species with a small population is costly and time consuming, and many high-stakes decisions need to be made based on limited data. We develop a partially observable Markov decision processes model with unknown parameters to jointly optimize the information collection and protection efforts for threatened species. The model takes into account uncertainties about the state, detectability, and dynamics of the species, and it adaptively adjusts the efforts of surveying and protection in real time. Although the standard formulation is intractable, we exploit the structure of ecological problems to identify a hybrid belief state in low dimensions, and we reformulate the stochastic dynamic program as a piecewise deterministic optimal control problem. This enables us to obtain structural insights into the optimal policy (some are in closed form) and find a near-optimal approximate policy with performance guarantee. In certain situations, areas where the species has never been found may be more likely to contain the species than areas where it has been previously found. We also conduct a case study on the conservation of the Hainan gibbon, the rarest primate species, in which we extend the model to optimize the spatiotemporal allocation of limited resources.

  abstract     = {We develop an analytical framework to appropriately model and adequately analyze A/B tests in presence of nonparametric nonstationarities in the targeted business metrics. A/B tests, also known as online randomized controlled experiments, have been used at scale by data-driven enterprises to guide decisions and test innovative ideas to improve core business metrics. Meanwhile, nonstationarities, such as the time-of-day effect and the day-of-week effect, can often arise nonparametrically in key business metrics involving purchases, revenue, conversions, customer experiences, and so on. First, we develop a generic nonparametric stochastic model to capture nonstationarities in A/B test experiments, where each sample represents a visit or action associated with a time label. We build a practically relevant limiting regime to facilitate analyzing large-sample estimator performances under nonparametric nonstationarities. Second, we show that ignoring or inadequately addressing nonstationarities can cause standard A/B test estimators to have suboptimal variance and nonvanishing bias, therefore leading to loss of statistical efficiency and accuracy. We provide a new estimator that views time as a continuous strata and performs poststratification with a data-dependent number of stratification levels. Without making parametric assumptions, we prove a central limit theorem for the proposed estimator and show that the estimator attains the best achievable asymptotic variance and is asymptotically unbiased. Third, we propose a time-grouped randomization that is designed to balance treatment and control assignments at granular time scales. We show that when the time-grouped randomization is integrated to standard experimental designs to generate experiment data, simple A/B test estimators can achieve asymptotically optimal variance. A brief account of numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the analysis. This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.

Under the meritocratic civil examination system, government service was the main employment for the Chinese intellectuals. The abolition of this system in 1905 reduced the status and wealth attached to government service, which led the intellectuals to turn to modern banking as a high-status sector of employment. We find that regions where there were more candidates for the civil examination produced more financial professionals after 1905, which translated to a greater development of modern banking.

  abstract     = {The transmission of information is crucial for productivity and growth. However, language differences may limit its effectiveness. This is particularly relevant for knowledge platforms that aim to be global, given the cultural diversity of the pool of users. In this paper, I empirically investigate how the exogenous cost of language affects communication quality and the trade-offs faced by knowledge platforms in implementing their website in multiple languages. I exploit the staggered introduction of websites for languages other than English on a question-and-answer platform to demonstrate two main facts. First, nonnative English speakers who contribute in English increase their answers’ quality once able to use their native language, and their answers are more likely to solve the questioner’s problem. The native-language answers drive the effect, which is larger when the question quality is higher and the incentives are stronger. Second, users who participate in their native language but not in English contribute lower-quality answers compared with those who contribute in English. This suggests that lower language barriers allow users with less expertise in the subject to participate. These results show that the platform should adopt multiple languages to maximise the quality of the information collected, although doing so may also result in an inflow of low-quality content from new users.

  abstract     = {Although conflicts typically lead to a waste of resources, organizations may still benefit from a corporate culture that tolerates or even encourages conflicts. The reason is that coordinated conflicts may help to enforce norms and foster cooperation. In this paper, we report results of a series of laboratory experiments designed to explore whether and under what conditions an efficiency-enhancing conflict culture can emerge. Using a principal-agent setup with subjective performance evaluation, we show that establishing a functional conflict culture is a delicate matter. If conflicts are encouraged in a careless hands-off manner, the destructive side of conflicts is likely to dominate. To be successful, a conflict culture requires a careful management of fairness norms. In our experiment, we find that conflicts have positive net effects on efficiency only if an explicit code of conduct is established and conflicts are institutionalized through a grievance process. Thus, providing workers with more power may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for improving productivity when performance evaluations are subjective.

  abstract     = {Piecewise-linear reward schemes are very common in workplaces; by definition, they divide the set of possible performance levels into disjoint intervals that could have psychological value to workers. When these schemes take the form of lump-sum bonuses, any psychological rewards associated with attaining a performance interval are hard to distinguish from material ones because both material and psychological incentives predict bunching at the output needed to earn the bonus. To disentangle these effects, this paper studies a common but understudied class of piecewise-linear pay—accelerators—in which the mechanisms’ predictions conflict. Using the distributions of daily sales in 103 small retail teams, we find that daily sales bunch at accelerators, which is inconsistent with models in which only material rewards matter. Combining simple theoretical models, institutional evidence, and heterogeneity analyses, we argue that this unexpected bunching results from teams’ decisions to use the convenient, salient kink points as shared goals, which yield symbolic utility to their members when the points are attained.

We provide a model illustrating how a change in capital taxation affects employment in existing and new establishments. We then use establishment-level data to show that, in its first two years, the OZ designation increased employment growth relative to comparable tracts by between 3.0 and 4.5 percentage points in metropolitan areas. The job growth occurred in multiple industries and persisted into 2021 rather than quickly disappearing. However, most of the jobs created by the program were likely taken by residents who live outside of the designated tracts, consistent with only 5% of U.S. residents working in the same Census tract as the one in which they live.

Using data from an online chess platform, we find strong evidence of heterogeneous history-dependent stopping behavior. We identify two behavioral types of people: those who are more likely to stop playing after a loss and those who are more likely to stop playing after a win. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice model in which the utility from playing another game is directly affected by the previous game’s outcome. We estimate this time nonseparable preference model and conduct counterfactual analyses to study alternative market designs.

  abstract     = {The ranking system within academic environments may impact future professional trajectories. Examining the influence of class rank on college students’ managerial attainment is crucial for understanding some determinants of career advancement. This paper estimates the effect of a low rank in a high-performing class on the probability of college students attaining a managerial position in the future. Our data combine administrative records from a highly selective university in Brazil and employment registries. For most programs, this university divides first-year students into two classes based on their preferences and admission scores. In a regression discontinuity design, we control for students’ preferences and inherent skills by comparing the last student admitted to the high-score class (the “first class”) with the first student excluded from this class, who joins the “second class.” Results show that the last student in the first class is 10 percentage points less likely to attain a managerial position soon after graduating than a similar student in the second class. Although this effect is initially similar between genders, it diminishes for men over time while persisting for women. Overall, our study indicates that better-performing peers can hinder a student’s managerial career by lowering their relative rank in the classroom.

Prevailing affirmative action policies are based only on one identity dimension (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic class). We find that any such nonintersectional policy can almost never achieve a representative outcome. In fact, nonintersectional policies often increase the underrepresentation of underrepresented groups in a manner undetected by standard measures. Examples based on race and gender reveal significant hidden inequality arising from nonintersectional policies.

Utilizing a selection of terms from real-world job postings that we characterize as describing either a “Rule-Bender” or “Rule-Follower” candidate, we first conduct several validation studies which reveal that these terms vary predictably across types of job postings, that people generally agree with our categorization of these terms, and that Rule-Benders are viewed as possessing worse managerial skills but a higher proclivity for unethical behavior. We then demonstrate that narcissistic job seekers are more attracted to job postings that describe the ideal candidate using Rule-Bender terms for both general positions (Experiment 1) and senior accounting positions (Experiment 2). Finally, we examine firm characteristics that might lead professional recruiters to incorporate Rule-Bender language into Chief Accounting Officer job postings and find that Rule-Bender terms are preferred for higher-growth, higher-innovation firms (Experiment 3), and when more aggressive reporting would benefit the firm (Experiment 4). Our results suggest that recruiters’ language choices can attract Rule-Bending narcissists to firms, perhaps even in unintended circumstances. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.

  abstract     = {With the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) being replaced by risk-free rate (RFR)-based alternative reference rates, the fundamental differences between the two benchmarking frameworks impose significant risks on banks. Exploiting the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)’s announcement of the phase-out of LIBOR, we conduct a difference-in-differences analysis based on banks’ reliance on LIBOR and show that LIBOR discontinuation entails higher interest rate spread of bank loans. The result implies that banks tend to compensate for the LIBOR-to-RFR risks by passing on the transition costs to borrowers. This effect is attenuated if multiple benchmarks are already in use, for relationship lending, and among banks operating in a competitive environment. We further find that LIBOR discontinuation leads to more collateral and covenant requirements in loan terms. After the FCA announcement, banks are inclined to switch away from LIBOR dependence by referencing alternative rates. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance. Funding: J.-B.

  abstract     = {Market design provides managerial insights into the success and failure of various market institutions in allocating scarce resources. We investigate a dynamic matching mechanism used in real-world college admissions, where students share a common priority ranking. Theoretically, we prove that efficient and stable matching occurs with an arbitrarily high probability, assuming sufficient revision opportunities and rationality. This predicts that the dynamic mechanism is less stable than the deferred acceptance mechanism and less efficient than the Boston mechanism. We confirm this prediction in a low-complexity laboratory setting. However, in a high-complexity setting, the dynamic mechanism matches the stability of the deferred acceptance and the efficiency of the Boston mechanism, as both underperform in this setting. This finding indicates that the dynamic mechanism is more resilient to increased complexity. We attribute this resilience to its belief-independent characterization of rationalizable strategies. Beyond college admissions, the dynamic mechanism has potential applications in housing assignments, job allocations, and ascending auctions.

  abstract     = {We show that ride-hailing markets are prone to a matching failure (“wild goose chases”) in which high demand sets off a harmful feedback cycle of few idle drivers, high pickup times, and low earnings, drastically reducing welfare. After characterizing these failures theoretically and showing empirical evidence of their relevance, we analyze how platforms can avoid them. Raising prices brings demand back under control. Platforms can thus set a uniform high price, or they can use high “surge” pricing during high demand times while keeping prices low at other times. Some adjustments to the matching algorithm can also avoid the problem, but surge pricing performs better than them. This paper was accepted by Itai Ashlagi, revenue management and market analytics.

  abstract     = {Using a comprehensive database of corporate relocation events in the United States from 1994 to 2017, we investigate the impact of headquarters relocation on the local economy by examining its spillover effects on the housing market. We find that headquarters relocation into a district at zip code level leads to 10% higher housing price growth. We also document a temporal spillover effect whereby housing prices increase one year before the relocation and rise further until two years afterward and a significant spatial spillover effect of corporate relocation on nearby zip codes’ housing markets up to 15 miles. We show the positive spillover effect on housing price growth is more pronounced for relocating firms with larger employee sizes and economic bases. We further find local economic spillover and agglomeration economies associated with corporate relocation. Overall, our study indicates that corporate relocation exhibits a significant impact on the local housing market. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {An influential line of research emphasizes that colonial legacy plays a key role in formal financial development. Can colonial legacy also shape informal finance? We investigate the impact of colonial legacy on informal financial development using a manually georeferenced data set within a credible empirical framework. In the 19th century, Europeans arbitrarily designed colonial borders that partitioned many ethnicities across multiple countries in Africa. Leveraging several spatial regression discontinuity designs across national borders and within British-French–partitioned Cameroon and a unique natural experiment where the same former British colony is compared with two otherwise similar areas with different exposures to French colonization, we discover that former British colonies today have better informal financial development than former French colonies. Exploring the channels, we find that places with a British colonial legacy maintain a style of social control that facilitates information flow, supports private enforcement and market interactions, and promotes strong legal cultures.

  abstract     = {Revenue management decisions often involve both offline and online decisions. Offline decisions are made first and establish the broad and long-term operational context in which online decisions are frequently and repeatedly made, often in real time. We consider a joint optimization of offline and online decisions. Specifically, we examine a setting in which the offline decision concerns the selection of product-design characteristics (e.g., price, capacity, return eligibility, and other characteristics) and the online decision concerns the dynamic assortment optimization over a selling season. Our formulation has many applications, including optimizing products’ return eligibility and determining product discounts, and a key feature of our model is its explicit consideration of complex return dynamics and accompanying financial implications. We formulate an optimization problem that combines the impact of both offline and online decisions on the expected revenue. To determine the product design, we reformulate the choice-based deterministic linear program, solve its continuous relaxation, and round the resulting solution. Using value function approximations enables us to obtain a dynamic assortment policy whose expected revenue is at least a constant fraction of the choice-based deterministic linear program. Combining these two results, we show that our approach provides an approximate solution to the joint optimization problem with performance guarantees. Numerical experiments based on real transaction data from a major U.S. retailer show that our method achieves 95%–97% effectiveness, an advantage of up to 18% over methods that disregard the interplay between offline and online decisions. This framework also yields a systematic quantitative measure of the relative importance of both offline and online decisions. Based on this measure, numerical experiments highlight the crucial role of product design, accounting for 94% and 85% of the observed variation in effectiveness across various methods in applications involving volume discount and return eligibility, respectively.

The goal in these problems is to find an assortment that maximizes a firm’s worst-case expected revenue under all ranking-based choice models that are consistent with the historical sales data generated by the firm’s past assortments. We establish for various settings that these robust optimization problems can either be solved in polynomial time or can be reformulated as compact mixed-integer optimization problems. To establish our results, we prove that optimal assortments for these robust optimization problems have a simple structure that is closely related to the structure of revenue-ordered assortments.

Using the staggered liberalization of the banking sector in China as a natural experiment, we find that, consistent with the model’s prediction, entry by more efficient foreign banks reduces corporate misreporting fraud. Fraud reduction is greatest among borrowers of foreign banks, but fraud also drops among borrowers of domestic banks, suggesting a spillover effect. As predicted by the model, fraud reduction is greatest for borrowers with higher levels of fixed assets or lower levels of current assets.

Our results show that these limited effects mask heterogeneous behavioral responses to feedback valence. In particular, physicians improve more from positive feedback than from negative feedback, with negative feedback even reducing performance for a nontrivial share of patients. Experiments with laypersons replicate these results and show that struggles with negative feedback can be mitigated by giving incentives directly tied to improvement and by adding qualitative information that helps individuals interpret past performance. These results are consistent with behavioral models that suggest cognitive and emotional difficulties limit how well individuals use negative feedback. Thus, feedback interventions in healthcare should be carefully designed to mitigate these counterproductive behavioral responses. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.

As a result, our work constitutes the first quantitative improvement over power-of-2 policies, which have been state-of-the-art in this context since the mid-1980s.

  abstract     = {We develop a framework to quantify the vulnerability of mutual funds to fire-sale spillover losses. We account for the first-mover incentive that results from the mismatch between the liquidity offered to redeeming investors and the liquidity of assets held by the funds. In our framework, the negative feedback loop between investors’ redemptions and price impact from asset sales leads to an aggregate change in funds’ net asset value, which is determined as a fixed point of a nonlinear mapping. We show that a higher concentration of first movers increases the aggregate vulnerability of the system as measured by the ratio between endogenous losses triggered by fund redemptions and exogenous losses caused by initial price shocks only. When calibrated to U.S. mutual funds, our model shows that, in stressed market scenarios, spillover losses are significantly amplified through a nonlinear response to initial shocks that results from the first-mover incentive. Higher spillover losses provide a stronger incentive to redeem early, further increasing fire-sale losses and the transmission of shocks through overlapping portfolio holdings.

By design, effects on team performance can only work through communication. We find that all-male teams communicate more than all-female teams and outperform teams of both alternative gender compositions. In mixed teams, men strongly dominate the team conversation quantitatively. Considering the ranking in terms of communication shares in mixed teams, we document that high-skilled men talk the most, followed by low-skilled men. High-skilled women talk more than low-skilled women, but much less than low-skilled men. We conclude that gender composition significantly impacts the way how teams exchange information.

  abstract     = {In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces, the platform allows for some latency to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations. As our base model, we consider K -stage variants of the classic vertex-weighted bipartite b-matching in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stagewise and in K batches—in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for this problem is an optimal ( 1 − ( 1 − 1 / K ) K ) -competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic ( 1 − 1 / e ) -competitive ratio bound known for its online variant [Mehta A, Saberi A, Vazirani U, Vazirani V (2007) Ad words and generalized online matching. J. ACM 54(5):22–es; Aggarwal G, Goel G, Karande C, Mehta A (2011) Online vertex weighted bipartite matching and single-bid budgeted allocations. Proc. 22nd Annual ACM-SIAM Sympos. Discrete Algorithms (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia), 1253–1264]. We also extend this result to the general problem of multistage configuration allocation with free disposals [Devanur NR, Huang Z, Korula N, Mirrokni VS, Yan Q (2016) Whole page optimization and submodular welfare maximization with online bidders. ACM Trans. Econom. Comput. 4(3):1–20], which is motivated by the display advertising application in the context of video streaming platforms. Our main technique at a high level is developing algorithmic tools to vary the trade-off between “greediness” and “hedging” of the matching algorithm across stages. We rely on a particular family of convex programming–based matchings that distribute the demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages while carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages. More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight–matching linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our fractional multistage algorithm returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this stage (by solving the convex program). By providing structural decomposition of the underlying graph using the optimal solutions of these convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we develop a new multistage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive ratio of this algorithm. We further show this algorithm is optimal competitive, even in the unweighted case, by providing an upper bound instance in which no online algorithm obtains a competitive ratio better than ( 1 − ( 1 − 1 / K ) K ) . For the extension to multistage configuration allocation, we introduce a novel extension of our regularized convex program that provides separate regularization at different “price levels.” Despite the lack of a relevant graph decomposition in this extension, in contrast to our base model, we show how we can directly use convex duality to set up a primal-dual analysis framework for our new algorithm.

  abstract     = {Recent regulations on search neutrality prohibit retail platforms from self-preferentially prioritizing their first-party products over those of third-party sellers in consumers’ search rankings. This paper shows that, despite its good intention, search neutrality may unintendedly harm consumers and third-party sellers because of the strategic decisions of the platform and third-party sellers. In the short term, search neutrality can weaken the price competition between the platform and third-party sellers, which will hurt consumers if many of them ex ante prefer the third-party product, and can increase the platform’s profit if many consumers ex ante prefer the first-party product. In the long term, search neutrality can incentivize the platform to preempt the entry of third-party sellers if their entry cost is intermediate, further harming consumers and third-party sellers. Both unintended harms stem from two unique features of online retailing platforms: platforms personalize consumers’ search rankings, and consumers observe product prices before searching a product in depth. Alternative formulations of search neutrality, consumers’ search costs, and their product match likelihoods are considered to demonstrate the robustness of the main results.

  abstract     = {We consider a class of sequential learning problems where a decision maker must learn the unknown statistical characteristics of a finite set of alternatives (or systems) using sequential sampling to ultimately select a subset of “good” alternatives. A salient feature of our problem is that system performance is governed by a set of features . The decision maker postulates the dependence on these features to be linear, but this model may not precisely represent the true underlying system structure. We show that this misspecification, if not managed properly, can lead to suboptimal performance because of a phenomenon identified as sample-selection endogeneity . We propose a prospective sampling principle—a new approach that eliminates the adverse effects of misspecification as the number of samples grows large. The proposed principle applies across a very general class of widely used sampling policies, enjoys strong asymptotic performance guarantees, and exhibits effective finite-sample performance in numerical experiments.

  abstract     = {Procuring essential products during disasters can save lives and livelihoods; nevertheless, limited research has explored this critical issue. In this paper, we collaborate with a buying company to run a unique B2B field experiment during the early COVID-19 outbreak that prompts an urgent need for personal protective equipment. We find that suppliers would deliver products faster by quoting a significantly shorter lead time when the buying company purchases products for donation rather than for resale. Similarly, suppliers quote a shorter lead time when the company provides crisis information—the number of COVID-19 cases in the region with high crisis levels—to highlight the urgent need for products. Interestingly, faster delivery does not come at the expense of the buying company. Buyers receive the products faster but also pay less. We collaborate with the same company to rerun the field experiment in the new normal and find that the buyer’s intent of donation leads to shorter lead time but not to lower wholesale price. Moreover, providing the COVID-19 information of the local community to suppliers has no impact on their decisions. Overall, our paper provides the first empirical evidence on suppliers’ lead time and wholesale price decisions during and after a disaster, thereby helping companies to deliver emergency products in a timely and efficient manner as well as designing their philanthropic and information strategies.

  abstract     = {We study biases and the informativeness of subjective performance evaluations in an online experiment, testing the implications of a standard formal framework of rational subjective evaluations. In the experiment, subjects in the role of workers perform a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe samples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct six experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation, (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations, and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. Moreover, we use the exogenous assignment of supervisors to workers to investigate the association between supervisors’ social preferences and their rating quality. In line with the model of optimal evaluations, we find that ratings are more lenient and less informative when they determine bonus payments. Rewards for accuracy reduce leniency and can enhance informativeness. When supervisors have access to more detailed performance information, their ratings vary more with the performance signal and become more informative. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that more prosocial supervisors are systematically more lenient when their ratings affect workers’ payoffs. Instead, they are more diligent in their rating behavior, resulting in more accurate and informative performance evaluations.

  abstract     = {We study the dynamic incentive interactions between a platform and a third-party seller over two stages, where the seller exerts product-value-enhancement effort in the first stage in anticipation of the platform’s potential entry in the second stage. Upon entry, the platform can exert effort to boost the value of the product sold by the platform, with positive spillovers to the value of the product sold by the platform. We show the existence of both the protective and the receptive regimes, characterizing the necessary and sufficient conditions for each regime. These conditions are of thresholds type with respect to the parameters including the degree of spillover, the referral rate, and the competition intensity. In the protective (receptive) regime, the seller is worse (better) off with the platform’s entry than without, thereby distorting effort downward (upward) from the first best to deter (induce) the platform’s entry to the products of intermediate value. Notably, if the spillover effect is negative, only the protective regime will arise. We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the platform’s nonentry commitment strictly improves the platform’s profits by restoring the seller’s effort to the first best, achieving the win-win outcome for both the platform and the seller.

  abstract     = {Many products are most meaningfully described using unstructured data such as text or images. Unstructured data are also common in e-commerce, in which products are often described by photos and text but not with standardized sets of attributes. Whereas much is known about how to efficiently measure consumer preferences when products can be meaningfully described by structured attributes, there is scant research on doing the same for unstructured data. This paper introduces a real-time, adaptive survey design framework for measuring preferences over unstructured data, leveraging Bayesian optimization. By adaptively choosing items to display based on uncertainty around a nonparametric utility model, the proposed method maximizes information gain per question, enabling quick estimation of individual-level preferences. The approach operates on embeddings of the unstructured data, thereby eliminating the requirement for manual coding of product attributes. We apply the method to measuring preferences over clothing and highlight its potential for both the general task of marketing research and the specific task of designing customer onboarding surveys to mitigate the cold-start recommendation problem. We also develop methods for interpreting the nonparametric utility functions, which allow us to reconstruct consumer valuations of discrete attributes, even for attributes that were not considered or available a priori.

  abstract     = {Consumers can sometimes be exploited because they make mistakes in their valuation of products. We present the results from a large-scale experimental study that examines whether third-party spectators from the general population in the United States cancel a voluntary deal where a buyer has made a mistake in the valuation of a product and agreed to pay more for the product than the seller knows it is worth. We find that the majority of the spectators cancel such deals, even when the seller’s involvement is limited to accepting a proposal made by the buyer. A substantial share of these spectators is also willing to fine the seller. However, a large minority of the spectators are willing to uphold the deal even when the seller has proposed the deal and obfuscated the information provided to the buyer. Our results shed new light on when people view market transactions as acceptable and their attitudes to government regulation of businesses.

  abstract     = {The predominant focus of the organizational literature on trust has been on direct interactions between actors. Whereas this emphasis has solidified our understanding of the dyadic foundations of trust, we know relatively little about the mechanisms of trust creation in network contexts. In this paper, we introduce the network mechanism of prismatic trust to explain why some actors are more trusted than others. Specifically, we posit that networks act as prisms that generate signals of trustworthiness based on not only actors’ positions in the social structure, but also their networking behavior. Moreover, we also theorize that the combination of signals from network structure and behavior amplifies trust accumulation in network actors. We test our predictions using data from an online social trading platform with more than 28,000 traders across 38 weeks. We find that traders who occupy positions of higher status in the network and those who express positive sentiments in the content of their communications (networking behaviors), accumulate more trustors. Furthermore, the positive effects of network status and the expression of positive sentiments on trust accumulation are mutually reinforcing. In sum, we contribute to the organizational literature on trust by proposing the role of a prismatic view in explaining how trust accumulates in network actors as a function of their position in social structure, their networking behavior, and a combination of the two.

  abstract     = {We investigate the strategic interaction between a product expert and a consumer. The expert publicly commits to a ranking methodology to rank two products with uncertain relative merits; the consumer decides whether to acquire the ranking report to guide her product choice. The expert cares only about selling the report; the consumer derives utility from the product itself and an extra ranking attribute controlled by the expert. Strategic shuffling, in which the expert induces demand for his report by manipulating the uncertainty in product rankings, emerges as an equilibrium phenomenon. When the consumer highly values the top-ranked product, the expert-optimal equilibrium, which features shuffling, diverges from the consumer-optimal equilibrium. Laboratory evidence supports the predictions of the expert-optimal equilibrium. With limited field data because of the proprietary nature of ranking methodologies, our study provides useful alternative evidence on how ranking publishers may adopt methodologies that are not in consumers’ best interests.

However, common ownership also undermines effective corporate governance by diminishing blockholders’ incentives to engage in value-enhancing behaviors, such as managerial monitoring. These adverse effects on corporate governance act as limiting factors, ultimately determining the equilibrium level of common ownership. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.},

A federated blockchain for financial reporting and auditing can improve verification efficiency not only for transactions in private databases but also for cross-chain verifications through privacy-preserving computation protocols. Despite the potential benefit of blockchains, private incentives for firms and first-mover advantages for auditors can create inefficient under-adoption or partial adoption that favors larger auditors. Although a regulator can help coordinate the adoption of technology, endogenous choice of transaction partners by firms can still lead to adoption failure. Our model also provides an initial framework for further studies of the costs and implications of the use of distributed ledgers and secure multiparty computation in financial reporting, including the positive spillover to discretionary auditing and who should bear the cost of adoption.

  abstract     = {Despite strong theoretical predictions based on disagreement, limited empirical evidence links short-selling restrictions to higher prices. We test this relationship using quasi-experimental methods based on rule 201, a threshold-based policy that restricts aggressive short selling when intraday returns cross −10%. When comparing stocks on either side of the threshold in the same hour of trading, we find that the restriction leads to 8% lower short-sale volume and 35 basis points higher daily returns.

  abstract     = {We examine the construction of variable importance measures for multivariate responses using the theory of optimal transport. We start with the classical optimal transport formulation. We show that the resulting sensitivity indices are well-defined under input dependence, are equal to zero under statistical independence, and are maximal under fully functional dependence. Also, they satisfy a continuity property for information refinements. We show that the new indices encompass Wagner’s variance-based sensitivity measures. Moreover, they provide deeper insights into the effect of an input’s uncertainty, quantifying its impact on the output mean, variance, and higher-order moments. We then consider the entropic formulation of the optimal transport problem and show that the resulting global sensitivity measures satisfy the same properties, with the exception that, under statistical independence, they are minimal, but not necessarily equal to zero. We prove the consistency of a given-data estimation strategy and test the feasibility of algorithmic implementations based on alternative optimal transport solvers. Application to the assemble-to-order simulator reveals a significant difference in the key drivers of uncertainty between the case in which the quantity of interest is profit (univariate) or inventory (multivariate). The new importance measures contribute to meeting the increasing demand for methods that make black-box models more transparent to analysts and decision makers.

  abstract     = {In the last two decades, last-mile delivery (LMD) firms have seen immense growth fueled by the success of e-commerce, leading to faster and cheaper deliveries. Operating on thin margins, LMD firms strive for successful first-time deliveries to avoid the financial and reputational costs of reattempts. Delivery agents (DAs) are integral to LMD efficiency, influencing customer experience, delivery success, and productivity. However, most LMD performance enhancement research focuses on process, technology, and incentives, which presume workers will conform to procedures and monitoring tools will function flawlessly. Nevertheless, in practice, DAs deviate from expected behaviors, that is, indulge in misconduct, negatively affecting delivery efficiency, often resulting in returned parcels. One of the major forms of misconduct is entering fake remarks about deliveries, wherein DAs intentionally do not deliver the parcels and provide fake reasons for it. For instance, even without reaching a delivery address, a DA remarks “customer unavailable” and records a delivery failure. In this study, we collaborated with a leading Indian LMD firm and, using instrumental variable regression, found that such misconduct leads to a spillover productivity loss. This effect reduces the next day’s successful deliveries by 1.60% and first-time-right deliveries by 1.86%. We discuss misconduct’s correlation with factors such as task complexity and offer novel insights into how opportunistic circumstances can influence worker behavior.

  abstract     = {We study a dynamic general equilibrium model with costly-to-short stocks and heterogeneous beliefs. Costly short sales drive a wedge between the valuation of assets that promise identical cash flows but that are subject to different trading arrangements. In particular, we show that the price of an asset is given by the risk-adjusted present value of its future cash flows, which include both dividends and an endogenous lending yield that we characterize explicitly. This valuation formula implies that stocks with low and high shorting costs should offer similar risk-return trade-off once returns are appropriately adjusted for lending revenues and thus, sheds light on recent empirical findings about the explanatory power of shorting costs in the cross-section of returns.

  abstract     = {This paper considers a firm’s investment decision determining the timing and capacity level in a dynamic setting with demand uncertainty. Its investment is financed by borrowing from a lender that has market power, generating a capital market inefficiency. We show that the firm’s investment is subject to double marginalization in the sense that the need for external financing results in a considerably smaller investment and thus, a reduction in welfare. In addition, we find that the presence of the bankruptcy option mitigates the double-marginalization effect unless the bankruptcy cost is small. The firm’s investment size is increasing in bankruptcy costs, albeit at the expense of an investment delay. Based on this, an increase of bankruptcy costs raises social welfare.

We identify three optimal channels for providing referral incentives. First, if the existing buyer declares that no potential buyer exists, his virtual value is penalized. Second, if the existing buyer refers the potential buyer to the seller, his virtual value is boosted. Third, in some scenarios where this carrots-and-sticks-via-virtual-value approach is insufficient for creating proper referral incentives, the existing buyer is then given a constant referral bonus for referring the potential buyer. We also provide conditions under which the optimal mechanism can be implemented using simple mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that the conventional resale mechanism is suboptimal.

  abstract     = {Firms have inefficiently low incentives to innovate when other firms benefit from their inventions and the innovating firm therefore does not capture the full surplus of its innovations. We show that, in theory, common ownership of firms mitigates this impediment to corporate innovation. By contrast, without technological spillovers, innovation has the effect of stealing market share from rivals and in that case more common ownership reduces innovation. Empirically, the association between common ownership and innovation inputs and outputs decreases with product market proximity and increases with technology proximity. The sign and magnitude of the overall relationship between common ownership and corporate innovation thus varies considerably across the universe of firms depending on their relative proximity in technology and product market space. Some of these results persist if we use only variation from BlackRock’s acquisition of BGI.

  abstract     = {In this study, we provide evidence on the effects of state tax whistleblower laws. We exploit a novel 2010 amendment to New York’s False Claims Acts (FCA) that explicitly extended whistleblower incentives to corporate income tax whistleblowers. We identify treated firms (firms exposed to New York’s FCA) using establishment-level data and descriptive analyses. Using a sample of firms exposed to New York and neighboring states, we find evidence that New York’s FCA reduced state tax avoidance. In cross-sectional tests, we find that effects are increasing in firms that grant fewer employee stock options and industry regulation, consistent with deterrence increasing in employee and regulator monitoring. We also find evidence that New York’s FCA deterred federal tax avoidance, consistent with positive vertical tax externalities. Next, we focus on particular tax strategies and find evidence of a reduced probability of Double Irish tax structures, reduced relationships to tax planning banks, reduced use of special purpose vehicles, and reduced outbound tax-motivated income shifting. We also find evidence that firms with the lowest (highest) cost of relocation (1) reduced (did not change) establishment counts in New York but (2) did not change (reduced) state tax avoidance. Finally, we disentangle general ex ante deterrence from ex ante peer deterrence using hand-collected New York tax whistleblower press releases from the Attorney General. We find evidence of both types of deterrence. Overall, this study provides policy-relevant evidence on the deterrence effects of tax whistleblower laws.

Estimates of MVC can guide corporate cash and payout policy, indicate the quality of governance, and make a firm a target for takeover or activism. Yet the existing methods of estimation lack a rigorous theoretical foundation and often provide implausibly high or low estimates. In this paper, we provide a formulation of MVC and structurally estimate the MVC based on a model that encompasses the important determinants for the choice of cash savings, including financing and agency costs. We find that firms with large cash and capital stocks have lower marginal value of cash, whereas the relationship between leverage and marginal value of cash is hump shaped.

  abstract     = {Does artificial intelligence (AI) displace auditors? We exploit the staggered hiring of AI employees at audit office locations across the United States as a proxy for the use of AI at local audit offices. The main findings are as follows. First, relative to audit offices that do not yet hire AI employees, those that do hire AI employees have a 4.3% increase in the number of auditor jobs, particularly among junior and midlevel auditors. Second, using AI is associated with an increased demand for soft skills (e.g., cognitive skills) in auditor jobs. Third, audit offices that use AI have more accurate going concern and internal control opinions. Semistructured interviews of 11 seasoned audit partners confirm that investment in AI is centralized at the national level, but the decision to deploy it often resides at the local audit office level. Notably, none of the partners believe that AI has replaced or will replace human auditors. Overall, our study—comprising both empirical and qualitative data—suggests that using AI does not replace auditors, but rather changes the skills required for these jobs and improves audit quality.

Among others, we find ransomware, as the most dominant organized crypto-enabled cybercrime, entails criminal gangs that operate like firms who adopt modern revenue models and carefully manage their reputations. We suggest that blanket restrictions on cryptocurrency usage may prove counterproductive. Instead, blockchain transparency enables effective forensics for tracking, monitoring, and shutting down dominant cybercriminal organizations, which potentially facilitates a more secure and reliable crypto ecosystem in the longer term.

  abstract     = {To what extent do firms know available information on key competitor decisions, and how does competitor information change their own strategic choices? These questions are fundamental to understanding how firms compete and make strategic decisions, yet systematic evidence on them remains limited. I designed a field experiment across 3,218 differentiated firms in the personal care industry, where firms randomly assigned to treatment received easily accessible information on competitor prices. At baseline, nearly half of treatment firms appeared to lack knowledge of competitor prices. Once treatment firms received competitor information, they were more likely to change their own decisions, aligning them with competitors rather than differentiating. These changes were driven by firms that were more misaligned in their price and quality decisions, and appear to have been performance enhancing. If competitor information was both easily accessible and decision relevant, why did firms not use this information on their own? Results from a follow-up experiment suggest that this lack of knowledge may have been driven by managerial inattention. These findings highlight that limited information processing is a key problem for firms and a central issue in strategy, and raise the possibility that growing availability of competitor data may lead firms to align their decisions more with their competitors.

  abstract     = {We propose a theory for rating financial securities in the presence of structural maximization by the issuer in a market with investors who rely on credit rating. Two types of investors, simple investors who price tranches solely based on the ratings and model-based investors who use the rating information to calibrate models, are considered. Concepts of self-consistency and information gap are proposed to study different rating criteria. In particular, the expected loss criterion used by Moody’s satisfies self-consistency, but the probability of default criterion used by Standard & Poor’s does not. Moreover, the probability of default criterion typically has a higher information gap than the expected loss criterion. Empirical evidence in the post–Dodd–Frank period is consistent with our theoretical implications. We show that a set of axioms based on self-consistency leads to a tractable representation for all self-consistent rating criteria, which can also be extended to incorporate economic scenarios. New examples of self-consistent and scenario-based rating criteria are suggested. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

We investigate the causal effects of such real-time feedback on individual effort and the quality of initial (prefeedback) and final (postfeedback) decisions by exploiting a natural quasi-experiment in the setting of professional soccer refereeing. Our results suggest that real-time feedback has differential effects for experienced compared with inexperienced agents. Specifically, we find some evidence that experienced agents decrease their effort under real-time feedback without harming the quality of their initial decisions. This results in better final decisions because real-time feedback allows agents to correct wrong initial decisions upon feedback. In contrast, inexperienced agents increase their effort, but make worse initial decisions. Upon feedback, they manage to compensate for their increased number of wrong initial decisions, but see no improvement in the quality of final decisions.

Panic drawdowns by borrowers coupled with bank liquidity rationing can mutually reinforce each other, creating a vicious cycle. Using data from U.S. banks, I estimate the model and quantify the amplification effect arising from strategic complementarity. This amplification effect accounted for two-thirds of the contraction of bank credit during the 2008–2009 crisis. Moreover, I show that policies targeting borrowers have a crowding-in effect and can effectively contain credit contraction. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

Our empirical findings provide international evidence in support of long-run risks, time-varying preference shocks, and countercyclicality of the stochastic discount factor.

  abstract     = {Across multiple studies, we investigate whether there are gender differences in preferences for receiving performance feedback. We vary many features of the feedback context: whether the performance task is a cognitive test or a mock interview, the feedback is objective or subjective, and it is possible for the provider of the feedback to discriminate on the basis of gender. Consistent with past work, we find that women are less optimistic about their performance than men and that, on average, more optimistic individuals have greater demand for feedback. Results like these have been hypothesized in the literature to imply that women will shy away from performance feedback more so than men. And, when we survey participants from a similar population, they also anticipate that women will demand feedback at lower rates than men. Yet, across our two incentivized studies, we find that women are no less eager to receive performance feedback than men. Understanding whether and how these results might generalize to broader contexts, particularly those with more social factors, is an important question for future work.

  abstract     = {This paper studies two competing firms’ choices between the contingent-price contract (CPC) and fixed-price contract (FPC) in global commodity procurement. The FPC price is determined when signing the contract, whereas the CPC price is pegged to an underlying index and remains open until the delivery date. Under both contracts, each firm determines its order quantity based on the updated belief about the market demand. The unrealized CPC price correlates with the market demand, allowing a firm to update its belief about the CPC price using demand information, thereby generating a price-learning effect. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, a larger price volatility could benefit the firms, and, under differentiated contracts, a firm might benefit from the improvement of forecast accuracy at its rival. We further show that the price-learning effect plays a critical role in the firms’ contract choices. First, significant price volatility forces the firms to pursue the responsiveness of the CPC. Second, the firms may adopt differentiated contracts to enhance their responses to market changes and dampen competition, and a higher competition intensity more likely leads to contract differentiation. Third, the firms in a small market seek responsiveness and contract differentiation rather than cost efficiency. This study reveals the bright side of price volatility and takes a step toward understanding the effect of two-dimensional information updating.

  abstract     = {Sequential decision making often requires dynamic policies, which are computationally not tractable in general. Decision rules provide approximate solutions by restricting decisions to simple functions of uncertainties. In this paper, we consider a nonparametric lifting framework where the uncertainty space is lifted to higher dimensions to obtain nonlinear decision rules. Current lifting-based approaches require predetermined functions and are parametric. We propose two nonparametric liftings, which derive the nonlinear functions by leveraging the uncertainty set structure and problem coefficients. Both methods integrate the benefits from lifting and nonparametric approaches, and hence provide scalable decision rules with performance bounds. More specifically, the set-driven lifting is constructed by finding polyhedrons within uncertainty sets, inducing piecewise-linear decision rules with performance bounds. The dynamics-driven lifting, on the other hand, is constructed by extracting geometric information and accounting for problem coefficients. This is achieved by using linear decision rules of the original problem, also enabling one to quantify lower bounds of objective improvements over linear decision rules. Numerical comparisons with competing methods demonstrate superior computational scalability and comparable performance in objectives. These observations are magnified in multistage problems with extended time horizons, suggesting practical applicability of the proposed nonparametric liftings in large-scale dynamic robust optimization.

To understand these shifts, we analyzed aggregated, anonymized metadata from over 360 billion emails within 4,361 organizations worldwide. By comparing month-to-month and year-over-year metrics, we examined changes in network community structures over the 24 months before and after COVID-19. We also examined shifts across multiple communication media (email, instant message, video call, and calendaring software) within a single global organization and compared them with communications shifts that were driven by changes in formal organizational structure. We found that in 2020, organizations around the world became more siloed than in 2019, evidenced by increased modularity. This shift was concurrent with decreased stability within silos. Collectively, our analyses indicate that following the onset of COVID-19, employees’ communications began to shift more dynamically between subcommunities (teams, workgroups, or functional areas). At the same time, once in a subcommunity, they limited their communication to other members of that community. We term these network changes dynamic silos .

  abstract     = {Approximate linear programs (ALPs) are well-known models based on value function approximations (VFAs) to obtain policies and lower bounds on the optimal policy cost of discounted-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs). Formulating an ALP requires (i) basis functions, the linear combination of which defines the VFA, and (ii) a state-relevance distribution, which determines the relative importance of different states in the ALP objective for the purpose of minimizing VFA error. Both of these choices are typically heuristic; basis function selection relies on domain knowledge, whereas the state-relevance distribution is specified using the frequency of states visited by a baseline policy. We propose a self-guided sequence of ALPs that embeds random basis functions obtained via inexpensive sampling and uses the known VFA from the previous iteration to guide VFA computation in the current iteration. In other words, this sequence takes multiple shots at randomly approximating the MDP value function with VFA-based guidance between consecutive approximation attempts. Self-guided ALPs mitigate domain knowledge during basis function selection and the impact of the state-relevance-distribution choice, thus reducing the ALP implementation burden. We establish high-probability error bounds on the VFAs from this sequence and show that a worst-case measure of policy performance is improved. We find that these favorable implementation and theoretical properties translate to encouraging numerical results on perishable inventory control and options pricing applications, where self-guided ALP policies improve upon policies from problem-specific methods. More broadly, our research takes a meaningful step toward application-agnostic policies and bounds for MDPs. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {Hedge fund managers contribute substantial personal capital, or “skin in the game,” into their funds. Although these allocations may better align incentives, managers may also strategically allocate their private capital in ways that negatively affect outside investors. We find that funds with more inside investment outperform other funds within the same family. This relationship is driven by managerial decisions to invest their own capital in their least-scalable strategies and restrict the entry of new outsider capital into these funds. Our results suggest that insider capital may work as a rent-extraction mechanism at the expense of fund participation of outside investors. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

  abstract     = {We investigate the welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination by a two-sided platform that enables interaction between buyers and sellers. Sellers are heterogeneous with respect to their per-interaction benefit, and, under price discrimination, the platform can condition its fee on sellers’ type. In a model with linear demand on each side, we show that price discrimination (i) increases participation on both sides, (ii) enhances total welfare, and (iii) may result in a strict Pareto improvement, with both seller types being better off than under uniform pricing. These results, which are in stark contrast to the traditional analysis of price discrimination, are driven by the existence of cross-group network effects. By improving the ability to monetize seller participation, price discrimination induces the platform to attract more buyers, which then increases seller participation. The Pareto improvement result means that even those sellers who pay a higher price under discrimination can be better off, because of the increased buyer participation.

  abstract     = {Online retailers are facing an increasing variety of product choices and diversified consumer decision journeys. To improve many operations decisions for online retailers, such as demand forecasting and inventory management and pricing, an important first step is to obtain an accurate estimate of the substitution patterns among a large number of products offered in the complex online environment. Classic choice models either do not account for these substitution patterns beyond what is reflected through observed product features or do so in a simplified way by making a priori assumptions. These shortcomings become particularly restrictive when the underlying substitution patterns get complex as the number of options increases. We provide a solution by developing a high-dimensional choice model that allows for flexible substitution patterns and easily scales up. We leverage consumer clickstream data and combine econometric and machine learning (graphical lasso, in particular) methods to learn the substitution patterns among a large number of products. We show our method offers more accurate demand forecasts in a wide range of synthetic scenarios when compared with classical models (e.g., the independent and identically distributed Probit model), reducing out-of-sample mean absolute percentage error by 10%–30%. Such performance improvement is further supported by observations from a real-world empirical setting. More importantly, our method excels in precisely recovering substitution patterns across products. Compared with benchmark models, it reduces the percentage deviation from the underlying elasticity matrix by approximately half. This precision serves as a critical input for enhancing business decisions such as assortment planning, inventory management, and pricing strategies.

  abstract     = {We study matching queues with abandonment. The simplest of these is the two-sided queue with servers on one side and customers on the other, both arriving dynamically over time and abandoning if not matched by the time their patience elapses. We identify nonasymptotic and universal scaling laws for the matching loss due to abandonment, which we refer to as the “cost of impatience.” The scaling laws characterize the way in which this cost depends on the arrival rates and the (possibly different) mean patience of servers and customers. Our characterization reveals four operating regimes identified by an operational measure of patience that brings together mean patience and utilization. The four regimes subsume the regimes that arise in asymptotic (heavy-traffic) approximations. The scaling laws, specialized to each regime, reveal the fundamental structure of the cost of impatience and show that its order of magnitude is fully determined by (i) a “winner-take-all” competition between customer impatience and utilization, and (ii) the ability to accumulate inventory on the server side. Practically important is that when servers are impatient, the cost of impatience is, up to an order of magnitude, given by an insightful expression where only the minimum of the two patience rates appears. Considering the trade-off between abandonment and capacity costs, we characterize the scaling of the optimal safety capacity as a function of costs, arrival rates, and patience parameters. We prove that the ability to hold inventory of servers means that the optimal safety capacity grows logarithmically in abandonment cost and, in turn, slower than the square-root growth in the single-sided queue.

  abstract     = {We propose a new optimization-based method for learning causal structures from observational data, a process known as causal discovery . Our method takes as input observational data over a set of variables and returns a graph in which causal relations are specified by directed edges. We consider a highly general search space that accommodates latent confounders and feedback cycles, which few extant methods do. We formulate the discovery problem as an integer program, and propose a solution technique that exploits the conditional independence structure in the data to identify promising edges for inclusion in the output graph. In the large-sample limit, our method recovers a graph that is (Markov) equivalent to the true data-generating graph. Computationally, our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art, and can solve in minutes instances that are intractable for alternative causal discovery methods. We leverage our method to develop a procedure for investigating the validity of an instrumental variable and demonstrate it on the influential quarter-of-birth and proximity-to-college instruments for estimating the returns to education. In particular, our procedure complements existing instrument tests by revealing the precise causal pathways that undermine instrument validity, highlighting the unique merits of the graphical perspective on causality.

  abstract     = {With soaring labor and logistics costs in developing countries, supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered Western firms to “reshore” some of their offshore operations (performed in-house or outsourced) for certain strategically important products or production processes from foreign countries to their home countries. Although reshoring can create more domestic jobs and reduce supply chain risks, the impact of various external and internal risks associated with reshoring on market reaction remains unclear. This observation motivates us first to conduct a text mining analysis, revealing four important types of reshoring risks inherent to (1) foreign currency fluctuation, (2) intellectual property (IP) protection, (3) reshoring types (in-house, insourced, or outsourcing-to-outsourcing (OTO)), and (4) reshoring location choice (Republican- versus Democrat-led states). We then examine how these risk factors help explain the variations in reshoring’s market valuation based on 281 reshoring initiatives of 132 publicly traded firms in the United States announced between 2009 and 2022. Our empirical analysis reveals that the market reacts more positively to a firm’s reshoring announcement when the firm reshores under a high-currency-fluctuation environment or from countries with weak IP protection. However, the market’s reaction is more negative when the firm’s reshoring announcement entails insourced reshoring operations or when the reshored location is a Democrat- rather than Republican-led state. We do not find a significant market reaction to OTO reshoring. This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

  abstract     = {Does online fundraising increase charitable giving? Using the Facebook advertising tool, we implemented a natural field experiment across Germany, randomly assigning almost 8,000 postal codes to Save the Children fundraising videos or to a pure control. We studied changes in the donation revenue and frequency for Save the Children and other charities by postal code. Our geo-randomized design circumvented many difficulties inherent in studies based on click-through data, especially substitution and measurement issues. We found that (i) video fundraising increased donation revenue and frequency to Save the Children during the campaign and in the subsequent five weeks, that (ii) the campaign was profitable for the fundraiser, and that (iii) the effects were similar independent of video content and impression assignment strategy. However, we also found some crowding out of donations to other similar charities or projects. Finally, we demonstrated that click data may be an inappropriate proxy for donations and recommend that managers use careful experimental designs that can plausibly evaluate the effects of advertising on relevant outcomes.

  abstract     = {Insider trading conveys insiders’ private information to outsiders. This private information potentially benefits rival firms, which may reduce the competitive advantage of the insiders’ firms. Using a composite proprietary cost measure, we find proprietary costs are negatively associated with insiders’ purchases, especially when their trades are more likely to be informative to rivals. Consistent with proprietary costs increasing the costs of insider purchases and, hence, the expected benefits required to trade, insiders earn significantly higher abnormal profits when proprietary costs are higher. Exploiting settings with exogenous and event-driven variation in proprietary costs, we find insiders significantly reduce their purchases when noncompete agreement enforceability is high and before new product launches. Moreover, firms with higher proprietary costs are more likely to impose window-based insider trading restrictions and insiders with greater equity holdings reduce their purchases more strongly in the presence of proprietary costs. Finally, we provide evidence of real effects of insider trading on rivals’ investment decisions. We find that investments are associated with insiders’ purchases at rival firms, and these associations are stronger when proprietary costs at rivals are higher. Our findings indicate insiders and firms are aware of potential proprietary costs when insiders trade on private information and respond accordingly.

Although innovation responds to incentives, ideas are a scarce resource that provides an exogenous constraint on the rate of innovation. We investigate how the optimal reward structure is shaped by the scarcity of ideas. Substitute ideas for innovation in the model arrive to random recipients at random times. By forgoing investment in a current idea, society preserves an option to invest in a better idea for the same market niche but with delay. Because successive ideas may occur to different people, there is a conflict between private and social optimality. The social planner does not observe the arrival of ideas and learns over time about the arrival rate of ideas. We represent the social planner’s beliefs using a general continuous density and illustrate that the evolution of beliefs can be tracked by the cumulative hazard function. The reward set by the social planner serves a dual purpose: learning about the arrival rate of ideas and trading off lower delays against lower-cost ideas. We show that the optimal reward increases as time passes because the social planner comes to view ideas as more scarce. This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.

  abstract     = {Despite evidence of the importance of sleep for cognitive performance, prior research finds limited effects of sleep disruptions on financial markets. This is puzzling because financial decisions rely on higher-order cognitive processes that are typically affected by sleep. We reconcile this dissonance by examining forecasts of corporate earnings by nonprofessional and professional forecasters. We find that nonprofessional forecasters exhibit a significant decline in their forecast accuracy following spring daylight saving time changes relative to professional forecasters. Using a separate sample of professional equity analysts’ forecasts, we continue to find that the information processing of analysts with less expertise is disproportionately negatively affected following sleep disruptions. Placebo tests provide support for sleep disruptions as the main driver of these effects. Overall, our evidence that information processing by less experienced and skilled market participants is particularly vulnerable to sleep disruptions provides one compelling reason why aggregate financial markets seem to be immune to sleep effects even though individual participants are not.

  abstract     = {Relationships with peers help entrepreneurs learn and improve firm performance. Recent scholarship confirms that events—social gatherings such as mixers, conferences, or training programs—can help entrepreneurs build valuable social connections. Yet, for entrepreneurs in developing economies, networking frictions may make connecting with peers challenging and undermine the benefits of events. We argue that when networking frictions are high, the value of events will lie more in connecting neighbors rather than bringing together distant peers. In the presence of networking frictions, neighbors are both less likely to be someone the entrepreneur has already learned from and easier to sustain a relationship with. To test this argument, we use data from a series of networking events in Togo during which entrepreneurs were randomly assigned to meet with peers from across the city of Lomé. We find that entrepreneurs who were assigned to neighboring peers were much more likely to sustain a relationship, learn from their peer’s management knowledge, and in turn benefit more: Profits increase by 10% when entrepreneurs get to know peers who are located on average 1 km closer to them. Our results highlight the central role that networking frictions play in shaping who entrepreneurs in developing economies can successfully learn from.

This estimation is complicated by challenges in determining how to compensate consumers monetarily to ensure they will maintain the same level of utility they would have obtained had stockouts not occurred. This paper presents an analysis of these compensation costs as applied to the design of optimal stockout rates by an online retailer marketing to consumers aesthetically substandard fruits and vegetables rejected by mainstream grocery chains. Because growers face high uncertainty in their harvesting conditions and in the aesthetic quality of their crops and there are little data on hand to predict the value consumers attach to the availability of subpar produce, it is difficult to optimally match the supply of these products with consumers’ demand. Our analysis draws from a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) choice model to calculate consumer compensations that the retailer can use to estimate the opportunity costs of stockouts to manage its inventory. We show that not taking into account these compensation costs could unduly inflate the optimal stockout rates for these products. Armed with these compensation cost estimates, we show how these costs can serve as incentives for retailers to source greater inventory amounts of imperfect produce from growers and how this will ultimately translate into less waste in the supply chain.

  abstract     = {Left unable to provide service during the COVID-19 pandemic, many small businesses have experimented with alternative ways of generating income. One approach that has gained traction is the use of advance selling, whereby the firm asks consumers in its local community to support the business by paying in advance for consumption at a future date. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to investigate whether and how advance selling schemes can be successfully implemented by firms facing financial distress. In cases of high distress (i.e., where obtaining bank financing is infeasible given the firm’s financial need), we show that advance selling in its classic implementation can help the firm secure its survival in some scenarios but may suffer from significant inefficiencies associated with strategic consumer behavior and firm moral hazard. We demonstrate that two modifications of the classic scheme currently observed in practice—namely, (i) the introduction of an “all-or-nothing” clause and (ii) selling future discount coupons as opposed to the full service—can expand the set of scenarios in which survival is ensured while also allowing the firm to extract higher profit. In cases of moderate financial distress (i.e., where bank financing is a feasible but inefficient option), we find that simple advance selling schemes typically fail to make an impact. However, we show that a more complex scheme, combining both of the aforementioned modifications simultaneously, can be used in conjunction with bank financing to generate a substantial improvement in firm profit.

  abstract     = {We examine team diversity and performance in the asset management industry through the lens of identity. Focusing on political ideology as the relevant dimension of identity, we find that diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams. The mechanism involves both improved decision making due to more diverse perspectives and increased monitoring by heterogeneous team members. The benefits of ideological diversity are undone when political polarization is higher, consistent with increased intrateam conflict. In examining why less diverse teams are prevalent in asset management, we find entrenched managers prefer homogeneous teams, and the local labor market supply of ideologically diverse managers is constrained.

  abstract     = {In many settings, a person’s outcome depends not only on her own behavior, but also on her counterpart’s. Such strategic decisions have traditionally been studied using normative game theory, which assumes that people adopt equilibrium strategies and will reach the same decision, regardless of how the problem is described (framed). We examine a potentially important type of framing effect—focusing on how the relationship between players’ actions generates joint outcomes. Any strategic interaction can be described by either spelling out the outcomes of all possible action combinations (which we call “outcome framing,” or simply “O-framing”) or describing what will happen if different players choose the same action or choose different actions (which we call “relation framing,” or simply “R-framing”). O-framing has been the typical way to describe a strategic problem in prior work, whereas R-framing is commonly employed in real-life communications. We propose that these functionally equivalent frames induce different psychological processes and lead to different decisions: Relative to O-framing, R-framing increases players’ beliefs about their counterparts’ likelihood of coordinating on a cooperative option. We demonstrate this effect in the context of classic games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Stag Hunt. We find that, compared with O-framing, R-framing significantly increases people’s likelihood to choose the action that maximizes collective benefits rather than individual interests, and it does so by increasing beliefs that one’s partner will choose the same action as well. We derive conditions when this effect is likely to emerge and discuss the managerial implications of this research.

  abstract     = {Competition between firms that sell incompatible varieties of network products can be fierce because it is important for each of them to attract a large number of users. The literature, therefore, predicts that stronger network effects decrease prices and profits. We show that this prediction hinges critically on an implicit or explicit assumption that each consumer buys only one of the varieties available in the market (singlehoming consumers). We show that multihoming (some consumers buying more than one variety) can arise endogenously if the number of exclusive features that each variety offers is sufficiently large. In sharp contrast to the conventional prediction under consumer singlehoming, we further show that both prices and profits can increase with the strength of the network effects if (some) consumers multihome. However, this does not necessarily imply that profits are higher under multihoming than under singlehoming. On the contrary, multihoming can constitute a prisoner’s dilemma for the firms in the sense that they could make higher profits if each consumer bought only one of the varieties.

  abstract     = {The value of a firm’s service lies both in its workers and its relationship with clients. In this paper, we study the interaction between the client-specific experience accumulated by workers, poaching behaviour from clients, and strategic rotation of workers by firms. Using detailed personnel data from a security service firm, we show that an increase in client-specific experience increases both the productivity of workers and their probability of being poached. The firm reacts to this risk by rotating workers across multiple clients, and more frequently so for those workers more likely to be poached. Furthermore, we find that after a policy change that prohibited poaching, the firm sharply decreased the frequency of rotation, which in turn increased workers’ productivity. We propose a theoretical model that guides the empirical patterns and allows us to argue their external validity beyond our specific empirical setting. Finally, we provide survey evidence from the security service sector, demonstrating the consistency between our findings and industry observations.

  abstract     = {We investigate the optimal clearing policy for a financial payment system composed of a number of member banks and a central bank in a dynamic setting, when new payment obligations or debts between member banks are generated over time. The central bank clears the debts among members in the system in order to minimize the costs, including the setup cost of each clearing, the variable cost of clearing the net debts, and the liquidity cost of uncleared debts. We formulate the problem using dynamic programming via state space reduction that provides a tractable framework to analyze and compute the optimal policy. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and show that it is optimal for the central bank either to clear all the debts in the system or not to clear at all in each period under mild conditions. This structure leads to efficient computation of the optimal clearing policy. We further characterize the optimal clearing frequency based upon the deterministic approximation for the debt process. We conduct a comprehensive case study based on the data acquired from our industry partner, Payments Canada, to demonstrate the performance of the policy and its feasibility in industrial-size problems.

  abstract     = {Transition probability density functions (TPDFs) are fundamental to computational finance, including option pricing and hedging. Advancing recent work in deep learning, we develop novel neural TPDF generators through solving backward Kolmogorov equations in parametric space for cumulative probability functions. The generators are ultra-fast, very accurate and can be trained for any asset model described by stochastic differential equations. These are “single solve,” so they do not require retraining when parameters of the stochastic model are changed (e.g., recalibration of volatility). Once trained, the neural TDPF generators can be transferred to less powerful computers where they can be used for e.g. option pricing at speeds as fast as if the TPDF were known in a closed form. We illustrate the computational efficiency of the proposed neural approximations of TPDFs by inserting them into numerical option pricing methods. We demonstrate a wide range of applications including the Black-Scholes-Merton model, the standard Heston model, the SABR model, and jump-diffusion models. These numerical experiments confirm the ultra-fast speed and high accuracy of the developed neural TPDF generators. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance. Funding: H.

  abstract     = {Using data on 10,776 firms across 22 emerging markets, we show that both credit constraints and weak green management hold back corporate investment in green technologies embodied in new machinery, equipment, and vehicles. In contrast, investment in measures to explicitly reduce emissions and other pollution is mainly determined by the quality of a firm’s green management and less so by binding credit constraints. Data from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register reveal the environmental impact of these organizational constraints. In areas where more firms are credit constrained and weakly managed, industrial facilities systematically emit more CO 2 and pollutants. A counterfactual analysis shows that credit constraints and weak management have respectively kept CO 2 emissions 4.5% and 2.3% above the levels that would have prevailed without such constraints. This is further corroborated by our finding that in localities where banks had to deleverage more due to the global financial crisis, carbon emissions by industrial facilities remained 5.6% higher a decade later.

Shocks in the demand for sustainable investing represent a novel risk source, characterized by diminishing marginal utility and positive premium. Green assets exhibit positive exposure to ESG demand shocks, hence commanding higher premia. Conversely, time-varying convenience yield leads to lower expected returns for green assets. Moreover, ESG demand shocks have positive contemporaneous effects on unexpected returns, contributing to large positive payoffs in the green-minus-brown portfolio over extended horizons. The model predictions align closely with evidence on return spreads between green and brown assets, further reinforcing the apparent gap between realized and expected spreads.

Based on evidence from an online experiment with 8,673 participants, we demonstrate that well-designed unit donation schemes can significantly boost giving above and beyond the standard money donation scheme. A decomposition of the underlying mechanisms shows patterns consistent with the conjecture that unit donations increase impact salience and leverage donors’ cognitive biases by changing the metric of the donation space.

Using unique and comprehensive House Provident Fund and home purchases data between 2006 and 2013 in a large Chinese city, we reach three conclusions. First, an average official’s unofficial income is 83% of her official income; this percentage increases sharply with the official’s rank. Second, about 13% of the officials have an unofficial income, and the proportion also increases with rank. Third, government officials are not underpaid, and their unofficial incomes are not compensation for low government salaries. Additionally, evidence suggests that unofficial incomes have declined since the recent anticorruption campaign. An analysis of a separate crosscity data set corroborates the key conclusion.

  abstract     = {The secretary problem is probably the most well-studied optimal stopping problem with many applications in economics and management. In the secretary problem, a decision maker faces an unknown sequence of values, revealed successively, and has to make irrevocable take-it-or-leave-it decisions. Her goal is to select the maximum value in the sequence. Although in the classic secretary problem the values of upcoming elements are entirely unknown, in many realistic situations, the decision maker has access to some information, for example, from past data. In this paper, we take a sampling approach and assume that before starting the sequence, each element is sampled independently with probability p . We study both the adversarial and the random arrival models. Our main result is to obtain the best possible algorithms for both settings and all values of p . As p grows to one, the obtained guarantees converge to the optimal guarantees in the full information case. Notably, we establish that the best possible algorithm in the adversarial order setting is a fixed threshold algorithm. In the random order setting, we characterize the best possible algorithm by a sequence of thresholds, dictating at which point in time we should accept a value. Surprisingly, this sequence is independent of p . We complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments on data of people playing the secretary problem repeatedly. Our results help explain some behavioral issues they raised and indicate that people play a strategy similar to our optimal algorithms from the start onwards, albeit slightly suboptimally.

  abstract     = {Many consumers across the world struggle to gain access to credit because of their lack of credit scores. This paper explores the potential of a new alternative data source, grocery transaction data, for evaluating consumers’ creditworthiness. Our analysis takes advantage of a unique, individual-level match of credit card data and supermarket loyalty card data. By developing credit scoring algorithms that either exclude or include grocery data, we illustrate both the incremental value of grocery data for credit decisions and its boundary conditions. We demonstrate that signals from grocery data can improve credit approval decisions, particularly for individuals who lack traditional credit scores. Furthermore, as a consumer establishes a relationship with lenders and builds a credit history, the marginal value of incorporating grocery data diminishes. These findings highlight the potential of grocery data in informing credit decisions and, consequently, in enabling financial institutions to extend credit to consumers who lack traditional credit scores.

  abstract     = {Data analytics enable firms to offer personalized prices to targeted consumers but at a cost. We study a competitive personalized pricing game where the entrant is uncertain about the incumbent’s targeting cost. We demonstrate that implementing personalized pricing through a “list price-discount” scheme allows the incumbent to signal its targeting cost via the list price. This signaling mechanism is effective because the list price serves as a price ceiling, which limits the incumbent’s ability to extract consumer surplus through personalized discounts. The high-cost incumbent can strategically set its list price below the full-information level to separate itself from the low-cost incumbent. Interestingly, the high-cost incumbent prefers separating over pooling only when there is a moderate variation in the incumbents’ targeting costs. Personalized pricing can affect firms differently, benefiting the incumbent but hurting the entrant. Asymmetric information about targeting costs weakens the high-cost incumbent’s incentive to offer personalized discounts, resulting in lower total targeting costs and potentially increasing social surplus. These findings shed light on government regulations and transparency policies regarding personalized pricing. This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing. Funding: P.

  abstract     = {One measure of the ex ante cost of disasters is the welfare gain from shortening their expected duration. We introduce a stochastic clock into a standard disaster model that summarizes information about progress (positive or negative) toward disaster resolution. We show that the stock market response to duration news is essentially a sufficient statistic to identify the welfare gain to interventions that alter the state. Using information on clinical trial progress during 2020, we build contemporaneous forecasts of the time to vaccine deployment, which provide a measure of the anticipated length of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model can thus be calibrated from market reactions to vaccine news, which we estimate. The estimates imply that ending the pandemic would have been worth from 5% to 15% of total wealth as the expected duration varied in this period. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we pursue a correlation-robust study of the influence maximization problem. Departing from the classic independent cascade model, we study a diffusion process adversarially adapted to the choice of seed set. More precisely, rather than the independent coupling of known individual edge probabilities, we now evaluate a seed set’s expected influence under all possible correlations, specifically, the one that presents the worst case. We find that the worst case expected influence can be efficiently computed, its NP-hard optimization done approximately ( 1 − 1 / e ) with greedy construction, and we provide complete, efficient characterizations of the adversarial coupling, the random graph, and the random number of influenced nodes. But, most importantly, upon mixing the independent cascade with the worst case, we attain a tunable and more comprehensive model better suited for real-world diffusion phenomena than the independent cascade alone and without increased computational complexity. Extensions to the correlation-robust study of risk follow along with numerical experiments on network data sets with demonstration of how our models can be tuned.

  abstract     = {We investigate the extent to which trade-offs involving the sharing of personal information exhibit consistency with an underlying rational preference for privacy. In an experiment, people engage in trade-offs across two domains of personal information sharing, allowing us to classify whether their choices satisfy the generalized axiom of revealed preference. They also subsequently price the sharing of their personal information. Sixty-three percent of subjects act consistently with a rational preference ordering when allocating privacy levels, a level comparable to that observed in other domains. Individuals who are inconsistent when engaging in simple privacy trade-offs exhibit substantially more costly preference reversals when pricing personal information sharing. Only one-third of subjects exhibit consistency across both the selection of personal information to share and the pricing of such information sharing. Our results imply that monetizing personal information can have distinct welfare consequences for people with different degrees of rationality in their underlying ability to make sensible trade-offs involving personal information. We also provide evidence that preferences elicited over choices in our experiment correlate with real-world privacy behaviors.

  abstract     = {In customer support contact centers, every service interaction involves a messaging dialogue between a customer and an agent; together, they exchange information, solve problems, and collectively co-produce the service. Because the service progression is shaped by the history of conversation thus far, we propose a bivariate marked Hawkes process cluster model of the customer-agent interaction. To evaluate our stochastic model of service, we apply it to an industry contact center data set containing nearly 5 million messages. Through both a novel residual analysis comparison and several Monte Carlo goodness-of-fit tests, we show that the Hawkes cluster model indeed captures dynamics at the heart of the service and surpasses classic models that do not incorporate the service history. Furthermore, in an entirely data-driven simulation, we demonstrate how this history-dependent model can be leveraged operationally to inform a prediction-based routing policy. We show that widely used and well-studied customer routing policies can be outperformed with simple modifications according to the Hawkes model. Through analysis of a stylized model proposed in the contact center literature, we prove that service heterogeneity can cause this underperformance and, moreover, that such heterogeneity will occur if service closures are not carefully managed.

Although investment in skill is always optimal, it does not take place in some states of the world, due to moral hazard. In intermediate states of the world, individuals acquire skill; however outside investors and individuals inefficiently share risk. We show that this simple moral hazard problem, combined with risk aversion of individuals and outside investors, amplifies the equity premium, lowers the risk-free rate, and leads to disaster states that fall especially heavily on some agents but not on others.

  abstract     = {In the mobile video games industry, a common in-app purchase is for additional “moves” or “time” in single-player puzzle games. We call these in-app purchases bonus actions . In some games, bonus actions can only be purchased in advance of attempting a level of the game (pure advance sales (PAS)), yet in other games, bonus actions can only be purchased in a “spot” market that appears when an initial attempt to pass the level fails (pure spot sales). Some games offer both advance and spot purchases (hybrid advance sales). This paper studies these selling strategies for bonus actions in video games. Such a question is novel to in-app tools selling in video games, and it cannot be answered by previous advance selling studies focusing on end goods. We model the selling of bonus actions as a stochastic extensive form game. We show how the distribution of skill among players (i.e., their inherent ability to pass the level) and the inherent randomness of the game influence selling strategies. For casual games, where low-skill players have a sufficiently high probability of success in each attempt, if the proportion of high-skill players is either sufficiently large or sufficiently small, firms should adopt PAS and shut down the “spot” market.

  abstract     = {Tele-driving refers to a novel concept by which drivers can remotely operate vehicles (without being physically in the vehicle). By putting the human back in the loop, tele-driving has emerged recently as a more viable alternative to fully automated vehicles with ride-hailing (and other on-demand transportation-enabled services) being an important application. Because remote drivers can be operated as a shared resource (any driver can be assigned to any customer regardless of trip origin or destination), it may be possible for such services to deploy fewer drivers than vehicles without significantly reducing service quality. In this paper, we examine the extent to which this is possible. Using a spatial queueing model that captures the dynamics of both pickup and trip times, we show that the impact of reducing the number of drivers depends crucially on system workload relative to the number of vehicles. In particular, when workload is sufficiently high relative to the number of vehicles, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, reducing the number of drivers relative to the number of vehicles can actually improve service level (e.g., as measured by the amount of demand fulfilled in the case of impatient customers). Having fewer drivers than vehicles ensures that there are always idle vehicles; the fewer the drivers, the likelier it is for there to be more idle vehicles. Consequently, the fewer the drivers, the likelier it is for the pickup times to be shorter (making overall shorter service times likelier). The impact of shorter service time is particularly significant when the workload is high, and in this case, it is enough to overcome the loss in driver capacity. When workload is sufficiently low relative to the number of vehicles, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of drivers without significantly reducing service level. In systems in which customers are patient and willing to queue up for the service, we show that reducing the number of drivers can also reduce delay, including stabilizing a system that may otherwise be unstable. In general, relative to a system in which the number of vehicles equals the number of drivers (as in a system with in-vehicle drivers), a system with remote drivers can result in savings in the number of drivers either without significantly degrading performance or actually improving performance. We discuss how these results can, in part, be explained by the interplay of two counteracting forces: (1) having fewer drivers increasing service rate and (2) having fewer drivers reducing the number of servers with the relative strength of these forces depending on system workload.

  abstract     = {A principal often needs to match agents to perform coordinated tasks, but agents can quit or slack off if they dislike their match. We study two prevalent approaches for matching within organizations: centralized assignment by firm leaders and self-organization through market-like mechanisms. We provide a formal model of the strengths and weaknesses of both methods under different settings, incentives, and production technologies. The model highlights trade-offs between match-specific productivity and job satisfaction. We then measure these trade-offs with data from a large organization’s internal talent market. Firm-dictated matches are 33% more valuable than randomly assigned matches within job categories (using the firm’s preferred metric of quality). By contrast, preference-based matches (using deferred acceptance) are only 5% better than random but are ranked (on average) about 38 percentiles higher by the workforce. The self-organized match is positively assortative and helps workers grow new skills; the firm’s preferred match is negatively assortative and harvests existing expertise.

  abstract     = {The topic of related diversification is of fundamental interest to corporate strategy research. However, the understanding of how the potential for resource redeployment might encourage related diversification is limited. This paper explores the impact of the 2006 German real estate transfer tax (RETT) reform, which led to higher RETT rates but retained the exemption from RETT for corporate restructurings. We propose that firms might have reacted strategically to the threat of higher transfer taxes by combining related businesses into a portfolio, providing an efficient internal market for reallocating property assets in the event of business-specific shocks. Consistent with a dynamic perspective on relatedness, difference-in-differences analyses of the European retail market show that the probability of related diversification increased significantly for firms that were affected by the reform, relative to control firms. This finding contributes to the literature that links firm boundary choices to intertemporal economies of scope and offers new insights into the real effects of transfer tax policies.

  abstract     = {We develop the operational data analytics (ODA) framework for the classical service design problem of G / G / c / k systems. The customer arrival rate is unknown. Instead, some historical data of interarrival times are collected. The data-integration model, specifying the mapping from the arrival data to the service rate, is formulated based on the time-scaling property of the stochastic service process. Validating the data-integration model against the long-run average service reward leads to a uniformly optimal service rate for any given sample size. We further derive the ODA-predicted reward function based on the data-integration model, which gives a consistent estimate of the underlying reward function. Our numerical experiments show that the ODA framework can lead to an efficient design of service rate and service capacity, which is insensitive to model specification. The ODA solution exhibits superior performance compared with the conventional estimation-and-then-optimization solutions in the small sample regime.

We investigate whether such community leadership leads to (causal) improvements in individuals’ careers. We assemble a data set, including job histories of IT professionals who have sought election as moderators (mods) in Stack Exchange question-and-answer communities, between 2010 and 2020. We estimate the career benefits of moderatorship under two complementary identification strategies: difference-in-differences (DID) and regression discontinuity (RD). We observe qualitatively consistent results under each design, finding that election to a moderator role has a significant, causal, positive effect on job mobility. We estimate that moderatorship increases the probability of a job change by between 4.7 and 12.3 percentage points over the two years following the election. We also report a series of secondary analyses that speak to associated salary increases and show evidence consistent with the notion that social capital and signaling play a role.

  abstract     = {We examine the role of AI analytics in facilitating innovation in firms that have gone through IPO. Using patent data on over 1,000 publicly traded firms, we find that firms acquiring AI analytics capability post-IPO experience less of a decline in innovation quality compared with similar firms that have not acquired that capability. This effect is greater when only machine learning capabilities are considered. Moreover, we find this sustained rate of innovation is driven principally by the continued development of innovations that combine existing technologies into new ones—a form of innovation that is especially well supported by analytics. By examining three main mechanisms that hampered post-IPO innovation, we find that AI analytics can ameliorate the pressure to meet short-term financial goals and disclosure requirements. However, it has limited effect in addressing managerial incentives. For firms with long product cycles, the disclosure effect is reduced to a greater extent than it is for those with short cycles. Overall, our results show the importance of examining technology as a critical input factor in innovation. We show that the increased deployment of AI analytics may reduce some of the innovative penalties suffered by IPOs and that investors and managers can potentially mitigate post-IPO reductions in innovative output by directing capital acquired in the IPO process to the acquisition of AI analytics capabilities.

  abstract     = {Online retail settings often present shoppers with large, complex choice sets where they need to quickly and dynamically weigh the benefits and costs of search within each web page. We build a model of information search within a web page using eye-tracking data collected during two incentive-compatible online shopping experiments, in which participants browsed the websites of two different clothing retailers (Experiments 1 and 2), as well as previously reported data from a laboratory experiment involving choices among snack food assortments (Experiment 3). Our model incorporates features that build upon recent advances in descriptive and normative models of information sampling and search in psychology and economics. First, our model captures how people decide where to look by treating eye fixations on clickable options as a series of “split-second” decisions that depend on estimates of option attractiveness and navigation effort. Second, our model assumes that the value of each option is learned via Bayesian updating. Third, the choice to end search on the web page depends on a dynamic decision threshold. Our model outperforms benchmarks that assume random search, instant learning, fixed thresholds, nonheterogeneous thresholds, and stochastic accumulator stopping rules. Explicitly modeling the sequence of eye fixation decisions results in accurate counterfactual simulations of the effects of hypothetical product orderings on search duration and quality as verified using experimental manipulation, and it can be applied flexibly to a wide range of web-page layouts. Systematic differences across experiments highlight the importance of accounting for product familiarity, choice-set size, and the role of category outside options.

  abstract     = {We study the market consequences of advances in consumption tracking technologies—such as mobile banking apps that help consumers monitor their spending and avoid overdrawn accounts—using a two-period consumption model. In the model, consumers pay a penalty fee if they consume in both periods. In the second period, consumers may be forgetful of their first-period consumption, although the use of consumption tracking can remind them. According to our analysis, the availability of consumption tracking often helps consumers at the expense of the firm; such benefits may be direct , where consumers make use of the technology to avoid penalty fees, or indirect , where the mere availability of consumption tracking forces the firm to lower its penalty fee. If consumers are partially sophisticated regarding their forgetfulness, however, the availability of consumption tracking may instill a false sense of security in that consumers expect to use consumption tracking to avoid penalty fees but ultimately, decide not to bother, making them especially susceptible to penalty fees. In some cases, the availability of consumption tracking may actually compel a firm to impose a penalty fee that would not otherwise be viable, leading to higher profits and lower consumer surplus. As we show, this scenario is attained within an intermediate range of forgetfulness and at a level of (partial) sophistication for which consumers overestimate their demand for the technology.

We show that foreign lenders and low market share lenders extend more credit in comparison with other lenders during lending booms leading to banking crises but not during other credit expansions. These less established lenders also shorten loan maturity and increase the amount of credit they extend to riskier borrowers without asking for collateral or imposing covenants and higher interest rates.

  abstract     = {Consensus analyst target prices are widely available online at no cost to investors. In this paper, we examine how the amount of dispersion in the individual target prices comprising the consensus affects the predictive association between the consensus target price and future returns. We find that returns implied by consensus target prices and realized future returns are positively correlated when dispersion is low, but they become highly negatively correlated when dispersion is high. Further analyses suggest that the differing effect of dispersion stems from incentive-driven staleness in price targets by some analysts after bad news. As a stock performs poorly and some analysts are slow to update their target prices, dispersion increases, and the consensus target price becomes too high. This has important implications for how consensus analyst target prices should inform investment decisions. We show that a hedge strategy taking a long (short) position in stocks with the highest predicted returns among stocks with the lowest (highest) dispersion earns more than 11% annually.

  abstract     = {Descriptive norms, the behavior of other individuals in one’s reference group, play a key role in shaping individual decisions in managerial contexts and beyond. Organizations are increasingly using information about descriptive norms to nudge positive behavior change. When characterizing peer decisions, a standard approach in the literature is to focus on average behavior. In this paper, we argue both theoretically and empirically that not only averages but also the shape of the whole distribution of behavior can play a crucial role in how people react to descriptive norms. Using a representative sample of the U.S. population, we experimentally investigate how individuals react to strategic environments that are characterized by different distributions of behavior, focusing on the distinction between tight (i.e., characterized by low behavioral variance), loose (i.e., characterized by high behavioral variance), and polarized (i.e., characterized by u-shaped behavior) environments. We find that individuals indeed strongly respond to differences in the variance and shape of the descriptive norm they are facing: Loose norms generate greater behavioral variance and polarization generates polarized responses. In polarized environments, most individuals prefer extreme actions, which expose them to considerable strategic risk, to intermediate actions that minimize such risk. Furthermore, in polarized and loose environments, personal traits and values play a larger role in determining actual behavior. These nuances of how individuals react to different types of descriptive norms have important implications for company culture, productivity, and organizational effectiveness alike.

  abstract     = {Although much attention is accorded to star performers, this paper considers the extent to which stars, themselves, benefit from the contribution of their collaborators (the constellation). By considering stars, constellations, and the synergies between them, we address a key question: To what extent is collaboration performance driven by the great individual or by great constellations? We introduce a novel approach that uses a matching model to uncover the complementarities driving collaboration formation. We use formal value-capture theory to estimate the relative contribution of stars and constellations to joint value creation. Analyzing a sample of academic research collaborations, we document that stars’ relative contribution exceeds that of their constellations in less than 15% of collaborations, although constellations provide a greater relative contribution in 9%. In most collaborations, neither party dominates: Innovation is a collective endeavor driven equally by the star and the constellation. Joint value creation and relative contribution are explained by the subtle interplay between complementarities in joint work and the substitutability of collaborative parties in the market. Joint value creation increases with the strength of complementarities between parties in a match. Relative value creation, and hence dominance, increases with the substitutability of one’s collaborative partner. Interestingly, joint value creation is greatest in collaborations where both stars and constellations offer bundles of rare attributes and where neither the star nor the constellation dominates.

  abstract     = {Unlike issuer-paid credit rating agencies (CRAs), investor-paid CRAs are compensated by investors for providing rating services. Exploiting the staggered timing of rating initiation by an investor-paid rating agency (the Egan Jones Ratings (EJR)), I document that the coverage by EJR increases rated firm managers’ voluntary disclosure of negative news. Consistent with EJR’s rating coverage deterring managerial bad news hoarding by informing investors of downside risks, I find that the effect of EJR coverage is more pronounced when issuer-paid CRAs tend to assign inflated ratings and when rated firms’ managers have a stronger incentive to conceal bad news. I also document that firms unwind upward earnings management after being covered by EJR. In contrast, coverage by an issuer-paid CRA (Standard & Poor’s) is not associated with changes in managerial information disclosure. I conclude that investor-paid CRAs function as a type of effective information intermediary to discipline firm managers and improve corporate transparency.

  abstract     = {Determining emergency department (ED) nurse staffing decisions to balance quality of service and staffing costs can be extremely challenging, especially when there is a high level of uncertainty in patient demand. Increasing data availability and continuing advancements in predictive analytics provide an opportunity to mitigate demand uncertainty by using demand forecasts. In this work, we study a two-stage prediction-driven staffing framework where the prediction models are integrated with the base (made weeks in advance) and surge (made nearly real-time) nurse staffing decisions in the ED. We quantify the benefit of having the ability to use the more expensive surge staffing and identify the importance of balancing demand uncertainty versus system stochasticity. We also propose a near-optimal two-stage staffing policy that is straightforward to interpret and implement. Last, we develop a unified framework that combines parameter estimation, real-time demand forecasts, and nurse staffing in the ED. High-fidelity simulation experiments for the ED demonstrate that the proposed framework has the potential to reduce annual staffing costs by 10%–16% ($2 M–$3 M) while guaranteeing timely access to care.

  abstract     = {Scientific conferences are an underexplored channel by which firms can learn from science. We provide empirical evidence that firms learn from scientific conferences in which they participate but also that this is conditional on intense participation. Using data from conference papers in computer science since the 1990s, we show that corporate investments in participation are both frequent and highly skewed, with some firms contributing to a given conference scientifically, some as sponsors, and some doing both. We use direct flights as an instrumental variable for the probability that other scientists participate in the same conference as a firm, altering the knowledge set to which the firm is exposed. We find that a firm’s use of scientists’ knowledge increases when they participate in the same conferences. Greater participation efforts, where the firm seeks the spotlight by both sponsoring the conference and contributing to its scientific discourse, foretell research collaborations and a stronger learning effect. Such learning is disproportionately concentrated among the most prominent firms and scientists rather than benefitting those without alternative interaction channels. Therefore, on average, firms learn from scientists that they encounter at conferences, but the substantial heterogeneity of the effect reflects the influence of reputation mechanisms in social interactions.

Prior research documents that aggregate advertising is positively associated with firm sales and brand values, but it fails to consider major recent shifts in advertising from traditional channels (such as TV) to digital advertising (such as paid search and online display). Using proprietary data, I decompose advertising expenditures into the categories of traditional, online display, and paid search. Consistent with expectations, results confirm that target firms’ traditional and online display advertising exhibit a higher likelihood of brand asset recognition and higher recognized brand values as compared with paid search advertising. Confirming the economic substance of the recognized brands, additional results reveal positive investor equity market reactions to brand value, which are driven by firms investing more in traditional and online display advertising. Overall, these results confirm that certain advertising channels exhibit stronger associations with the recognition and characteristics of the underlying brand asset, consistent with their heterogeneous properties.

If not, how large is the gap to a benchmark condition where CBBE is financially fully leveraged? Which market strategies, if any, should the firm emphasize to close the gap? This research addresses these questions. The authors introduce a framework and methodology that enables firms to identify and measure their “brand capabilities gap,” which captures the firm’s potential for leveraging CBBE into firm value when the most effective and efficient brand leverage strategy is in place, and, if necessary, take corrective action to realize their brand leverage potential. The authors further examine three market strategy moderators that firms can steer via their marketing programs and tactics to close the brand capabilities gap. The application of the framework and methodology to a wide-ranging sample of firms from 2005 to 2013 reveals that, on average, firms only realize 35% of their financial brand leverage potential. This translates into an average brand capabilities gap worth $2.1 bn per brand, which represents 4.3% of firm value. These findings have important implications for strategic brand analysis and planning and can help firms design a more effective financial brand leverage strategy.

  abstract     = {We consider a finite-horizon multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem in a Bayesian setting, for which we propose an information relaxation sampling framework. With this framework, we define an intuitive family of control policies that include Thompson sampling (TS) and the Bayesian optimal policy as endpoints. Analogous to TS, which at each decision epoch pulls an arm that is best with respect to the randomly sampled parameters, our algorithms sample entire future reward realizations and take the corresponding best action. However, this is done in the presence of “penalties” that seek to compensate for the availability of future information. We develop several novel policies and performance bounds for MAB problems that vary in terms of improving performance and increasing computational complexity between the two endpoints. Our policies can be viewed as natural generalizations of TS that simultaneously incorporate knowledge of the time horizon and explicitly consider the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We prove associated structural results on performance bounds and suboptimality gaps. Numerical experiments suggest that this new class of policies perform well, in particular, in settings where the finite time horizon introduces significant exploration-exploitation tension into the problem. Finally, inspired by the finite-horizon Gittins index, we propose an index policy that builds on our framework that particularly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in our numerical experiments.

We first assess how bank regulatory reforms that improved credit conditions, for example, by enhancing the efficiency of credit allocation and lowering lending rates, impacted mental health. We discover that among low-income individuals, these regulatory reforms reduced mental depression, boosted labor market outcomes, eased access to mortgage debt, and reduced the ranks of the “unbanked.” We also find that mergers of large regional banks that led to branch closures and tighter credit constraints in affected counties harmed the mental health of lower-income individuals in treated counties.

  abstract     = {We build a benchmark for AAA-rated tranches of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) using business development companies (BDCs), which hold a diversified portfolio of loans as CLOs do. BDCs are publicly listed, and their share price, equity volatility, and borrowing cost can be easily obtained. Applying a structural model to BDCs, we extract market-implied correlation in their loan portfolio, compare spreads on CLO tranches and BDC-implied benchmark, and find that observed large credit spreads on CLO senior tranches after the financial crisis are a fair reflection of the systematic risk of correlated loan defaults.

  abstract     = {Industry 4.0 integrates digital and physical technologies to transform work management, where two core enablers are the internet of things (IoT) and three-dimensional printing (3DP). IoT monitors complex systems in real time, whereas 3DP enables agile manufacturing that can respond to real-time information. However, the details of how these two can be integrated are not yet clear. To gain insights, we consider a scenario where a three-dimensional (3D) printer supplies a critical part to multiple machines that are embedded with sensors and connected through IoT. Although the public perception indicates that this integration would enable on-demand printing, our research suggests that this is not necessarily the case. Instead, the true benefit is the ability to print predictively. In particular, it is typically more effective for the 3D printer to predictively print to stock based on a threshold that depends on the system’s status. We also identify a printing mode called predictive print on demand that allows for minimal inventory, and we find the speed of 3DP to be the primary factor that influences its optimality. Furthermore, we assess the value of IoT in cost reductions by separately analyzing the impact of advance information from embedded sensors and the real-time information fusion through IoT. We find that IoT provides significant value in general. However, the conventional wisdom that IoT’s value scales up for larger systems is suitable only when the expansion is paired with appropriate 3DP capacity. Our framework can help inform investment decisions regarding IoT/embedded sensors and support the development of scheduling tools for predictive 3DP.

We use a laboratory experiment and survey data to study preferences for working under time pressure. We make three main contributions. First, we develop an incentivized method to measure preferences for working under time pressure and document that participants in our laboratory experiment are averse to working under time pressure on average. Second, we show that there is substantial heterogeneity in the degree of time pressure aversion across individuals and that these individual preferences can be partially captured by simple survey questions. Third, we include these questions in a survey of bachelor’s degree students and a nationally representative survey panel and show that time pressure preferences predict career choices and income.

  abstract     = {Practitioners and academics have long appreciated the benefits of covariate balancing when they conduct randomized experiments. For web-facing firms running online A/B tests, however, it still remains challenging in balancing covariate information when experimental subjects arrive sequentially. In this paper, we study an online experimental design problem, which we refer to as the online blocking problem . In this problem, experimental subjects with heterogeneous covariate information arrive sequentially and must be immediately assigned into either the control or the treated group. The objective is to minimize the total discrepancy, which is defined as the minimum weight perfect matching between the two groups. To solve this problem, we propose a randomized design of experiment, which we refer to as the pigeonhole design. The pigeonhole design first partitions the covariate space into smaller spaces, which we refer to as pigeonholes, and then, when the experimental subjects arrive at each pigeonhole, balances the number of control and treated subjects for each pigeonhole. We analyze the theoretical performance of the pigeonhole design and show its effectiveness by comparing against two well-known benchmark designs: the matched-pair design and the completely randomized design. We identify scenarios when the pigeonhole design demonstrates more benefits over the benchmark design. To conclude, we conduct extensive simulations using Yahoo! data to show a 10.2% reduction in variance if we use the pigeonhole design to estimate the average treatment effect.

  abstract     = {We investigate how key features associated with the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism of Bitcoin (commonly referred to as mining) affect pricing. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we observe that price bubble formation can be attributed to mining. Moreover, overpricing is more pronounced if the mining capacity is centralized to a small group of individuals. The order book data reveal that miners seem to play a crucial role in bubble formation. Further probing the mechanism in a second study, we find that both mining costs and decisions jointly with the sluggish rate of supply of the asset contribute to the bubble formation. Our results demonstrate that erratic pricing is an inherent feature of cryptocurrencies based on a mining protocol, thus seriously limiting any prospects for such assets becoming a medium of exchange.

  abstract     = {I use an important ruling, Marblegate Asset Management v. Education Management Corporation (EMC), to study the economic role of two publicly traded debt restructuring methods: coercive bond exchange offers and Chapter 11. This ruling restricted firms from employing coercive bond exchange offers to facilitate out-of-court restructurings, thereby increasing the likelihood of restructuring publicly traded debt under Chapter 11. Following the ruling, investment in affected distressed firms decreased substantially, but investment efficiency improved. The changes in covenant, maturity, and offering yield of newly issued bonds suggested that existing bondholders with covenants gained more bargaining power than shareholders and new bondholders.

Our theory suggests that American puts yield less negative raw but more negative delta-hedged expected returns than equivalent European puts. The raw (delta-hedged) spread widens with a higher early exercise probability as induced through, for example, moneyness, time to maturity, and underlying asset volatility (variance and jump risk premiums). An empirical comparison of single-stock American puts with equivalent synthetic European puts formed from put–call parity supports our theory if and only if we allow for optimal early exercises in our return calculations. More strikingly, allowing for optimal early exercises significantly alters the profitability of 14 out of 15 well-known option anomalies with the average absolute change equal to 33% and five anomalies becoming insignificant.

  abstract     = {We build a risk management model that incorporates variable capital utilization and time-varying collateral capacity. The former lets firms optimally choose capital utilization, and hence production, which affects capital depreciation and risk exposure. The latter means firms’ ability to borrow and hedge increases with expected earnings and thus utilization. Calibrated solutions show both ingredients matter for firm value. We test the novel model predictions using a new data set of oil and gas producers. Consistent with model predictions, we find utilization is negatively correlated with firm liquidity, while hedging is positively correlated with liquidity and expected profitability.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional weakly coupled Markov decision processes (WDPs) arise in dynamic decision making and reinforcement learning, decomposing into smaller Markov decision processes (MDPs) when linking constraints are relaxed. The Lagrangian relaxation of WDPs (LAG) exploits this property to compute policies and (optimistic) bounds efficiently; however, dualizing linking constraints averages away combinatorial information. We introduce feasibility network relaxations (FNRs), a new class of linear programming relaxations that exactly represents the linking constraints. We develop a procedure to obtain the unique minimally sized relaxation, which we refer to as self-adapting FNR, as its size automatically adjusts to the structure of the linking constraints. Our analysis informs model selection: (i) the self-adapting FNR provides (weakly) stronger bounds than LAG, is polynomially sized when linking constraints admit a tractable network representation, and can even be smaller than LAG, and (ii) self-adapting FNR provides bounds and policies that match the approximate linear programming (ALP) approach but is substantially smaller in size than the ALP formulation and a recent alternative Lagrangian that is equivalent to ALP. We perform numerical experiments on constrained dynamic assortment and preemptive maintenance applications. Our results show that self-adapting FNR significantly improves upon LAG in terms of policy performance and/or bounds, while being an order of magnitude faster than an alternative Lagrangian and ALP, which are unsolvable in several instances.

  abstract     = {The transition from a traditional manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge- and service-based economy over recent decades resulted in a considerable rise in intangible capital, most of which is not reported on companies’ balance sheets. As a result, balance sheet-based valuation ratios, investment measures, and other firm characteristics that do not incorporate off-balance sheet (OBS) intangible capital suffer from significant measurement error problems. We incorporate a new measure of OBS intangible capital into firm characteristics, such as book to market, investment, and profitability, to address these measurement errors. These OBS intangible adjustments improve the performance of the Fama–French three- and five-factor models and the q -factor model, especially during recent decades.

This paper studies the relationship between the value generated by shared rides and the detours they create for riders. We establish a limit on the sum of value and detour, and we prove that this leads to a tight bound on the Pareto frontier of values and detours in a general setting with an arbitrary number of requests. We explicitly compute the Pareto frontier for one family of city topologies and construct it via simulation for several more networks, including one based on ride-sharing data from commute hours in Manhattan. We find that average detours are usually small, even in low-demand-density settings. We also find that by carefully choosing the match objective, detours can be reduced with a relatively small impact on values and that the density of ride requests is far more important than detours for the effective operations of a shared rides service. In response, we propose that platforms implement a two-product version of shared rides and limit the worst-case detours of its users. This paper was accepted by Hamid Nazerzadeh, data science.

However, obtaining accurate valuation estimates of reorganized firms is challenging because of limited firm-specific market-based information and the oft-conflicting incentives of claimholders. We examine the role of industry peer information in reducing misvaluations and its implications for unintended interclaimant wealth transfers and postreorganization performance. First, we find that the availability of relevant industry peer information is negatively associated with equity valuation errors for firms emerging from Chapter 11. Cross-sectional results suggest that the relation between industry peer information and valuation errors varies substantially with debtors’ information environment and case characteristics. Second, we find that industry peer information quality is associated with better ex post financial performance of emerged firms because of lower overvaluation. Finally, we document the role of industry peer information in substantially reducing the frequency and magnitude of unintended wealth transfers between claimants arising from equity valuation errors.

Applying a two-stage difference-in-differences approach to a panel data set of online reviews for a matched set of hotels across TripAdvisor and Expedia, we find that hotels’ participation in the review solicitation program results in a 34.3% increase in review volume, a 0.151 increase in review rating, but a 16.9% decrease in review length. Review solicitation, however, generates a notable negative spillover effect on the volume of organic reviews. Specifically, the volume of organic reviews is reduced by 15.5% after hotels start soliciting reviews. We provide evidence that the motivational crowding-out effect plays an important role in driving this negative spillover. Further analyses reveal that the effects of review solicitation are heterogeneous with respect to hotels of different types and consumers with different demographic and behavioral characteristics. Finally, using a novel structural topic model, we detect a significant shift in review content from specific and concrete topics to general and abstract topics. Our findings suggest that review platforms and firms should be cautious about the unintended negative consequences of review solicitation on consumers’ review generation.

  abstract     = {Advancements in technology have reduced information acquisition costs, creating an improved information environment for retail investors. Specifically, new technologies, such as application programming interface (API), deliver high-volume, institutional-like raw data directly to Main Street investors. Although greater availability of information can be beneficial, it may also exacerbate retail investors’ existing trading deficiencies. Exploiting the sudden shutdown of Yahoo! Finance API, the largest free API for retail investors, this study examines how access to tech-enabled raw financial data affects retail investment. We find that retail trading volumes in stocks favored by active retail investors dropped by 8.6%–10.5% within one month of the API shutdown. The remaining retail trades collectively became more predictive of future returns, suggesting less gambling-like behavior after the API shutdown. Moreover, our randomized controlled experiment affirms the underlying mechanism: tech-enabled access to high-volume historical price data increases individuals’ overconfidence, which further leads them to engage in excessive trading. The study reveals an unintended consequence of technology-led, wider data access for retail investors. This paper was accepted by D. J. Wu, information systems.

  abstract     = {Hedge funds with larger macroeconomic-risk betas do not earn higher returns, in contrast to the theoretically predicted risk-return trade-off. Meanwhile, high macro-beta funds deliver higher returns than low macro-beta funds following a low-sentiment period, whereas the risk-return relation is flat following a high-sentiment period. We show that the sophisticated management of hedge funds explains this pattern. The relation between funds’ macro-risk betas and the timing abilities/investor flows is sentiment dependent, and such variation likely drives the contrasting beta-return trade-offs after high- and low-sentiment periods.

Using a hiring experiment, we rule out taste-based discrimination by design and test for the presence of two types of belief-based gender discrimination. We document evidence of explicit discriminators —individuals who are willing to discriminate even when their hiring choices are highly revealing of their gender-biased beliefs. Crucially, we also identify implicit discriminators —individuals who do not discriminate against women when taking a discriminatory action is highly revealing of their biased beliefs, but do discriminate against women when their biased motive is obscured. Our analysis highlights the central role played by features of the choice environment in determining whether and how discrimination will manifest.

We analytically prove that in some scenarios, coordination incentives cause sophisticated players who can comprehend disclosures to choose not to analyze them to match unsophisticated players’ actions, a phenomenon we call “coordinated inattention.” Laboratory experiments provide support for the coordinated inattention mechanism: Coordination incentives reduce sophisticated subjects’ propensity to analyze disclosures, especially when they believe others are unlikely to comprehend them. We further find that psychological biases help reduce coordinated inattention. Subjects are overconfident, sophisticated subjects overestimate others’ ability to comprehend disclosures, and both biases are associated with a higher tendency to analyze disclosures. Our analysis suggests that unsophisticated decision makers’ inability to comprehend complex disclosures has a negative spillover effect by reducing sophisticated decision makers’ attention to disclosures.

  abstract     = {We consider model-free reinforcement learning (RL) in nonstationary Markov decision processes. Both the reward functions and the state transition functions are allowed to vary arbitrarily over time as long as their cumulative variations do not exceed certain variation budgets. We propose Restarted Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bounds (RestartQ-UCB), the first model-free algorithm for nonstationary RL, and show that it outperforms existing solutions in terms of dynamic regret. Specifically, RestartQ-UCB with Freedman-type bonus terms achieves a dynamic regret bound of O ˜ ( S 1 3 A 1 3 Δ 1 3 H T 2 3 ) , where S and A are the numbers of states and actions, respectively, Δ > 0 is the variation budget, H is the number of time steps per episode, and T is the total number of time steps. We further present a parameter-free algorithm named Double-Restart Q-UCB that does not require prior knowledge of the variation budget. We show that our algorithms are nearly optimal by establishing an information-theoretical lower bound of Ω ( S 1 3 A 1 3 Δ 1 3 H 2 3 T 2 3 ) , the first lower bound in nonstationary RL. Numerical experiments validate the advantages of RestartQ-UCB in terms of both cumulative rewards and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the power of our results in examples of multiagent RL and inventory control across related products. This paper was accepted by Omar Besbes, revenue management and market analytics.

Running two large-scale experiments, we show that (i) performance can be predicted by accurately measured worker characteristics, (ii) a machine learning algorithm can detect heterogeneity in responses to different schemes, (iii) a targeted assignment of schemes to individuals increases performance significantly above the level of the single best scheme, and (iv) algorithmic assignment is more effective for workers who have a high likelihood to repeatedly interact with the employer or who provide more consistent survey answers.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing platforms typically take a passive approach, and they let the competing firms freely design their own contests and allow every solver to self-select and join any of the concurrently running contests. In a model of competing noise-driven contests, we show that the duopoly prize allocation has fewer (but larger) prizes compared with a monopolist contest designer. We also find that contests with firm-chosen budgets and solvers’ endogenous participation create coordination inefficiencies. Thus, platform policies that constrain the competing firms from freely choosing their budgets and offer solvers non-enforceable recommendations toward specific noise-driven contests strictly enhance total welfare. Extending our framework to include arbitrarily correlated ability-driven contests, we highlight the critical role of inter-contest dependence on the efficacy of a platform’s interventions. Specifically, platform nudges to improve solver-contest (mis)matches are welfare enhancing only when the contests are sufficiently related, and allowing solvers to self-sort is appropriate otherwise.

  abstract     = {Two events, with major implications for U.S. voters, occur after each decennial census. First, congressional “apportionment” takes place, followed by congressional “districting.” Apportionment determines how to allocate the 435 seats in the House of Representatives across the 50 states, whereas districting determines the geographic boundaries assigned to representatives within each state. Although districting and the practice of gerrymandering often receive great attention in the media and courts, the best way to apportion representatives across states has been debated for nearly 250 years. Historical methods (including the current method) each satisfy some desirable optimality criteria that the others are not guaranteed to satisfy. Moreover, none are guaranteed to optimize certain reasonable fairness measures (e.g., minimum range, minimum bias). To our knowledge, we are the first to formulate and analyze a multiobjective optimization approach to apportionment, allowing policymakers to identify Pareto-optimal allocations and quantify their trade-offs between several competing criteria. Some of these models can be formulated and solved as mixed-integer linear programs, whereas others require the solution of mixed-integer, nonconvex, quadratically constrained quadratic programs. We take advantage of recent software advances that allow one to solve these problems with optimality guarantees. Policy implications of our work include Pareto curves from historical censuses and simulations, which suggest opportunities for improvement in some objectives at little sacrifice to others.

These economically significant effects suggest that through advertising, targets increase their profile and negotiating power. Further, targets that advertise are more likely to initiate their takeovers, attract multiple bidders, receive enhanced bids, capture more merger rents, and even in failed acquisitions, experience a 1% permanent revaluation. The latter result differentiates between information asymmetry and behavioral explanations for the target advertising.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the incentive to register for deceased organ donation under alternative organ allocation priority rules, which may prioritize registered donors and/or patients with higher valuations for organ transplantation. Specifically, the donor priority rule grants higher priority on the organ waiting list to those who have previously registered as donors. The dual-incentive priority rules allocate organs based on donor status, followed by individual valuations within the same donor status, or vice versa. Both theoretical and experimental results suggest that the efficacy of the donor priority rule and the dual-incentive priority rules critically depends on the information environment. When organ transplantation valuations are unobservable prior to making donation decisions, the hybrid dual-incentive rules generate higher donation rates. In contrast, if valuations are observable, the dual-incentive priority rules create unbalanced incentives between high- and low-value agents, potentially undermining the efficacy of the hybrid dual-incentive rules in increasing overall donation rates.

  abstract     = {Largely constant average acquirer returns over the past four decades mask fundamental changes in the takeover market. Controlling for bidder composition, the common component of acquirer returns has increased by five percentage points relative to the 1980s. Offsetting this increase, the average bidder-specific component has declined. We propose a theory of bidder-specific synergies to help interpret these opposing trends. In our theory and in the data, acquirer returns increase with the extent to which synergies are unique to that bidder. The composition effect reflects bidder uniqueness. Overall, the evidence is consistent with rising merger synergies that have become less bidder specific. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance. Funding: A.

We show that lagged disclosure, on exogenous predetermined dates, that reveals an increase in block diversity is followed by a negative market reaction. Firms held by heterogeneous blockholders consistently perform worse than firms held by homogeneous blockholders. Block diversity is particularly detrimental when uncertainty is high.

  abstract     = {Through a large-scale field experiment with 393,036 customers considering opening a credit card account with a nationwide retail bank, we investigate how providing transparency into an offering’s tradeoffs affects subsequent rates of customer acquisition and long-run engagement. Although we find tradeoff transparency to have an insignificant effect on acquisition rates, customers who were shown each offering’s tradeoffs selected different products than those who were not. Moreover, prospective customers who experienced transparency and subsequently chose to open an account went on to exhibit higher-quality service relationships over time. Monthly spending was 9.9% higher and cancellation rates were 20.5% lower among those who experienced transparency into each offering’s tradeoffs. Increased product use and retention accrued disproportionately to customers with prior category experience: more-experienced customers who were provided transparency spent 19.2% more on a monthly basis and were 33.7% less likely to defect after nine months. Importantly, we find that these gains in engagement and retention do not come at the expense of customers’ financial well-being: the probability of making late payments was reduced among customers who experienced transparency. We further find that the positive effects of tradeoff transparency on engagement and retention were attenuated in the presence of a promotion that provided financial incentives to choose particular offerings. Taken together, these results suggest that providing transparency into an offering’s tradeoffs may be an effective strategy for informing customer choices, leading to better outcomes for customers and firms alike.

  abstract     = {We study the blocking effect of patents on follow-on innovation by others. We posit that follow-on innovation requires freedom to operate (FTO), which firms typically obtain through a license from the patentee holding the original innovation. Where licensing fails, follow-on innovation is blocked unless firms gain FTO through patent invalidation. Using large-scale data from post-grant oppositions at the European Patent Office, we find that patent invalidation increases follow-on innovation, measured in citations, by 16% on average. This effect exhibits a U-shape in the value of the original innovation. For patents on low-value original innovations, invalidation predominantly increases low-value follow-on innovation outside the patentee’s product market. Here, transaction costs likely exceed the joint surplus of licensing, causing licensing failure. In contrast, for patents on high-value original innovations, invalidation mainly increases high-value follow-on innovation in the patentee’s product market. We attribute this latter result to rent dissipation, which renders patentees unwilling to license out valuable technologies to (potential) competitors.

We conjecture that banks should be better informed about the presence of zombie firms and the congestion externalities that such firms exert on healthy borrowers in industries where banks are specialized and show that banks’ credit supply to zombie firms relates negatively to their industry specialization. This relation is stronger when congestion externalities are likely to have stronger adverse effects, namely when zombie firms take a higher fraction of resources in the industry or when the industry is geographically more concentrated. Additionally, this relation is weaker in industries with higher asset specificity as zombie firms’ default (and potential asset fire sales) could reduce healthy borrowers’ collateral value.

  abstract     = {Ranking and selection (R&S) aims to select the best alternative with the largest mean performance from a finite set of alternatives. Recently, considerable attention has turned toward the large-scale R&S problem which involves a large number of alternatives. Ideal large-scale R&S procedures should be sample optimal; that is, the total sample size required to deliver an asymptotically nonzero probability of correct selection (PCS) grows at the minimal order (linear order) in the number of alternatives, k . Surprisingly, we discover that the naïve greedy procedure, which keeps sampling the alternative with the largest running average, performs strikingly well and appears sample optimal. To understand this discovery, we develop a new boundary-crossing perspective and prove that the greedy procedure is sample optimal for the scenarios where the best mean maintains at least a positive constant away from all other means as k increases. We further show that the derived PCS lower bound is asymptotically tight for the slippage configuration of means with a common variance. For other scenarios, we consider the probability of good selection and find that the result depends on the growth behavior of the number of good alternatives: if it remains bounded as k increases, the sample optimality still holds; otherwise, the result may change. Moreover, we propose the explore-first greedy procedures by adding an exploration phase to the greedy procedure. The procedures are proven to be sample optimal and consistent under the same assumptions. Last, we numerically investigate the performance of our greedy procedures in solving large-scale R&S problems. This paper was accepted by Baris Ata, stochastic models and simulation.

  abstract     = {We examine the effect of trade secret protection laws on internal information integration (i.e., the extent to which economic agents are provided with access to decision-relevant information from other economic agents within a firm). We argue that stronger trade secret protection laws increase firms’ internal information integration because they reduce the proprietary costs of information leakage. To test our prediction, we measure a firm’s internal information integration by the share of its sites integrated into its enterprise management system. Exploiting the staggered adoption of trade secret protection laws via the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), we find that these laws increase firms’ internal information integration. This effect is stronger (weaker) for firms with higher proprietary costs (coordination benefits). Further, we provide evidence that the UTSA-induced increase in internal information integration translates into improvements of firms’ internal information quality and decision-making quality. Taken together, our results enhance the understanding of the economic trade-offs shaping firms’ internal information environment. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting. Funding: S.

This paper explores whether policy-driven lending is differentially transmitted to single-bank firms in comparison with the multibank firms that are the focus of the literature. Using unique variation in the ECB’s very long-term refinancing operations (VLTROs), which affected lending to firms discontinuously across credit ratings but within banks, we find selective transmission of VLTRO liquidity to single-bank firms. Banks apply higher lending standards to single-bank firms, with banking relationships determining both new lending and lending maturity. By contrast, banks appear to transmit policy lending near-uniformly across multibank firms. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

  abstract     = {The topic of learning to solve optimization problems has received interest from both the operations research and machine learning communities. In this paper, we combine ideas from both fields to address the problem of learning to generate decisions to instances of optimization problems with potentially nonlinear or nonconvex constraints where the feasible set varies with contextual features. We propose a novel framework for training a generative model to produce provably optimal decisions by combining interior point methods and adversarial learning, which we further embed within an iterative data generation algorithm. To this end, we first train a classifier to learn feasibility and then train the generative model to produce optimal decisions to an optimization problem using the classifier as a regularizer. We prove that decisions generated by our model satisfy in-sample and out-of-sample optimality guarantees. Furthermore, the learning models are embedded in an active learning loop in which synthetic instances are iteratively added to the training data; this allows us to progressively generate provably tighter optimal decisions. We investigate case studies in portfolio optimization and personalized treatment design, demonstrating that our approach yields advantages over predict-then-optimize and supervised deep learning techniques, respectively. In particular, our framework is more robust to parameter estimation error compared with the predict-then-optimize paradigm and can better adapt to domain shift as compared with supervised learning models.

  abstract     = {This paper considers sensitivity analysis of the cost coefficients in multiobjective integer linear programming problems. We define the sensitivity region as the set of simultaneous changes to the coefficients for which the efficient set and its structure remain the same. In particular, we require that the component-wise relation between efficient solutions is preserved and that inefficient solutions remain inefficient, and we show that this is sufficient for the efficient set to be the same upon changes. For a single coefficient, we show that a subset of the inefficient solutions can be excluded from consideration. More specifically, we prove that it suffices to inspect the inefficient solutions of a q -objective problem that are efficient in one of two related q + 1-objective problems. Finally, we show that the sensitivity region is a convex set (an interval). Our approach generalizes to simultaneous changes in multiple coefficients. For illustration, we consider mean-variance capital budgeting and determine the region for which the set of efficient portfolios remains the same, despite a misspecification or a change in the net present values of the projects. Further computational experience with multiobjective binary and integer knapsack problems demonstrates the general applicability of our technique. For instance, we obtain all sensitivity intervals for changes to single coefficients of biobjective problems with 500 binary variables in less than half an hour of CPU time by excluding a large number of inefficient solutions. In fact, the number of excluded solutions is above 100 orders of magnitude larger than the number of remaining solutions. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {We investigate a bargaining setting between an “informed” player, who has private information, and an “uninformed” player. The informed player has the option to truthfully disclose private information in two unique environments. In the first environment, the informed player is randomly matched with an uninformed player and, after matching, can voluntarily disclose private information prior to a negotiation taking place. In the second environment, the informed player can voluntarily disclose private information before any endogenous matching between players (and subsequent negotiation) takes place. We begin by examining these environments theoretically. When disclosure occurs after matching, we show that low informed types should disclose more often than high informed types to avoid disagreement. However, when disclosure occurs before matching, for a range of parameter values, we show that high informed types should disclose more than low informed types to secure a better match. We test these predictions in a controlled human-subjects experiment and verify many of the theoretical predictions. Among other results, we find that low informed types do indeed disclose their private information to avoid disagreement and that, when it is in their interest to do so, high informed types disclose their private information to secure a better match.

  abstract     = {Government ownership of financial intermediaries is pervasive around the world. In this study, we examine the impact of common government ownership between the brokerage and listed firms on the information production role of brokerage firms. We show that affiliated analysts tend to issue more optimistic recommendations for stocks of firms controlled by the same government entity that controls their brokerage firms. This optimistic bias is particularly pronounced during periods of economic shocks. Our study demonstrates this by utilizing additional tariff impositions and tariff exemptions during the U.S.–China trade war as exogenous negative and positive shocks, respectively. Additionally, our study indicates that stocks recommended by politically affiliated analysts tend to underperform those recommended by independent analysts, implying that the optimism stems from conflicts of interest rather than superior information. Furthermore, our research highlights that sophisticated investors perceive the potential bias and incorporate it into their trading. Consistent with an exchange of favors story, politically affiliated brokerage firms receive a larger allocation during the issuance of local government debt, whereas governments subscribe for more shares during seasoned equity offerings by these affiliated brokerage firms.

  abstract     = {Standard search models assume that consumers actively decide on the order, identity, and number of products they search. We document that online, a large fraction of searches happen in a more passive manner, with consumers merely reacting to online advertisements that do not allow them to choose the timing or the identity of products to which they will be exposed. Using a clickstream panel data set capturing full URL addresses of websites that consumers visit, we show how to detect whether a click is ad initiated. We then report that in the apparel category, ad-initiated clicks account for more than half of all website arrivals, are more concentrated early on in the consumer search process, and lead to less in-depth searches and fewer transactions, consistent with the passive nature of these searches. To account for these systematic differences between active and passive searches, we propose and estimate a simple model that accommodates both types of searches. Our results show that incorrectly treating all searches as active inflates the estimated value of brands that advertise frequently. Our model can more accurately recover data patterns, especially for advertising brands. We finish with model extensions and a discussion of the managerial implications.

  abstract     = {Advances in information technology (IT) may affect the organizational design of production. Exploiting the rapid diffusion of the internet in the United States, we assess the sensitivity of production chain organization to this innovation in IT access and use. Extending theories of the firm that recognize the importance of downstream transfers (selling as opposed to sourcing) and plural governance in organizational design, we predict IT-driven shifts in downstream vertical integration. In a detailed panel of Census Bureau data for over 5,600 manufacturing plants, we observe the extent of a production unit’s downstream transactions within the firm alongside concurrent sales to external customers—a mix we refer to as plural selling . Our main finding is that the use of the internet for external coordination precipitated a significant decline in downstream vertical integration across the manufacturing sector. Instrumental variables estimation points to a causal relationship but also heterogeneous treatment effects. Key drivers of plural organization, such as complementarities and constraints across differently governed transactions, help explain such heterogeneity, as does concurrent use of internal production management IT. Our study is the first study to leverage a plural governance framework and large-scale microdata to understand how U.S. production chain organization shifted in response to this rapid and far-reaching technological change.

  abstract     = {In the classic Adwords problem introduced by [Mehta A, Saberi A, Vazirani U, Vazirani V (2007) Adwords and generalized online matching. J. ACM 54(5):22-es.], we have a bipartite graph between advertisers and queries. Each advertiser has a maximum budget that is known a priori. Queries are unknown a priori and arrive sequentially. When a query arrives, advertisers make bids, and we (immediately and irrevocably) decide which (if any) Ad to display based on the bids and advertiser budgets. The winning advertiser for each query pays their bid up to their remaining budget. Our goal is to maximize total budget used without any foreknowledge of the arrival sequence (which could be adversarial). We consider the setting where the online algorithm does not know the advertisers’ budgets a priori and the budget of an advertiser is revealed to the algorithm only when it is exceeded. A naïve greedy algorithm is 0.5 competitive for this setting, and finding an algorithm with better performance remained an open problem. We show that no deterministic algorithm has competitive ratio better than 0.5 and give the first (randomized) algorithm with strictly better performance guarantee. We show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm is at least 0.522 but also strictly less than ( 1 − 1 / e ) . We present novel applications of budget oblivious algorithms in search ads and beyond. In particular, we show that our algorithm achieves the best possible performance guarantee for deterministic online matching in the presence of multichannel traffic [Manshadi V, Rodilitz S, Saban D, Suresh A (2022) Online algorithms for matching platforms with multi-channel traffic.

  abstract     = {In community first responder (CFR) systems, traditional emergency service response is augmented by a network of trained volunteers who are dispatched via an app. A central application of such systems is out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), where a very fast response is crucial. For a target performance level, how many volunteers are needed, and from which locations should they be recruited? We model the presence of volunteers throughout a region as a Poisson point process, which permits the computation of the response-time distribution of the first-arriving volunteer. Combining this with known survival-rate functions, we deduce survival probabilities in the cardiac arrest setting. We then use convex optimization to compute a location distribution of volunteers across the region that optimizes either the fraction of incidents with a fast response (a common measure in the industry) or patient survival in the case of OHCA. The optimal location distribution provides a bound on the best possible performance with a given number of volunteers. This can be used to determine whether introducing a CFR system in a new region is worthwhile or can serve as a guide for additional recruitment in existing systems. Effective target areas for recruitment are not always obvious because volunteers recruited from one area may be found in various areas across the city depending on the time of day; we explicitly capture this issue. We demonstrate these methods through an extended case study of Auckland, New Zealand. This paper was accepted by Carri Chan, healthcare management.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates whether limited liability and moral hazard affect risk taking through motivated beliefs. On the one hand, limited liability encourages investors to take excessive risks. On the other, excessive risk taking makes it hard for investors to maintain a positive self-image when moral hazard is present. Using a novel experimental design, we show that subjects form motivated beliefs to self-justify their excessive risk taking. For the same investment opportunity, subjects invest more and are significantly more optimistic about the success of the investment if its failure can harm others. We show that more than one third of the investment increases under limited liability, and moral hazard can be explained through motivated beliefs. Moreover, through a treatment with limited liability but no moral hazard, we show that motivated beliefs are formed subconsciously and can lead to the paradoxical result of investors taking larger risks when their investment can harm a third party compared with when it cannot. These results underscore the importance of motivated beliefs in regulatory policy, emphasizing that policymakers must not only address bad incentives, but also address the role of bad beliefs.

However, the performance of human underwritten loans largely declines for riskier and more complex loans, whereas the machine performance stays relatively stable across various risk dimensions and loan characteristics. The performance difference is more pronounced at underwriting thresholds with a high potential for agency conflict.

  abstract     = {A critical element of word of mouth (WOM) or buzz marketing is to identify seeds, often central actors with high degree in the social network. Seed identification typically requires data on the relevant network structure, which is often unavailable. We examine the impact of WOM seeding strategies motivated by the friendship paradox, which can obtain more central nodes without knowing network structure . Higher degree nodes may be less effective as seeds if these nodes communicate less with neighbors or are less persuasive when they communicate; therefore, whether friendship paradox–motivated seeding strategies increase or reduce WOM and adoption remains an empirical question. We develop and estimate a model of WOM and adoption using data on microfinance adoption across village social networks in India. Counterfactuals show that the proposed strategies with limited seeds are about 13%–30% more effective in increasing adoption relative to random seeding. These strategies are also on average 5%–11% more effective than the firm’s leader seeding strategy. We also find these strategies are relatively more effective when we have fewer seeds.

  abstract     = {We investigate an unexplored mechanism of earnings management: income shifting from not-wholly-owned subsidiaries to help the parent company avoid losses at the expense of subsidiaries. Consolidated net income attributable to the parent company (i.e., net income) increases through this mechanism, as the parent company enjoys the full amount of the shifted earnings rather than sharing them with minority investors. We design an empirical model to directly estimate the amount of income shifted from subsidiaries to parent firms. Employing this measure, we find that firms opportunistically decrease earnings of their not-wholly-owned subsidiaries to manage net income upward to avoid losses. The results are stronger for firms with high noncontrolling ownership, firms with large subsidiaries, firms with strong influence over not-wholly-owned subsidiaries, and firms with a high level of related-party transactions. Our results are robust to alternative research designs, including controls for within-firm variations, alternative earnings thresholds, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing techniques. Our mechanism of earnings management is generalizable to other earnings management scenarios, such as share pledging. This paper was accepted by Brian Bushee, accounting. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Using proprietary data on nonperforming loan (NPL) transactions in China, we document that banks conceal NPLs in disposal transactions that are supposed to resolve NPLs. In these transactions, banks provide financing and retain the credit risks and debt collection obligations. Transaction prices contradict underlying credit risks: Despite being delinquent for 4.5 years, the median NPL package is sold at face value with zero haircut. The majority of NPL packages are resold at a premium to banks’ non–government-owned borrowers, further supporting the concealment view. Banks under stricter regulation conceal NPLs more and engage in more illicit concealment. NPL-concealing banks increase zombie lending, suggesting that an ineffective resolution exacerbates credit misallocation. Recognizing the hidden NPLs implies the total NPLs in China is two to three times the reported amount. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance. Funding: B.

  abstract     = {We consider a distribution system in which retailers replenish perishable goods from a warehouse, which, in turn, replenishes from an outside source. Demand at each retailer depends on exogenous features and a random shock, and unfulfilled demand is lost. The objective is to obtain a data-driven replenishment and allocation policy that minimizes the average inventory cost per time period. The extant data-driven methods either cannot guarantee a feasible solution for out-of-sample feature observations or generate one with excessive computational time. We propose a policy that resolves these issues in two steps. In the first step, we assume that the distributions of features and random shocks are known. We develop an effective heuristic policy by using Taylor expansion to approximate the retailer’s inventory cost. The resulting solution is closed-form, referred to as Taylor Approximation (TA) policy. We show that the TA policy is asymptotically optimal in the number of retailers. In the second step, we apply the linear quantile regression and kernel density estimation to the TA solution to obtain the data-driven policy called Data-Driven Taylor Approximation (DDTA) policy. We prove that the DDTA policy is consistent with the TA policy. A numerical study shows that the DDTA policy is very effective. Using a real data set provided by Fresh Hema, we show that the DDTA policy reduces the average cost by 11.0% compared with Hema’s policy.

  abstract     = {In many markets (e.g., cell phones, video games), firms offer menus of contracts that include some tariffs charging per-use prices above marginal cost and others below marginal cost. We term this puzzling phenomenon as two-sided deviations from marginal cost pricing and present a potential explanation based on two well-recognized consumer characteristics. The first one is that consumers’ actual consumptions may depart systematically from their initial plans (i.e., time-inconsistent preferences). In addition, consumers can be either sophisticated or naive in their beliefs about their time inconsistency (i.e., heterogenous beliefs). We characterize properties of the optimal contracts for a firm to screen the time-inconsistent consumers with heterogeneous beliefs. We articulate the conditions under which the optimal menu may account for two-sided deviations from marginal cost pricing. We also show that, contrary to intuition, a higher degree of time inconsistency may reduce firm profit and increase social welfare. Meanwhile, reducing consumer naivete may harm the society. Moreover, we confirm that our main results are robust to the presence of time-consistent consumers. This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.

  abstract     = {Queues where people misreport their private information to access service faster are everywhere. Motivated by the prevalence of such behavior in practice, we construct a queueing-game-theoretic model where customers make strategic claims to reduce their waiting time and where the manager decides on the static scheduling policy based on those claims to minimize the expected delay cost in the system. We develop a lying-aversion model where customers incur both delay and lying costs. We run controlled experiments to validate our modeling assumptions regarding customer misreporting behavior. In particular, we find that people do incur lying costs, and we find that their misreporting behavior does not depend on changes in waiting times but rather, on the scheduling parameters. Based on the validated lying-aversion model, we study the equilibrium that arises in our game. We find that under certain conditions, the optimal policy is to use an honor policy where service priority is given according to customer claims. We also find that it may be optimal to incentivize more honesty by means of an upgrading policy where some customers who claim to not deserve priority are upgraded to the priority queue. We find that the upgrading policy deviates from the celebrated cµ rule. This paper was accepted by Elena Katok, operations management.

  abstract     = {Advertising is a crucial revenue source for e-commerce platforms and a vital online marketing tool for their sellers. In this paper, we explore dynamic ad allocation with limited slots upon each customer’s arrival for an e-commerce platform, where customers follow a choice model when clicking the ads. Motivated by the recent advocacy for the algorithmic fairness of online ad delivery, we adjust the value from advertising by a general fairness metric evaluated with the click-throughs of different ads and customer types. The original online ad-allocation problem is intractable, so we propose a novel stochastic program framework (called two-stage target-debt ) that first decides the click-through targets and then devises an ad-allocation policy to satisfy these targets in the second stage. We show the asymptotic equivalence between the original problem, the relaxed click-through target optimization, and the fluid-approximation ( Fluid ) convex program. We also design a debt-weighted offer-set algorithm and demonstrate that, as long as the problem size scales to infinity, this algorithm is (asymptotically) optimal under the optimal first-stage click-through target. Compared with the Fluid heuristic and its resolving variants, our approach has better scalability and can deplete the ad budgets more smoothly throughout the horizon, which is highly desirable for the online advertising business in practice. Finally, our proposed model and algorithm help substantially improve the fairness of ad allocation for an online e-commerce platform without significantly compromising efficiency.

  abstract     = {While patents have been shown to play a role as barriers to entry, they also reveal information about incumbent strategies and risk being invalidated. We examine the trade-off incumbents face between using their patents ex ante as entry deterrents or ex post once competitors have revealed their moves. Leveraging the unique characteristics of the pharmaceutical sector, in which it is possible to observe exactly when a competitor entry threat materializes, and exploiting exogenous variation in that timing, we show that incumbents intentionally fragment and delay the full disclosure of their intellectual property rights through continuation patents. They disproportionately reveal continuation patents after a competitor entry threat becomes concrete, tailoring their response to the threat they have received and successfully delaying competitor entry through litigation. The detected incumbents’ reaction is stronger when their attacked drugs are valuable and when the patents listed at the Food and Drug Administration approval of a drug are relatively narrow in scope.

  abstract     = {We develop a measure of merger and acquisition (M&A) quality using accounting theory. This measure, implied return-on-equity improvement (IRI), quantifies the minimum improvement in the target’s post-acquisition return on equity (ROE) the acquirer must attain to break even on the acquisition price. Employing a large sample of M&As from 1980 to 2018, we find that a high IRI is, on average, less attainable ex post and predicts worse acquirer financial performance. The acquirer’s ROE growth over the first three years after the M&A is 11 percentage points lower for high-IRI M&As compared with low-IRI M&As. Worse high-IRI acquirer performance is observable through higher operating costs, tighter financial constraints, lower investments, and larger and more frequent goodwill impairments. We also find that IRI increases with acquiring chief executive officers’ overconfidence, incentive misalignment, and difficulty in estimating synergies; IRI decreases with acquirers’ financial discipline and due diligence effort. As such, overestimating synergies and managerial incentives that drive overpayment are potential mechanisms underlying IRI’s negative association with acquirers’ post-M&A performance.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of reviews on product choices when consumers can negotiate price. Although prior research has examined the impact of reviews in various contexts, none has considered a setting in which the purchase price is negotiated. We postulate that online reviews affect demand through consumer baseline product preference and consumer bargaining power. Leveraging a unique data set of consumer reviews of new car purchases, we developed and estimated a structural model to decompose and quantify the two mechanisms of how reviews affect demand: baseline preference mechanism versus bargaining power mechanism. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that the bargaining power mechanism is more important than the baseline preference mechanism in explaining how historical price and discount frequency information in reviews affect seller profits. Ignoring the impact of reviews on the negotiated price leads to a biased estimation of the effectiveness of reviews. We call into caution a popular selling practice of using discounts in exchange for positive reviews, as it can backfire when future consumers leverage this discount information to negotiate a lower price.

  abstract     = {Internally developed intangibles are not included in reported assets under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The omission of this increasingly important class of assets reduces the usefulness and relevance of financial statement analysis, conducted with reported values of equity and assets. Recent studies overcome this deficiency by capitalizing research and development (R&D) expenses to estimate the value of knowledge capital and by capitalizing selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses to estimate the value of organization capital. Those two estimates are then added to reported values for financial statement analysis. For convenience, many studies rely on two rules of thumb and assume them to be equally applicable in all instances: (1) 30% of SG&A and 100% of R&D expenses are investments, and (2) the useful life of SG&A and R&D investments is three and five years, respectively. We propose a more flexible approach by estimating the capitalization and amortization parameters on an industry–year–specific basis. Our modified values of total assets and equity, inclusive of the value of capitalized intangibles, exhibit greater association with future returns and investments compared with as-reported values and values estimated with uniform rules of thumb. We provide a better estimate of intangible capital for the consumers of financial statements. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting. Funding: A. Srivastava and R.

  abstract     = {The prevalence of racial bias in policing has long concerned social scientists and policymakers. This article studies a predecessor mechanism that constitutes an important source of policing bias in American society: calls by individuals to the police to investigate “suspicious” behaviors, often involving neighbors. We construct a novel data set of more than 39 million 911 calls across 14 U.S. cities from 2011 to 2020. These data, obtained through the digitization initiatives of local governments, provide us with a unique opportunity to study neighborhood-level trust and social cohesion and demonstrate how changes to a neighborhood’s composition lead to systematic increases in the prevalence of “unfounded” suspicion calls to the police. Across a range of specifications, the proportion of unfounded suspicion calls increases as more non-Black residents move into neighborhoods with historically high levels of Black residents. This relationship is exacerbated in gentrifying neighborhoods and those with public spaces that enable more contact between community members. However, we also find some evidence that Black leadership and public support of Black citizens in communities mitigate the association between non-Black residents and the proportion of unfounded 911 calls. We discuss our results and implications for future research and policy. This paper was accepted by Anindya Ghose, information systems.

  abstract     = {Credence goods, such as repair and healthcare services, are characterized by profound information asymmetries between less-informed customers and better-informed expert sellers. These information asymmetries open the door for fraudulent behavior on the seller side. In a preregistered natural field experiment, we vary in one dimension the seller’s perception of whether the service is an ordinary or a credence good service and in the second dimension whether the customer is a member of a minority or a member of the majority. This allows us to measure the size of the induced credence goods markup and to address the question whether it interacts systematically with discrimination. We document the existence of a large credence goods markup, on average. Moreover, we find that members of the minority pay a sizeable discriminatory markup if the good is perceived as a credence good but not if it is perceived as an ordinary good. Our results show that sellers engage in sophisticated discrimination where informational asymmetries are used to hide discriminatory (fraudulent) behavior.

We posit that, by allowing visitors to acquire investment-related information and monitor the management team, site visits offer disciplinary benefits for corporate investments. Using mandatory disclosures of site visits in China, we find that corporate investments become more responsive to growth opportunities as the intensity of site visits increases, consistent with the notion that site visits yield disciplinary benefits. We also find that the positive association between site visits and investment efficiency is more pronounced when visitors can glean more investment-related information and when they have stronger incentives and greater power to monitor managers. This positive association is also stronger among firms with more severe agency problems and higher asset tangibility. The overall evidence supports the notion that site visits serve as a unique venue for institutional investors and financial analysts to acquire valuable information and serve a monitoring function, which generates disciplinary benefits for corporate investments.

  abstract     = {We examine how corporate bond fund managers manipulate portfolio risk in response to incentives. We find that liquidity risk concerns drive the allocation decisions of underperforming funds, whereas tournament incentives are of secondary importance. This leads laggard fund managers to trade off yield for liquidity while holding the exposure to other sources of risk constant. The documented derisking is stronger for managers with shorter tenure and is reinforced by a more concave flow to performance sensitivity and by periods of market stress. Derisking meaningfully supports ex post laggard fund returns. Flexible net asset values (swing pricing) may, however, reduce derisking incentives and create moral hazard.

  abstract     = {A significant element of managerial post-COVID job design regards remote work. In an era of renewed recognition of diversity, employers may wonder how diverse (gender and race) and experienced job applicants respond to remote job listings, especially for high-skilled technical and managerial positions. Prior work has shown that while remote work allows employee flexibility, it may limit career promotion prospects, so the net effect of designating a job as remote-eligible is not clear from an applicant interest standpoint, particularly when recruiting females and underrepresented minorities (URM). We analyze job applicant data from a leading startup job platform that spans long windows before and after the COVID-19 pandemic-induced shutdowns of March 2020. To address the empirical challenge that remote job designation may be codetermined with unobserved job and employer characteristics, we leverage a matching approach (and an alternative method which leverages the sudden shutdowns) to estimate how applicant characteristics differ for otherwise similar remote and onsite job postings. We find that offering remote work attracts more experienced and diverse (especially URM) job applicants, with larger effects in less diverse geographic areas. A discrete change in job posting to remote status (holding all else constant) is associated with an approximately 15% increase in applicants who are female, 33% increase in applicants with URM status, and 17% increase in applicant experience. Using the application data, we estimate an average estimated compensating wage differential for remote work that is about 7% of posted salaries in this labor market.

  abstract     = {When pursuing goals, we commonly choose between going it alone versus teaming up together. In a field experiment ( n = 774), we tested the benefits of rewarding individual versus tandem goal pursuit. In a standard-reward condition, we experimentally offered gym members an individual cash reward each day they visited the gym for four weeks. Participants in a tandem-reward condition could earn the same reward but only if they surmounted an extra logistical hurdle: they had to visit the gym with a friend. Although this additional requirement made it more difficult for participants in the tandem-reward condition to earn equivalent incentives, participants with this extra hurdle visited the gym about 35% more frequently than those earning a standard reward. A follow-up survey suggests that tandem rewards provide nonmonetary incentives that change behavior, including increased accountability and enjoyment. Our findings illustrate the advantages of making desired behaviors social to promote follow-through. This paper was accepted by Yan Chen, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

We find that the most notable impact of the tick size reduction is a substantial increase in the liquidity demand of high-frequency traders (HFTs) and not the decrease in their liquidity provision discussed by prior literature. We show that this change in behavior is linked to the higher frequency of price signals that arises with the smaller tick size and to the ability of fast traders to profit from it, often at the detriment of slower traders. Following the tick size decrease and the increase in liquidity demand by HFTs in the spot market, the role of the spot market in price discovery drops relative to that of the futures market. We discuss these findings in the context of the impact of HFTs on the information content of financial markets. This paper was accepted by Agostino Capponi, finance.

  abstract     = {Digital technologies enable consumers to actively participate in the design and production process for a wide range of products, giving rise to the concept of a ‘prosumer.’ A significant portion of the value for such products is generated through the prosumption process. A variety of firms are investing in building such capabilities; however, a major, largely unexplored, friction in prosumption is the customers’ effort involved to undertake a creative exercise of designing products and extracting value from the process. In this study, we ask whether and how social learning—the act of showing creations made by other customers to focal customers—can ameliorate such friction. Arguably, by showing others’ product designs to focal customers, especially if such designs are attractive and of high quality, the firm may entice users to initiate the design process. Showing others’ designs is also likely to influence customers’ beliefs about their own ability—their self-efficacy—to design a valuable product that they would like to purchase. Certain designs may be perceived as out of the creative reach of focal users and therefore reduce their likelihood of finishing the design and purchasing it. How does this understanding vary across different stages of the purchase funnel? In close collaboration with an e-commerce platform that specializes in customized photo products, we examine the effectiveness of social learning by means of two large scale in-vivo randomized field experiments. We exogenously vary both the availability of others’ designs and the characteristics of the images shown to the treated users. Our analysis shows that showing other users’ designs as examples can be highly effective in influencing the purchase and design behavior of focal customers, but firms must choose the right customers and carefully select the type of user image design for display. In the upper stages of the purchase funnel, showing high-quality designs to these customers significantly increases the likelihood of project creation. Lower down in the funnel the self-efficacy effect dominates, and users are more likely to finish designs and purchase products when shown designs that are easy to learn. This paper was accepted by D.

We show that even in this highly liquid market, exposure to liquidity risk commands an economically significant risk premium of up to 3.6% per year. Liquidity risk is not subsumed by existing currency risk factors and successfully prices the cross section of currency excess returns. Moreover, we find that liquidity risk and carry trade premia are correlated, although this correlation is limited to static rather than dynamic carry trades. Building on this result, we propose a liquidity-based explanation for the carry trade, which adds significant explanatory power to existing theories. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

In China, platform distributions of mutual funds emerged in 2012 and grew quickly into a formidable presence. Utilizing the staggered entrance of funds onto platforms, we find a marked increase of performance chasing driven by the centralized information flow unique to fintech platforms. This pattern is further confirmed using proprietary data from a top platform. Examining the platform impact on fund managers, we find that incentivized by the amplified performance chasing, fund managers increase risk-taking to enhance their probability of getting onto the top ranking.

We find that CEO turnover is associated with an initial decrease in intrafirm communication (−20% relative to the pre-CEO transition period), followed by a significant increase approximately five months after the CEO turnover (+20% relative to the pre-CEO transition period). The increase in communication is driven primarily by interdepartmental (i.e., communication involving employees of different functional departments) and vertical (i.e., communication among managers and employees) communication flows.

  abstract     = {Important decisions are often complex, and existing evidence suggests that complexity can affect economic behavior. It is an open question, however, exactly when and how complexity matters. We hypothesize that salient cues—standing out in the choice context—mitigate the effect of complexity on choices. We theoretically develop and experimentally test this hypothesis in the context of portfolio selection. We find that, in both simple and complex problems, subjects seek highly right-skewed portfolios, which have an extreme and salient upside, and avoid highly left-skewed portfolios with an extreme and salient downside. Complexity does affect, however, choices among symmetric portfolios, which have neither a salient upside nor downside. Absent a salient cue, subjects diversify naively.

  abstract     = {Accounting standards prohibit internally created knowledge and organizational capital from being disclosed on firm balance sheets. As a result, balance sheets exhibit downward biases that have become exacerbated by increasing levels of intangible investments. To offset these biases, researchers must estimate the value of these off-balance sheet intangibles by capitalizing prior flows of research and development (R&D) and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A). In doing so, a set of capitalization parameters must be assumed (i.e., the R&D depreciation rate and the fraction of SG&A that represents a long-lived asset). We estimate these parameters using market prices from firm exits and use them to capitalize intangibles for a comprehensive panel of firms from 1978 to 2017. We then use a series of validation tests to examine the performance of our intangible capital stocks versus those developed from commonly used parameters. On average, our estimates of intangible capital are 15% smaller than estimates from status quo parameters while exhibiting larger variation across industry. Intangible capital stocks derived from exit price parameters outperform existing measures when explaining market enterprise values and identifying human capital risk. Adjusting book values with exit-based intangible capital stocks markedly attenuates well-documented biases in market-to-book and return on equity ratios while increasing the precision of the high-minus-low asset pricing factor. We conclude that our capitalization parameters create intangible stocks that perform equal to or better than status quo measures in various applications.

  abstract     = {Online marketplace designers frequently run randomized experiments to measure the impact of proposed product changes. However, given that marketplaces are inherently connected, total average treatment effect (TATE) estimates obtained through individual-level randomized experiments may be biased because of violations of the stable unit treatment value assumption, a phenomenon we refer to as “interference bias.” Cluster randomization (i.e., the practice of randomizing treatment assignment at the level of “clusters” of similar individuals) is an established experiment design technique for countering interference bias in social networks, but it is unclear ex ante if it will be effective in marketplace settings. In this paper, we use a meta-experiment or “experiment over experiments” conducted on Airbnb to both provide empirical evidence of interference bias in online marketplace settings and assess the viability of cluster randomization as a tool for reducing interference bias in marketplace TATE estimates. Results from our meta-experiment indicate that at least 20% of the TATE estimate produced by an individual-level randomized evaluation of the platform fee increase we study is attributable to interference bias and eliminated through the use of cluster randomization. We also find suggestive, nonstatistically significant evidence that interference bias in seller-side experiments is more severe in demand-constrained geographies and that the efficacy of cluster randomization at reducing interference bias increases with cluster quality.

Using comprehensive data collected twice a week over three years from 172 Israeli local markets, we show that an online grocer sets identical prices in all markets. By contrast, service time is shorter in more competitive markets and on low-demand days. Next, we exploit regional and temporal variation in entry decisions to examine how the incumbent adjusts its service time when new online grocers enter the market. The incumbent’s service time falls significantly on low-demand days and in monopolistic markets. This decrease begins shortly before entry and is greater when the entrant poses a larger competitive threat. On high-demand days and in competitive markets we do not find a significant change in service time in the months surrounding entry. Our findings suggest that firms use service time to exercise their local market power when prices are unresponsive and that operational considerations affect the extent to which they respond.

  abstract     = {We examine how information processing costs affect the extent to which depositors’ use the details in banks’ income statements. Depositors have a unique cost-benefit structure because they are nonprofessional users of financial information and have high information processing costs. At the same time, they benefit from acting quickly because failing banks make payments on a first-come, first-serve basis. This makes it likely that they will react to a prominent summary measure like the reported net income without adjusting for any risk-irrelevant information included in the line items. In our empirical analysis, we investigate depositors’ behavior as driven by the mechanical revaluations of deferred tax assets due to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find deposit withdrawals because of this risk-irrelevant information. In cross-sectional tests, we show that the withdrawals are stronger if the information acquisition costs are low, and the information integration costs are high. Overall, our results show that information processing costs are important for understanding depositors’ reactions to accounting information and can lead to deposit flows that cannot be explained by new risk-relevant information.

  abstract     = {Motivated by emerging applications, such as live-streaming e-commerce, promotions, and recommendations, we introduce and solve a general class of nonstationary multi-armed bandit problems that have the following two features: (i) the decision maker can pull and collect rewards from up to K ( ≥ 1 ) out of N different arms in each time period and (ii) the expected reward of an arm immediately drops after it is pulled and then nonparametrically recovers as the arm’s idle time increases. With the objective of maximizing the expected cumulative reward over T time periods, we design a class of purely periodic policies that jointly set a period to pull each arm. For the proposed policies, we prove performance guarantees for both the offline and the online problems. For the offline problem when all model parameters are known, the proposed periodic policy obtains a long-run approximation ratio that is at the order of 1 − O ( 1 / K ) , which is asymptotically optimal when K grows to infinity. For the online problem when the model parameters are unknown and need to be dynamically learned, we integrate the offline periodic policy with the upper confidence bound procedure to construct on online policy. The proposed online policy is proved to approximately have O ˜ ( N T ) regret against the offline benchmark. Our framework and policy design may shed light on broader offline planning and online learning applications with nonstationary and recovering rewards. This paper was accepted by J.

  abstract     = {Online shoppers often prefer to return items to stores (i.e., “offline return”) rather than mail them back. We study a new business practice, return partnership, wherein online retailers partner with store retailers to offer offline returns. We seek to identify when return partnerships benefit both the store and online retailers. Customers choose between the online and store channels for their purchase and decide whether, and through which channel, to return an online purchase if needed. We find that store and online retailers who offer differentiated products have incentives to partner, as in the case of the return partnership between Everlane and Cost Plus World Market (formed via Happy Returns—a service provider that connects online retailers with store retailers). In this case, the online retailer’s benefit from the cost savings achieved by consolidating shipments of returned items from stores outweighs the loss associated with a high return rate. We show that, contrary to initial intuition, return partnerships may also feature retailers who offer similar products, as in the case of Amazon-Kohl’s. In this case, online customers’ migration to offline returns ensures a store retailer’s incentive to partner. However, it limits the incentive of an online retailer when the added convenience of an offline return induces more returns of online purchases. Thus, we caution that with limited differentiation in product offerings, store visits should not be too convenient for a partnership to form.

  abstract     = {Regulatory stress tests have become one of the main tools for setting capital requirements at the largest U.S. banks. The Federal Reserve uses confidential models to evaluate bank-specific outcomes for bank-specific portfolios in shared stress scenarios. As a matter of policy, the same models are used for all banks, despite considerable heterogeneity across institutions; individual banks have contended that some models are not suited to their businesses. Motivated by this debate, we ask, what is a fair aggregation of individually tailored models into a common model? We argue that simply pooling data across banks treats banks equally but is subject to two deficiencies: it may distort the impact of legitimate portfolio features, and it is vulnerable to implicit misdirection of legitimate information to infer bank identity. We compare various notions of regression fairness to address these deficiencies, considering both forecast accuracy and equal treatment. In the setting of linear models, we argue for estimating and then discarding centered bank fixed effects as preferable to simply ignoring differences across banks. We also discuss extensions to nonlinear models. This paper was accepted by Kay Giesecke, finance.

  abstract     = {Although internal labor market theory emphasizes promotions as the main form of mobility within organizations, many internal job moves take people sideways into jobs that are at the same hierarchical level as the one that was left. Despite the prevalence of these lateral moves, however, we have little evidence on what role they play in workers’ careers. We argue that lateral mobility can facilitate subsequent career advancement by allowing for the development and demonstration of new skills and can, therefore, help those who would struggle to be promoted from their current job to develop their careers further. We establish empirical evidence on the implications of lateral mobility using eight years of personnel data from a large U.S. healthcare company. Our analyses show that those employees who move laterally are more likely to be subsequently promoted and achieve substantially higher pay growth than a matched sample of employees. We also find that lateral moves are more likely to be undertaken by those who have spent longer in the job but have lower performance than those who are promoted. This pattern of results suggests that lateral mobility provides an important avenue for career growth as people who step sideways in organizations are more likely to subsequently step up.

We find that a new reference point is created when an investor logs in and views the investor’s portfolio. We observe this as a disposition effect on returns since last login in addition to the traditional disposition effect on returns since purchase. Further, these reference points produce a strong interaction such that even a small loss since last login nullifies the positive effect of a gain since purchase.

We refer to this permutation as a submodular order. This class of functions includes monotone submodular functions as a subfamily. We give fast algorithms with strong approximation guarantees for maximizing submodular order functions under a variety of constraints and show a nearly tight upper bound on the highest approximation guarantee achievable by algorithms with polynomial query complexity. Applying this new notion to the problem of constrained assortment optimization in fundamental choice models, we obtain new algorithms that are both faster and have stronger approximation guarantees (in some cases, first algorithm with constant factor guarantee). We also show an intriguing connection to the maximization of monotone submodular functions in the streaming model, where we recover best known approximation guarantees as a corollary of our results.

In incentive-compatible behavioral choice studies on representative samples of the English and U.S. populations, we find significantly positive willingness to pay for such inequality reductions in more than 80% of subjects. Although it varies with political leaning and the extent of the inequality reduction, willingness to pay is positive across the political spectrum and for all studied inequality differences. It is higher for more intuitive and informative inequality-reporting formats. Our findings have policy implications for both governments and firms.

  abstract     = {When employees work from home, organizations have traditionally placed a stronger reliance on output-based controls because of the inability to physically observe its employees. Because of recent advances in technology, however, many organizations now use input-based controls. One such input-based control is computer monitoring, which records the number of hours spent working and leaves out any time in which an employee does not perform work activities. On the one hand, computer monitoring may provide productivity-enhancing benefits by reducing the likelihood of employees experiencing self-control problems, such as procrastination. On the other hand, computer monitoring may motivate reduced effort by decreasing employees’ autonomy, which a prior study finds is an important mediator of the relation between telecommuting and productivity. We take advantage of a field-research setting in which the organization adopts computer monitoring for its telecommuting employees. We find that computer monitoring leads to a 7.1% productivity increase for telecommuting employees. We also find that computer monitoring reduces employees’ procrastination tendencies. In addition, we find that low performers’ productivity increases more following the introduction of computer monitoring. Finally, we find evidence that telecommuters’ departure rates increase significantly following computer monitoring. Our results suggest that technology can play a significant role in expanding organizations’ management control choices when achieving controls in telecommuting arrangements.

  abstract     = {Modern traceability technologies promise to improve supply chain management by simplifying recalls, increasing visibility, and verifying sustainable supplier practices. Initiatives leading the implementation of traceability technologies must choose the least-costly set of firms—or seed set —to target for early adoption. Choosing this seed set is challenging because firms are part of supply chains interlinked in complex networks, yielding an inherent supply chain effect : benefits obtained from traceability are conditional on technology adoption by a subset of firms in a product’s supply chain. We prove that the problem of selecting the least-costly seed set in a supply chain network is hard to solve and even approximate within a polylogarithmic factor. Nevertheless, we provide a novel linear programming-based algorithm to identify the least-costly seed set. The algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable in the supply chain network’s treewidth, which we show to be low in real-world supply chain networks. The algorithm also enables us to derive easily computable bounds on the cost of selecting an optimal seed set. We leverage our toolbox to conduct large-scale numerical experiments that provide insights into how the supply chain network structure influences diffusion. These insights can help managers optimize their technology diffusion strategy. This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization.

  abstract     = {This paper demonstrates the financial and real consequences of online review aggregators. Exploiting a regression discontinuity design that overcomes the endogenous relationship between Yelp reviews and Small Business Administration loan outcomes, I show that higher coarse Yelp ratings lead to improved loan terms and performance. Specifically, a one-half-star increase in Yelp ratings corresponds to a 25-basis-point decrease in loan spread and 6% lower collateral requirements. The effects are more pronounced when banks have less borrower information. Higher Yelp ratings also contribute to increased consumer demand and the likelihood of future business openings. These findings indicate that online review aggregators influence both consumer choices and banks’ financing decisions. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.

  abstract     = {Some mutual funds retain a fraction of securities lending income by employing in-house lending agents. In a model with heterogeneous investors and endogenous delegation to mutual funds, we show that a subset of funds optimally engages in lending fee retention and as a result, overweights high lending fee stocks that endogenously underperform. We find empirical evidence consistent with our model’s predictions; active mutual funds we identify as fee retainers invest more in high-fee stocks and underperform relative to both nonretaining and nonlending funds. We also show that fee retention helps explain the negative relation between lending fees and future fee-inclusive stock returns. This paper was accepted by Lukas Schmid, finance.

  abstract     = {We report a laboratory experiment examining how demand for exchange-traded fund (ETF) index products affects the prices and trading volume of assets. We compare an environment where the ETF index includes all assets against an environment where a redundant asset is excluded from the index. We find that (i) subjects place significant value on the ETF index asset beyond the value of its constituent assets; (ii) there is a substantial index premium for included assets; and (iii) the index premium persists even when short selling is permitted. The price increases of the constituent assets and of the ETF itself suggest that ETF products can distort markets to some degree. This paper was accepted by David Sraer, finance.

  abstract     = {The shift to a service-oriented economy has driven traditional product-oriented manufacturing firms to integrate various services into their businesses. This study aims to provide empirical evidence on how manufacturers’ service offerings impact demand variability and intrafirm bullwhip effects. Through “bag-of-words” text mining on 10-K filings of U.S.-listed manufacturing firms, we propose a novel measurement to identify annual services offered. We validate the measurement’s statistical and economic significance and verify its consistency with the results obtained using the large language model (i.e., GPT-4). Services are categorized as complementing product sales (e.g., maintenance and repair) or substituting product sales entirely (e.g., machine hours). Utilizing difference-in-difference techniques, we find robust evidence that manufacturers’ service offerings reduce the bullwhip effect in two steps: basic complementing services decrease demand variability, whereas advanced substituting services mitigate intrafirm bullwhip. Moreover, servitization mainly minimizes demand variability through information channels, whereas increased production efficiency decreases intrafirm bullwhip. Our findings contribute to understanding manufacturers’ business model innovations by demonstrating that servitization can smooth demand and mitigate intrafirm bullwhip.
