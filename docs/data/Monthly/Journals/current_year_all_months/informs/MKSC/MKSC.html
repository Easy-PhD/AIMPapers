  abstract     = {Large language model (LLM)-based digital twin simulation, where LLMs are used to emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in business, artificial intelligence, social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has been hindered by the scarcity of real individual-level data sets that are both large and publicly available. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale public data set designed to capture a rich and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative sample of N = 2 , 058 participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the United States across four waves with more than 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures, as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. Beyond LLM applications, due to its unique breadth and scale, the data set also enables broad social science and business research, including studies of cross-construct correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.

  abstract     = {The rise of e-commerce has transformed the retail industry, changing consumer habits and forcing offline retailers to find new ways to stay relevant. Meanwhile, online retailers are seeking ways to enhance the flexibility of product returns as they lack a tactile shopping experience. As such, novel buy online, return in store (BORS) agreements between competing online and offline retailers, such as Amazon and Kohl’s, are emerging. A BORS agreement allows customers who buy from the online retailer to make returns at the offline retailer’s stores. In this paper, we examine the strategic impact of the agreement on price competition and profits. Our analysis suggests that the BORS agreement can create an aggressive environment for the offline retailer, despite the additional footfall from returners. However, under certain conditions, the agreement creates an opportunity for the two retailers to carve out a section of the customer base that they can decide not to compete on. As a result of this strategic effect, the agreement can soften price competition, rendering both retailers better off when they are moderately differentiated. Interestingly, the agreement can also curb customers’ showrooming behavior. We also investigate the welfare implications of the agreement and show that it can lead to a win-win-win situation for the online retailer, offline retailer, and consumers.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of Zillow’s Zestimate on housing market outcomes and how the impact differs across socioeconomic segments. Zestimate is produced by a machine learning algorithm using large amounts of data and aims to predict a home’s market value at any time. Zestimate can potentially help market participants in the housing market as identifying the value of a home is a nontrivial task. However, inaccurate Zestimate could also lead to incorrect beliefs about property values and therefore, suboptimal decisions, which would hinder the selling process. Meanwhile, Zestimate tends to be systematically more accurate for rich neighborhoods than poor neighborhoods, raising concerns that the benefits of Zestimate may accrue largely to the rich, which could widen socioeconomic inequality. Using data on Zestimate and housing sales in the United States, we show that Zestimate overall benefits the housing market as on average, it increases both buyer surplus and seller profit. This is primarily because its uncertainty reduction effect allows sellers to be more patient and set higher reservation prices to wait for buyers who truly value the properties, which improves seller-buyer match quality. Moreover, Zestimate actually reduces socioeconomic inequality as our results reveal that both rich and poor neighborhoods benefit from Zestimate but that the poor neighborhoods benefit more. This is because poor neighborhoods face greater prior uncertainty and therefore, would benefit more from new signals. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We examine the implications of privacy-motivated targeting restrictions on consumer welfare, advertisers’ customer acquisition costs, and platform revenue. In our model, competitive product firms reach consumers by placing informative ads on a monopoly advertising platform; consumers are horizontally differentiated in their product preferences and in their willingness to pay for a less preferred product, but they don’t have any intrinsic privacy preferences or an aversion to mistargeted ads per se. In this context we show that both the platform and consumers would be better off without privacy restrictions if ad rates are exogenous to the privacy regime. However, in the more realistic scenario of endogenous ad rates, consumers with flexible product preferences are likely to be better off under privacy. This is because a platform with market power recognizes the threat cross-selling by mistargeted ads poses to ad volume and compensates by lowering ad rates. Flexible consumers benefit when competitive product firms pass on their advertising cost savings in the form of lower product prices. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {The implementation of recent privacy protection regulations mandates that firms obtain privacy consent from consumers before acquiring their private data. This procedure, known as “informed privacy consent,” has significant implications for behavior-based pricing, wherein firms engage in third-degree price discrimination based on consumers’ purchase history. Before keeping track of consumers’ purchasing history for implementing price discrimination, firms must seek consumers’ privacy consent, enabling consumers to autonomously make decisions regarding their data. These endogenous privacy decisions are shaped by several factors, such as the cost of risk from privacy breaches, anticipation of future utility changes driven by price discrimination and personalized products, and rewards for opting in. Although consumers strategically decide their privacy choices to get the best future utility, in equilibrium, none of them exclusively benefit from their choices, which leads to a decrease in overall consumer surplus even with the enhanced utility from personalized products and rewards for opting in. Firms, despite the cost of providing the rewards, earn higher profits by exploiting consumers’ strategic privacy decisions, which alleviates price competition. Our findings underscore an autonomy paradox that empowering consumers to make informed decisions about their privacy rights does not necessarily lead to increased consumer surplus. This result implies privacy regulations founded on informed consent may lead to unintended consequences. History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor.

It considers the start- and end-of-period effects for time dependence and exponential and hyperbolic discounting for time preference. The study provides formal identification arguments and sufficient conditions for both time constructs, including the duration of time dependence. Using granular individual data and variations in the compensation structure, the empirical analysis separately identifies the two time constructs. Accounting for agents’ time assessment, counterfactual studies examine how changes in compensation structures affect agents’ behavior and, subsequently, their sales outcomes. The findings reveal a trade-off between long- and short-quota cycles, demonstrate the nonlinearity of sales performance relative to the duration of the compensation cycle, and show how quota-bonus plans and commissions can motivate different types of agents.

To answer this question, we run a large-scale choice experiment to elicit consumers’ valuation for their Facebook data while randomizing two common choice frames: default and price anchor. An opt-out default decreases valuations by 22% compared with opt-in, whereas a $0–$50 price anchor decreases valuations by 37% compared with a $50–$100 anchor. Moreover, some consumer segments are influenced by frames more while having lower average privacy valuations. As a result, conventional frame optimization practices that aim to maximize data volume can exacerbate bias and lower data quality. We demonstrate the magnitude of this volume-bias trade-off in our data and provide a framework to inform optimal choice architecture design. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel theory-based approach to the reinforcement learning problem of maximizing profits when faced with an unknown demand curve. Our method, rooted in multiarmed bandits, balances exploration and exploitation across various prices (arms) to maximize rewards. Traditional Gaussian process bandits capture one informational externality in price experimentation—correlation of rewards through an underlying demand curve. We extend this framework by incorporating a second externality, monotonicity, into Gaussian process bandits by introducing monotonic versions of both the Gaussian process-upper confidence bound and Gaussian process-Thompson sampling algorithms. Through reduction of the demand space, this informational externality limits exploration and experimentation, outperforming benchmarks by enhancing profitability. Moreover, our approach can also complement methods such as partial identification. Additionally, we present algorithm variants that account for heteroscedastic noise in purchase data. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm and empirically demonstrate its improved performance across a broad range of willingness-to-pay distributions (including discontinuous, time varying, and real world) and price sets. Notably, our algorithm increased profits, especially for distributions where the optimal price lies near the lower end of the considered price set. Across simulation settings, our algorithm consistently achieved over 95% of the optimal profits. History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Our study investigates the impact of product ranking systems on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered pricing algorithms. Specifically, we examine the effects of “personalized” and “unpersonalized” ranking systems on algorithmic pricing outcomes and consumer welfare. Our analysis reveals that personalized ranking systems, which rank products in decreasing order of consumer’s utilities, may encourage higher prices charged by pricing algorithms, especially when consumers search for products sequentially on a third-party platform. This is because personalized ranking significantly reduces the ranking-mediated price elasticity of demand and thus incentives to lower prices. Conversely, unpersonalized ranking systems lead to significantly lower prices and greater consumer welfare. These findings suggest that even in the absence of price discrimination, personalization may not necessarily benefit consumers because pricing algorithms can undermine consumer welfare through higher prices. Thus, our study highlights the crucial role of ranking systems in shaping algorithmic pricing behaviors and consumer welfare. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We develop a dynamic model of naïve social learning from consumer reviews. In our model, consumers decide if and what to buy based on both the products’ expected quality and their idiosyncratic taste for them. Products’ qualities are initially unknown and are (mis)learned from reviews. At the heart of the model lies a dynamic feedback loop between reviews, beliefs, and choices: period t reviews influence t + 1 consumers’ beliefs and, thus, choices; these determine the average of t + 1 reviews, which, in turn, influences t + 2 beliefs, choices, and reviews. We show that, in the long run ( t = ∞ ), reviews are systematically biased, leading some consumers astray. In particular, in both monopoly and duopoly, reviews relatively advantage lower quality and more polarizing products because these products induce stronger taste-based consumer self-selection. Thus, in stark contrast with the winner-takes-all dynamics of classic observational learning models in which consumers learn from the choices of their predecessors, social learning from opinions generates excessive choice fragmentation. Our findings have implications for interpreting the variance and number of reviews, pricing in the presence of reviews, and the short- and long-term effectiveness of fake reviews.

  abstract     = {Search aid technologies, especially prepopulated search bars, are increasingly being adopted by major players in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of prepopulating search bars with keywords on online consumer journey. In this study, I design and run a randomized field experiment on a large e-commerce platform involving 72,587 consumers who were randomly exposed to three types of keywords prefilled in the search bar. Individual consumer–level analyses reveal that prepopulating trending category keywords encourages users to discover and buy items from the suggested category without reducing queries using self-entered keywords, ultimately leading to a 10.4% (8.8%) increase in purchase incidence (spending) compared with the counterfactual outcomes when the search bar is empty. Prepopulating personalized keywords brings about more focused product searching within the category recently browsed by users, resulting in a 21% (17%) increase in purchase incidence (spending), although this is offset by the negative effect of a reduction in queries using self-entered keywords. Exposure to niche category keywords is found to have little impact. This study also finds that a prepopulated search bar does not cannibalize the other navigation tool, making it a beneficial addition to the focal e-commerce platform’s business outcomes. These findings, contributing to the literature on consumer search and product recommendation strategies for digital platforms, carry timely implications for e-commerce managers.

  abstract     = {When gathering information to make decisions, individuals often have to delay making a decision because the process of gathering information is interrupted, and the individual is not yet ready to make a decision. The paper considers a model of choice deferral based on time-varying search costs, potentially based on search fatigue, in which individuals have to strategically decide whether to defer choice when information gathering is interrupted, taking into account the current available information, and when they will be able to resume gathering information. We find that individuals are more likely to defer choice when information gathering is interrupted less frequently, when individuals can resume gathering information sooner, and when they discount the future less. We also consider the case in which individuals incur costs of restarting a process of information gathering and cases in which the individual has greater or less information about the extent of search fatigue. The paper also considers optimal pricing, user interface design, and retargeting decisions, and it shows how they should respond to the length of consumer browsing sessions and gaps between browsing sessions. The paper illustrates the importance of modeling fatigue and interruptions in the search process. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {When multiple groups of consumers reside in the same market, we determine that we can write each group’s conditional choice probabilities (CCPs) as a function of unobserved consumer heterogeneity. Moreover, we can specify choice probabilities of one group as a function of another by shifting the unobserved component. Armed with our novel CCP estimator, we develop an approach to identify and estimate a dynamic discrete demand model for durable goods with nonrandom attrition of consumers and continuous unobserved consumer heterogeneity but without the usual need for value function approximation or reducing the dimension of state space by ad hoc behavioral assumptions. We illustrate the empirical value of our method by estimating consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the state of Washington during the period of 2016–2019. We also determine the impact of a different federal tax credit based on the electric range of a car rather than the size of the battery, which was the existing policy during the data period, and we evaluate how best to seed a nascent market that presents indirect network effects to drive faster adoption. Should the government incentivize adoption through consumer tax credits or through EV infrastructure? History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {As consumers become increasingly concerned about their privacy, firms can benefit from committing not to sell consumer data. However, the holdup problem prevents firms from doing so in a static setting. This paper studies whether reputation consideration of the firm can serve as a commitment device in a long-run game when consumers have imperfect monitoring technology. We find that a patient enough monopoly can commit because its reputation will suffer from a persistent punishment if consumers detect the data sale. In contrast, reputation may fail to serve as a commitment device when there are multiple firms. The penalty for selling data is temporary when consumers do not know exactly which firm sold the data. In addition, selling data imposes a negative externality on other firms, but each firm does not take it into account in equilibrium. We characterize conditions under which duopolistic firms lose the ability to commit even if they are arbitrarily patient. Reputation cannot serve as a commitment device under any conditions as the number of firms increases because each firm is penalized less for selling the data but not rewarded more for not doing so. Lastly, we explore several ways of restoring firms’ commitment power through regulation. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Short-form videos have taken over social media and attracted attention from advertisers. But doubts remain about the advertising efficacy on these platforms. In a large-scale randomized experiment on ByteDance, we show that advertising spillover plays a pivotal role in the advertising campaign. Most of the advertising effect comes from advertising spillover beyond ByteDance with exposed users being eight times more likely to convert from outside than from within ByteDance. When considering advertising spillover outside ByteDance, the average cost per conversion, which brands commonly use to evaluate the cost of campaigns, shrinks by 5 or 25 times, depending on the methods used to calculate it. Advertising spillover can also affect a brand’s targeting strategy. Whereas commonly used demographic variables by the automobile brand are effective for target marketing with only platform data, they are not when considering advertising spillover outside ByteDance. Instead, a behavioral variable proposed herein (prior brand home page visits) effectively moderates the advertising effect but has no impact when ignoring advertising spillover in the analysis. Our findings underscore the importance of information sharing between platforms and brands, which in practice is typically not the case. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Retailers often use store flyers to communicate the availability, price, and promotions of their products. Many households inspect store flyers for promotions, and the majority still prefer to receive store flyers in print. Yet, many are said to throw out store flyers unread, creating excessive waste that is environmentally damaging because of the excess use of paper, ink, and logistics. Legislation to reduce the distribution and waste associated with unsolicited store flyers has been proposed, but if and how much such a cut in distribution would affect households’ grocery shopping behavior remain unclear. This paper investigates a recent policy change by seven Dutch municipalities that implemented a ban on unsolicited store flyers by moving from an opt-out policy to an opt-in policy at some point between 2018 and 2020. Using household scanner data, the authors assess changes in shopping behavior along nine comprehensive dimensions relevant to retailers, brand manufacturers, and policymakers using a stacked, synthetic difference-in-differences approach. Although store flyer distribution decreased by 50% under the new policy, the drastic change did not substantially affect grocery shopping behavior. These findings are robust to different time windows and modeling approaches. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Targeted marketing policies target different customers with different marketing actions. Although most research has focused on training targeting policies without managerial constraints, in practice, many firms face managerial constraints when implementing these policies. For example, firms may face volume constraints on the maximum or minimum number of actions they can take or on the minimum acceptable outcomes for different customer segments. They may also face similarity (fairness) constraints that require similar actions with different groups of customers. Traditional optimization methods face challenges when solving problems with either many customers or many constraints. We show how recent advances in linear programming can be adapted to the targeting of marketing actions. We provide a theoretical guarantee comparing how the proposed algorithm scales compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks (primal simplex, dual simplex, and barrier methods). We also extend existing guarantees on optimality and computation speed, by adapting them to accommodate the characteristics of targeting problems. We implement the proposed algorithm using data from a field experiment with over 2 million customers and six different marketing actions (including a no-action “Control”). We use this application to evaluate the computation speed and range of problems that the algorithm can solve, comparing it to benchmark methods. The findings confirm that the algorithm makes it feasible to train large-scale targeting problems that include volume and similarity constraints. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We study how a particular form of social ties (i.e., professional ties proxied by past employment) affects price and profitability in business-to-business (B2B) markets. Although most of the work on social ties focuses on information diffusion in business-to-consumer markets, we ask the following. Do B2B buyers receive higher or lower prices from sellers with whom they have professional ties? Can professional ties benefit both buyers and sellers and create win-win exchanges? Answering these questions is challenging because it is difficult to observe B2B prices, the individual decision makers (IDMs), and elements of differentiation that drive price variation. Moreover, potentially endogenous formation of social ties exacerbates the identification challenge. We resolve these challenges by leveraging proprietary data from the Federal Reserve on the repo market, the largest market for short-term loans with daily transactions of more than $2 trillion. In addition, we use financial disclosure laws to unmask IDMs at sellers and use LinkedIn to reveal their ties. We leverage exogenous movement of IDMs in and out of decision-making positions to identify the effect of professional ties on price. We show that a seller IDM, who is the buyer’s former employee, charges the buyer 1/4 basis points more than other buyers with no ties (i.e., 25 basis points relative to median price, or 13% of average cross-sectional price variance). The mechanism driving this price increase is “supply reliability.” Sellers with a professional tie to the buyer act more reliably toward that buyer during supply-demand imbalances. We perform several robustness checks, including leveraging the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to show that an exogenous increase in the aggregate cash supply diminishes the effect of professional ties, consistent with a supply reliability mechanism. Our work suggests professional ties can affect B2B prices beyond observable supply-demand dynamics and provide value for sellers and buyers. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

An exploratory survey shows that many consumers desire sustainable products and are willing to pay more for them, but some consumers dislike sustainable products and want to pay less for them. Using a theoretical model where firms are horizontally differentiated and two groups of consumers have divergent preferences for sustainable products, we investigate the strategic implications of sustainable consumption. First, our analysis shows that when consumers’ dislike for sustainable products is moderate, the price could increase as the dislike increases. Moreover, price could decrease if consumers’ desire for sustainable products increases. Second, we find that competing firms’ profits can decrease with consumers’ desire for sustainability but increase with consumers’ dislike for sustainability. Third, we clarify when and why enforcing minimal sustainability standards for products can backfire and reduce consumer surplus. Finally, we extend the model to capture additional facets of sustainable consumption, such as multiproduct firms, sustainable luxury goods, and political orientation of consumers, and tease out its counterintuitive implications for the firms supplying sustainable products.

However, how an expert constructs a specific set of recommendations and how it subsequently affects consumer choices and outcomes have been understudied. We propose an empirical framework that econometrically recovers experts’ recommendations and combines them with heterogeneous consumers’ choice of products or services. We then apply the framework to examine kidney disease patients’ choice of dialysis facilities. Using detailed data on more than 16,900 U.S. patients with kidney disease who had consultations with over 750 physicians between 2015 and 2017, we study physicians’ dialysis facility recommendations and patients’ subsequent choice of facilities. We find that physicians are more likely to recommend facilities with which they are affiliated and those close to patients. Policy simulations suggest that quality information provision through five-star ratings has likely lowered mortality, thereby helping patients. In contrast, reducing conflicts of interest by banning the usage of affiliation as a basis for physicians’ facility recommendations can inadvertently hurt patients as evidenced by an increase in mortality. The study provides relevant consumer-centric insights into recent efforts to change market regulations and policies in this healthcare market. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Modern media firms require automated and efficient methods to identify content that is most engaging and appealing to users. Leveraging a large-scale data set from Upworthy (a news publisher), which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests, we first investigate the ability of three pure–large language model (LLM) approaches to identify the catchiest headline: prompt-based methods, embedding-based methods, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. Prompt-based approaches perform poorly, while both OpenAI embedding–based models and the fine-tuned Llama-3-8B achieve marginally higher accuracy than random predictions. In sum, none of the pure LLM–based methods can predict the best-performing headline with high accuracy. We then introduce the LLM-assisted online learning algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. LOLA combines the best pure-LLM approach with the upper confidence bound algorithm to allocate traffic and maximize clicks adaptively. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B test method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic. Our approach is scalable and applicable to content experiments across various settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.

  abstract     = {Mass shootings in the United States have become more frequent, often targeting retail locations such as shopping malls that attract high foot traffic. We combine detailed data on mass shootings with debit and credit card transaction data at individual stores to assess the economic impact of mass shootings. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that affected stores experience lower demand, smaller order sizes, decreased foot traffic, and reduced customer dwell times, resulting in a significant decline in retail revenues. We also find the impact of mass shootings diminishes with distance, adversely affecting stores within a radius of up to 1.25 miles. Additionally, we examine the likelihood of store closures after incidents and factors contributing to store survival. Overall, we estimate the annual economic cost of mass shootings at $27 billion in lost revenues to retail businesses. Consistent with consumers’ fear and safety concerns, we observe heterogeneous effects by business type (e.g., nonessential stores are more impacted than essential stores), channel substitution from in-person to online shopping, and moderation by local exposure to gun-related violence.

We make four key points. First, data-based personalized marketing is not automatically harmful. Second, consumers have heterogeneous privacy preferences, and privacy policies may unintentionally favor the preferences of the rich. Third, privacy regulations may stifle innovation by entrepreneurs who are more likely to cater to underserved, niche consumer segments. Fourth, privacy measures may favor large companies who have less need for third-party data and can afford compliance costs.

  abstract     = {In e-commerce, product returns have become a costly and escalating issue for retailers. Beyond the financial implications for businesses, product returns also lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and the squandering of natural resources. Traditional approaches, such as charging customers for returns, have proven largely ineffective in curbing returns, thus calling for more nuanced strategies to tackle this issue. This paper investigates the effectiveness of informing consumers about the negative environmental consequences of product returns (“green nudging”) to curtail product returns through a large-scale randomized field experiment ( n = 117,304) conducted with a leading European fashion retailer’s online store. Our findings indicate that implementing green nudging can decrease product returns by 2.6% without negatively impacting sales. We then develop and assess a causal machine learning model designed to identify treatment heterogeneities and personalize green nudging (i.e., make nudging “smart”). Our off-policy evaluation indicates that this personalization can approximately double the success of green nudging. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of both subtle marketing interventions and personalization using causal machine learning in mitigating environmentally and economically harmful product returns, thus highlighting the feasibility of employing “Better Marketing for a Better World” approaches in a digital setting.

  abstract     = {Banning of books has become increasingly prevalent and politically polarizing in the United States. Although the primary goal of these bans is to restrict access to books, conversations about the bans have garnered attention on a wider scale. This increased attention to bans can either have a chilling effect or can influence consumers to read the banned books. In this study, we use a novel, large-scale data set of U.S. library book circulations and evaluate the impact of high-profile book bans on the consumption of banned books. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that the circulations of banned books increased by 12%, on average, compared with comparable nonbanned titles after the ban. We also find that banning a book in a state leads to increased circulation in states without bans. We show that the increase in consumption is driven by books from lesser-known authors, suggesting that new and unknown authors stand to gain from the increasing consumer support. Additionally, our results demonstrate that books with higher visibility on social media following the ban see an increase in consumption, suggesting a pivotal role played by social media. Using patron-level data from the Seattle Public Library that include the borrower’s age, we provide suggestive evidence that the increase in readership in the aggregate data is driven, in part, by children reading a book more once it is banned. Using data on campaign emails sent to potential donors subscribed to politicians’ mailing lists, we show a significant increase in mentions of book ban-related topics in fundraising emails sent by Republican candidates. We also provide suggestive evidence on the impact of the rhetoric around these events on donations received by politicians. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

To this end, we collect novel high-frequency data from Twitch.tv , a major video game streaming platform, by monitoring live streams of 60,000 popular streamers every 10 minutes for eight months. To estimate the effect of live streaming, we leverage these high-frequency data and isolate plausibly exogenous within-day variation in the broadcast hours of top influencers. We find that the number of people watching a game in live streams increases the concurrent number of people playing it with an elasticity of 0.027, a moderate effect that dissipates within a few hours. Investigating the mechanisms behind live streaming effects, we find evidence that live streams make consumers aware of games by lesser-known publishers and reveal the quality and match value of games to consumers. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, despite the general excitement about live stream promotions in this industry, only about one sixth of all games profit from sponsored live streams.

  abstract     = {Policymakers have mandated food labeling standards, for example, through the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. However, many claims made by firms are voluntary, such as when they label products as containing “low calories” and “no high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).” This paper examines whether the use of voluntary labels can help consumers make more informed choices, or if labels lead consumers to ignore other relevant product characteristics, resulting in choices that can be harmful. With theory providing both types of predictions, we empirically analyze firm- and consumer-side behavior, focusing on the specific case of the “no HFCS” label and the corresponding sugar content—an increasingly policy-relevant product characteristic—of such products. We first document common firm practices in the industry across various product categories where the use of the label is prevalent. We then examine consumer search and purchase behavior through an incentive-aligned experiment. We find that products with the “no HFCS” label are less healthy, containing more sugars, than others, and that certain subsets of consumers search less and buy nutritionally worse products in the presence of voluntary labels. Our findings inform both managers and policymakers about whether and how voluntary labels should be displayed. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {If a buying firm employs an agent to conduct a procurement process, then sellers might be tempted to bribe the agent in order to win the contract. As a consequence, the procurement outcome can be inefficient (i.e., a low-quality product is purchased). This paper shows under which conditions sellers’ delegation to stooges mitigates or aggravates the inefficiency problem. Delegation will be efficiency-enhancing if the stooge’s and the delegating seller’s joint loss from detected corruption is sufficiently large compared with the respective loss of a non-delegating seller. Intuitively, the probability of inefficient procurement increases with the intensity of the bribing competition, and large losses mitigate this intensity. If all parties on the sell side that are involved in corruption suffer similar losses under delegation and nondelegation, then the condition for an efficiency-enhancing effect of stooges is clearly satisfied. The theoretical analysis also shows that, in contrast to the strategic-delegation literature, overall delegation is not an equilibrium outcome because bribing is a hidden action and sellers dislike leaving positive rents to stooges who are protected by limited liability. Finally, this paper derives the buying firm’s optimal reserve price and incentive pay for its agent to prevent an inefficient procurement outcome for sure.

  abstract     = {What are the causal effects of the closure of a store on a retail chain’s overall, offline, and online sales? We address this central research question using sales, shopper transaction, and mobile app usage data from a large retail chain that closed 34 stores across states in a month. We use the difference-in-differences approach, creating propensity score-matched control counties and controlling for selection. We examine potential moderators of these effects and underlying mechanisms using individual shopper-level and mobile app user-level data, including analyzing app engagement through topic modeling. Our findings reveal that closing a store opens a Pandora’s box in that it triggers significant net monthly sales loss of $209,317 (more than the average monthly sales of the closed store), representing 18.7% of the retailer’s net sales in the county with the closed store because of spillover effects on other channel purchases by the retailer’s customers in that county. The numbers of the retailer’s active customers, new customers, active app users, new app users, and their mobile app engagement all decline postclosure. Store closure has a negative spillover effect on even nearby shoppers who never shopped at the closed store. Loyal shoppers among nonvisitors to the closed store and app users are more tolerant of store closure than other shoppers. To mitigate adverse effects, retail chains can strategically choose stores closer to other stores in the chain, with a high percentage of in-store discounts and online sales, and a low value of product returns to close. Additionally, they can redirect shoppers in affected counties to the chain’s nearby stores and online (in particular, the mobile app) by offering discounts and promoting store and product information in the app. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

We show that the net result of these forces may lead to either shorter or longer product lines and higher or lower prices and profits depending on the distribution of product valuations across consumers. In the case of full market participation/coverage and many firms, we provide a simple function of value distribution (and discuss its relation to the hazard rate) that can guide managers in understanding the directional impact of consumer search costs on firms’ product line length. Lower search costs lead to longer product lines if the value distribution has a nonincreasing hazard rate (e.g., Exponential or Pareto distributions) but are a force toward shorter product lines under Normal, Logistic, or Gumbel-Minimum distributions. Gumbel-Maximum is the borderline case resulting in a net zero effect. Under Uniform distribution, prices and product lines are inverted-U shaped in the search costs. We separately consider the implications of consumers’ market participation decisions for firms’ product line strategy. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

Taking the context of a French car-sharing platform for which we have historical data, we lay out a random coefficient logit model of spatial demand combined with a Bertrand model of price competition between providers. Sparsity brings challenges in demand estimation; we resolve them through an approximation that brings new insights on a recent model with Poisson consumer arrivals. We then perform counterfactuals to evaluate the incremental value brought by existing potential providers to the platform. The results show that ignoring externalities between providers leads to large biases: provider incremental values are overestimated by 40% on average, and customer scorings are substantially impacted, resulting in suboptimal reward allocation. We also evaluate the potential impact of an advertising campaign to illustrate how our approach can be used to target acquisitions in specific locations, and we study the impact of activities that may increase the value of existing providers through price and/or location changes.

However, managers often worry that this supply relationship may give their competitor valuable knowledge about new product innovations. We develop a two-period model in which a firm can buy an input from a competitor or a third party in each period. In order to innovate, the firm must invest in improving the input, which results in its supplier learning to produce a higher quality input. We show that buying from the competitor: (i) increases short-term profits by softening price competition and (ii) may reduce long-term profits by preventing investment in innovation. Our results imply that the classic holdup problem, which leads to underinvestment in innovation, becomes more severe when a firm buys from its competitor who benefits from knowledge spillover.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of online news aggregators has intensified the debate over whether they should compensate news publishers for redistributing news content. Regulators worldwide are working to develop policies that balance the interests of both parties. However, there is limited understanding of the impact of carrying news on news aggregators, especially on their non-news content. Our research fills this gap by examining the impact of news on non-news user engagement and content generation on Facebook. We utilize a natural experiment—the Facebook Australia news shutdown in 2021—and apply a difference-in-differences approach to quantify these effects. We find that, in the short run, both user engagement and content generation of non-news content on Facebook decreased after the news shutdown. Moreover, the effects were more pronounced for non-news posts with negative sentiment and higher popularity as well as for non-news accounts that are more socially active, experienced, and verified.

  abstract     = {We study the effectiveness of personalized video advertisements created using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). We run a mobile ad targeting field experiment on WhatsApp in partnership with a leading direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand that sells eco-friendly sustainable products. We randomize users into receiving ads from one of three targeting conditions: (1) GenAI-based personalized video ads, (2) personalized image ads, and (3) generic nonpersonalized video ads. The first group is our main treatment, and the latter two serve as baselines. In the personalized treatment conditions, ad content is tailored to individual purchase histories, whereas in the generic treatment condition, a uniform brand message is delivered to all users. Our results show that GenAI-based personalized video ads increase engagement by six to nine percentage points over the baselines. These gains are robust across consumer demographics such as gender and location. We use back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight substantial cost savings and productivity benefits of GenAI-based personalized ad campaigns. We discuss the implications of our findings for businesses and policymakers while noting the potential variation in effectiveness and generalizability of GenAI applications across marketing contexts.

  abstract     = {The article by Amaldoss and He [Amaldoss W, He C (2013) Pricing prototypical products. Marketing Sci. 32(5):733–752] investigates how prototypicality changes the competitive behavior of firms in a horizontally differentiated market. Their study extends the spokes model by considering the asymmetry between the prototypical and nonprototypical products in terms of the probabilities of being included in consumers’ consideration sets. Their analyses show that when consumer valuations are low (moderately high), the prototypical product charges a lower (higher) price than a nonprototypical product. However, the asymmetric probabilities are overlooked when characterizing the demand for the prototypical product. With the correct demand function, we show that whether the prototypical product is priced lower depends on consumer valuations as well as the level of prototypicality, and the prototypical product can charge a lower price even when consumer valuations are moderately high. One should use extra caution when characterizing demands in the spokes model with asymmetric probabilities. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {The most recent artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms lack interpretability. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to address this by explaining AI decisions to customers. Although it is commonly believed that the requirement of fully transparent XAI enhances consumer surplus, our paper challenges this view. We present a game-theoretic model where a policymaker maximizes consumer surplus in a duopoly market with heterogeneous customer preferences. Our model integrates AI accuracy, explanation depth, and method. We find that partial explanations can be an equilibrium in an unregulated setting. Furthermore, we identify scenarios where customers’ and firms’ desires for full explanation are misaligned. In these cases, regulating full explanations may not be socially optimal and could worsen the outcomes for firms and consumers. Flexible XAI policies outperform both full transparency and unregulated extremes. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We study a scenario in which a consumer has uncertain match with a product but can conduct costly prepurchase search to resolve this match. The firm selling the product jointly decides its price and return policy to maximally extract surplus by strategically managing who bears the cost of resolving the match, and when it is resolved. If the consumer’s search cost is low relative to the firm’s return processing cost, the firm induces the consumer to search and bear the cost of resolving the match before making the purchase decision. However, if search cost is high enough, the firm offers a return policy such that match is resolved after the purchase decision and the firm bears the processing cost of an unmatched returned product. By allowing search to be potentially inconclusive, we show that active search and returning may coexist and, in fact, be complementary such that offering a partial-refund return policy can encourage search and more efficient search can result in more returns due to a more lenient return policy. The firm finds it optimal to add restrictive clauses to the return policy along with offering free returns, and the presence of these clauses induces consumers to resolve match by conducting prepurchase search. In addition to providing novel insights into the interplay between search and returns, our model explains a wide range of pricing and return policies used by firms, and associated search and return behaviors of consumers.

To examine this tension, we developed a game-theoretic model that captures the rich interactions among creators, the platform, and viewers. We show that when view allocation leans more toward content promotion, it does not necessarily lead creators to increase their promotion expenses, and it can result in either lower or higher equilibrium content quality. Furthermore, the platform should offer content promotion only when content production is cost-effective for creators and when the total number of creators is moderate. Finally, we find that the platform should avoid combining revenue sharing with content promotion, and that interplatform competition may result in more promotion-oriented view allocation and lower content quality compared with a monopoly platform.

An increasingly popular approach is enabling content creators to offer paid content directly to viewers. This paper studies whether giving creators the option of providing paid content influences their incentives to contribute free content. Our setting is an online knowledge-sharing platform, which started out as a Q&A community based on users’ voluntary contributions and later introduced a program that allows participants to monetize their expertise by hosting paid live events. We find that participant motivations for contributing answers are rekindled after the program announcement, whereas the contributions of the nonparticipants continue to decrease. Further analysis shows that the motivating effect of program announcement is more pronounced for less established participants or participants facing more intense competition. Moreover, we show that participants adjust their answer contributions according to the time and topics of their paid events. These results suggest that participants strategically leverage free content to boost their reputation and attract “eyeballs” for their paid content.

  abstract     = {Workers often possess characteristics such as soft skills that are important for teamwork but unobserved by managers. In this paper, we develop a teamwork model based on the econometric teamwork framework in Bonhomme [Bonhomme S (2021) Teams: Heterogeneity, sorting, and complementarity. Becker Friedman Institute for Economics Working Paper No. 2021-15, University of Chicago, Chicago] and stochastic blockmodels for binary outcomes (e.g., Bickel et al. [Bickel P, Choi D, Chang X, Zhang H (2013) Asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood and its variational approximation for stochastic blockmodels. Ann. Statist. 41(4):1922–1943]) when only team-level outputs are observed. Our model does not impose any functional form restrictions on the complementarity between workers with unobserved characteristics, which are modeled as latent types. We apply our model to a data set from a leading Chinese real estate company; the data contain the complete history of team assignments, team performances, and property details. We find that complementarities between different agent types are heterogeneous and cannot be captured by commonly used production functions. More specifically, workers with intermediate solo performance complement all other workers the most, whereas those with the best solo performance are not the best team players. Our results suggest that firms can boost productivity by redesigning teams without incurring additional hiring costs. Leveraging our complementarity estimates, our counterfactual experiments demonstrate that reorganizing teams could enhance overall team output by up to 26.6%.

  abstract     = {This paper studies how the growth and evolution of product assortments impact consumer adoption, churn, and purchase frequency. Most economic theories of product variety and the value of platforms suggest consumers at least weakly prefer larger product assortments. In contrast, the psychological literature on the phenomenon of choice overload finds that larger assortments overwhelm consumers with decision costs or induce more regret. I provide empirical evidence of how the size and contents of product assortments impact consumers across their lifetime on an online food delivery platform. I find that assortment expansion increases the acquisition of new consumers but reduces the frequency of consumption among consumers who remain on the platform. I rationalize these effects on returning customers via a model of costly attention and choice under limited information. Counterfactual exercises show that targeting choice set reductions can improve revenue among existing customers. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Gamification has gained significant attention in marketing. While previous research has primarily focused on the short-term effects of implementing gamification, this study explores the discontinuation of gamification in financial services and how it affects previously incentivized behaviors. We leverage a data set from a prominent Latin American bank that had incentivized behaviors in its app through a reward module with prize wheels, raffles, and points. Unexpectedly, the reward module was temporarily stopped due to a lapse in government licensing; a unique natural experiment. Using age-period-cohort models, we examine whether gamification had a causal impact on the behaviors the bank intended to motivate, and whether it was necessary to continue gamification to maintain these behaviors over time. We find that the reward module incentivized the desired behaviors, and its discontinuation caused these behaviors to decline. This effect was stronger for newer customers, and increased over time, further highlighting the need to maintain these behaviors. We also find that both cash rewards and module engagement played distinct roles in influencing user behavior, and examine the impact of different game-design element outcomes on engagement.

Complaints after the redesign were shorter and easier to read, which may indicate that the redesign induced less sophisticated consumers to complain.

  abstract     = {This study examines the impact of a query recommender system on user search behavior, sales volume, and consumption diversity within a leading mobile food delivery app in Asia. We find that access to a query recommender increases consumer purchase volumes by 1%–2% over 30 days while broadening consumption diversity at both the individual and market levels. Exploring the mechanisms by which these effects arise, we highlight the complementary, balancing role of query auto-completion features. Whereas the query recommender helps to expand a user’s consideration set by suggesting alternative and adjacent queries, the auto-complete feature helps to extend and refine the queries in a personalized manner. Our findings highlight the potential of query recommenders for increasing demand while enhancing consumer exploration and consumption diversity, particularly when deployed in tandem with auto-complete. Our study contributes to the literature on search behavior and recommendation systems, offering actionable insights for platform managers into the strategic design and integration of query recommenders to improve user engagement and market outcomes.

  abstract     = {We study the disclosure of influencer posts on Twitter across a large set of brands based on a unique data set of over 100 million posts and a novel classification method to detect undisclosed sponsorship. Using our preferred empirical specification, we find that 96% of sponsored posts are not disclosed. This result is robust to a series of specification tests, and even a lower-bound classification still yields an undisclosed share of 82%. Despite stronger enforcement of disclosure regulations, the share of undisclosed posts decreases only slightly over time. Compared with disclosed posts, undisclosed posts tend to be associated with young brands with a large Twitter following. Using an online survey, we find that many consumers are not able to identify sponsored content without disclosure. Our findings highlight a potential need for further regulatory scrutiny and suggest that researchers studying influencers must account for undisclosed sponsored content.

We construct both state- and county-month panel data sets covering 2010 to 2017, using background checks and online firearm retail purchase data. We find that CCW Shall Issue adoption increases gun purchases, particularly new handguns. Over 70% of this increase is driven by repeat gun buyers. The increase in handguns induced by CCW Shall Issue is substantially greater in high-crime and urban areas. In contrast, CCW Permitless Carry has no effect on gun purchases.

However, finding an intervention that improves all desired outcomes is often rare, creating a trade-off for managers and decision makers. In this paper, we develop a multiobjective personalization framework that identifies personalized policies to balance multiple objectives at the individual level. We apply our framework to a canonical example of multiobjective conflict between sponsored and organic content consumption outcomes. Partnering with vdo.ai , we conduct a field experiment and randomly assign users to the skippable/long and nonskippable/short versions of the same ad. We document substantial substitution between sponsored and organic content consumption; the version that increases sponsored consumption reduces organic consumption. We find that multiobjective personalized policies can significantly improve both sponsored and organic consumption outcomes over single-objective policies. We show that compared with a single-objective policy optimized for organic consumption, there exists a multiobjective policy that increases sponsored consumption by 61% at the expense of only a 4% decrease in organic consumption. Similarly, compared with the single-objective policy optimized for sponsored consumption, there is a multiobjective policy that increases organic consumption by 53% while decreasing sponsored consumption by just 15%.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the measurement of advertising effects on online platforms when parallel experimentation occurs, that is, when multiple advertisers experiment concurrently. It provides a framework that makes precise how parallel experimentation affects the experiment’s value: while ignoring parallel experimentation yields an estimate of the average effect of advertising in place, which has limited value in decision making in an environment with variable advertising competition, accounting for parallel experimentation captures the actual uncertainty advertisers face due to competitive actions. It then implements an experimental design that enables the estimation of these effects on JD.com, a large e-commerce platform that is also a publisher of digital ads. Using traditional and kernel-based estimators, it shows that not accounting for competitive actions can result in the advertiser inaccurately estimating the advertising lift by a factor of two or higher, which can be consequential for decision making.

  abstract     = {Grocery retailers cannot engage in inventory-based pricing without physically auditing their shelves because their inventory records are inaccurate and incomplete. In particular, inventory data do not reflect actual, real-time quantity on the shelf, and standard Universal Product Code barcodes do not contain expiration dates. We argue that these inventory information frictions are much more powerful in explaining price rigidity in perishable groceries than physical menu costs are. We build our argument in two steps. First, we add inventory shrink, deteriorating product quality, and menu costs to [Gallego G, Van Ryzin G (1994) Optimal dynamic pricing of inventories with stochastic demand over finite horizons. Management Sci. 40(8):999–1020] classic revenue-management model, and we derive the model’s optimal pricing policy when the price setter can and cannot condition on real-time inventory information. Within the model, reducing a representative product’s physical menu cost by 90% increases its price-updating frequency by at least 300% more when pricing managers also have real-time inventory information than when they do not. Second, we provide proof of concept for our theory with data from two industry pilots: a UK grocery store that installed electronic shelf labels (ESLs)—a technology that reduces physical menu costs—and an EU grocery store that installed both ESLs and expanded barcodes—the latter being a technology that reduces inventory information frictions. Consistent with our theory, the technology upgrade increased price-updating frequency by 54% in the first pilot and by 853% in the second pilot. Our theory can explain the lack of widespread dynamic pricing of perishable groceries, which has significant consequences for profits, consumer surplus, and food waste.

  abstract     = {We study an advertiser’s targeting strategy and its effects on consumer data privacy choices, both of which determine the advertiser’s targeting accuracy. Targeted ads, serving as implicit recommendations when consumer preferences are uncertain, not only influence the consumer’s beliefs and purchasing decisions, but also amplify the advertiser’s temptation toward strategic mistargeting: sending ads to poorly matched consumers. Our analysis reveals that advertisers may, paradoxically, choose less precise targeting as accuracy improves. Even if prediction is perfect, the advertiser still targets the wrong consumers, leading to strategic mistargeting. Nevertheless, consumer surplus can remain positive because of improved identification of well-matched consumers, thereby reducing the incentive for consumers to withhold information. However, the scenario shifts with endogenous pricing; better prediction leads to more precise targeting although mistargeting persists. To exploit the recommendation effect of advertising, the advertiser raises prices instead of diluting recommendation power, lowering consumer welfare and prompting consumers to opt out of data collection. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of consumer data opt-out decisions under varying privacy policy defaults (opt in versus opt out). These decisions significantly affect equilibrium outcomes, influencing both the advertiser’s targeting strategies and consumer welfare. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between targeting accuracy, privacy choices, and advertisers’ incentives. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {Firms must often decide whether to disclose private information regarding their costs to other market participants. Although extant literature has explored firms’ incentives to disclose exogenous and uncertain costs, little is known about when their endogenous costs should be disclosed. This paper studies the cost-disclosure strategies of competing firms whose inputs are sourced from and endogenously priced by upstream suppliers. We find, first, that cost disclosure affects not only market competition but also the motivations of suppliers in setting their input prices. As such, firms can strategize their disclosure decisions to optimize their procurement costs. Second, we find that firms’ disclosure decisions vary depending on both the nature of the competition and the market structure at hand. That is, when competing firms source from the same supplier or compete on price, they never disclose their costs; in such a case, nondisclosure is strictly better for consumers and welfare compared with disclosure. When competing firms source from different suppliers and compete on quantity, they always disclose; in such a case, disclosure is strictly better for consumers and welfare compared with nondisclosure. We also find that whereas manufacturers’ disclosure incentives are misaligned with those of suppliers, they are largely aligned with the goal of maximizing channel profits. Together, our results underscore the distinct role that endogenous costs play in firms’ disclosure decisions. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought the availability of diagnostic tests to the forefront of public attention and highlighted the prevalence of undertesting (i.e., insufficient test supply relative to demand). Another important yet little studied systematic issue is overdiagnosis (i.e., positive diagnoses for patients with negligible viral loads); evidence suggests that U.S. laboratories have adopted highly sensitive diagnosis criteria such that up to an estimated 90% of positive diagnoses are for minuscule viral loads. Motivated by this situation, we develop a theory of diagnostic testing for infectious diseases that explains both undertesting and overdiagnosis. We show that a commercial laboratory has an incentive to inflate its diagnosis criterion, which generates a higher diagnosis-driven demand as a result of contact-tracing efforts, albeit while dampening demand from disease transmission. An inflated diagnosis criterion prompts the laboratory to build a higher testing capacity, which may not fully absorb the inflated demand, so undertesting arises. Finally, we examine a social planner’s problem of whether to mandate that the laboratory report the viral load along with its diagnosis so that a physician or contact tracer can make informed triage decisions. Our results show that the social planner may choose not to mandate viral-load reporting initially; this choice induces a higher testing capacity and can help reduce disease transmission.

  abstract     = {The role of advertising as an implicit price has long been recognized in economics and marketing, yet the effects of personalizing these implicit prices on firm profits and consumer welfare have not been explored. Using a large-scale field experiment on Pandora, we exogenously changed the ad load—the number of ads played per hour—for more than seven million users over 18 months. We find that the impact of ad load on consumption takes more than a year to stabilize, whereas subscription responses stabilize in less than six months. Using a machine-learning model, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of changing ad load on ad and subscription revenues. We then show that reallocating ads across users can enhance subscription profits by 7% without decreasing overall advertising profits. To achieve the same subscription rate with a uniform ad allocation policy, the firm would need to increase ad load by more than 22%. Our results show that, on average, consumer welfare drops by 2% with the proposed personalization strategy, and the effect seems to be more pronounced for users who have a higher willingness to pay.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to enhance our understanding of customer loyalty and its implications on firm profits. Factors such as favorable brand attitudes and switching costs may drive customer loyalty, which is often considered a strong indicator of a firm’s profitability. However, empirical findings on the profitability of customer loyalty are inconsistent, and a comprehensive framework to analyze the connection between customer loyalty and firm profits is still lacking. This paper fills this gap by proposing an analytical framework that characterizes how repeat-purchase loyalty is generated from consumer choice in a dynamic competition environment. It also examines the impact of brand preference and switching costs on firm profits and customer loyalty. Our findings suggest that strong brand preference can either increase or decrease customer loyalty, depending on the stability of consumer preferences over time, and when it increases loyalty, such loyalty is profitable for firms. Conversely, if customer loyalty is primarily driven by habitual buyers who are simply avoiding switching costs, this type of loyalty is not profitable for firms.

  abstract     = {Product safety is jointly determined by product quality and consumers’ precaution efforts when using products. Product failures because of either party’s negligence can cause deaths and injuries. The strict liability rule holds firms fully responsible for damages, whereas the comparative negligence rule allocates responsibilities based on the firm’s negligence in product quality and the consumer’s negligence in precaution efforts. This paper examines how these two common product liability rules affect firms and consumers when firms can advertise product quality deceptively and consumers exert precaution efforts endogenously. Common wisdom suggests that the comparative negligence rule shifts responsibility from firms to consumers, which benefits firms and motivates consumers to exert precautions to improve safety. However, we find that comparative negligence incentivizes firms to use deceptive advertising, whereas strict liability induces firms to advertise low product quality more truthfully. The latter can induce consumers to exert precaution efforts to avoid product failures, thereby improving firm profit and product safety. Moreover, raising firms’ penalties or the amount that firms compensate consumers for product failures can benefit firms but reduce consumer surplus and product safety. These findings caution public policymakers and firms that with asymmetric information about product quality and endogenous precaution efforts, liability policies can lead to unintended consequences.

  abstract     = {Third-party cookies and related “offsite” tracking technologies are frequently used to share user data across applications in support of ad delivery. These data are viewed as highly valuable for online advertisers, but their usage faces increasing headwinds. In this paper, we quantify the benefit to advertisers from using such offsite tracking data in their ad delivery. With this goal in mind, we conduct a large-scale, randomized experiment that includes more than 70,000 advertisers on Facebook and Instagram. We first estimate advertising effectiveness at baseline across our broad sample. We then estimate the change in effectiveness of the same campaigns were advertisers to lose the ability to optimize ad delivery with offsite data. In each of these cases, we use recently developed deconvolution techniques to flexibly estimate the underlying distribution of effects. We find a median cost per incremental customer at baseline of $38.16 that under the median loss in effectiveness would rise to $49.93, a 31% increase. Further, we find ads targeted using offsite data generate more long-term customers per dollar than those without, and losing offsite data disproportionately hurts small scale advertisers. Taken together, our results suggest that offsite data bring large benefits to a wide range of advertisers. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {Many ads are engaging, but what makes them engaging may have little to do with the product. This problem can be particularly relevant to influencer advertising if influencers are motivated to promote themselves, not just the product. We develop an algorithm to measure the degree of effective engagement associated with the product and use it to predict the sales lift of influencer video advertising. We propose the concept of the product engagement score (PE score) to capture how engaging the product itself is as presented in a video. We estimate pixel-level engagement as a saliency map by training a deep three-dimensional convolutional neural network on video-level engagement data. We locate pixel-level product placement with an object detection algorithm. The PE score is computed as the pixel-level, engagement-weighted product placement in a video. We construct and validate the algorithm with influencer video ads on TikTok and product sales data on Taobao. We use variation in video posting time to identify video-specific sales lift and show that the PE score significantly and robustly predicts sales lift. We explore drivers of engagement and discuss how various stakeholders in influencer advertising can use the PE score in a scalable way to manage content, align incentives, and improve efficiency.

  abstract     = {The consumption of digital content products (e.g., video games and live streaming) is often associated with multifaceted, dynamically interacting consumer behavior that is subject to influence from pertinent external events. Inspired by these characteristics, we develop a novel attention-based neural point process approach to holistically capture the richness and complexity of consumer behavioral dynamics in modern digital content consumption. Our model features a new multirepresentational, continuous-time attention mechanism that can flexibly model dynamic interactions between different types of behavior under external influence. Using learned representations as sufficient statistics of past events, we build a marked point process to efficiently characterize the occurrence time, behavior combination, and consumption quantity of consumers’ future activities. We illustrate our model development and applications in the empirical context of a sports video game, showing its superior predictive performance over a wide range of baseline methods. Leveraging individual-level parameter estimates, we further demonstrate our model’s utility for conducting segmentation analysis and evaluating the effects of past events on consumers’ future engagement. Our model provides managers and practitioners with a powerful tool for developing more effective and targeted marketing strategies and gaining insights into consumer behavioral dynamics in digital content consumption.

We design novel CNN filters that leverage the frequency harmonics structure from acoustic physics known to impact the perception of musical features. Our theory-based model is more parsimonious, but it provides comparable predictive performance with atheoretical deep learning models while performing better than models using handcrafted features. Our model can be complemented with handcrafted features, but the performance improvement is marginal. Importantly, the harmonics-based structure placed on the CNN filters provides better explainability for how the model predicts emotional response (valence and arousal) because emotion is closely related to consonance—a perceptual feature defined by the alignment of harmonics. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our model with an application involving digital advertising. Motivated by YouTube’s midroll ads, we conduct a laboratory experiment in which we exogenously insert ads at different times within videos. We find that ads placed in emotionally similar contexts increase ad engagement (lower skip rates and higher brand recall rates). Ad insertion based on emotional similarity metrics predicted by our theory-based, explainable model produces comparable or better engagement relative to atheoretical models.

Assessing the effectiveness of such advertising remains a challenge in research and practice. This paper proposes a new approach to perform causal inference on advertising bought through such mechanisms. Leveraging the economic structure of first- and second-price auctions, we establish novel results that show how the effects of advertising are connected to and, hence, identified from optimal bids. Importantly, we also outline the precise conditions under which these relationships hold. Because these optimal bids are required to estimate the effects of advertising, we present an adapted Thompson Sampling algorithm to solve a multiarmed bandit problem that succeeds in recovering such bids and, consequently, the effects of advertising, while minimizing the costs of experimentation. We also show that a greedy variant of this algorithm can perform just as well, if not better, when exploiting the structure of the model we consider. We use data from real-time bidding auctions to show that it outperforms commonly used methods to estimate the effects of advertising.

  abstract     = {Customer reviews help communicate product information, but their effectiveness may suffer from selection bias (i.e., depending on factors, such as the individual experience and price, not all consumers may voluntarily write reviews). Consequently, a seller may have to resort to additional means (e.g., signaling through price in the context of an experience good) to convey its quality. This paper develops an analytical model to investigate the interaction of customer reviews and price with the presence of selection bias in marketing an experience good with uncertain quality to consumers. Our analysis reveals the dual roles played by both customer reviews and price in communicating quality information. On one hand, customer reviews may either directly convey product information with unbiased distribution of reviews or facilitate price signaling when reviews are biased because of selection. On the other hand, price may be adjusted to mitigate the selection bias of reviews to make them more informative, and it may also signal quality directly in the presence of review bias. As a result, we show that bias in reviews may actually benefit consumers without compromising information communication as the incentive to reduce review selection bias makes it credible and profitable for the high-quality seller to signal its type by undercutting the price that would be set if it is of low quality. We then extend our analysis to examine the information, profits, and welfare impacts of several important design elements of a review system as well as the impact of consumers’ aversion to risk. Finally, the implications of our findings on the management of user-generated content and pricing are discussed. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor. Funding: J.

  abstract     = {Academics and practitioners acknowledge the value of customer feedback in improving firm performance. Companies routinely solicit feedback from different customer subsets. However, the extent to which this feedback impacts nonsolicited customers depends on whether firms implement meaningful business-level changes that resonate with customers. This paper assesses customer feedback’s impact on firm learning and business improvements as well as its spillover effects on nonsolicited customers using a randomized, controlled field experiment conducted in Rwanda over two years. We hypothesize that private feedback seeking could operate through two broad mechanisms: (a) directly influencing solicited customers and/or (b) prompting firms to improve their offerings, leading to spillover effects on other customers. Our results demonstrate a 38.2% increase in recall and a 77.4% increase in purchases for customers not engaged in the feedback process. The analysis further suggests that business-level changes driven by customer feedback fuel these spillovers. Additionally, customer feedback seeking significantly improves treatment firm performance, resulting in a 62.0% revenue increase and 54.5% profit increase compared with control firms. Our study also introduces a basic customer feedback-seeking technology for small businesses to improve performance. These findings can guide firms in leveraging customer feedback to undertake business changes and generate greater revenues/profits.

Training examples consist of datasets generated by the econometric model under a range of parameter values. The neural net takes the moments of a dataset as input and tries to recognize the parameter value underlying that dataset. Besides the point estimate, the neural net can also output statistical accuracy. This neural net estimator (NNE) tends to limited-information Bayesian posterior as the number of training datasets increases. We apply NNE to a consumer search model. It gives more accurate estimates at lighter computational costs than the prevailing approach. NNE is also robust to redundant moment inputs. In general, NNE offers the most benefits in applications where other estimation approaches require very heavy simulation costs. We provide code at: https://nnehome.github.io .

  abstract     = {Many digital platforms with large product assortments endorse a select group of items to facilitate user choice. However, although it seems intuitive that such endorsement may increase the sales of endorsed items, little is known about its effect on unendorsed items and on the platform. Using data from a field experiment conducted by an online freelance platform, we examine the effect of exposure to platform endorsement on user search and purchase behavior. We find that exposure to platform endorsement increases user search and purchases not only for endorsed services but also, for unendorsed services. We link the increase in search and purchases to an increase in the perception of the quality of services offered on the platform. We further explore heterogeneity in the effect of platform endorsement and find that the effect of exposure to platform endorsement on purchase is more pronounced for users with a higher propensity to purchase. We discuss implications for platforms, merchants, and regulators. History: Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the impact of using advanced technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) to match marketers with social media influencers. We develop a theoretical model to examine how matching accuracy affects the competition between influencers and the profitability of a social media platform. Our findings show that improving matching accuracy may not always benefit the platform, especially for platforms with intermediate follower density. Two opposing effects of technology improvement affect the prices of influencer marketing campaigns: advanced technology, such as AI, enhances the matching between influencers and marketers and also intensifies competition between different types of influencers. The overall effect on prices can be negative for some influencers because of the asymmetric nature of such matching technology: the matching outcome for influencers with a narrower audience (niche influencers) is more sensitive to matching accuracy than that for those with a broader audience (general influencers). As a result, more niche influencers begin to participate in marketing campaigns when matching accuracy improves, which reduces the prices offered by sufficiently general influencers and may lead to a decline in platform revenue. Additionally, we find that adjusting commission rates in response to technology improvements could help mitigate the negative impact although it may not eliminate it entirely. Our findings offer valuable insights for social media platforms seeking to remain competitive in the influencer marketing landscape. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We provide estimates of the drivers of playlist followers on Spotify. We base our analysis on a unique panel data set for 30,000+ popular playlists and combine it with data on how prominently these playlists are featured in the Spotify app. Using two-way fixed effects and staggered synthetic difference in difference models, we compare the short-term effect of two important demand factors in our data—featuring playlists on Spotify’s Search Page and adding songs by exceptionally popular major label artists to playlists. We find that users prefer to follow playlists featured in the app. According to our estimates, being featured on the Search Page raises daily playlist followers by 0.95%—which is about two times larger than the effect on followers of including a song by an exceptionally popular major label artist (0.45%). Our examination of playlist demand has two important implications. First, Spotify can effectively guide user attention to certain playlists, supporting industry executives’ and artists’ concerns that the platform has the potential to favor some producers by selectively promoting their content. Second, popular artists signed with major labels play an important role in attracting followers to playlists on Spotify. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {We develop an AI and AI-human-based model for salesforce hiring using recordings of conversational video interviews that involve two-sided, back-and-forth interactions with messages conveyed through multiple modalities (text, voice, and body language). We derive objective, theory-backed measures of sales performance from these modalities, leveraging recent advances in body language analysis, conversational analysis, and large language models (LLMs). These measures serve as explanatory variables in our AI model. Our key contribution to the broader research on persuasion and influence is that we show how to use conversational videos to capture features related to (i) two-way conversational interactivity; (ii) real-time adaptation; and (iii) human body language, with minimal measurement error relative to extant survey-based approaches that suffer from recall biases. We use rubric-based scores by panels of sales professionals (correlated with hiring decisions) to isolate a candidate’s “latent sales ability” and use these as outcome variables to be predicted by the AI model. The AI model achieves reasonable predictive accuracy, yet incorporating human judgments into an AI-human hybrid model enhances its effectiveness—improving workforce quality by 67% over random selection. Although the content of what is spoken is most important in prediction, conversational interactivity, sellers’ real-time adaptation to the buyer, and body language also have good explanatory power. Finally, in terms of performance-cost trade-offs, the addition of just one human professional evaluation in the hiring loop in combination with AI is optimal. Further, using human input based on only the two early stages of the interview in a task-based hybrid model is the most cost-effective in improving performance.

  abstract     = {Recommender systems play a vital role in driving the long-term values for online platforms. However, developing recommender systems for multi-sided platforms faces two prominent challenges. First, recommending for multi-sided platforms typically involves a joint optimization of multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. Second, many platforms adopt hierarchical homepages, where items can either be individual products or groups of products. Off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable in these settings. To address these challenges, we propose MOHR, a novel multi-objective hierarchical recommender. By combining machine learning, probabilistic hierarchical aggregation, and multi-objective optimization, MOHR efficiently solves the multi-objective ranking problem in a hierarchical setting through an innovative formulation of probabilistic consumer behavior modeling and constrained optimization. We implemented MOHR at Uber Eats, one of the world’s largest food delivery platforms. Online experiments showed significant improvements in consumer conversion, retention, and gross bookings, resulting in a $1.5 million weekly increase in revenue. Moreover, MOHR offers managers a mathematically principled tool to make quantifiable and interpretable trade-offs across multiple objectives. As a result, it has been deployed globally as the recommender system for Uber Eats’ app homepage. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor for this article.
