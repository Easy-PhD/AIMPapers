  abstract     = {In the freight transport spot market, carriers face several challenges, including handling small-sized loads, managing short lead times, and dealing with uncertainties that can disrupt their existing networks and capacity. In this context, auction platforms assist carriers in developing strategies to maintain productivity and service levels. This paper introduces the freight transportation game, an online auction-based platform specifically designed for the freight spot market. The game equips players, acting as carriers, with tools to develop transportation strategies, optimize routes, and propose competitive rates to maximize profits. Players engage in decision making and competition, with key performance indicators evaluating their decisions. The game includes two scenarios; the first helps students understand the operational challenges that carriers face in spot market auctions, whereas the second encourages cooperation to enhance performance and overcome obstacles. Designed for a three-hour session, the game can be integrated into courses on supply chain management or transportation systems. The practical learnings for students from the game include understanding the complexity of constructing transport plans, recognizing the challenges of using online auction-based platforms, and experiencing the difficulties of managing spot market requests despite their benefits.

  abstract     = {In view of the long wait times for women and the lack of accessibility for LGBTQ+ individuals when they use restrooms, this case provides a set of analytical tools to evaluate wait time disparity among users for different restroom configurations. A stadium manager who faces complaints about excessive restroom wait times aims to retrofit the restroom layout to improve both efficiency, measured in terms of wait time, and fairness, measured in terms of totalitarian and Rawlsian scores. Given that customers have diverse preferences over the use of restroom types, in three modules, students learn to (i) evaluate queuing parameters for a mix of heterogeneous populations, (ii) evaluate queuing metrics for various restroom layouts and discuss their wait time disparities, and (iii) evaluate and discuss the fairness of access to restroom facilities from a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) perspective. By completing this case, students gain an understanding of service systems, learn about process flexibility concepts, and become familiar with DEI concepts and measures. The primary objectives of the case for students are to understand the trade-offs between efficiency and fairness, develop an understanding of multiobjective problems, and improve their skills in employing queuing concepts and tools.

The case deals with the management of the food donation supply chain. The case, using a project-based approach, proposes a realistic scenario that simulates the consulting interaction with a nonprofit company, Logica&Co, which acts as a two-sided platform connecting supply and demand. The objective is to define an effective strategy to collect and deliver food donations, using either bike or e-bike, from local businesses to soup kitchens, covering a semester-long timeframe. The form of the problem exhibits nonlinear characteristics, but the design allows for adjustable difficulty levels. Students can assess their performance during the class period thanks to an interactive offline tool, the SoS simulator , which is publicly available for download and can be customized by instructors. The case was proposed as a competitive group challenge for students of the bachelor’s or master’s program in management engineering at Sapienza University of Rome. However, given the embedded characteristics of flexibility, it can be easily adjusted for heterogeneous curricula of undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in engineering programs (this opportunity is extensively discussed in the Case Article and the Teaching Note). The students appreciated both the teaching methodology and the teamwork aspects and highlighted the utility of the SoS simulator tool.

  abstract     = {Social justice considerations are critical in today’s engineering education. As an example, access to electricity will be crucial to the development of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by powering essential sectors and services that would yield economic growth and an improved quality of life. Because infrastructure investments are often allocated to urban areas, it is important for stakeholders to equally prioritize rural electrification in their efforts to achieve universal electrification. These stakeholders make decisions on allocating infrastructure investment based on their underlying values and preferences. It is therefore important to introduce and integrate ideas of fairness and social justice into the engineering curriculum. Our paper investigates the influence of social justice education on decision preferences among students tasked with planning electricity systems. We engaged graduate and undergraduate students in a discrete choice experiment to determine their preferences for equality. In our study, we find that an interactive social justice education module can be effective in increasing equality preferences among non–U.S.-citizen students by 22%. Among students with relatively low preferences for equality, we find that the education module was effective in increasing preference by 18% on average and up to 191%, which translated into more equitable resource allocation. As such, we show that an education intervention for stakeholders may be effective in improving equitable electrification in SSA. The preference elicitation and education module presented in this paper could be repurposed by instructors to include other contexts in their course content (e.g., money, water, housing, etc.) or to people wanting to educate decision makers about social justice.

ROAR is composed of three teaching units addressed to grades 10, 11, and 12, respectively. To improve students’ interest, motivation, and skills related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, ROAR integrates the teaching of mathematics and computer science through operations research. Its implementation started in 2021 in a grade 10 class at the scientific high school IIS Antonietti in Iseo (Brescia, Italy). We provided the details of the first two units in previous papers. Here, we focus on the third and last unit, carried out from October 2022 to January 2023, with the same students, then in a grade 12 class. Similarly to the first two units, we describe objectives, prerequisites, topics and methods, the organization of the lectures, digital technologies used, and a challenging final project that, this time, involved the manufacturer company Filtrec S.p.A. with a case. After analyzing the feedback from students, teachers, and practitioners engaged in the experimentation, we reflect on the entire experimentation and provide some insights to replicate a similar experience.

  abstract     = {This case asks students to solve a multiobjective optimization decision problem applied to school district zoning. In the case, residential areas in a school district must be assigned to middle schools having capacity limits. The operational considerations on the decision are the weighted distances traveled between students’ residences and their assigned middle school campuses. The ethical considerations pertain to equity in education and are measured using the numbers of economically disadvantaged students assigned to each middle school. This problem, including its two objectives, is motivated by a real zoning problem faced by a school district. Publicly available data from the school district and its rezoning efforts are used to populate the case. To complete the case, students model and solve an optimization problem both with and without the ethical considerations included. In doing so, they observe how ethical considerations can change the outputs generated by the optimization model. Evidence is provided from student surveys to indicate how completion of the case impacts perceptions of the importance of and understanding of how to include ethical considerations in optimization modeling. Results indicate statistically significant increases in those perceptions.

  abstract     = {The newsvendor model is widely used to teach decision making under uncertainty. Traditionally, analytical methods have been taught to determine the optimal order quantity that balances missed profit from ordering too few units against the cost of excess inventory from ordering too many. In practical settings, however, organizations must estimate these costs using censored data as only sales are observable in the data, not the true demand. Neglecting demand censoring can, therefore, lead to underestimating lost sales. These concepts can be difficult to grasp in a classroom setting. Hence, we developed a fun classroom challenge to simulate the newsvendor problem with data and demand censoring. In the challenge, students are provided with hypothetical, long-term sales data and are tasked with determining the optimal number of units to order per period. The challenge extends the traditional newsvendor model by including censored data such that traditional approaches result in suboptimal decisions. The challenge also emphasizes the importance between time spent on predictions (forecasting demand) and prescriptions (order decisions). The challenge can be adapted to diverse student cohorts, and experience reveals productive class discussions as students compete to determine the best order policies.

The game covers aspects of blending problems, production process problems, transportation problems, work scheduling problems, multiperiod production planning problems, and sensitivity analyses, all within a context that relates to a popular fictional theme, that is, Game of Thrones. The game can be used in an introductory linear programming (LP) course as an additional practice or repetition exercise. It can also be used to refresh students’ knowledge of LP modeling at the start of a subsequent integer programming or operations research course. Since 2016, the game has been used successfully in a first course on LP for undergraduate students following the Bachelor of Business Engineering program at KU Leuven (Belgium). Besides our positive experience, two formal student surveys revealed that most students (strongly) agreed that the game increased their interest in operations research.

Two innovative strategies serve as the key factors behind the series’ success: (1) using LinkedIn to partner with guest speakers, especially university alumni, who possess expertise in specific operations management disciplines, and (2) implementing a novel structured Q&A approach that enables alignment with learning objectives while maximizing quality student engagement. Our approach accesses the resumes of tens of thousands of college alumni listed on LinkedIn and utilizes free cloud-based services such as Google Forms and Google Sheets for question submission (by students), review (by instructors), and selection (by the guests). These successfully implemented strategies (1) match qualified speakers to relevant course content, (2) boost student engagement by ensuring the participation of all students, (3) promote content alignment by first filtering out irrelevant student questions, and (4) increase speaker preparation and comfort level.},

The case focuses on a call center that faces the issue of daily task allocation. The current self-selection-based allocation protocol has created friction among employees. To enable employee satisfaction and boost team morale, the call center needs to develop an allocation model that is perceived to be fair by employees. The case tends to elicit enthusiastic participation from students, especially on the theme of workplace fairness and the role of gender and individual constraints on employees’ ability to excel at the workplace. Overall, students believed the case was challenging and that it provided them skills to combine (i) optimization modeling and (ii) qualitative considerations for workplace fairness that they studied in management and leadership courses.

  abstract     = {Multiple studies call for engineering education to integrate social justice into classroom instruction. Yet, there is uncertainty regarding whether integrating these social topics into engineering curriculum will support or detract from the learning of technical concepts. This study focuses on evaluating how reframing technical assessments to include social justice concepts impacts student learning and investigates how well students integrate social justice into engineering decision making. Using a within-subject design, in which students were exposed to both conditions (questions with and without social justice context), we evaluate how social justice framing impacts overall student learning of technical topics. Social justice prompts are added to homework questions, and we assess students’ demonstration of knowledge of original technical content of the course, as well as their ability to consider social justice implications of engineering design. In the earlier homework assignment, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in learning when technical concepts were framed to include social justice. As the students became more familiar with social justice considerations, their learning of technical concepts became comparable to that of students who did not have the social justice components in their assignment. Their evaluation of the social implications of technical decisions also improved.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected higher education institutions worldwide as they had to switch from face-to-face to online teaching almost overnight. This abrupt change made a huge impact on teaching, learning, and particularly, student engagement. This paper focuses on online social presence as an element of student engagement, which represents how students feel under synchronous online teaching. A survey was conducted among 244 first-year students to evaluate the impact of online social interaction, online collaboration, online contact with staff, online engagement, and online active learning on online social presence. Structural equation modeling was used to test and evaluate these multivariate relationships. Our study illustrates that all variables have a significant positive relationship with online social presence. In particular, online social interaction and online collaboration show a more powerful relationship with student online social presence. Thus, digital technologies should be adopted in a way that encourages students to actively interact with their peers.},

  abstract     = {This case study introduces students to the decision-making process of a facility location problem and requires them to apply appropriate methods to recommend a desirable terminal location for CBT, a transportation provider in the United States. In response to the increasing number of drivers in the Texas market, CBT explored different options to better serve the rising demand, including a new and second terminal in a different geographic area. Students employ multi-criteria decision-making framework and optimization modeling to support their analysis using empirical data. While students use provided data to solve the problem in the base case, they need to research various publicly available databases in the case extension. This case can be used in undergraduate courses in logistics, transportation, operations, and supply chain management to apply facility location related concepts, or in a business analytics course to illustrate optimization modeling in a real-world context.
