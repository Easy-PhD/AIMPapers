  abstract     = {China’s online retail sales growth rate of men’s plain color shirts had declined because they could not meet customers’ aesthetic value needs. This study aims to determine consumers’ aesthetic value preferences and corresponding design elements. Based on Kansei Engineering, a semantic differential scale questionnaire was conducted with seven crucial Kansei words and styling specimens. Then, researchers validated these Kansei words using principal component analysis. More significantly, this study used partial least squares to construct a relationship between crucial Kansei words and styling design elements. Furthermore, researchers obtained the matching colors corresponding to Kansei words in the color image scale. Thus, Kansei words, styling design elements, and corresponding colors made up the recommendation guidelines. Lastly, questionnaires and interviews were used to verify the effectiveness of these guidelines. These recommendation guidelines were the most important results of this study. Besides, this study also found that the recent popular oversized fit appeared in distinctive and casual styles, but the audience is relatively small. Purchasers preferred a one-button square cuff, and the separate left-side pocket is more popular than both-side pockets. Purchasers liked the wide-spread collar compared with the classical pointed collar because it appeared most frequently in recommendation guidelines. Classic fit was still the mainstream, but its popularity would decline. In addition, modern fit and slim fit would become increasingly popular. Funding: B.

  abstract     = {We investigate a setting in which two rivals, an airline and railways, create value through a new joint service that reduces the cancellation-risk of waitlisted passengers. This setting is motivated by a recent collaboration between a railway company and two low-cost airlines in India. Under this arrangement, the railways offers train ticket holders whose reservations are not confirmed the option to upgrade to a flight ticket on the same route for an additional fee. The airline sets the price for the upgrade while the railways charges the airline a referral commission. The new service creates value for waitlisted passengers and thereby stimulates additional demand for the railways and the airline. We analyze the strategic interactions that arise from this collaboration, derive the equilibrium upgrade prices and commission, and compare the outcomes to those under centralized decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that cooperation between two competing service providers can create a mutually beneficial outcome for both firms as well as for consumers. Notably, the airline and the railways can generate profit from the collaboration only if they engage in a sequential game; a simultaneous-move game fails to generate any value. Furthermore, we identify scenarios in which increasing railway capacity also benefits the airline by stimulating additional demand. Finally, we analyze the case of strategic consumers who reduce the value created from the collaboration, and we show that the price difference between early and late booking mitigates such strategic behavior.

  abstract     = {Employees and consumers have varying preferences between human and algorithmic advisors. Drawing on construal level theory, I hypothesize that individual differences in algorithm aversion can be explained by the perception that algorithms are psychologically farther away than human advisors. The first set of studies ( n = 266) shows that algorithms are viewed as abstract and distant compared with humans, even when their outputs are perceived at a low-level construal, challenging prior research. Leveraging construal congruency, the second set of studies ( n = 1,148) shows that farther within-task psychological distance generally increases preference for algorithmic advisors due to differences in advisor confidence. Specifically, I contribute to the literature by showing that a far psychological distance within a task reduces confidence in human advisors. In contrast, confidence in algorithms remains stable, increasing algorithm appreciation at farther within-task distances.

Postpandemic, information technology in tourism must adjust to changes in traveler behavior, including online booking trends and risk perceptions. Based on the online platform Trivago, the research objectives of this study seek to explore the relationships among electronic service quality, perceived severity of negative publicity, perceived risk, and consumers’ advocacy intention to embrace after the impact of Trivago’s negative publicity. Further, this study aims to explore the moderating effects of electronic service quality and mediating effects of perceived risk. This research collected a total of 468 valid responses and verified the hypothesis by regression analysis and Sobel test. The research results are summarized as follows: the perceived severity of negative publicity negatively affects advocacy intention and positively affects perceived risk, which also negatively affects advocacy intention. These effects are all moderated by e-service quality, which negatively affects perceived risk; perceived risk is the mediator between perceived severity of negative publicity and advocacy intention. The results enrich literature on online hotel websites, offering valuable insights into how managers can effectively use online travel agencies to enhance their online presence and increase revenue.

  abstract     = {Generating sales leads for auto dealers is the core business to auto vertical media platforms (VMPs). However, in recent years, many auto VMPs have started directly selling vehicles to consumers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the primary purpose of auto VMPs’ business-to-consumer (B2C) endeavors is not solely B2C profitability, but rather the acquisition of sales data to calculate the leads-to-sales conversion ratio. This ratio is crucial in determining the pricing strategy for sales leads. To understand this, we consider an asymmetric information game in which the auto dealer possesses information about the leads-to-sales conversion ratio, whereas the VMP does not. We find that, when the VMP solely focuses on profiting from the sales lead business, if the market potential is large, the auto dealer prefers the cost-per-lead scheme, whereas the VMP always tends to the cost-per-sale scheme. However, when the VMP encroaches on the consumer market as a reseller, this divergence in contract-type preference can potentially be resolved. We recognize that VMPs need to conduct a comprehensive assessment of factors such as market potential, fixed cost related to market encroachment, and the correlation between market uncertainty and leads-to-sales conversion ratio when encroachment. Moreover, the encroachment of the VMP has the potential to create a win–win outcome. It is essential to highlight that engaging in B2C business enables the VMP to expand its market sample, thereby enhancing the value of leveraging information technology to optimize the leads-to-sales ratio and achieve superior performance.

  abstract     = {Extensive research has investigated the buffering effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) when firms have poor financial performance. However, few studies have examined the possible consequences of this effect. By analyzing data on listed firms in China from 2010 to 2018, this study investigates the buffering effect of CSR under conditions of earnings pressure, and then discusses its impact on CSR disclosure impression management behavior. The results show that CSR can buffer the negative impact of earnings pressure on stock prices, chief executive officer stability, and top management team stability. This buffering effect is mainly exerted by technical CSR. Moreover, earnings pressure leads to CSR disclosure impression management without resulting in improved CSR performance. These findings have implications for cultivating CSR buffering awareness among firms and managers. The results also have practical implications for future research on the antecedents and motivations of CSR disclosure impression management.

  abstract     = {There are disparities in access to livers based on transplant patients’ height, which disproportionately affects Hispanics, Asians, and women (across all ethnicities), because short patients can receive transplants from a smaller pool of available deceased donors for medical reasons. Reduced likelihood of transplantation leads to higher mortality rates and longer waiting times. We analyze fairness within the current U.S. liver allocation system where patients receive priority dynamically, based on their model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, which reflect the severity of liver disease. We propose a simple adjustment, providing additional (exception) points based on height and MELD score, that can be easily implemented in practice, which materially reduces the disparity without sacrificing overall efficiency. We model the liver allocation system as a multiclass fluid model of overloaded queues with heterogeneous servers. We impose explicit equity constraints for all static patient classes, that is, height. We characterize the optimal solution under the objective of minimizing pretransplant mortality. The discretized version of the optimal policy is numerically solved using estimates from clinical data and a detailed simulation study demonstrates its effectiveness. The optimal policy, called the equity adjusted mortality risk policy, advocates ranking patients based on their short-term mortality risk adjusted for equity among height classes. Interpretation of the shadow prices of equity constraints in the optimal control problem as MELD exception points is novel in the transplant context since they can be seamlessly mapped into the existing system. Our simulations show that for women, the disparity can be almost completely eliminated. Hispanics and Asians greatly benefit from receiving these MELD exception points also. Our work provides a remedy to reduce the disparities in access to liver transplantation within the MELD-based allocation. Our approach can help the on-going analysis of the continuous distribution model for livers because it also considers aspects of candidate biology, notably height and body surface area. Funding: M.
