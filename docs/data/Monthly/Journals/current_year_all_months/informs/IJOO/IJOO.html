  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a new data-driven tradeoff (TRO) approach for modeling uncertainty that serves as a middle ground between the optimistic approach, which adopts a distributional belief, and the pessimistic distributionally robust optimization approach, which hedges against distributional ambiguity. We equip the TRO model with a TRO ambiguity set characterized by a size parameter controlling the level of optimism and a shape parameter representing distributional ambiguity. We first show that constructing the TRO ambiguity set using a general star-shaped shape parameter with the empirical distribution as its star center is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the hierarchical structure of the sequence of TRO ambiguity sets. Then, we analyze the properties of the TRO model, including quantifying conservatism, quantifying bias and generalization error, and establishing asymptotic properties. Specifically, we show that the TRO model could generate a spectrum of decisions, ranging from optimistic to conservative decisions. Additionally, we show that it could produce an unbiased estimator of the true optimal value. Furthermore, we establish the almost-sure convergence of the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the TRO model to their true counterparts. We exemplify our theoretical results using an inventory control problem and a portfolio optimization problem.

  abstract     = {Energy production throughout the world is transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind power and solar power. This transition has been gradual—over half of the world’s electricity is still produced by coal, oil, and gas—but must accelerate to meet global emission targets. This paper examines the contributions that mathematical optimization and equilibrium models can make to help accelerate this transition. The models we catalog cover a range of physical scales and timescales. Our focus is on novel model formulations that can help overcome the challenges of the transition by unpicking the complexity inherent in many settings and quantifying the trade-offs that must be made when developing energy policy.

This paper proposes two continuous approximation methods that reformulate the discrete cardinality as complementarity constraints and difference-of-convex functions, respectively. We show that under suitable conditions, local and stationary solutions of the approximation problems recover local minimizers of the cardinality minimization problem. To demonstrate effectiveness, we apply the proposed methods to applications where violating as few preference conditions (or soft constraints) is desired.

This paper supports robotic parts-to-picker operations in warehousing by optimizing order–workstation assignments, item–pod assignments, and the schedule of order fulfillment at workstations. The model maximizes throughput, managing human workload at the workstations and congestion in the facility. We solve it via large-scale neighborhood search with a novel learn-then-optimize approach to subproblem generation. The algorithm relies on an off-line machine learning procedure to predict objective improvements based on subproblem features and an online optimization model to generate a new subproblem at each iteration. In collaboration with Amazon Robotics, we show that our model and algorithm generate much stronger solutions for practical problems than state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our solution enhances the utilization of robotic fleets by coordinating robotic tasks for human operators to pick multiple items at once and by coordinating robotic routes to avoid congestion in the facility.

  abstract     = {We present a new optimization-based method for aggregating preferences in settings in which each voter expresses preferences over pairs of alternatives. Our approach to identifying a consensus partial order is motivated by the observation that collections of votes that form a cycle can be treated as collective ties. Our approach then removes unions of cycles of votes, or circulations, from the vote graph and determines aggregate preferences from the remainder. Specifically, we study the removal of maximal circulations attained by any union of cycles the removal of which leaves an acyclic graph. We introduce the strong maximum circulation, the removal of which guarantees a unique outcome in terms of the induced partial order, called the strong partial order. The strong maximum circulation also satisfies strong complementary slackness conditions and is shown to be solved efficiently as a network flow problem. We further establish the relationship between the dual of the maximum circulation problem and Kemeny’s method, a popular optimization-based approach for preference aggregation. We also show that identifying a minimum maximal circulation—that is, a maximal circulation containing the smallest number of votes—is an NP-hard problem. Further, an instance of the minimum maximal circulation may have multiple optimal solutions whose removal results in conflicting partial orders. Funding: D.

  abstract     = {Despite the modeling power for problems under uncertainty, robust optimization (RO) and adaptive RO (ARO) can exhibit too conservative solutions in terms of objective value degradation compared with the nominal case. One of the main reasons behind this conservatism is that, in many practical applications, uncertain constraints are directly designed as constraint-wise without taking into account couplings over multiple constraints. In this paper, we define a coupled uncertainty set as the intersection between a constraint-wise uncertainty set and a coupling set. We study the benefit of coupling in alleviating conservatism in RO and ARO. We provide theoretical tight and computable upper and lower bounds on the objective value improvement of RO and ARO problems under coupled uncertainty over constraint-wise uncertainty. In addition, we relate the power of adaptability over static solutions with the coupling of uncertainty set. Computational results demonstrate the benefit of coupling in applications. Funding: I.

  abstract     = {In the subspace clustering with missing data (SCMD) problem, we are given a collection of n partially observed d -dimensional vectors. The data points are assumed to be concentrated near a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The goal of SCMD is to cluster the vectors according to their subspace membership and recover the underlying basis, which can then be used to infer their missing entries. State-of-the-art algorithms for SCMD can fail on instances with a high proportion of missing data, with full-rank data, or if the underlying subspaces are similar to each other. We propose a novel integer programming approach for SCMD. The approach is based on dynamically determining a set of candidate subspaces and optimally assigning points to selected subspaces. The problem structure is identical to the classical facility-location problem, with subspaces playing the role of facilities and data points playing that of customers. We propose a column-generation approach for identifying candidate subspaces combined with a Benders decomposition approach for solving the linear programming relaxation of the formulation. An empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach can achieve better clustering accuracy than state-of-the-art methods when the data are high rank, the percentage of missing data is high, or the subspaces are similar.

  abstract     = {Decision trees are a widely used tool for interpretable machine learning. Multivariate decision trees employ hyperplanes at the branch nodes to route datapoints throughout the tree and yield more compact models than univariate trees. Recently, mixed-integer programming (MIP) has been applied to formulate the optimal decision tree problem. A key component of most MIP formulations is a specification of how to route datapoints in the tree from the root to the leaves. Our goal is to provide polyhedral characterizations of realizable routings, that is, routings that can be realized using multivariate branching rules. We first focus on shattering inequalities, a class of valid inequalities that can be used to strengthen almost any MIP formulation and that have been shown to be computationally effective. We prove that if all the feature vectors are in general position, then the shattering inequalities defined for the root of the tree are facet defining for the convex hull of the realizable routings. We then show that every facet-defining inequality of a depth one tree involving at least two variables is also facet defining for trees of arbitrary depth. Finally, we show that facet-defining inequalities characterizing realizable routings are also facet-defining for a complete MIP formulation. We validate our theoretical results by performing numerical experiments that specifically exploit shattering inequalities defined at the root node and we observe an improvement in performance for both numerical and categorical data sets, especially for decision trees of intermediate size.

We establish a sandwich relation on the spectrum of Riemannian and Euclidean Hessians at first-order stationary points (FOSPs). As a result of that, we obtain an equivalence on the set of FOSPs, second-order stationary points, and strict saddles between the manifold and factorization formulations. In addition, we show that the sandwich relation can be used to transfer more quantitative geometric properties from one formulation to another. Similarities and differences in the landscape connection under the PSD case and the general case are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric landscape connection between the manifold and factorization formulations for handling rank constraints, and it provides a geometric explanation for the similar empirical performance of factorization and manifold approaches in low-rank matrix optimization observed in the literature. In the general low-rank matrix optimization, the landscape connection of two factorization formulations (unregularized and regularized ones) is also provided. By applying these geometric landscape connections (in particular, the sandwich relation), we are able to solve unanswered questions in the literature and establish stronger results in the applications on geometric analysis of phase retrieval, well-conditioned low-rank matrix optimization, and the role of regularization in factorization arising from machine learning and signal processing.

The objective is to maximize the reward obtained from fulfilling the customers’ requests sans the cumulative procurement cost. We analyze the competitive ratio of a primal-dual algorithm in this setting and develop an optimization framework for designing a surrogate function for the procurement cost to be used by the algorithm to improve the competitive ratio of the primal-dual algorithm. We use the optimal surrogate function for polynomial procurement cost functions to improve on previous bounds. For general procurement cost functions, our design method uses quasiconvex optimization to find optimal design parameters. We then implement the design techniques and show the improved performance of the algorithm in numerical examples.

  abstract     = {In a fixed-budget ranking and selection (R&S) problem, one aims to identify the best design among a finite number of candidates by efficiently allocating the given computing budget to evaluate design performance. Classical methods for R&S usually assume the distribution of the randomness in the system is exactly known. In this paper, we consider the practical scenario where the true distribution is unknown but can be estimated from streaming input data that arrive in batches over time. We formulate the R&S problem in this dynamic setting as a multistage problem where we adopt the Bayesian approach to estimate the distribution, and we formulate a stagewise optimization problem to allocate the computing budget. We characterize the optimality conditions for the stagewise problem by applying the large deviations theory to maximize the decay rate of the probability of false selection. Based on the optimality conditions and combined with the updating of distribution estimates, we design two sequential budget allocation procedures for R&S under streaming input data. We theoretically guarantee the consistency and asymptotic optimality of the proposed procedures. We demonstrate the practical efficiency through numerical experiments in comparison with the equal allocation policy and an extension of the optimal computing budget allocation algorithm.
