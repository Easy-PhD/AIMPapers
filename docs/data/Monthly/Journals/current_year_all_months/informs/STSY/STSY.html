  abstract     = {Distributed ledgers (DLs) are modern decentralized databases where trusted network members can transparently update data while maintaining security. IOTA is an exemplar alternative to the well-known Bitcoin protocol, and such alternatives, which aim to overcome shortcomings, have gained increasing attention recently. These systems warrant deeper theoretical analysis using directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. One essential property of a properly functioning DL is that all network members holding a copy of the database agree on the sequence of information added, which is referred to as consensus and is known to be related to a structural property of DAGs called one-endedness. In this paper, we consider a model of a DL with sequential stochastic arrivals that mimic IOTA’s attachment rules. Although the resulting DAG model is more complex than Bitcoin, we demonstrate that as time goes to infinity, the IOTA DAG almost surely achieves one-endedness.},

  abstract     = {Consider a Markovian tandem line with finite intermediate buffers and an equal number of stations and servers. Servers are flexible but noncollaborative, so that a job can be processed by at most one server at any time. When a job is being processed, it can be damaged and wasted depending on the proficiency of the server. We identify the dynamic server assignment policy that maximizes the long-run average throughput of the system with two stations and two servers. We find that the optimal policy is either a single or a double threshold policy on the number of jobs in the buffer, where the thresholds depend on the service rates and defect probabilities of the two servers at the two stations. For larger systems, we show that the optimal policy may involve server idling and that improving the service rate at any station is always beneficial. Finally, we propose heuristic server assignment policies motivated by experimentation for small systems with finite buffers and analysis of larger systems with infinite buffers. Numerical results suggest that our heuristics yield near-optimal performance. Funding: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grants CMMI-1536990 and CMMI-2127778]. S.

  abstract     = {Queueing systems present many opportunities for applying machine learning predictions, such as estimated service times, to improve system performance. This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely large language model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems. Funding: M.

  abstract     = {The join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) load-balancing scheme is known to minimize the average response time of jobs in homogeneous systems with identical servers. However, for heterogeneous systems with servers having different processing speeds, finding an optimal load balancing scheme remains an open problem for finite system sizes. Recently, for systems with heterogeneous servers, a variant of JSQ scheme, called the speed-aware-join-the-shortest-queue (SA-JSQ) scheme, has been shown to achieve asymptotic optimality in the fluid-scaling regime where the number of servers n tends to infinity but the normalized the arrival rate of jobs remains constant. In this paper, we show that the SA-JSQ scheme is also asymptotically optimal for heterogeneous systems in the Halfin-Whitt traffic regime where the normalized arrival rate scales are 1 − O ( 1 / n ) . Our analysis begins by establishing that an appropriately scaled and centered version of the Markov process describing system dynamics weakly converges to a two-dimensional reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process . We then show using Stein’s method that the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov process converges to that of the OU process as the system size increases by establishing the validity of interchange of limits. Finally, through coupling with a suitably constructed system, we show that SA-JSQ asymptotically minimizes the diffusion-scaled total number of jobs and the diffusion-scaled number of waiting jobs in the steady state in the Halfin-Whitt regime among all policies that dispatch jobs based on queue lengths and server speeds.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a stochastic control problem whose state space is the d -dimensional positive orthant. The controlled process Z evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the orthant’s boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector θ ( t ) at each time t based on the history of Z , and the cost rate at time t depends on both Z ( t ) and θ ( t ) . In our initial problem formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic control problem. Extending the earlier work by Han et al. [Han J, Jentzen A, Weinan E (2018) Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations using deep learning. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 115(34):8505–8510], we develop and illustrate a simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. For the test problems studied thus far, our method is accurate to within a fraction of 1% and is computationally feasible in dimensions up to at least d = 30 .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide explicit upper bounds on some distances between the (law of the) output of a random Gaussian neural network and (the law of) a random Gaussian vector. Our main results concern deep random Gaussian neural networks with a rather general activation function. The upper bounds show how the widths of the layers, the activation function, and other architecture parameters affect the Gaussian approximation of the output. Our techniques, relying on Stein’s method and integration by parts formulas for the Gaussian law, yield estimates on distances that are indeed integral probability metrics and include the convex distance. This latter metric is defined by testing against indicator functions of measurable convex sets and so allows for accurate estimates of the probability that the output is localized in some region of the space, which is an aspect of a significant interest both from a practitioner’s and a theorist’s perspective.

  abstract     = {The basic adjoint relationship (BAR) approach is an analysis technique based on the stationary equation of a Markov process. This approach was introduced to study heavy-traffic, steady-state convergence of generalized Jackson networks in which each service station has a single job class. We extend it to multiclass queueing networks operating under static-buffer-priority (SBP) service disciplines. Our extension makes a connection with Palm distributions that allows one to attack a difficulty arising from queue-length truncation, which appears to be unavoidable in the multiclass setting. For multiclass queueing networks operating under SBP service disciplines, our BAR approach provides an alternative to the “interchange of limits” approach that has dominated the literature in the last twenty years. The BAR approach can produce sharp results and allows one to establish steady-state convergence under three additional conditions: stability, state space collapse (SSC) and a certain matrix being “tight.” These three conditions do not appear to depend on the interarrival and service-time distributions beyond their means, and their verification can be studied as three separate modules. In particular, they can be studied in a simpler, continuous-time Markov chain setting when all distributions are exponential. As an example, these three conditions are shown to hold in reentrant lines operating under last-buffer-first-serve discipline. In a two-station, five-class reentrant line, under the heavy-traffic condition, the tight-matrix condition implies both the stability condition and the SSC condition. Whether such a relationship holds generally is an open problem.},
