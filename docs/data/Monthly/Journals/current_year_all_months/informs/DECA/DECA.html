  abstract     = {Hazen and Sounderpandian (1999) claim to have demonstrated that ordinal equivalence of the buying price and the selling price for information entails that the utility function must have constant risk attitude (i.e., be linear or exponential). However, there is no explicit indication of the scope of the ordinal equivalence assumed—is it within any particular decision problem , or within all decision problems sharing the same utility function ? Here we explore the difference between these two assumptions, providing counterexamples for the constant risk attitude assertion in the first case, and in the second case a proof that buy-sell ordinal equivalence within all decision problems sharing the same utility forces constant risk attitude. In the first case, the simplest counterexample arises from the assertion that more refined information sources have greater information values.},

Secondly, this paper proposes the participation of hydrogen energy storage equipment in the power system scheduling of integrated energy parks. Hydrogen energy storage, as a clean, efficient, and sustainable carbon-free energy storage technology, can be used to mitigate the impact of wind power and photovoltaics output on the power grid. Finally, this paper proposes to construct an optimized scheduling model that considers economic optimization and proves the economic feasibility of the model through case analysis.

  abstract     = {In multiobjective decision-making problems, it is common to encounter nondominated alternatives. In these situations, the decision-making process becomes complex, as each alternative offers better outcomes for some objectives and worse outcomes for others simultaneously. However, DMs still must choose a single alternative that provides an acceptable balance between the conflicting objectives, which can become exceedingly challenging. To address this scenario, our work introduces a decision-making framework aimed at supporting such decisions. Our proposed framework draws upon concepts from the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and combines a novel simplex-like weight generation method with expert insights and machine learning data-driven procedures to establish an intuitive methodology that empowers DMs to select a single alternative from a range of alternatives. In this paper, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology through an example and two real-world decision cases from the oil and gas industry, each involving 128 alternatives and five distinct objectives.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a product distributor’s incentive to share private consumer preference information with a farming cooperative that possesses the capability for quality improvement. Although conventional view holds that in the presence of the investment spillover effect, downstream information sharing surely occurs when the upstream investment cost is low enough, our results show that (due to the decreasing marginal effect of quality investment) the product distributor voluntarily commits to sharing information only when the quality investment cost is in a medium range. And this ex ante sharing behavior can be induced through a precontracted side payment when the quality cost slightly deviates from the range in which voluntary sharing occurs. Given the challenge of predicting consumer preference for perennial crops, we examine the product distributor’s incentives for ordering and ex post sharing under upfront quality improvement, finding that the distributor can partially disclose the acquired information even facing a potential mismatch between supply and demand. An equilibrium ordering scheme is proposed whereby the distributor prearranges transportation capacity. Interestingly, under delayed information acquisition, partially sharing information is more effective in motivating the farming cooperative to invest more at the outset than not sharing at all.

  abstract     = {The growing concern over water scarcity and the management of freshwater is common worldwide. Voluntary incentives, such as payments offered to water users, are recognized as a strategy for reducing conflicts and water consumption. A primary challenge lies in determining the allocation of these incentives among water users, taking into account socio-environmental factors. This study leverages differential game theoretic models to design incentive schemes for the network of water users, geographically distributed across a river network. Two networks of water users are considered: those who utilize groundwater and those who rely on surface water for agricultural purposes. A nongovernmental organization (NGO) participates as another key player, providing conservation incentives to encourage water users to reduce their consumption. The proposed model considers both vertical and horizontal interactions within the network of players. By considering the unique characteristics of each water user, the NGO aims to introduce an incentive scheme designed for each water user. Addressing the challenge of model scalability becomes crucial as the number of players or water users within each network increases, in order to identify optimal decisions. Thus, we propose solution methods for both convex and nonconvex decision problems using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, Value Iteration, and Basis Function Approximation methods. Finally, we perform parametric analyses to examine how parameters influence the choice of solution methods and affect the decision-making processes.

  abstract     = {In the absence of historical data for use as forecasting inputs, decision makers often ask a panel of judges to predict the outcome of interest, leveraging the wisdom of the crowd [Surowiecki J (2005) The Wisdom of Crowds (Anchor, New York)]. Even if the crowd is large and skilled, shared information can bias the simple mean of judges’ estimates. Addressing the issue of bias, Palley and Soll [Palley AB, Soll JB (2019) Extracting the wisdom of crowds when information is shared. Management Sci. 65(5):2291–2309] introduces a novel approach called pivoting. Pivoting can take several forms, most notably the powerful and reliable minimal pivot. We build on the intuition of the minimal pivot and propose a more aggressive bias correction known as the neutral pivot. The neutral pivot achieves the largest bias correction of its class that both avoids the need to directly estimate crowd composition or skill and maintains a smaller expected squared error than the simple mean for all considered settings. Empirical assessments on real data sets confirm the effectiveness of the neutral pivot compared with current methods.

We also provide results on the value of information calculus to measure how the buying price behaves as we increase our information content through acquisition of two or more tail event information alternatives. Our theoretical results indicate the correlation between the buying prices of simpler tail event information alternatives and more complex versions of event information. The focus of the article then shifts to modeling of an additional risk that may be encountered in information acquisition.

By comparing the three games, we find that both types of enterprises would always exert more effort in the sequential game than in the simultaneous game, and the later-move advantage makes both types of enterprises prefer to become the follower in the game. We also find that the enhanced cost efficiency advantage or enterprise value gap possessed by the high-type enterprise would widen the effort gap between the two types of enterprises, and enhance the low-type enterprise’s incentive to be the follower. Moreover, the existence of system vulnerability not only causes both types of enterprises to reduce their security effort that generates free-riding behaviors but also can first discourage and then encourage enterprises from moving in advance. We further propose a liability-based mechanism to tackle the free-riding problem. We reveal an exact optimal liability coefficient, whether in the simultaneous or sequential game and find that the high-type enterprise should undertake more compensation when its dominant position becomes more obvious and the low-type enterprise could therefore undertake decreased liability. Last, we extend the model to multiple enterprises and show that the results are robust.

  abstract     = {The ecological restoration of abandoned mines poses a significant challenge within China’s broader efforts toward the protection and restoration of the nation’s ecosystems. Based on the ecology-oriented development (EOD) model, a differential game framework for the ecological restoration of abandoned mines was constructed in this study, involving both government and corporate entities as players. Our analysis focused on various factors, including investment levels in ecological restoration quality, the quality of ecological restoration itself, investment levels in environmentally sensitive industry development, the quality of environmentally sensitive industries, environmentally sensitive product pricing strategies, and profit dynamics for both players across four distinct modes. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, extending the government’s concession period incentivizes enterprises to increase investment in both the quality of ecological restoration of abandoned mines and the development of environmentally sensitive industries. Second, the government should prefer the cooperative mode to introduce social capital for the ecology-oriented development of abandoned mines. Third, in noncooperative mode, for technology-intensive industries, the government’s industrial support policy is more mutually beneficial; conversely, for labor-intensive industries, the ecological restoration compensation policy yields higher mutual gains. Lastly, differentiated incentive policies implemented by the government across various modes prompt the input of enterprises in ecological restoration quality and environmentally sensitive industry development. Based on these findings, we offer specific policy recommendations to guide governmental efforts in promoting EOD for the ecological restoration of abandoned mines.

This paper proposes a value function-based model of frugal materialism and establishes a close theoretical link between frugal materialism and the slope of value satiation as defined in the decision analytic literature; for both their absolute and relative versions, frugal materialism and increasing value satiation are nearly equivalent to each other. Only some shapes of the value function are thus compatible with frugal materialism, and the shape restrictions involve concepts familiar from models of decision making under risk, even though the proposed model of frugal materialism does not involve any risk. Under the additional assumption of relative risk neutrality, the demand for risky assets of a frugally materialistic consumer should exhibit well-known behavioral patterns associated with increasing risk aversion, and there is only a narrow possibility for frugal materialism to coexist with precautionary saving behavior.},

The market clearing asset price falls as a proportion of wealth when market wealth is higher, implying that CRRA investors hold a lower (rather than fixed) proportion of wealth in the risky asset when they are wealthier. Investors prefer conditions where they can obtain more risk, either because the risky payoff is exogenously riskier or competing investors want less.

In contrast, this paper focuses on the value of information across scalar-valued decision problems sharing the same utility function such as different divisions within an organization exploring various information sources for their decisions using the same organizational utility function. In this context, it still makes sense to ask which sources are more informative. We show that BPI and EUI rank information sources identically in this context only when the utility function is linear . However, if the certainty equivalent increase is used instead of EUI , then identical ranking with BPI across problems is maintained for the broader class of linear or exponential utility functions. We discuss the importance of these results for distributed decision-making settings, where different departments within an organization may calculate the value of information separately. Our results advise against using EUI to measure information value in this context when risk attitude is important.},
