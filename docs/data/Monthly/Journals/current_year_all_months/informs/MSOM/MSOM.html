  abstract     = {Problem definition : Inpatients are often treated as the “captive audience” for hospital diagnostic services, and they are notified only when service capacity is available. This arrangement causes significant chaos and inefficiencies in hospital operations. Methodology/results : We propose an innovative scheduling approach called “advance notice” to manage hospital diagnostic practices. Advance notice is a brand-new scheduling paradigm in between classic allocation scheduling and advance scheduling. Patients are placed in a common queue waiting to be called for service, and they will be provided both a fixed preparation time and a guaranteed service time window in advance. The advance notice policy enjoys the benefit of allocation scheduling (giving the provider flexibility in using her capacity) and that of advance scheduling (reducing patient online waiting). It calls for two decisions: who to serve now and who to send advance notices to. We formulate a Markov decision process model to optimize these decisions dynamically. Via a novel variable transformation, we reveal the hidden anti-multimodular structure of the problem and show how the optimal decisions should be adjusted in response to changes in the system load. Beyond solving the model for daily operations, we further investigate how the service and preparation time windows as system-level controls can be used to manage system performance. Our numerical study, populated by real data from a large academic medical center in the United States, demonstrates significant improvement in operational efficiency by switching from current practice to our proposed advance notice policy. Managerial implications : The advance notice policy strikes a fine balance between the two classic scheduling paradigms; it gives the provider flexibility in using her capacity as in allocation scheduling, and it reduces patient online waiting as in advance scheduling. Although it is motivated by healthcare applications, the advance notice policy offers a promising cutting-edge approach to improving general appointment-based services. Funding: The work of Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is ubiquitous to address uncertainties inherent in operations management (OM) problems. Recently, an alternative goal-driven framework, robust satisficing (RS), is proposed. RS aims to attain a prescribed target, such as avoiding overshooting the cost budget, as much as possible under uncertainty. The goal-driven modeling philosophy fits many OM problems, yet there is a lack of direct comparisons between DRO and RS. In this paper, we uncover connections between DRO and RS. Methodology/results : Suppose both models are based on the Wasserstein metric and consider a risk-aware convex objective function affected by uncertain parameters. We demonstrate that they share the same solution family. We establish the correspondence between the radius parameter in DRO and the target parameter in RS such that the optimal solutions to the two models coincide. Inspired by the globalized distributionally robust counterpart (GDRC), we extend the analysis to GDRC and the globalized robust satisficing (GRS). We reveal that GDRC and GRS have the same solution families as DRO and RS, respectively. More importantly, we establish novel results on the equivalence of DRO, GDRC, RS, and GRS models under previously stated conditions. Managerial implications : The equivalence results help unify performance bounds of DRO and RS models. Specifically, each model now has an additional set of theoretical guarantees from the other model, and any bounds derived for one model automatically apply to other equivalent models via some parameter mapping. Despite the theoretical equivalence result, the performance of the DRO and RS models can vary depending on how the model parameters are selected. The experimental findings show how these differences emerge when transitioning from theory to practice. Additionally, the experiments provide insights for practitioners, such as how the use of cross-validation can help reflect the true model preferences, particularly when only a few validation points are set.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many innovations today are data driven. To improve the algorithms of these products, firms make substantial investments in data collection. However, the data are limited for an individual firm, which caps the benefits of the algorithms. Data sharing among the firms can help alleviate this problem, but firms may be reluctant to share their proprietary data, because doing so may result in a loss of competitive advantage. Motivated by this tension, we ask the following two questions. First, when do firms voluntarily share their data and when are they reluctant to do so? Second, how does voluntary data sharing compare with the corresponding centralized data sharing (as if a government were to decide the level of data sharing to promote innovation)? Methodology/results : Using a game-theoretic model, we identify two key factors that determine the answers to the questions: (i) the relationship between firms’ data sets and (ii) the degree of uncertainty associated with the innovation. We find that firms voluntarily share data if their data sets are complements or if the uncertainty is high. Moreover, relative to the centralized data sharing, firms voluntarily share too little (respectively, much) data when their data sets are complements (respectively, redundant) and the uncertainty is moderate (respectively, high). Managerial implications : Our findings provide plausible explanations on data-sharing practices, for example, why firms in the autonomous vehicle industry voluntarily share their proprietary data. We also shed light on the antitrust issues associated with data sharing, where too much voluntary data sharing can reduce firms’ data collection incentives and stifle competition. Moreover, if the government considers subsidizing firms’ data collection efforts to accelerate innovation, cost subsidies are particularly effective when paired with mandatory data-sharing regulations. The government should exercise caution under voluntary data sharing because higher subsidies may not necessarily lead to higher innovation. Funding: Z.

We set out to study a UGC platform’s optimal dynamic operational policies in its different stages and the impact of various constraints and innovations. Methodology/results : We adopt a hybrid of the Bass diffusion model and the replicator equation in evolutionary game theory to capture the creator and viewer base growths and analyze the dynamic operational decisions of a UGC platform, including promotion, advertising, and revenue sharing in an optimal control framework. We find an interesting mirroring structure between the platform’s early- and mature-stage optimal advertising and creator wage policies. An analysis of the optimal policies reveals a coherent rationale behind the dynamic management of the UGC platform around the relationship triangle. We also show that the platform should generously share advertising revenue with creators and may adopt loss leading shortly after as opposed to right at launch. We further explore the impacts of celebrity creators, liquidity constraints, paid advertisement removal, sponsored content, and viewer tipping.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A company’s project portfolio is an important success factor. Employing strategic buckets to segment the overall budget into budgets for different project types is a commonly used approach for managing project selection. Strategic buckets typically refer to sets of projects of a certain type, such as safe and risky projects. A strategic bucket specification defines the number of buckets and thresholds between them. This paper addresses the question of how different strategic buckets specifications affect decision makers’ project selection behavior. Methodology/results : We develop a behavioral model of the effect of strategic buckets on project selection and use laboratory experiments to analyze how bucket specifications affect project selection decisions. For various strategic bucket specifications where a rational decision maker would allocate the budget to projects of the project type matching their risk preference only, we find that actual decision makers have the tendency to allocate the budget evenly among buckets and among project types within buckets. This observation can be explained by the naïve diversification bias, and we observe this effect in experimental settings with different selection processes, project definitions, and subject pools. Managerial implications : Our findings allow companies to better understand the effect of buckets guidelines on actual project selection behavior and to manage their project portfolio selection by choosing the right bucket specification.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailers face the challenge of converting website traffic into actual purchases and profits. Specifically, the study examines how effective different forms of retargeting strategies are for engaging consumers who visit online stores but leave without making a purchase. Methodology/results : A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of retargeting strategies offering free shipping (FSR) and free returns (FRR) on customer purchasing behavior and profitability. The key findings reveal that simple product reminders do not significantly boost purchases. In contrast, FSR and FRR implemented late in the shopping process led to significant increases in both purchase rates (18.6% and 31.6%) and targeting profitability (28.2% and 37.8%), respectively. Additional analyses with advanced machine learning methods of causal forest algorithms identified significant heterogeneity of the FSR and FRR effects. FRR was particularly effective among younger customers with less experience on the platform and when the abandoned product was of higher value. In contrast, FSR was more effective among older customers with longer tenure and when the product price was lower. Managerial implications : The findings benefit academics, managers, and decision makers by emphasizing the need for personalized retargeting strategies that address customers’ perceived risks, particularly in the later stages of the shopping process. The research highlights the importance of tailoring retargeting strategies to specific customer profiles to maximize effectiveness and retail profitability. Funding: L.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In practice, supply chain parties often have limited capital, requiring them to seek financing and bear bankruptcy risk. In this paper, we behaviorally investigate a trade credit contract between a supplier and a capital-constrained retailer, the latter of which may face bankruptcy risk. After the supplier proposes a wholesale price, the retailer purchases a quantity through trade credit if its initial capital is insufficient and repays the supplier after demand is realized. If demand is too low, the retailer goes bankrupt. Methodology/Results : Through a controlled-laboratory experiment with human participants, we investigate how a retailer’s exposure to bankruptcy risk, which we vary through its initial capital, affects supply chain decisions and outcomes. We find that the presence of such bankruptcy risk leads to decisions that systematically differ when compared with a setting without bankruptcy risk. Among others, the retailer significantly understocks when exposed to bankruptcy risk, and the supplier attempts to offset this effect by offering a lower wholesale price. The resulting effect is that expected profits for the retailer, supplier, and supply chain are all significantly different than the baseline predictions. To account for these observed decisions, we show that a behavioral model of reference dependence and fairness organizes the data well. Managerial implications : Our work demonstrates that the presence of bankruptcy risk for a retailer significantly alters supply chain decisions in systematic ways, which has direct consequences on profits.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We present a continuous-time Bayesian model for managing inventory in a retail setting when inventory records are inaccurate. In our formulation, the inventory level and its record have separate dynamics. The former is driven by the demand and unobservable loss process, whereas the latter is driven by the demand and transaction error process. Methodology/results : We analytically characterize the dynamics of the retailer’s belief on the shelf inventory level and prove that the optimal restocking policy is a threshold policy. In contrast to prior conjectures, we show that transaction errors play a prominent role in increasing the uncertainty in the shelf inventory distribution. In addition to this confounding effect, the presence of transaction errors breaks the retailer’s ability to calculate this distribution by tracking a small set of sufficient statistics: it remains a function of the entire observed history. Hence, computing the optimal restocking policy, even though we obtain its exact analytical form, remains numerically intractable. We tackle this “curse of dimensionality” by dynamically adjusting the problem’s underlying information filtration. This effectively projects the dynamics of the inventory level onto a manifold that is adaptively adjusting to the information revealed by the inventory record process. Managerial implications : Adding this extra layer of adaptation, implemented by dynamic filtration , enables us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by an arbitrary degree. We show that the resulting implementable policy, which is optimal for the chosen dynamic filtration, also exhibits significant robustness to model misspecification.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Companies operating global supply chains face growing policy uncertainties that affect the costs of importing raw materials (RM) and finished goods (FG) from low-cost to developed countries, as well as the relative profitability of production in different countries. This has prompted the need for diversified global supply chains often involving the addition of onshore production alongside existing offshore facilities. Motivated by recent developments in the U.S. clean energy sector, this paper adopts a game-theoretic model to analyze a global firm’s reshoring capacity decision and output quantity competition with a domestic manufacturer under policy uncertainty. We examine the effects of these policies on operational decisions and profitability for both firms. Methodology/results : We show that the impact of FG tariffs depends on two opposite effects: an output quantity effect that leads to reduction of reshoring investment as the expected unit cost in serving the market increases and an overflow demand effect that encourages more reshoring investment to minimize the overflow of unsatisfied production to offshore locations. RM tariffs do not affect overflow production, and the output quantity effect will always dampen reshoring investment. Because consumer tax credits directly influence market demand, when firms’ output decisions are made after demand and therefore policy realization, the output quantity effect is absent. The overflow demand effect and stimulated higher demand will incentivize higher reshoring investment. Furthermore, we show that higher tariffs hurt the global firm’s profit as tariffs increase its average output cost, whereas tax credits can benefit the firm. Although both policies are intended to protect domestic firms, they may negatively affect their profit when the global firm’s reshoring capacity is high, intensifying competition between them. Finally, the existence of domestic competition will reduce reshoring investment when domestic manufacturing is efficient. However, when global firms have significant cost advantage, the presence of domestic competition may encourage aggressive reshoring investment. Managerial implications : For global firms, investing in reshoring capacity creates a “real option” in production allocation in serving the market, and the provided operational flexibility enhances competitiveness in an uncertain environment. For policymakers, it is crucial to carefully consider the tariff level, which stage of a supply chain to execute trade restrictions on, and tax credit amounts to be used. Very high tariffs on moderate size markets may have unexpected effect on reshoring. Trade and industrial policies should be carefully analyzed for their effectiveness, accounting for cost disadvantages of domestic competitors and market demand strength. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Imperfect produce—edible but cosmetically flawed fruits and vegetables—is often excluded from store shelves, contributing significantly to food waste. Commercializing imperfect produce presents a promising opportunity to reduce waste. This study examines how grocery retailers can best choose from three common retailing strategies: discarding imperfect produce, bunching it with cosmetically perfect produce, or differentiating by selling perfect and imperfect produce separately at different prices. Methodology/results : We develop analytical models that capture consumers’ purchase behaviors under each retailing strategy. These models account for varying consumer preferences and quality perceptions to determine optimal retailer choices and their implications for food waste reduction. Our analysis identifies the specific market conditions under which each retailing strategy becomes optimal. We then examine two widely discussed policy interventions aimed at reducing food waste: educating consumers to improve their perception of imperfect produce and relaxing the tolerance limits for the amount of imperfect produce allowed into retail stores. We find that educating consumers about the value of imperfect produce may inadvertently reduce sales of perfect produce through cannibalization, potentially leading to increased amounts of unsold perfect produce and lower profits. This economic pressure can cause retailers to switch from the differentiating strategy to the discarding strategy, paradoxically increasing food waste. Additionally, relaxing tolerance limits may merely shift food waste from farms to retail stores when retailers employ discarding or differentiating strategies. Our study incorporates three extensions—upcycling imperfect produce into by-products, adopting mixed strategies that combine approaches, and implementing full-shelf ordering policies—which confirm the robustness of our main findings. Managerial implications : This research provides retailers with actionable insights for selecting optimal strategies to manage imperfect produce based on specific consumer preference profiles and market conditions. For policymakers, we offer recommendations that highlight the potential unintended consequences of well-intentioned interventions, suggesting more nuanced approaches to effectively reduce food waste.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Although many retailers allow consumer returns via money-back guarantees (MBGs) to stimulate consumer demand, some may choose not to. Most existing literature emphasizes factors from the marketing side. However, it is not uncommon that the returned products from unsatisfied consumers are further returned to the upstream manufacturer. How the upstream manufacturer–retailer interactions impact the downstream MBG policies is unclear. Methodology/results : We adopt a multiunit bilateral bargaining framework to model the firms’ interactions in distribution channels consisting of a manufacturer and two competing retailers. Interestingly, we find that both bargaining power and contract forms play important roles in determining equilibrium MBG decisions. When both retailers possess the same bargaining power, both retailers offering MBGs arises in equilibrium under the wholesale price contract, whereas the equilibrium MBG decisions depend on the bargaining power under the two-part tariff contract. Particularly, when the manufacturer is relatively weak in the negotiation with retailers, only one channel provides MBGs. When the retailers possess different bargaining powers, regardless of the contract forms, the asymmetric MBG decisions arise when one retailer is significantly more powerful in negotiation with the manufacturer than the other. The channel associated with the retailer with lower bargaining power provides an MBG, whereas the other may not. We further extend our analysis to situations where retailers can salvage the returned products with positive values by themselves, and the manufacturer negotiates with retailers sequentially to confirm our main findings. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that manufacturers should carefully develop product return policies when trading with symmetric retailers under coordinating contracts or asymmetric retailers with imbalanced power distribution.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many service and manufacturing systems use both capacity rationing (CR) and priority to differentiate among their customers. We model these as a two-class nonpreemptive priority M / M / c queueing model and the practice of CR; an arriving low-priority customer can directly enter service only when the number of idle servers is higher than the CR level, k . For these systems, we separately discuss two important features that are common in practice but ignored in the literature; supply is narrowly matched with demand, and service rates are heterogeneous, reflecting different customer types. Methodology and results : When the service times of both classes are identical, our asymptotic results indicate that for a system with a large number of servers, the nondegenerative CR level does not exceed O ( c ) . When the service times of classes differ, we derive exact solutions for different performance measures of interest using queueing and Markov chain decomposition. We numerically demonstrate the impact of system parameters on these performance measures and provide insights on the CR level. Management implications : We show that as predicted by the asymptotic analysis, an O ( c ) CR level can significantly reduce the waits of high-priority customers with little effect on low-priority customers’ waiting. We establish that this insight is robust to heterogeneous service times across classes and other system parameters, such as the number of servers and the arrival rates of the classes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a multiperiod, multiproduct, dynamic pricing problem with price adjustment costs known as “menu costs.” In this setting, decision makers, such as retailers or online platforms, incur a fixed menu cost whenever prices are updated between periods as well as a variable menu cost that linearly scales with the number of between-period price changes. From a demand standpoint, the random number of customers arriving in each period is assumed to be arbitrarily distributed, whereas purchasing decisions are dictated by a time-dependent multinomial logit choice model. Methodology/results : Our first main contribution consists of establishing fundamental hardness results for the dynamic pricing problem of interest, unveiling inherent computational hurdles even when stripped down to its simplest form. On the positive side, we identify grocery retail as a particular application domain whose distinguishing features allow us to develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), through which optimal expected revenues are shown to be approachable within any degree of accuracy. In this context, our methodology synthesizes compact enumeration ideas, novel coupling arguments, and approximate dynamic programming techniques. Managerial implications : Finally, we present two extensive numerical experiments aimed at studying the impacts of menu costs, albeit from distinct vantage points. Both studies make use of a large and diverse test bed of problem instances that we painstakingly construct from a NielsenIQ scanner grocery data set. Given the novelty of incorporating menu costs within dynamic pricing environments, we use the first set of numerical experiments to present what constitutes one of the first close looks at how these price adjustment costs shape pricing patterns and influence optimal gross margins in a multiproduct setting. The second set of experiments is used to evaluate the efficacy of our FPTAS, ultimately showing its mean revenue performance to be within 1%–2% of optimal. In this way, not only do we break ground from a theoretical perspective when it comes to multiproduct dynamic pricing problems in the presence of menu costs, but we also extensively demonstrate the practical viability of our approach.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many services rely on the prosocial behavior of consumers that benefits the wider community for effective delivery, such as bike-sharing schemes, self-service checkouts in grocery stores, and pathology screening services, yet there are frequent challenges in motivating honest, cooperative user behavior in these services. We build on existing research to argue that the degree of anonymity of users toward the service provider can be used to facilitate their prosocial behavior. Anonymity has two effects: It removes the ability of individuals to build a public reputation as someone who is prosocial, but it also removes accountability to others. Although studies have examined the effect of reputational motivation, studies of the effect of accountability on prosocial behavior have been limited to laboratory and online settings, where accountability, mostly toward their peers or to a “higher power,” only benefited other participants. Thus, little is known about how accountability toward the service provider can affect prosocial behavior that benefits the wider public. Methodology/results : We investigate this context with a unique proprietary data set from a pooled asymptomatic pathological screening program. We find that increasing anonymity by removing names from test kits distributed by the service provider decreased voluntary participation by 22%. Social pressures in larger groups partially substituted for the reduced accountability from removing names, providing an insight that can help mitigate reduced accountability in settings where anonymity is preferred. Managerial implications : For managers, we emphasize the value of accountability to the service provider as a motive for prosocial behaviors such as honesty and cooperation. For policymakers, we provide insight into designing healthcare screening and public interaction services.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Digital platforms provide sellers with the opportunity to leverage data analytics products, granting them convenient access to statistical analyses of their business data. To promote the adoption of data analytics products and facilitate the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a world-leading E-commerce platform initiated a “Democratizing Data Analytics” (DDA) campaign in May 2021, which gives free data analytics products access to all sellers on the platform. Leveraging a unique panel data set of over 370,000 sellers and a natural experiment, our study seeks to identify the causal effect of data analytics product adoption on seller performance. Methodology/results : This natural experiment led to a sharp increase in SMEs’ adoption of data analytics. Employing look-ahead propensity score matching (LA-PSM) coupled with difference-in-differences methods, we find that sellers who adopted an analytics product experienced a 14.4% increase in the number of transactions and an 18.8% increase in their revenue. We further explore the rich heterogeneity across sellers and find that younger, smaller sellers, and sellers with fewer cumulative transactions, benefit more from data analytics adoption, highlighting the value of data analytics product adoption for SME growth. Finally, we uncovered the intermediate process and mechanisms underlying such growth by examining how SMEs use data analytics and detailed operational decisions they make. After the adoption of data analytics products, sellers (1) spend more on advertising; (2) edit product titles, descriptions, and images more frequently; and (3) carry more new product stock keeping units and more product categories. Managerial implications : Our research indicates SMEs significantly benefit from adopting data analytics, underscoring the pivotal role these tools play in promoting their growth and development. Meanwhile, platforms or digital economies can increase their gross merchandise volume (GMV) by providing data analytics products to their sellers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how to leverage patient-specific information to improve a hospital’s operational efficiency. We use abdominal surgery as the clinical setting and study the heterogeneous effects of surgical volume on surgery duration. We develop a framework for using patient-specific information by addressing three important questions: (1) Is the effect of surgical volume heterogeneous across patients with different features? (2) If so, how could patient-specific information that captures the heterogeneous effects of surgical volume on surgery duration be generated? (3) What is the value of patient-specific information in helping a hospital improve its operational efficiency? Methodology/results : Using an instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity issues, we first use a regression model to show that the average effect of surgical volume on surgery duration is significant. Then, we use a regression model with interaction terms to show that the effect of surgical volume is heterogeneous. After that, we apply an instrumental variable forest approach to obtain patient-specific volume effects. Finally, we use patient-specific volume effects and an optimization model to assess the potential value of patient-specific information in improving a hospital’s operational efficiency. We find the that total duration of surgeries could be reduced by 2.5%–8.9% if patient-specific volume effects are considered. Managerial implications : This study provides a framework for understanding treatment effect heterogeneity and using patient-specific information to improve a hospital’s operational efficiency. We provide empirical evidence that the effect of surgical volume is heterogeneous and address the challenges of estimating heterogeneous effects for different patients. Our framework can help hospital administrators to better match patients with surgeons, improving a hospital’s operational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The COVID-19 pandemic imposed unprecedented stresses on global supply chains (GSCs), compelling companies to reassess their supply chain structures and strategies. This crisis has also heightened awareness among businesses, consumers, and policymakers about the critical importance and far-reaching implications of GSC design and management. This unique moment presents a generational opportunity for Operations Management (OM) researchers to document and understand the ongoing restructuring of GSCs. Methodology/results : By analyzing microlevel data on U.S. customs import shipments (2019–2021), we uncover shifts in GSC strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firms diversified suppliers within existing sourcing locations and reallocated volumes among them. Whereas dependence on China decreased, imports from other Asian nations like India and Vietnam, as well as North American countries like Canada and Mexico, increased. Industry-specific differences were pronounced, and a notable shift toward lower-frequency, higher-quantity shipments was also observed. Managerial implications : Beyond the challenges of COVID-19, recent years have witnessed other major supply chain disruptions, due to causes such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, and port worker strikes. We offer actionable insights for executives designing supply chain strategies to prepare for similar disruptions as they increase in frequency and severity. We identify future research avenues aimed at enhancing the resilience and adaptability of GSCs in a continuously evolving environment.

We study the causal relationship between drug shortages and medication errors using a natural experiment: hurricane damage to factories that produce heparin, an essential medication used frequently in hospitals. Methodology/results : We collect data on medication errors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System and drug sales from IQVIA’s National Sales Perspective. Applying the synthetic control method, we find that hurricane-related heparin supply disruptions increased medication error rates by 152%. In addition, we find significant spillover effects. The disruption increased medication error rates of a substitute drug, enoxaparin, by about 114%. Managerial implications : Our study uses an exogenous event to show that medication supply chain disruptions may negatively impact hospitals’ quality of care. We contribute to the literature by empirically linking the effects of supply chain disruptions to downstream service quality. Our results show that commonly used measures to mitigate the impact of drug shortages, such as substituting medications, may be unsafe.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Responding to large hurricanes requires the deployment of food, shelter, and medical assistance to relieve the immediate needs of the victims. These services are supported by, and eventually fully transitioned to, local resources, such as grocery stores. However, disparities in local infrastructure and services may result in low-income communities bearing a disproportionate burden from these disasters. We investigate this possibility by testing for differences in the percentage change in paid prices, stockouts, and substitutions for grocery products between low-income and high-income communities following three large Atlantic hurricanes. Methodology/results : We use major disaster declarations by the U.S. federal government, and marry this information to U.S. Census Bureau data on household demographics and third-party data on grocery store sales. Using a triple-difference regression specification, we find that low-income communities in the disaster zones endure higher average percentage price increases within grocery categories compared with high-income communities. We provide evidence for several mechanisms that can contribute to this outcome—higher percent price increases at the product level, more frequent stockouts of low-priced products, and a larger increase in stockout-based substitution from low-priced products to high-priced products. Managerial implications : Product pricing, stockouts, and stockout-based substitutions are important topics in operations management practice and research. We provide empirical evidence across these outcomes of sustained heterogeneous effects by community income level in the aftermath of a hurricane. These findings can inform private and public sector responses to hurricanes, including pricing, prepositioning target goods, strategic overstocking, grocery store access, and structuring cash-and-voucher (C&V) programs that anticipate the disaster-induced substitution patterns of different community types.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a dual sourcing problem in an increasingly volatile world. We consider two types of volatilities. External volatilities reflect fluctuating economic conditions via an underlying Markov-modulated state-of-the-world that affects the two suppliers’ cost structures, capacity limits, supply mechanisms, and demands. Internal volatilities affect the actual outputs resulting from random supply processes. Demand distributions are impacted by both types of volatilities. Methodology/results : We show how the optimal combined ordering strategy from the two suppliers, along with a salvaging policy, can be efficiently computed under the conventional assumption of consecutive lead times. We characterize the relatively simple structure of the optimal policies and systematically compare the two types of volatilities. Managerial implications : By exploiting dual sourcing options, we find that the firm can benefit from external volatilities; indeed, benefits increase as volatilities increase in specific ways. Numerical studies illustrate these results and reject other reasonable conjectures.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper addresses an appointment scheduling problem involving multiple sequential servers using a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach. Two decisions are optimized: the schedule for patient visits and an adjusting policy to rebalance customers’ waiting time across servers. Methodology/results : We formulate the distributionally robust appointment scheduling problem in sequential-servers systems using conic optimization, incorporating service time correlations. We find that the traditional cost-minimization approach results in imbalanced waiting times, concentrated at downstream servers. To address this, we propose strategically idling upstream servers, inspired by queueing literature, and develop a DRO model to jointly optimize the schedule and strategic idling (SI) policy. Through extensive numerical studies, we thoroughly examine the role of SI in a system’s performance and the effect of correlation information on the optimal schedule and SI policy. Finally, using data from a clinic, we conduct a case study to demonstrate the performance advantage of our SI policy, over existing SI policies in the literature. Managerial implications : First, our SI model provides a jointly optimal schedule and SI policy that is effective in balancing waiting times across servers, in some scenarios, and also reduces total waiting time, with the cost borne by the service provider’s overtime. Second, the typical dome-shaped schedule provides an advantage in systems with multiple congested servers, as it evenly distributes congestion across servers. Finally, incorporating correlations lessens the expected cost and improves the patients’ waiting experience with balanced waiting time across servers. Funding: Z.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Cash flow variability is driven by operational decisions and influences operating performance and valuation. Despite this and the early role that operations management scholarship had on cash flow management theory, the prevailing approaches for managing cash flow variability focus on financial remedies. Our research extends this set of remedies by proposing customer portfolio management and selective trade credit as operational hedges for reducing cash flow variability. Methodology/results : We empirically validate our proposal by studying a causal relationship between new customer acquisitions and cash-flow variability using a large database of customer-supplier relationships that we join with quarterly financial reports. We strengthen the inferences from this analysis by assembling random samples of customers for each firm in our study and show that the firms’ actual customer portfolios yield lower cash variability compared with the counterfactual sets of randomly sampled customers. Using aggregate and link-level trade credit data, we show that trade credit harmonization is associated with reduced cash flow variability. Managerial implications : Our analysis shows that firms can reduce their cash variability by (i) pursuing customers with desirable order patterns that offset the cash flow variability from serving legacy customers and (ii) selectively offering customers trade credit that harmonizes payment terms in the customer portfolio.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online marketplaces have revolutionized online sales by creating platforms that connect millions of buyers and sellers. Although the presence of numerous third-party sellers attracts customers, it also results in a proliferation of listings for each product, making it difficult for customers to choose between the available options. To address this issue, online marketplaces employ algorithmic tools to curate and present different product listings to customers. Although tools that assist customers in choosing between different products , such as recommender systems and reviews, have been studied extensively, there is limited evidence regarding tools that help customers choose between different listings of the same product . This paper focuses on the buybox algorithm, an algorithmic tool that prominently presents one option as the default choice to customers. Methodology/results : We assess the influence of the buybox on marketplace dynamics by examining its staggered introduction within a major product category in a leading online marketplace. Our results show that the implementation of buybox increases the number of orders and enhances the efficiency of the customer journey. This is evidenced by an increase in conversion rates and a more pronounced buybox effect on the mobile channel, where search frictions are higher compared with the desktop channel. The introduction of buybox simplifies the process of posting new products on the marketplace, potentially reducing friction for sellers. We find supporting evidence for this hypothesis, because the number of sellers offering a product increases after the introduction of buybox. Managerial implications : Our analysis reveals that a buybox is an effective tool for reducing search frictions and stimulating competition among sellers. Customers benefit from lower prices and higher average quality levels when competition in a buybox is intense. However, the marketplace becomes more concentrated following the introduction of the buybox, representing an unintended consequence that platforms and vendors should manage. Our study contributes to the growing literature on algorithms in platforms by examining how algorithmic curation affects marketplace participants and overall marketplace dynamics.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Micromobility systems (bike-sharing or scooter-sharing) have been widely adopted across the globe as a sustainable mode of urban transportation. To efficiently plan, operate, and monitor such systems, it is crucial to understand the underlying rider demand—where riders come from and the rates of arrivals into the service area. They serve as key inputs for downstream decisions, including capacity planning, location optimization, and rebalancing. Estimating rider demand is nontrivial as most systems only keep track of trip data, which are a biased representation of the underlying demand. Methodology/results : We develop a locational demand model to estimate rider demand only using trip and vehicle status data. We establish conditions under which our model is identifiable. In addition, we devise an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for efficient estimation with closed-form updates on location weights. To scale the estimation procedures, this EM algorithm is complemented with a location-discovery procedure that gradually adds new locations in the service region with large improvements to the likelihood. Experiments using both synthetic data and real data from a dockless bike-sharing system in the Seattle area demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the model and its estimation algorithm. Managerial implications : Our theoretical results shed light on the quality of the estimates and guide the practical usage of this locational demand model. The model and its estimation algorithm equip municipal agencies and fleet operators with tools to effectively monitor service levels using daily operational data and assess demand shifts because of capacity changes at specific locations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The classic newsvendor model yields an optimal decision for a “newsvendor” selecting a quantity of inventory under the assumption that the demand is drawn from a known distribution. Motivated by applications such as cloud provisioning and staffing, we consider a setting in which newsvendor-type decisions must be made sequentially in the face of demand drawn from a stochastic process that is both unknown and nonstationary. All prior work on this problem either (a) assumes that the level of nonstationarity is known or (b) imposes additional statistical assumptions that enable accurate predictions of the unknown demand. Our research tackles the Nonstationary Newsvendor without these assumptions both with and without predictions. Methodology/results : In the setting without predictions, we first design a policy that we prove (via matching upper and lower bounds) achieves order-optimal regret; ours is the first policy to accomplish this without being given the level of nonstationarity of the underlying demand. We then, for the first time, introduce a model for generic (i.e., with no statistical assumptions) predictions with arbitrary accuracy and propose a policy that incorporates these predictions without being given their accuracy. We upper bound the regret of this policy and show that it matches the best achievable regret had the accuracy of the predictions been known. Managerial implications : Our findings provide valuable insights on inventory management. Managers can make more informed and effective decisions in dynamic environments, reducing costs and enhancing service levels despite uncertain demand patterns. This study advances understanding of sequential decision-making under uncertainty, offering robust methodologies for practical applications with nonstationary demand. We empirically validate our new policy with experiments based on three real-world data sets containing thousands of time-series, showing that it succeeds in closing approximately 74% of the gap between the best approaches based on nonstationarity and predictions alone.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper explores budget allocation strategies for a multichannel ad campaign, where a marketing agency strives to maximize the total conversions by dynamically adjusting budget allocation over marketing channels. A salient feature of the problem is the interplay of spillover and carryover effects; namely, customers are exposed to ads through multiple channels, and thus ads from one channel affect the effectiveness of the subsequent ads from other channels. Methodology/results : We construct a simple model that captures the essential features of this problem. Our theoretical analysis yields two main insights. First, motivated by common practice based on the last-click attribution method, we examine a class of budget allocation policies that are oblivious to the spillover and carryover effects. If the agency decreases the budget on a channel based on past low conversions while neglecting to account for the fact that the ads from that channel induced conversions through other channels, then the conversions from that channel will decrease. Consequently, the agency will further decrease the budget on the channel. This pattern repeats, eventually leading to suboptimal performance in the long run. Second, we derive a fluid approximation to consumer dynamics across multiple channels, which lends itself to characterizing structural properties of optimal dynamic budget allocation policies that internalize the cross-channel interactions. To enable practical implementation, we propose a static budget allocation policy that is both tractable in practice and near optimal for long campaigns. Managerial implications : Our theoretical results provide normative guidance for budget allocation in multichannel ad campaigns. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method through a numerical study based on data from an online multichannel ad campaign.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Managers in digital ad agencies face the complex problem of setting prices for new ad campaigns, bidding for viewers on ad exchanges, and allocating them appropriately to campaigns. We have developed an analytical methodology for optimizing the agency’s profits, with uncertainties in the arrival of potential viewers and new ad campaigns and in winning bids and obtaining viewer actions on ad exchanges. Methodology/results : The ad agency manages a series of contracts with advertisers who wish to display their ads to randomly arriving targeted viewers. Advertisers differ in their delay costs and willingness to pay for obtaining various actions by these viewers. We formulate the ad agency’s sequential decision problem as a Markov decision process and develop exact solutions for both finite-horizon and steady-state cases. In our numerical analysis, we find that the finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) solutions converge quickly to time-invariant policies, which are shown to be equivalent to the steady-state solutions. We also develop and test two heuristics that allow our solution methods to be scaled for large problems. Managerial implications : Several managerial implications follow from our paper, which is the first to address this multifaceted ad agency decision problem: (i) managers can exercise three key operational levers to maximize profits: campaign pricing, bidding strategy, and the queue capacity for campaign outcomes; (ii) the effectiveness of these levers varies in different situations, as illustrated by our numerical sensitivity analysis; (iii) optimal dynamic policies that depend on the queue length deliver significantly better profits than optimal static policies; (iv) appropriately designed heuristics can provide accurate solution methods that can be scaled to accommodate the large numbers of campaign outcomes frequently requested in practice; and (v) combining ad campaigns or merging ad agencies leads to higher total profits for the ad agency, lower prices for ad campaigns, and decreased delays in obtaining campaign outcomes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a multistore assortment planning problem in which a seller centrally decides the assortment of products in each store. Each store is visited by a certain fraction of customers. Upon arrival, customers observe the products offered in the current store. The seller can either (1) show products offered in other stores to customers simultaneously (called simultaneous offering strategy) or (2) show products offered in other stores to customers if they decide not to purchase in the current store (called sequential offering strategy). Customers may incur a disutility if they choose products from other stores. We study the optimal assortment planning problem under each of the two strategies and compare their performance. Methodology/results: We show that under the simultaneous strategy, the optimal assortment for each store is revenue-ordered, and the seller cannot do better than if it operates each store separately. In contrast, adopting the sequential strategy can significantly increase the seller’s revenue. In particular, when customers’ disutilities of purchasing from other stores are universally homogeneous, the optimal assortment under the sequential offering strategy is revenue-ordered for each store, and the store with a lower (higher, respectively) demand should offer a larger (smaller, respectively) assortment to facilitate the sequential selling process. We then compare the two offering strategies in terms of the seller’s revenue and customer surplus, and we analyze the impact of parameters on the revenue comparison. We also consider several extensions (e.g., heterogeneous valuation, capacity constraint, and partial recommendation) and find that our main results still hold qualitatively. Managerial implications : The sequential offering strategy may be a better strategy for sellers in practice. We provide detailed guidelines for sellers to implement the sequential strategy, such as regarding the optimal assortment decisions and when sellers can exploit the most benefits.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study innovative capacity-planning strategies for service systems that encounter significant challenges in maintaining service quality because of worker shortages, a prevalent and growing issue across healthcare, retail, customer service, and other labor-intensive sectors. Methodology/results: Using a stylized queueing model representing a centralized service system, we propose a multistage staffing strategy utilizing capacities of various flexibility. Accounting for demand uncertainty and limited worker supply, our model prescribes dynamic staffing decisions, including long-term base staffing, short-term agency staffing, and the allocation of agency staffing in real time. We establish the convexity of the exact cost functions under a reasonable assumption of customer patience. To gain further insights, we characterize approximate solutions under stochastic fluid approximation. We then leverage these approximate solutions to quantify the benefits of flexible capacity in mitigating worker shortages, specifically by analyzing server utilization and cost reduction. A case study using hospital data validates the effectiveness of our staffing solutions; the annual cost reduction can reach at least half a million dollars by switching from independent agency staffing to pooled agency staffing if their unit staffing costs are comparable. Managerial implications: Our study demonstrates that incorporating flexible capacity alleviates heavy utilization of long-term capacity, preventing worker burnout in understaffed systems and ultimately improving the quality of service in the long run. In addition, employing flexible capacity effectively reduces system cost—a combination of staffing and delay costs that reflects the severity of shortages. In terms of cost reduction, a pooling strategy proves to be particularly advantageous when the demands of service units are volatile and countermonotonic. Interestingly, because pooling induces high server utilization (which likely further reduces congestion), a pooling strategy may recommend a higher total capacity than an independent staffing strategy, contrary to the common wisdom that pooling reduces resource requirements.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Behavioral health interventions, delivered through digital platforms, have the potential to significantly improve health outcomes through education, motivation, reminders, and outreach. We study the problem of optimizing personalized interventions for patients to maximize a long-term outcome, in which interventions are costly and capacity constrained. We assume we have access to a historical data set collected from an initial pilot study. Methodology/results : We present a new approach for this problem that we dub DecompPI , which decomposes the state space for a system of patients to the individual level and then approximates one step of policy iteration. Implementing DecompPI simply consists of a prediction task using the data set, alleviating the need for online experimentation. DecompPI is a generic, model-free algorithm that can be used irrespective of the underlying patient behavior model. We derive theoretical guarantees on a simple, special case of the model that is representative of our problem setting. When the initial policy used to collect the data is randomized, we establish an approximation guarantee for DecompPI with respect to the improvement beyond a null policy that does not allocate interventions. We show that this guarantee is robust to estimation errors. We then conduct a rigorous empirical case study using real-world data from a mobile health platform for improving treatment adherence for tuberculosis. Using a validated simulation model, we demonstrate that DecompPI can provide the same efficacy as the status quo approach with approximately half the capacity of interventions. Managerial implications : DecompPI is simple and easy to implement for an organization aiming to improve long-term behavior through targeted interventions, and this paper demonstrates its strong performance both theoretically and empirically, particularly in resource-limited settings.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Problem definition : Efficient allocation of a divisible resource and its associated costs among consumers is a critical issue in many societal decision-making scenarios. This decision is especially difficult when consumers have heterogeneous incomes and private levels of resource utility. Common approaches in practice often overlook either utility heterogeneity or income disparity, leaving a significant gap between potential and actual outcomes. We develop and analyze a resource allocation method to bridge this gap. Methodology/results : Our model incorporates consumer heterogeneity in both income levels and private utility from the resource. We formulate the problem of allocating the resource and its associated costs or savings as a mechanism design problem, aiming to maximize aggregate consumer welfare. We propose a mechanism that offers consumers income-dependent menus (IDMs) of quantity and cost (or savings) options, and uncover structural properties of these menus. Our IDM approach significantly outperforms the considered alternatives in a numerical study calibrated using real-world data. Managerial implications : In the realm of resource allocation where both income and resource utility levels are heterogeneous, significant welfare gains can be realized by judiciously leveraging the dual dimensions of heterogeneity. Implementing our IDM approach ensures that consumers receive and contribute to resources in a manner that reflects their financial capacities and utility levels, maximizing overall welfare.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Substance use disorder (SUD) is a pressing health concern in the United States, and connecting communities with treatment is a growing public health imperative. We study the optimal allocation of substance use treatment centers across counties within U.S. states over a multiyear time horizon. We use a three-part objective function that minimizes (i) statewide overdose deaths, (ii) mismatch between counties’ treatment center access and overdose death rates (inequity), and (iii) mismatch between counties’ treatment center access and population (inequality). We also consider the temporal interdependence of counties’ treatment center allocations and their death-rate-based equity targets. Methodology/results : We use a predict-then-optimize approach based on data from more than 2,500 U.S. counties between 1999 and 2016. We first estimate SUD treatment centers’ causal impact on county-level overdose death rates, using mental health parity laws as an instrument. We then use these estimates in a nonlinear program that reallocates states’ observed levels of SUD treatment funding. Results suggest that this approach can meaningfully reduce statewide overdose deaths and between-county disparities in treatment access. Managerial implications : Prioritizing death rate reductions over equity/equality results in more resources being directed to high-population counties, where treatment centers are most effective. Prioritizing equity/equality in treatment access results in more resources being directed to underserved, low-population counties. We also find that states differ in their Pareto-optimal trade-offs between death rates and inequity/inequality.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Online allocation problems with resource constraints have a rich history in operations management. In this paper, we introduce the regularized online allocation problem , a variant that includes a nonlinear regularizer acting on the total resource consumption. In this problem, requests repeatedly arrive over time, and for each request, a decision-maker needs to take an action that generates a reward and consumes resources. The objective is to simultaneously maximize additively separable rewards and the value of a non-separable regularizer subject to the resource constraints. Methodology/results: We design an algorithm that is simple and fast and attains good performance with stochastic and adversarial inputs. In particular, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal under stochastic i.i.d. input models, attains a fixed competitive ratio that depends on the regularizer when the input is adversarial, and can handle a sublinear amount of non-stationarity. Furthermore, the algorithm and analysis do not require convexity or concavity of the reward function and the consumption function, which allows more model flexibility. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and of regularization in an Internet advertising application. Managerial implications: Introducing a regularizer allows decision-makers to trade off separable objectives such as the economic efficiency of an allocation with ancillary, non-separable objectives such as fairness or equity of an allocation. Our results have implications for online allocation problems across many sectors, such as Internet advertising, cloud computing, and humanitarian logistics, in which fairness and equity are key considerations for managers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The covert nature of sex trafficking provides a significant barrier to generating large-scale, data-driven insights to inform law enforcement, policy, and social work. Existing research has focused on analyzing commercial sex sales on the internet to capture scalable geographical proxies for trafficking. However, ads selling commercial sex do not reveal information about worker consent. Therefore, it is challenging to identify risk for trafficking, which involves fraud, coercion, or abuse. Methodology/results : We leverage massive deep web data (collected globally from leading commercial sex websites) in tandem with a novel machine learning framework (combining natural language processing, active learning, and network analysis) to study how and where sex worker recruitment occurs. This allows us to unmask potentially deceptive recruitment patterns (e.g., an entity that recruits for modeling but sells sex), which signal high trafficking risk. We demonstrate via simulations that our approach outperforms existing active learning techniques to identify key nodes and edges in the underlying trafficking network. Our analysis provides a geographical network view of online commercial sex supply chains, highlighting deceptive recruitment-to-sales pathways that are likely trafficking routes. Managerial implications : Our results can help law enforcement agencies along trafficking routes better coordinate efforts to tackle trafficking entities at both ends of the supply chain, as well as target local social policies and interventions toward exploitative recruitment behavior frequently exhibited in that region.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The opioid crisis has been called the worst drug crisis in American history. Although myriad factors influencing this crisis have been examined, the questions of whether and how the diversion of prescription (Rx) opioids from legal supply chain channels to illegal marketplaces contributes to the ongoing crisis remain understudied. Methodology/results : We utilize the enactment of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) and cross-state variations in initial Rx opioid seizures, measured before the policy intervention, to investigate the impacts of supply chain diversion. The results indicate that states with higher initial Rx opioid seizures have experienced greater decreases in Rx opioid abuse treatment admissions and mortality following the enactment of the DSCSA. Specifically, states with one-standard-deviation-higher initial Rx opioid seizures experienced an average of 9.3% greater decrease in Rx opioid treatment admissions (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1%–16.9%) and an average of 10.2% greater decrease in Rx opioid mortality (95% CI: 3.5%–16.6%) following the enactment of the DSCSA. Notably, the study identifies an underlying mechanism of supply chain diversion— pharmacy procurement transactions —surrounding three types of prescription opioids: morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone. Finally, we conduct falsification tests to evaluate the validity of drug supply chain diversion and the pharmacy procurement channel in contributing to the diversion. Managerial implications : This study informs policymakers, the Food and Drug Administration, and supply chain practitioners about opioid diversion risks in pharmaceutical supply chains and highlights the role of supply chain traceability as a risk mitigation strategy to combat the ongoing crisis. Further, by identifying fraudulent pharmacy transactions as an underlying mechanism for supply chain diversion and specific prescription opioids that are targets of diversion, this study highlights the need for the Drug Enforcement Administration to devise more precise, targeted plans to identify suspicious pharmacy orders of certain types of prescription opioids to counter rampant diversionary efforts.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates how a crowdfunding campaign’s voluntary disclosure of sensitive cost information affects its funding performance on Kickstarter—a mainstream, primarily reward-based crowdfunding platform. Instead of enhancing a campaign’s marketing traits, project budget as a novel information-provision tool reminds the crowd of the behind-the-scenes operations for developing and executing a project. This resembles the radical practice of cost transparency recently observed in the retail industry and studied experimentally in the literature. We also separate the disclosure effect on reward seeking versus altruistic pledges and examine how it varies with the structure of the cost items (fixed versus variable costs). Methodology/results : Our data collection follows Kickstarter’s rollout of the Project Budget tool in 2019. The project-level raw data are preprocessed via coarsened exact matching to match projects with and without budgets. We show that the main channel through which budget provision improves funding performance is via attracting additional funding, not by cannibalizing competing projects. Because of the voluntary nature of budget provision, we address the resulting endogeneity issue using peer average-style instruments. Budget provision on average increases funding performance by over 100%, which is more effective than many information-provision tools studied. Interestingly, this funding improvement comes from an increased number of backers (width), not from a higher pledge per backer (depth), and from a considerably higher number of altruistic pledges, not from more reward-seeking pledges. Further, a higher fixed-cost (over total cost) ratio, which is indicative of a higher profit margin, significantly reduces the benefit but does not make disclosure backfire. Managerial implications : Showing the costs to customers can be highly effective in business settings where trust between stakeholders is critical, which implies a promising generalization to donation-based crowdfunding. Our results can also be used to guide a sequential rollout of the Project Budget feature across campaign categories and promote adoption rates. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Problem Definition: Proficiency in many sophisticated tasks is attained through experience-based learning, in other words, learning by doing. For example, transplant centers’ surgical teams need to practice difficult surgeries to master the skills required. Meanwhile, this experience-based learning may affect other stakeholders, such as patients eligible for transplant surgeries, and require resources, including scarce organs and continual efforts. To ensure that patients have excellent outcomes and equitable access to organs, the organ allocation authority needs to quickly identify and develop medical teams with high aptitudes. This entails striking a balance between exploring surgical combinations with initially unknown full potential and exploiting existing knowledge based on observed outcomes. Methodology/results: We formulate a multi-armed bandit (MAB) model in which parametric learning curves are embedded in the reward functions to capture endogenous experience-based learning. In addition, our model includes provisions ensuring that the choices of arms are subject to fairness constraints to guarantee equity. To solve our MAB problem, we propose the L-UCB and FL-UCB algorithms, variants of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that attain the optimal O ( log t ) regret on problems enhanced with experience-based learning and fairness concerns. We demonstrate our model and algorithms on the split liver transplantation (SLT) allocation problem, showing that our algorithms have superior numerical performance compared with standard bandit algorithms in a setting where experience-based learning and fairness concerns exist. Managerial implications: From a methodological point of view, our proposed MAB model and algorithms are generic and have broad application prospects. From an application standpoint, our algorithms could be applied to help evaluate potential strategies to increase the proliferation of SLT and other technically difficult procedures.

Although the demand uncertainty is exogenous, the absenteeism uncertainty is decision-dependent , that is, the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse staffing level. For quality of care, hospitals develop float pools of hospital units and train nurses to be able to work in multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortages. Methodology/results : We study a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model that considers both exogenous and decision-dependent uncertainties. We derive a separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Managerial implications : Through the numerical case studies, based on the data of a collaborating hospital, we found that modeling decision-dependent absenteeism improves the out-of-sample performance of staffing decisions, and such improvement is positively correlated with the value of flexibility arising from fully utilizing float pools.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Women have been shown to prefer jobs with a better work-life balance across many fields. Given that serving as a state political representative requires a significant amount of travel between one’s home district and the state capitol, this suggests that long commute distances may reduce the number of women seeking political office in the United States. At the same time, state political positions vary in their degree of flexibility (e.g., full-time versus part-time) and commensurate compensation, which could make them more or less desirable to women. We analyze the extent to which longer commute distances deter female political participation and whether this effect varies according to the degree of flexibility and commensurate compensation provided by the position. Furthermore, we investigate policies that can lower the barrier to entry for women in politics. Methodology/results : Leveraging differences in distance to the state capitol among state legislative districts, we show that districts located further from the state capitol in states with full-time legislatures have a lower percentage of female candidates, whereas in states with part-time legislatures, the opposite is true. The effect in hybrid states, that is, those state legislatures with a workload between part-time and full-time, appears to be slightly negative or neutral. We then conduct two conjoint survey experiments administered to a pool of college students and past political candidates to understand how policies allowing for paid parental leave, remote work/proxy voting, or daycare benefits in political positions could help to close the gender gap in politics. We find that paid parental leave might motivate women at the beginning of their political careers with longer commutes to run for office while a remote work/proxy voting policy could help to sustain the political careers of these types of women. Managerial implications : For organizers and policymakers seeking to encourage more women to run for office, our work shows that commute distance is a barrier for would-be candidates in states with full-time legislatures and that making paid parental leave and remote work/proxy voting available may help.

Motivated by China’s regulatory journey that first mandated authorized remanufacturing and then moved to a laissez-faire policy, our goal is to understand which policy is better from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Methodology/results : We use a game-theoretic approach and consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier, an OEM, and an IR under the two policy regimes. Conventional wisdom suggests that the IR would be better off under the laissez-faire policy, but the OEM and the supplier would be better off under the mandatory authorization policy. However, we show that this conventional wisdom may not hold. For products with a low remanufacturing cost, all firms benefit from the mandatory authorization policy, whereas for products with a moderately high remanufacturing cost, all firms are better off under the laissez-faire policy. Further, mandatory authorization may outperform the laissez-faire policy in both economic and environmental dimensions. Managerial implications : Our findings reveal that seemingly advantageous policy regimes may backfire for firms. Therefore, before supporting such policies, the firms need to assess the strategic reactions of other firms and the potential impacts on their profits. Furthermore, a mandatory authorization policy can be beneficial in fostering the development of the remanufacturing sector for products with low remanufacturing costs. Nevertheless, it may also lead to an increase in the total environmental impact. Funding: The work of M.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : It is well known that the power sector requires flexibility, especially from fossil fuel–based power-generating units, to balance demand side variability and supply side fluctuations. However, the environmental consequences related to possessing and exercising such flexibility remain relatively unexplored. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of two forms of flexibility pertinent to power generation: fuel flexibility —that is, the ability to utilize multiple fuel types, and volume flexibility —that is, the ability to alter production volumes quickly. Methodology/results : We assembled a data set that spans 1998–2016 and includes details on fuel usage, power generation, generating unit characteristics, and carbon dioxide (i.e., CO 2 ) emissions for 3,135 fossil fuel power-generating units that account for more than 92% of the United States’ fossil fuel–generating capacity. Our empirical analysis reveals that power-generating units that possess fuel flexibility or volume flexibility generate greater CO 2 emissions than comparable nonflexible generating units. Additionally, when power-generating units exercise fuel flexibility (i.e., they use multiple fuel types in a period) or volume flexibility (i.e., they vary production to a greater degree in a period), they generate greater CO 2 emissions. By contrast, when power-generating units exercise both fuel and volume flexibility, we find that they diminish the aggregate emissions increases expected from exercising fuel or volume flexibility alone. Managerial implications : We add to the literature by exploring how flexibility affects environmental performance and by disambiguating the effects of possessing flexibility and exercising flexibility. These results are important when considering the penetration of renewables, the adoption of utility-grade storage, and demand response as each of these paths can significantly affect the flexibility burden placed on conventional sources of power. Thus, our results are relevant to policy makers and practitioners because they crystallize the environmental tradeoffs involved with deploying flexibility in fossil fuel–based power-generating units.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The asymmetric pull-to-center effect for newsvendors is a robust finding in operations, and understanding why newsvendors make suboptimal decisions is key for identifying ways to improve decision-making quality in this critical task. Although prior studies have indicated that experience does not substantially mitigate the pull-to-center effect, the experience levels achieved in those previous studies are limited in comparison with the experience level that a near-continuous time environment can provide. Methodology/results : We conduct a set of laboratory experiments using a near-continuous time environment to determine the effect that extensive experience has on newsvendor behavior and the extent to which resultant learning is transferable across conditions. Observed behavior clearly demonstrates that the pull-to-center effect is substantially reduced, if not eliminated, with sufficient experience and that this learning can have positive spillovers to more traditional settings. Further, the experiments suggest that it is the repeated feedback regarding a given inventory decision rather than the ability to explore many strategies that drives improved decision making. Managerial implications : Experience can mitigate the pull-to-center effect, and near-continuous time environments can be an effective training tool for gaining such experience.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a feature-based pricing problem with demand censoring in an offline, data-driven setting. In this problem, a firm is endowed with a finite amount of inventory and faces a random demand that is dependent on the offered price and the features (from products, customers, or both). Any unsatisfied demand that exceeds the inventory level is lost and unobservable. The firm does not know the demand function but has access to an offline data set consisting of quadruplets of historical features, inventory, price, and potentially censored sales quantity. Our objective is to use the offline data set to find the optimal feature-based pricing rule so as to maximize the expected profit. Methodology/results : Through the lens of causal inference, we propose a novel data-driven algorithm that is motivated by survival analysis and doubly robust estimation. We derive a finite sample regret bound to justify the proposed offline learning algorithm and prove its robustness. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robust performance of our proposed algorithm in accurately estimating optimal prices on both training and testing data. Managerial implications : The work provides practitioners with an innovative modeling and algorithmic framework for the feature-based pricing problem with demand censoring through the lens of causal inference.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine how to manage turnover among drivers delivering parcels for last-mile platforms. Although driver attrition in these platforms is both commonplace and costly, there is little understanding of the processes responsible for this phenomenon. Methodology/results : We collaborate with a platform to build a structural model to estimate the effects of key predictors of drivers’ decisions to leave or remain at the platform. For this estimation, we apply a dynamic discrete-choice framework in a two-step procedure that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity among drivers while circumventing the use of approximation or reduction methods commonly used to solve dynamic choice problems in the operations management domain. Drivers are compensated using a combination of regular payments that reward their productivity and subsidy payments that support them as they gain experience on the job. We find that regular pay has a greater effect on drivers’ retention. Furthermore, the marginal effects of both regular and subsidy pay diminish with drivers’ tenure at the platform, but the latter diminishes faster than the former. Additionally, we find significant heterogeneity among drivers in their unobserved nonpecuniary taste for the jobs at the platform and a significantly greater probability of retention among drivers with greater taste for these jobs. Managerial implications : Platforms can leverage our results to improve driver retention and design more profitable payment policies. We perform counterfactual analyses and develop a modeling framework to guide platforms toward this goal. Funding: This study was partially funded by a grant from TForce Logistics.

We analyze (a) customers’ heterogeneous search and purchase behaviors and (b) their reactions to changes in assortment size. We then develop a consider-then-choose model to generalize our findings. Methodology/results : We characterize the online customer journey as a two-stage consider-then-choose framework. In the consider stage, we analyze the consideration set formation and show that heterogeneity—familiarity with the assortment—amplifies the number of options; in the purchase stage, it drives preferences for niche versus popular choices. A real-world high-stakes field experiment reveals that shrinking the menu produces mixed results: highlighting the market for the long-tail for some customers and reflecting choice overload for others. Finally, we build a psychologically rich consider-then-choose model with (a) heterogeneous preferences for product features and (b) heterogeneous search costs moderated by search fatigue, theoretically characterizing the impact on consideration sets and conversion rates. Managerial implications : Identifying frictions in the shopping funnel is critical for online platforms, especially when pain points hurt click-through or conversion rates. Which options matter to which users? What is the right assortment size? Although online platforms can offer virtually unlimited assortments, managers may assume frictionless environments—which is not always the case.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Short video format platforms like NetEase and TikTok are attention economies that host user-generated content, in the form of combined video and audio elements, and operate on principles of network virality. This study explores user content creation strategies by focusing on decisions around content release frequency and the incorporation of adopted content in newly generated creations. Methodology/results : We theoretically explore the role of the following three mechanisms influencing these decisions: (a) social hierarchies in the platform’s network structure, (b) virality of content on the platform, and (c) algorithmic interventions through the ranking of content recommendations. To empirically study these relationships, we use a detailed log of user activity on NetEase Cloud Village registered during the month of November 2019 and carry out regression-based analyses. We find that high-status users, measured through their follower count, adapt their content release frequency strategically, slowing down after successful content to avoid dilution of potential virality. We also observe that high-status users generally deviate from prevailing viral trends in their content creation. However, following exceptionally successful releases, they tend to conform more to viral content, suggesting a risk-averse approach. Finally, contrary to algorithm aversion, users prefer content recommended by the platform. However, high-status users disregard algorithms to retain agency in decision making. Managerial implications : Our findings provide a holistic understanding of the content creation process and suggest that platforms could strategically adjust algorithmic ranking policies to foster content creation diversity while catering to the preferences of users with different status levels.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the impact of an airline’s route-level decisions on the efficiency and resilience of its operations. Methodology/results : Our study uses a proprietary passenger-level data set provided by Southwest Airlines and takes advantage of a regulatory change, the Wright Amendment repeal. The Wright Amendment restricted nonstop service between Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL) and most major destinations. Its repeal led to significant changes in Southwest’s service offerings at DAL. We use a difference-in-differences framework to quantify the impact of the repeal on the scheduled travel times and long travel delays at the passenger level, which serve as proxies for efficiency and resilience, respectively. We show that the repeal’s impact varies widely across destinations. Although Southwest introduced nonstop service to some destinations but not others after the repeal, this decision alone does not sufficiently explain the observed heterogeneity. As such, we develop two route-level metrics—route inefficiency and route resilience—to explain the heterogeneous impact of the repeal on different destinations. Moreover, our counterfactual analysis shows that reallocating connecting passengers with small itinerary buffers to alternative itineraries can result in major resilience improvements without significantly deteriorating efficiency. Managerial implications : Our findings are robust to alternative empirical specifications and have important implications for practitioners and regulators. Specifically, our study not only sheds light on the operational consequences of airlines’ route-level decisions but also demonstrates how managers can effectively manage the efficiency-resilience tradeoff for connecting passengers. Our study also implies that regulators can add more transparency to airline operations by providing public access to passenger-level data.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Improving the surplus of low-income consumers during economic distress is of primary concern for many governments. This paper uses an economic model to investigate consumers’ brand switching during economic distress and highlights its disparate impact on low-income consumers. Our modeling framework also captures how retailers and national-brand manufacturers strategically adjust the market prices in response to brand switching and shelf space constraints. To generate prescriptive insights, we also analyze the effectiveness of commonly observed government interventions that fall into two major categories: (i) consumer-focused (e.g., cash subsidy) and (ii) retailer-focused (e.g., price control). Methodology/results : Our analysis indicates that market access for low-income consumers can decline significantly because of the brand switching behavior. Furthermore, not all government interventions are equally effective in increasing the welfare of low-income consumers. In fact, retailer-focused schemes such as price control (PC) can backfire and decrease access for low-income consumers. Although cash subsidy (CS) can increase the surplus of low-income consumers, it is always at the expense of high-income consumers. Managerial implications : We study an important but understudied challenge that highlights how strategic behavior by retailers can exacerbate affordability and accessibility concerns during economic distress. Model calibration using NielsenIQ Homescan Panel data shows that our model captures the data well and generates practical insights for policymakers. These results suggest that the success of government interventions depends critically on whether they account for the strategic behavior of different stakeholders in the supply chain.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Cloud computing is a multibillion-dollar business that draws substantial capital investments from large companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Large cloud providers need to accommodate the growing demand for computing resources while avoiding unnecessary overprovisioning of hardware and operational costs. The underlying decision processes are challenging, as they involve long-term hardware and infrastructure investments under future demand uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce the cloud server deployment problem . One important aspect of the problem is that the infrastructure preparation work has to be planned for before server deployments can take place. Furthermore, a combination of temporal constraints has to be considered together with a variety of physical constraints. Methodology/results : We formulate the underlying optimization problem as a two-stage stochastic program. After carefully examining the demand data and on-the-ground deployment operations, we distill two structural properties on deployment throughput constraints and provide tightness results on a convex relaxation of the second stage. Based on that, we develop efficient cutting-plane methods that exploit the special structure of the problem and can accommodate different risk measures. We test our algorithms with real production traces from Microsoft Azure and demonstrate sizeable cost reductions. We show empirically that the algorithms remain optimal even when the two properties are not fully satisfied. Managerial implications : Cloud supply chain operations were largely executed manually due to their complexity and dynamic nature. In this paper, we show that the key decision processes can be systematically optimized. In particular, we demonstrate that accounting for the stochastic nature of demands results in substantial cost reductions in cloud server deployments. Another benefit of our stochastic optimization approach is the ability to seamlessly integrate configurable risk preferences of cloud providers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The rise of digital channels has led to significant media market transformations. This paper studies whether and how digitization, sparked by the launch of Amazon Kindle in late 2007, affected print book sales. Methodology/results: To estimate the impact, we exploit the quasiexperimental variation in the popularity of digital books across different genres or subgenres. We employ difference-in-differences and other identification strategies, and we use print sales data on a large representative sample of book titles published in the United States from 2004 to 2015 across a variety of genres. Using various empirical specifications, we find that digitization significantly reduced print sales of adult fiction (the most popular genre in the e-book format) while having a much smaller impact on adult nonfiction and juvenile fiction. We further find that the effect for adult fiction is higher after the launch of the iPad (in 2010) and stronger for smaller publishers, the paperback version, and low-selling books. Managerial implications : Our findings provide book publishers with key inputs for optimal pricing and release strategies of different book formats. Our study also extends the vast yet growing academic literature on the impact of digital distribution channels on existing sales channels and can inform the policy debate concerning third-party digitization and its effect on physical sales.

Methodology/results : We develop a unified optimization methodology that applies efficient frontier and dimensional reduction and transforms the joint optimization problem into a single-variable one with respect to the total choice probability. The efficient frontier is employed to transform the nonconcave objective function equivalently into its concave counterpart. We show that the optimal prices are uniquely determined by the common target adjusted markup. The complexity of the mixed combinatorial optimization problem can be reduced by searching over efficient sets of polynomial size. In the randomized assortment and pricing problem in which the product offer sets and prices follow certain distribution, we show that randomization has the potential to elevate the total revenue to the exact efficient frontier, a feat that the static problem may fail to achieve (with a given total choice probability). For dynamic joint product selection and pricing, we find that the optimal policy adopts a simple time-threshold structure that can be precomputed. Furthermore, we illustrate the robustness of our methodology by extending the analysis to a variety of general settings, including the nested logit model. Managerial implications : The proposed methodology contributes to the increasingly popular topic in retail management by significantly reducing the computational complexity of joint product offering and pricing under different constraints. Our results regarding the effects of product set constraints and price bounds provide valuable insights and guidance to practitioners on product offering and pricing in various business scenarios.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimizing long-term discounted reward problems with large combinatorial action space and state dependent constraints. These characteristics are common to many operations management problems, for example, network inventory replenishment, where managers have to deal with uncertain demand, lost sales, and capacity constraints that results in more complex feasible action spaces. Our proposed programmable actor RL (PARL) uses a deep-policy iteration method that leverages neural networks to approximate the value function and combines it with mathematical programming and sample average approximation to solve the per-step-action optimally while accounting for combinatorial action spaces and state-dependent constraint sets. Methodology/results : We then show how the proposed methodology can be applied to complex inventory replenishment problems where analytical solutions are intractable. We also benchmark the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art RL algorithms and commonly used replenishment heuristics and find that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms existing methods by as much as 14.7% on average in various complex supply chain settings. Managerial implications : We find that this improvement in performance of PARL over benchmark algorithms can be directly attributed to better inventory cost management, especially in inventory constrained settings. Furthermore, in the simpler setting where optimal replenishment policy is tractable or known near optimal heuristics exist, we find that the RL-based policies can learn near optimal policies. Finally, to make RL algorithms more accessible for inventory management researchers, we also discuss the development of a modular Python library that can be used to test the performance of RL algorithms with various supply chain structures. This library can spur future research in developing practical and near-optimal algorithms for inventory management problems.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly leveraged in business and consumer decision-making processes. Because LLMs learn from human data and feedback, which can be biased, determining whether LLMs exhibit human-like behavioral decision biases (e.g., base-rate neglect, risk aversion, confirmation bias, etc.) is crucial prior to implementing LLMs into decision-making contexts and workflows. To understand this, we examine 18 common human biases that are important in operations management (OM) using the dominant LLM, ChatGPT. Methodology/results : We perform experiments where GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 act as participants to test these biases using vignettes adapted from the literature (“standard context”) and variants reframed in inventory and general OM contexts. In almost half of the experiments, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) mirrors human biases, diverging from prototypical human responses in the remaining experiments. We also observe that GPT models have a notable level of consistency between the standard and OM-specific experiments as well as across temporal versions of the GPT-3.5 model. Our comparative analysis between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 reveals a dual-edged progression of GPT’s decision making, wherein GPT-4 advances in decision-making accuracy for problems with well-defined mathematical solutions while simultaneously displaying increased behavioral biases for preference-based problems. Managerial implications : First, our results highlight that managers will obtain the greatest benefits from deploying GPT to workflows leveraging established formulas. Second, that GPT displayed a high level of response consistency across the standard, inventory, and non-inventory operational contexts provides optimism that LLMs can offer reliable support even when details of the decision and problem contexts change. Third, although selecting between models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, represents a trade-off in cost and performance, our results suggest that managers should invest in higher-performing models, particularly for solving problems with objective solutions.

Methodology/results : This article explores the factors that enabled publicly traded companies to be relatively more successful with DEI implementation and provides insights into how privately held companies can improve their DEI performance. We highlight the role of transparency in driving positive DEI change in publicly traded companies, which are also more likely to benefit from DEI initiatives because of their greater access to the resources required for implementation and a higher degree of customization. We describe additional barriers to DEI implementation, by which the differences between company types are less certain. These barriers include unawareness of or skepticism about the benefits of DEI programs in supply chains, internal opposition from advantaged groups, and the geographical scope of operations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Prototyping and testing are an integral part of almost any new product development process, helping firms navigate the inherent uncertainties of creating new products. Recent developments in rapid prototyping, including technologies that enable cheaper low-fidelity tests, have opened up the possibilities for firms in reconfiguring their product development processes. Firms can, by choosing the level of evaluation fidelity, alter the traditional cost-quality trade-offs inherent in sequential prototyping. Methodology/results : The current article formulates a general model of sequential search where firms can proceed by obtaining noisy low-fidelity evaluations of their prototypes. Our results demonstrate that the imperfect fidelity of evaluations alters the firm’s optimal experimentation, with the starkest difference being that it may make it optimal for the firm to select and launch a prototype that did not yield the best evaluation. In addition, our analysis of optimal measurement technology reveals that the focal firm should demand the most precise measurements when their ex-ante uncertainty is moderate (not too high or low). We also consider extensions analyzing how the optimal choice of evaluation fidelity is affected by the number of available prototypes, by operational flexibility (to dynamically change measurement technology), and by the ability to outsource evaluations to an experimentation platform. Managerial implications : We develop managerial insights for how the optimal choice of fidelity and the optimal length of the evaluation cycle should be planned depending on the evaluation costs and the firm’s ex-ante uncertainty. The resulting framework offers guidance to product and software development firms to successfully leverage imperfect fidelity experiments.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Limited resources in the judicial system can lead to costly delays, stunted economic development, and even failure to deliver justice. Using the Supreme Court of India as an exemplar for such resource-constrained settings, we apply ideas from service operations to study delay. Specifically, court dynamics constitute a case-management queue , whereby each case may experience multiple service encounters spread across time, but all are necessarily with the same server. Our goal is to elucidate the drivers of congestion, focusing on metrics such as the expected case-disposition time (delay) and expected number of cases awaiting adjudication (pendency), and leverage this understanding to recommend operational interventions. Methodology/results : We employ data-driven calibrated simulations to model the analytically intractable case-management queue. The life cycle of a case comprises two stages: preadmission (before determining its merit for detailed hearings) and postadmission. Our methodology allows us to capture the queueing dynamics in which the judges are shared resources across the two stages. It also permits modeling of holiday capacity, which is flexibly tailored to address any surplus work that spills over from the regular year. We find that the second stage of this judicial queue is overloaded, but holiday capacity creates a perception of stability by steadying performance metrics. Managerial implications : The sources of inefficiency that drive congestion include a misalignment between scheduling guidelines and judicial capacity, coupled with the requirement to schedule hearings in advance. Together, these factors inhibit utilization of shared capacity across the two-stage judicial queue. We demonstrate how interventions that account for these inefficiencies can successfully tackle judicial delay. In particular, scheduling to improve the allocation of time across preadmission and postadmission cases can cut down the expected delay by as much as 65%.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we investigate how line-sitting and express lines affect customers’ satisfaction and fairness perception about queues. In line-sitting, customers skip the wait by hiring others to stand in line on their behalf. In express lines, customers skip the wait by purchasing priority. Because both schemes disrupt the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule, they may be perceived to be unfair and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Methodology/results : In three experiments, we find that customers are more satisfied with the overall queueing experience when they encounter a line-sitter than when they encounter an express-line customer, even when the wait time is held constant. We also find that customers perceive express lines as less fair than line-sitting, which has a significant influence on their satisfaction. A key operational difference between line-sitting and express lines is that line-sitting involves a one-to-one swap between a line-sitter doing a fair share of waiting and their client, whereas express lines insert a new priority customer into the queue without an existing surrogate in the queue. We show that if line-sitting includes an insertion by letting a line-sitter hold a spot for more than one customer, then line-sitting is perceived to be just as unfair and unsatisfying as express lines. Managerial implications : Our results imply that express lines can engender a lower fairness perception, thus harming future business through both more negative word of mouth and a higher customer churn. Therefore, service providers should beware of customer backlash against express lines and yet be more open-minded about line-sitting, provided that one-to-one swaps can be enforced.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : With the rapid growth of e-commerce, platforms are able to gather large quantities of data, which can result in high-precision predictions regarding consumer purchasing patterns and future demand. A fundamental question is whether a platform has the incentives and ability to share such nonverifiable information with its sellers. Methodology/results : We show that when information is nonverifiable, sharing the precise value of the platform’s private information by means of cheap-talk cannot result in an equilibrium. This outcome is due to the incentive of the platform to portray a more favorable market condition than that predicted, in order to encourage the sellers to raise their prices and improve market efficiency. In spite of this negative result, we demonstrate that the level of incentives misalignment between the platform and its sellers is bounded; consequently, a region-forecast information-sharing equilibrium can emerge. In this equilibrium, the support of the platform’s private information is divided into several intervals, and the platform strategically chooses to report truthfully the interval containing its private information. The structure of the partition is influenced by two main factors: the incentive of the platform to reduce market uncertainty for the sellers, and the motivation of the platform to soften competition among the sellers. Although both the sellers and the platform benefit from the ability to share some level of information, such an outcome hurts the consumers. Managerial implications : This work explains the observed practice of a platform providing nonverifiable information to its sellers via cheap-talk. The main advantage of this equilibrium is the ability to share information in a costless manner; however, the amount of information that can be shared is limited and is influenced by the level of market competition between the sellers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailing platforms are increasingly relying on personalized recommender systems to help guide consumer choice. An important but understudied question in such settings is how many products to include in a recommendation set. In this work, we study how the number of recommended products influences consumers’ search and purchase behavior in an online personalized recommender system within a retargeting setting. Methodology/results : Via a field experiment involving 1.6 million consumers on an online retailing platform, we causally demonstrate that consumers’ likelihood of purchasing any product from the recommendation set first increases then decreases as the number of recommended products increases. Importantly, as much as 64% of the decrease in purchase probability (i.e., the choice overload effect) can be attributed to a decrease in consumers’ likelihood of starting a search (i.e., clicking on any recommended product). We discuss the possible behavioral mechanisms driving these results and analyze how these effects could be heterogeneous across different product categories, price ranges, and timing. Managerial implications : This work presents real-world experimental evidence for the choice overload effect in online retailing platforms, highlights the important role of consumer search behavior in driving this effect, and sheds light on when and how limiting the number of options in a recommender system may be beneficial to online retailers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the problem of forecasting an entire demand distribution for a new product before and after its launch. Firms need accurate distributional forecasts of demand to make operational decisions about capacity, inventory, and marketing expenditures. We introduce a unified, robust, and interpretable approach to producing these pre- and postlaunch distributional forecasts. Methodology/results : Our approach is inspired by Bayesian model averaging. Each candidate model in our ensemble is a life-cycle model fitted to the completed life cycle of a comparable product. A prelaunch forecast is an ensemble with equal weights on the candidate models’ forecasts, whereas a postlaunch forecast is an ensemble with weights that evolve according to Bayesian updating. Our approach is part frequentist and part Bayesian, resulting in a novel approach tailored to the demand forecasting challenge. We also introduce a new type of life-cycle or product diffusion model with states that can be updated using exponential smoothing. The trend in this model follows the density of an exponentially tilted Gompertz random variable. For postlaunch forecasting, this model is attractive because it can adapt itself to the most recent changes in a product’s life cycle. We provide closed-form distributional forecasts from our model. In two empirical studies, we show that when the ensemble’s candidate models are all in our new type of exponential smoothing model, this version of the ensemble outperforms several leading approaches in both point and quantile forecasting. Managerial implications : In a data-driven operations environment, our model can produce accurate forecasts frequently and at scale. When quantile forecasts are needed, our model has the potential to provide meaningful economic benefits. In addition, our model’s interpretability should be attractive to managers who already use exponential smoothing and ensemble methods for other forecasting purposes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by carbon emissions trading schemes (ETSs), Treasury auctions, procurement auctions, and wholesale electricity markets, which all involve the auctioning of homogeneous multiple units, we consider the problem of learning how to bid in repeated multiunit pay-as-bid (PAB) auctions. In each of these auctions, a large number of (identical) items are to be allocated to the largest submitted bids, where the price of each of the winning bids is equal to the bid itself. In this work, we study the problem of optimizing bidding strategies from the perspective of a single bidder. Methodology/results : Effective bidding in PAB auctions is complex due to the combinatorial nature of the action space. We show that a utility decoupling trick enables a polynomial time algorithm to solve the offline problem where competing bids are known in advance. Leveraging this structure, we design efficient algorithms for the online problem under both full information and bandit feedback settings that achieve an upper bound on regret of O ( M T log T ) and O ( M T 2 3 log T ) , respectively, where M is the number of units demanded by the bidder, and T is the total number of auctions. We accompany these results with a regret lower bound of Ω ( M T ) for the full information setting and Ω ( M 2 / 3 T 2 / 3 ) for the bandit setting. We also present additional findings on the characterization of PAB equilibria. Managerial implications : Although the Nash equilibria of PAB auctions possess nice properties such as winning bid uniformity and high welfare and revenue, they are not guaranteed under no-regret learning dynamics. Nevertheless, our simulations suggest that these properties hold anyways, regardless of Nash equilibrium existence. Compared with its uniform price counterpart, the PAB dynamics converge faster and achieve higher revenue, making PAB appealing whenever revenue holds significant social value—for example, ETSs and Treasury auctions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The paucity of data on governmental regulatory agencies’ product safety defect investigations has restricted our knowledge about (1) the determinants of a regulator’s decisions to open or close an investigation, (2) the process it follows between opening and closing of an investigation, and (3) the outcomes of the investigation when it is closed. Methodology/results : The authors view a safety regulator’s opening and closing of a product defect investigation as a decision of interest to the operations management discipline. This data paper describes a rich, novel, and hand-collected data set of all investigations that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration—the U.S. regulator for automobile safety—opened and closed against 187 manufacturers between 2009 and 2021. The authors provide two Microsoft Excel data files, one capturing data for the investigations opened and the other for the investigations closed. The data files enable researchers to address three sets of research questions. First, researchers can use the “Data on Investigations Opened” file to model the determinants of a regulator’s opening of a product defect investigation. Second, researchers can mine the textual variables from both files to identify the steps involved in the investigation process. They can also use the process variables included in the data to investigate the regulator’s efficiency in opening and closing investigations. Third, researchers can use the “Data on Investigations Closed” file to better understand when and why a regulator closes an investigation and the outcomes of the closed investigations. Managerial implications : The data files can also be valuable to nonacademic stakeholders (e.g., governmental organizations and regulators, journalists, liability lawyers, politicians, and safety advocates). The authors provide an open-access website that simplifies the use of the data for a nonacademic audience and allows them to draw insights from the data via graphs and tables.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the joint estimation of the consumer arrival rate and choice model parameters when “no-purchasers” (customers who considered the product but did not purchase) are not observable. Estimating this unconstrained demand even with the simplest discrete-choice model such as the multinomial logit (MNL) becomes challenging as we do not know the fraction that have chosen the outside option (i.e., not purchased). Methods have been proposed to use market share to pin down the parameter associated with the outside option. However, market share data are difficult to obtain in many situations, and in some industries, such as fashion retail, have little meaning as the items are difficult to compare. In this paper, we point out an additional difficulty that can arise in practice: Many firms monitor sales and optimize their prices and assortments within the sale period as part of their revenue management (RM) process, based on partially observed demand. This can potentially cause a revenue management induced endogeneity as the data used for estimation is the result of optimization (in turn based on prior data) to set controls. As we demonstrate, methods that work well on randomly generated assortments may do badly on optimized assortment data. Methodology/results : In this paper, we propose a robust method when the firm cannot observe no-purchases and has no market share information, and the data have been revenue-managed. We develop a two-step generalized method-of-moments (GMM) procedure that is based on a modified moment condition, and importantly, does not require instrumental variables (IVs), a significant advantage in practice. Managerial implications : In Monte Carlo simulations, the performance of our method matches existing methods when the controls are generated randomly, and is robust under all conditions, whether RM-induced endogeneity is present or not. On a large real-world data set from the fashion industry, subject to stock-outs and markdown pricing along with unknown management controls, our method provides robust estimates compared with existing methods without requiring any input on market shares, which is especially difficult to pin down at a category and season/collection level.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper examines the impact of retail store closures on omnichannel sales and consumer shopping behavior in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To explain the likelihood of store closure, we develop a novel instrumental variable motivated by varying geopolitical responses across the United States to the pandemic. Methodology/results : Using data from a luxury fashion retailer, we find that when a store is closed, the volume of online orders originating from its location increases by 24%. Furthermore, when the retailer closes 10% of its stores, the omnichannel total sales (offline + online) decrease by 5.5%. Notably, our findings indicate that the online channel enables the retailer to recover 11% of offline sales that would have otherwise been lost because of store closures. We also show that compared with existing e-shoppers, new e-shoppers are more likely to order popular product models in an effort to mitigate the heightened mismatch risk associated with online transactions. For new e-shoppers, the likelihood of ordering a popular model stands at 70%, whereas it is 45% for existing online consumers. Additionally, the conservative behavior of favoring popular models reduces the likelihood of returns by new e-shoppers. Managerial implications : Even for luxury apparel, which is often associated with in-store purchases requiring “touch and feel” and customer tryout, the option to purchase online proves immensely valuable. The tendency of new e-shoppers to limit product mismatch risk by choosing popular products may create an opportunity for retailers to strategically target these inexperienced online customers with advertisements, product promotions, or virtual fitting rooms, all geared toward reducing online shopping risk of product mismatch.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The improper disposal of electronic and electrical goods at the end of their useful lives (i.e., e-waste) can have adverse effects on the environment and human health. The increased awareness of the negative consequences of e-waste has prompted many regulators to enact recycling standards that promote the proper disposal and recycling of e-waste. A large body of research has used analytical models to explore how recycling standards affect firms that make electronic and electrical goods. A key insight from this research is that e-waste recycling standards would induce firms to design products that have reduced environmental impact and are easier to recycle. In other words, e-waste recycling standards would enhance inventive activity at firms to better comply with regulatory requirements. But hardly any empirical work has validated the insights developed with analytical models. Methodology/results : We empirically examine whether California’s Electronic Waste Recycling Act (EWRA) affects the inventive output (i.e., measured as patents) of firms that manufacture electronic and electrical goods. We leverage a quasi-experimental setup that arises when California enacted the EWRA and use multiple identification strategies to isolate the law’s effect on the inventive output of firms. We disentangle two causal pathways, industry and headquarter location , by which EWRA affects manufacturers. We find that EWRA increased the environmentally focused inventive output (i.e., “green” patents) of affected firms in California by nearly 14% and by nearly 8% for firms in other states. Interestingly, we also observe spillover effects—EWRA increased other inventive output (i.e., patents other than green patents) of affected firms in California by nearly 41% and by nearly 24% for firms in other states. Managerial implications : Our study provides important insights for managers and policy makers by empirically quantifying the impact of recycling standards on environmentally focused inventions and by identifying spillover effects for other inventions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To investigate the interplay between servicizing and remanufacturing, two widely used strategies in the circular economy, and its impact on firms’ economic and environmental performance, we consider a profit-maximizing manufacturer who explores the possibility of jointly adopting the two strategies. Methodology and results : We develop optimization models that capture the main attributes for servicizing (pay-per-use, demand pooling) and remanufacturing (lower production costs, higher operating costs). We show that the presence of remanufacturing always makes servicizing less attractive to adopt, and having servicizing may discourage the adoption of remanufacturing if the remanufacturing cost reduction effect is not sufficiently large. The joint adoption of servicizing and remanufacturing is preferred when the remanufacturing cost is neither too high nor too low and the range of the remanufacturing cost that favors the joint adoption is further moderated by the firm’s pooling level and the operating cost of remanufactured products. Lastly, we find that when the firm adopts servicizing in the presence of remanufacturing with relatively high remanufacturing costs, it can reduce the number of remanufactured products with low environmental impact in the market and, thus, harm the environment, resulting in a misalignment between economic and environmental goals. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that managers considering jointly adopting servicizing and remanufacturing must balance their competition on the low-usage end of the market with the potential complementarity due to remanufacturing cost reduction. Further, by showing the win-win conditions under which the joint adoption of servicizing and remanufacturing improves firms’ economic and environmental performance, we demonstrate that there are no one-size-fits-all circular economy strategies and call for caution when promoting these strategies across industries.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A growing number of firms are encouraging consumers to participate in “bring-your-own-container” (BYOC) behavior in which consumers bring their own reusable packaging to purchase and consume products, thus reducing single-use packaging waste. In this paper, we study the environmental implications of a firm’s BYOC implementation when considering its disposable packaging choice and communication strategy. Methodology/results : We build a stylized model to study a firm’s joint decisions on BYOC, disposable packaging choice, and communication and their implications on the environment. Our main results follow. First, allowing BYOC reduces the firm’s incentive to make fraudulent green claims about its disposable product packaging; however, BYOC implementation may harm the overall environment while improving the firm’s profit, thereby creating a new form of greenwashing. Second, the adoption of third-party certification for green disposable packaging is an effective remedy to mitigate the negative environmental impact of BYOC. In addition, the environmental implications of adopting third-party certification (either voluntarily or because of government mandates) depend on the relationship between the environmental qualities of green disposable packaging and reusable packaging. Whereas it always benefits the environment when the firm’s green disposable packaging has better environmental performance, adopting certification may negatively impact the environment if consumers’ reusable packaging is greener. Furthermore, we find numerically that offering a price discount for BYOC may encourage the firm to adopt certification because of increased profitability, thereby leading to the aforementioned environmental implications. Managerial implications : We offer operational insights on how firms should make joint decisions on BYOC, disposable packaging choice, and communication. We also generate insights on how governments should regulate firms’ green claims when firms start to allow BYOC.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This work aims to examine the role of emergency department (ED) operational status related to congestion in fast-track (FT) routing decisions and the subsequent effects on patient outcomes. Methodology/results : In this paper, we utilize a two-year data set from two hospital EDs in Alberta, Canada, and adopt an instrumental variable approach to examine the effects of FT routing decisions on patient outcomes. Based on the empirical findings, we utilize a data-calibrated simulation to compare the performance of different routing policies. First, our study reveals that FT routing decisions are not purely clinically driven, and ED operational status is also associated with FT routing decisions. Second, being routed to FT can improve ED efficiency by reducing the average length of stay and left without being seen rates. However, this efficiency improvement comes at the cost of potential quality decline. In particular, being routed to the FT leads to an 8.2% increase in the 48-hour revisit rate for the high-complexity group and a 2.3% increase for the medium-complexity group. Third, we delve into the mechanisms behind observed patient outcomes and find that physicians in the FT area may prioritize expediting patient flow by simplifying patient diagnosis and treatment procedures. Consequently, the quality of care may be compromised for high- and medium-complexity patients. Finally, our simulation findings highlight the importance of selecting the “right” patients to be routed to the FT unit. To this end, the complexity-based classification method and dynamic routing policies emerge as promising avenues. Managerial implications : Our findings call for immediate attention from healthcare practitioners to carefully balance the trade-off between emergency care efficiency and quality, emphasizing the necessity of selecting the right patients for routing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies a multichannel healthcare system where physicians diagnose patients and prescribe treatment in-person or through asynchronous telemedicine (AT), a widely adopted yet relatively under-explored form of telemedicine. In collaboration with physicians at the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA), we examine the impact of introducing an AT channel on the existing in-person channel and on overall system performance. Methodology/results : VHA implemented AT at select clinics in the state of Georgia in 2012. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the introduction of the AT channel led to a sorting process whereby more complex patients were seen in the in-person channel. AT implementation led to a 20% increase in recommended visit time and an 8.5% increase in required clinical resources for in-person consultations. In addition, the adoption of AT resulted in higher throughput—more patients seen by the specialists per month across both channels. Using a fixed-effects model we find a reduction in average wait time for in-person referrals (37.5%), and for the most common medically necessary procedure (43%) despite an increase in the total number of consultations at the specialist clinic. We attribute the improved efficiency to early patient triage, better match between patient needs and treatment modality, and reduction of setup and switching costs in physicians’ workflow. Managerial implications : This paper contributes to our understanding of a rapidly expanding form of healthcare delivery: multichannel healthcare with in-person and AT channels. Our results suggest that healthcare managers and physicians can adopt AT to improve overall system efficiency. At the same time, they should take into account the additional impact of AT on the in-person channel when making capacity decisions and developing guidance on patient referrals.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In response to the increased use of telehealth to replace traditional office visits with a physician, several U.S. states have recently adopted telehealth pay-parity policies. Such policies state that payers must reimburse healthcare providers for telehealth services at the same rate that would apply if those services had been provided in a traditional office setting. But health policy researchers have pointed out that telehealth may not be as effective as a traditional office visit for acute care. Specifically, telehealth is associated with increased probability of a subsequent office visit (a “duplicate visit”). We examine whether telehealth pay-parity policies are effective at improving access to acute care, and under what conditions. Methodology/results : We use a three-stage game-theoretic model to study the impact of telehealth pay parity. In the first stage, the payer sets a reimbursement policy for telehealth visits. In the second stage, a healthcare provider commits a portion of its capacity to telehealth, and in the third stage, patients arrive and choose between telehealth and office visits according to an equilibrium queueing network. We find structural results for the equilibria and characterize the equilibria in closed-form. When the chance of a duplicate visit is moderate (neither too high nor too low), pay parity leads providers to allocate too much capacity to telehealth, resulting in lower overall patient access than could be otherwise achieved. We characterize a reimbursement level that avoids this misalignment and maximizes patient access, which we show is less than parity. Managerial implications : The literature shows that patients receiving acute care via telehealth may be more likely to require a duplicate, in-person visit to resolve their health concern. In the fee-for-service environment that is common in the United States for acute care, duplicate visits resulting from telehealth lead to an incentive alignment problem because they generate extra work and provider revenue, without any corresponding increase in patient access. Legislating pay parity for telehealth can lead to providers committing more capacity to telehealth, which may not always be good. However, there is good news in that all parties (payers, providers, and patients) would be better off if duplicate visits could be decreased. Policy makers should understand these implications before enacting policies that affect reimbursements for telehealth.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Coordinated care network (CCN) is a burgeoning paradigm where patients’ diagnosis and treatment plans are developed based on collaboration between multiple, colocated medical specialties to holistically address patients’ health needs. A primary performance metric for CCNs is how quickly patients can complete their itinerary of appointments at multiple medical services in the network. Rapid completion is critical to care delivery but also presents a major operational challenge. Because information about a patient’s condition and treatment options evolves over the course of the itinerary, care paths are not known a priori. Thus, appointments (except for the first one) cannot be reserved in advance, which may result in significant delays if capacity is not allocated properly. Methodology/results : We study capacity allocation for the patient’s first (root) appointment as the primary operational lever to achieve rapid itinerary completion in CCNs. We develop a novel queueing-based analytical framework to optimize this root appointment allocation, maximizing the proportion of patients completing care by prespecified deadlines. Our framework accounts for the complex interactions among all patients in the network through the blocking process, which contrasts with conventional siloed planning. We provide an exact characterization of the itinerary time and develop a mean-field approximation with convergence guarantees that permits tractable solutions for large-scale network problems. In a simulation case study of Mayo Clinic, our solution improves on-time completion from 60% under the current plan to more than 93%. Managerial implications : We demonstrate that root appointment allocation is a multifaceted problem and that ignoring any of those facets can lead to poor performance. Simultaneously accounting for all of these complexities makes manual template design or traditional optimization methods inadequate, highlighting the significance of our integrated approach.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The clean energy transition is an important component of the net zero transformation, which aims at averting potentially disastrous climate change related to excessive global warming by practically eliminating new global greenhouse gas emissions within 2050. The resulting move toward decarbonized energy systems is projected to encompass massive investments in assets that employ technologies with low environmental impact, some of which are innovative or yet unproven or even undeveloped, an area known as CleanTech. The typical analyses that are informing the dialogue on this process in practice provide insights into decarbonization paths at the technology level. In contrast, managers need to make decisions about assets. Methodology/results : Taking an asset-level view of the clean energy transition that complements its technology outlook, this essay provides a concise entry point into this topic based on both the practitioner literature and personal reflections, highlighting CleanTech innovations and related operational considerations in carbon capture, use, and storage; sustainable fuels; hydrogen; electricity; and concomitant government support activities. Managerial implications : Further, this work advocates for potential CleanTech research or teaching pursuits, especially ones aimed at directly supporting managerial decision making, for which it provides an example from the literature.},
