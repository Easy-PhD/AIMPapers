  abstract     = {Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.},

Although disclination states of topological crystalline insulators have been extensively explored in wave systems, i.e., electromagnetic and acoustic wave systems, their experimental realizations in the diffusion process, particularly thermal diffusion, have remained underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we theoretically model and experimentally measure topologically protected disclination states in C 4 , C 5 , and C 7 -symmetric thermal crystalline lattices composed of aluminum disks. The temperature evolution is tied to an effective Hamiltonian hosting topological disclination modes, which have a diffusion rate that is robust against defects. Our findings extend topological disclination phases and the physics of fractional charges from Hermitian to anti-Hermitian systems, opening new avenues for future research in thermal information processing and temperature management processes that are robust against disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) has recently celebrated 30 years of existence when counting from the original patent of 1994. In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.},

Usually, the fluorescence of CQDs is quenched when they aggregate, limiting further exploration of their application. In recent years, research on CQDs with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features has shown promise in addressing the issue of poor luminescence efficiency upon aggregation, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Here, inter-dots/molecular excitonic and intra-dots/molecular electron-vibration couplings are employed to potentially explore the mechanism of aggregation-caused quenching and AIE of CQDs. In addition, the CQDs with AIE feature are classified into two categories, the CQDs possessing intrinsic AIE properties (AIE-CQDs) and the exogenous CQDs (endowed-AIE-CQDs). The detailed research progress on both types is also summarized. Furthermore, the documented applications of AIE-CQDs and endowed-AIE-CQDs in biomedical imaging, chemical analysis, and solid-state lighting are summarized based on their enhanced fluorescence and redshifted emission wavelengths upon aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Optical microscopy constitutes an essential cornerstone in the life sciences, facilitating detailed investigations into the structural and dynamic complexities of biological systems. Nonetheless, classical optical microscopy encounters significant challenges in probing the intricate complexities of cellular and molecular systems, particularly due to the diffraction limit of light and limitations posed by detection noise. Although significant advances in optical microscopy have realized super-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratios, and high-speed imaging, these methods frequently require high-intensity illumination, potentially inducing photodamage and photobleaching in biological samples. Quantum-twinned photons, characterized by their unique properties of quantum entanglement, quantum correlation, and quantum interference at the single photon level, present transformative solutions to these limitations. Several imaging modalities have been developed that utilize quantum-twinned photons, encompassing quantum correlation imaging, quantum entanglement imaging, and quantum interference imaging. These techniques exhibit quantum-enhanced imaging capabilities that markedly outperform classical methods, with diverse applications in cellular, tissue, and organism imaging. Centered on this theme, here we present a comprehensive review of quantum biological imaging leveraging the three pivotal quantum properties of quantum-twinned photons. The review encompasses the physical principles underlying these methods, recent experimental advancements, and an exploration of future prospects and challenges in the practical implementation of quantum bio-imaging.},

Although they are currently playing crucial roles in applications such as mobile communication, space-to-ground communication, and the Internet of Thing, there are significantly stringent and challenging requirements demanded for their rapid and successful applications. Compared with conventionally adopted low-temperature co-fired ceramics, integrated passive device filters, and dielectric filters, acoustic wave filters have been regarded as the competitive choice, mainly attributed to their wide bandwidth, small size, and low insertion loss. This paper reviews the advances and outlines future perspectives of high frequency acoustic wave devices for RF communication, focusing on several critical issues including bandwidth, roll-off, frequency, power-handling, insertion loss, out-of-band rejection, tunability, and size/package. It is focused mainly on the extreme performance breakthroughs of RF acoustic wave filter, e.g., how to achieve acoustic devices with operating frequency above 8 GHz, bandwidth around 1 GHz, and quality factor exceeding 2000. Various principles, strategies, and technologies for achieving the superior performance of super-high frequency RF filters are discussed, e.g., applying advanced materials such as scandium-doped AlN or single crystals of AlN and LiNbO 3 , creating new topology structures such as hybrid filters, and generating new types of vibration modes of acoustic waves.},

  abstract     = {Succinonitrile (SN)-based composite polymer electrolytes offer high ionic conductivity and flexibility for solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs); however, they suffer from cyano group-induced interfacial side reactions and PVDF's crystallinity-driven performance limitations. Herein, we introduce semiconductor waste-derived LiGaO 2 (LGO) as a multifunctional additive to address these challenges. LGO's high-dielectric constant modulates PVDF-HFP crystallization into disordered amorphous domains, reducing interfacial resistance and enhancing exchange current density. Simultaneously, LGO promotes LiTFSI dissociation via dipole interactions while anchoring SN molecules, suppressing migration and side reactions. The optimized electrolyte achieves an ionic conductivity of 1.24 × 10 −3 S·cm −1 , a transference number of 0.67, an activation energy of 0.13 eV, and a critical current density of 0.8 mA·cm −2 at 45 °C. Symmetric Li cells show stable cycling, while LiCoO 2 /Li batteries exhibit superior rate performance (111.8 mAh·g −1 at 2 C) and retain 61.4% capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5 C with 99.2% average Coulombic efficiency.

  abstract     = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a quantum phenomenon arising from the breaking of chiral symmetry in relativistic Weyl fermions due to quantum fluctuations under parallel electric ( E ) and magnetic fields ( B ). Intuitively, Weyl fermions with opposite chirality, under the stimulus of parallel E and B , will have different chemical potentials that give rise to an extra current, whose role is like a chiral battery in solids. However, up until now, the experimental evidence for the chiral magnetic effect is the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , rather than a chiral electric source. Here, different from previous reports, we observed a giant chiral magnetic effect evidenced by “negative” resistance and corresponding voltage–current curves located in the second-fourth quadrant in the type-II Weyl semimetal WP 2+δ . These phenomena occur under the following conditions: the misalignment angle between B and E is smaller than 20°, the temperature is below 40 K, the externally applied electrical current is less than 50 mA, and the magnetic field is larger than 3 T. Phenomenologically, based on the macroscopic Chern–Simons–Maxwell equation, this giant chiral magnetic effect observed in WP 2+δ is attributed to the chirality of Weyl fermions possessing a two-order longer coherent time than the Drude transport relaxation time. Our findings provide evidence of the giant chiral-magnetic/chiral-battery effect in Weyl semimetals.},

  abstract     = {The realization of multiple electronic states on ultrafast sub-picosecond timescales can be leveraged to develop energy-efficient terahertz (THz) photonic devices. Such explorations are pursued in the framework of femtosecond optical excitation with THz probes wherein either negative or positive photoconductivity manifests in metallic and insulating states, respectively. Co-existence of both states is highly desired but rarely observed. Here, a strategy is devised exploiting crystalline transport anisotropy and hetero-epitaxy in a multi-band nickelate to demonstrate switching of the positive to the negative sign of photoconductivity on a sub-picosecond timescale. This combines with a profound anisotropy of THz photoconductivity in unconventional (111) epitaxial films having preferential arrangement of oxygen vacancies along selective crystal axes—a framework that reversibly modulates the anisotropy of negative THz photoconductivity using oxygen content as a control parameter, and corroborated by theoretical calculations. Thus, ultrafast switching between negative, positive, and zero photoconductive states in timescales of a few picoseconds at room temperature, as demonstrated in this study, holds a remarkable prospect for creating multiple channels of information processing. A proof-of-concept experiment to utilize these photo-controlled states is proposed for a three-state THz communication system, which would transmit a larger volume of information vis-a-vis that of a binary communication system.},

Using three nonlinear optical cationic chromophores with different interionic assembly types, each combined with three molecular anions featuring different substituents (non-polar methyl or polar chloro and bromo groups), we investigated nine ionic crystals, including four reported here for the first time. The crystal members within each isomorphic crystal family show nearly identical crystal structures (i.e., isomorphic crystal structures), all of them achieving top-level macroscopic second-order optical nonlinearity and efficient ultrabroad THz wave generation capabilities. Remarkably, their physical (and terahertz) properties within each isomorphic crystal family differ dramatically according to a certain order of the introduced anions, and this ordering trend persists across all three isomorphic crystal families. These results provide a crucial advancement in the design and prediction of macroscopic properties in ionic organic THz and nonlinear optical crystals, marking an important step toward rational crystal design exhibiting enhanced physical properties.},

  abstract     = {Non-Fourier thermal transports have drawn significant attention for decades. Among them, the frequency-dependent thermal conductivity has been extensively explored by pump-probe techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance, which is employed to probe the spectra of phonon mean free paths. However, previous studies on silicon have not exhibited apparent frequency dependence despite its broad phonon distribution. Here, we report the frequency-dependent thermal transport in Al/Si with an atomically sharp interface, where the matched Debye temperatures preserve the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons in Si and contribute as additional non-equilibrium thermal resistance. The dependence vanishes in Al/SiO 2 /Si at room temperature, since the SiO 2 interlayer facilitates phonon scattering and destroys thermal non-equilibrium. At 80 K, frequency dependence reemerges in Al/SiO 2 /Si due to reduced interfacial phonon scattering, which is not sufficient to destroy the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons. The frequency dependence is weakened in the Al/Si sample at 500 K, originating from the enhanced phonon scattering rate in Si. Our findings highlight the significance of boundary conditions in frequency-dependent thermal conductivity.},

The SMES integrates a force–magnetic coupling layer with an electromagnetic induction layer, enabling it to detect vertical forces at 25 points and tangential forces in 12 directions using only 4 coils, showing its tactile hyperacuity.

Additionally, a customized machine learning model achieves 96.01% accuracy in detecting 37 force directions, even under varying compression conditions. Combined with a real-time sensing system, its application potential for robotic tactile sensing and human–computer interfaces has been highlighted, showcasing its application versatility.

By exploiting the different spectral response of these detectors, transmitted data of different wavelengths can be effectively distinguished, making them promising candidates for wavelength division multiplexing to enhance optical communication transmission rates. Herein, we present a facile dual-wavelength demultiplexing strategy based on ZnO/PbSe wide-/narrow-bandgap heterojunction to achieve ultraviolet (UV)-infrared (IR) broadband detection by utilizing the photosensitive/dielectric properties of ZnO along with unique band alignment. The detector demonstrates a continuous photocurrent response in the UV region, while producing transient pulsed photocurrent in the IR region. It is first time reporting response wavelength extension of transient photodetectors from near-infrared (NIR) to mid-infrared (MIR). Additionally, the response bandwidth reaches 2 kHz in the UV and 0.7 MHz in the IR bands. The UV/IR dual-wavelength optical communication tests show the coexistence of transient pulsed and continuous photocurrents. By incorporating different filter modules at the output terminals, the transmitted data at both wavelengths can be extracted simultaneously. This study offers a facile and practical approach for broadband photodetection and wavelength demultiplexing, while also providing a novel route for extending the application of wide-bandgap semiconductors to IR optoelectronic devices.},

This limitation hinders the application development of the self-powered optoelectronic synaptic devices in neuromorphic computing. In this work, a self-powered optoelectronic synaptic device based on the tin dioxide and cesium silver bismuth bromide heterojunction is developed. Through utilizing the ion migration and photo-generated carrier transport behaviors in the heterojunction, self-powered optically inhibitory and excitatory synaptic behaviors are successfully mimicked under ultraviolet (365 nm) monochromatic all-optical modulation. On this basis, a convolutional neural network has been constructed with the software-based means to recognize images (the absence of real hardware-level image processing) in fashion MNIST dataset and an accuracy of 84.48% is obtained in this network, indicating broad application prospects of the all-optical self-powered systems in the neuromorphic computing.},

The spin transport across the interfaces is affected not only by the Brillouin zone (BZ) filtering but also by the interfacial bonds. This work focuses on studying the 2H Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS 2 ) van der Waals layers as the tunnel barrier, and Cobalt (Co) as the electrode. The TMR varies with different adsorption interfaces, yet none have achieved the desired levels because the momentum-resolved transmissions of Co and MoS 2 in the folded horizontal BZ do not match well, resulting in inefficient spin filtering and thereby a low TMR. The effects of interfacial bonds on spin transport and magnetic anisotropy are studied. The orientations of bonds determine the anisotropy of the interfacial Co. Vertical bonds stabilize the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), while non-vertical bonds cause in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). The layers below exhibit PMA, so both types of MTJs overall support PMA, while the physisorbed MTJ is stronger. The positive relation between the transmission and the electron density near the Fermi level is weakened by the bonds, as the scattering centers hold back the spin injection. Our work further strengthens the importance of BZ filtering in governing TMR and the design principle of MTJ, as well as how bonds affect the overall device performance.},

Yet on-chip electronic detection and tuning of multimode resonances in these 2D VCT resonators have been challenging due to the ultrasmall vibration amplitudes and rich multimode dynamics at radio frequencies (RF). Here, we leverage the atomic-scale thickness, ultrahigh strain limit, as well as strain-engineering effects on band structure and carrier mobility of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) sheets, and experimentally demonstrate multimode 2D MoS 2 VCT resonators. Using all-electronic signal transduction, we show single-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS 2 VCT resonators with up to the 14th resonance mode, thanks to the ultra-efficient electromechanical transduction enabled by internal multiphysics coupling. Measured gate dependency of multimode resonances exhibits frequency tuning ranges of Δ f / f 0 up to 326%. These 2D VCT resonators provide a unique platform for engineering on-chip integrated and ultra-scaled RF signal transduction, sensing, and analog computing elements with multimode and hyperspectral capabilities.},

This process does not require population inversion, unlike conventional photonic lasers. II-VI/III-V colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known for their narrow emission linewidth and tunable emission wavelength, find broad applications in displays, LEDs, and detectors. However, achieving exciton-polariton lasing with these materials remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the exciton binding energy variations in CdSe colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) with different thicknesses and demonstrate the integration of CQWs in a face-down aligned configuration within a Fabry–Pérot cavity. This alignment enhances the exciton-photon coupling, leading to increased Rabi splitting energy and stronger coupling compared to randomly oriented CQWs, thereby facilitate exciton-polariton condensation. Due to the enhanced coupling with cavity fields and large exciton binding energy, we report the first observation of room-temperature exciton-polariton BEC and exciton-polariton lasing from CdSe CQWs. By systematically tuning the exciton-photon detuning, we achieve wavelength-tunable polariton lasing from 530 nm to 549 nm, including spectral regions without conventional optical gain, extending lasing beyond the intrinsic emission of 4 ML CQWs. These findings establish CdSe CQWs as effective platform for polariton-based optoelectronics.},

As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications in diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics, thermodynamics, to materials science. It has long been thought that the Maxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is valid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal or spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we break this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength limit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry–Pérot resonance. We discover that under the Fabry–Pérot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time crystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab simultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of these light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time crystals.},

Here, we circumvent this ambiguity through strategically designed aliovalent-alloying semiconductors (e.g., TiFe 0.5+ x Ni 0.5- x Sb, −0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.25), where the compositional deviations from x = 0 amplify EPIs while weakening PDPS. Experimentally, we observed a pronounced EPI-driven κ L reduction of ∼50% at room temperature and ∼40% even at 1000 K as carrier concentration approaches 1 × 10 22 cm −3 . The carrier-induced phonon softening and the enhanced electron-phonon scattering rates collectively lead to this remarkable phonon transport attenuation. Our findings establish a quantitative framework for disentangling EPI effects on phonon transport in heavily doped semiconductors or metals, and provide insights into phonon engineering strategies for advanced thermal management materials design.},

Traditional LSFM utilizes Gaussian illumination with a limited system field of view (FOV) due to the short Rayleigh range. As one kind of the propagation-invariant light field, the Airy beam can inherently extend the FOV and enhance the axial resolution for microscopy. However, implementing an Airy-LSFM requires a complex illumination system. Here, we demonstrate that the Airy light-sheet is conveniently integrated into LSFM using a polarization-independent, Airy metasurface to achieve compact illumination, large system FOV, and high image quality. To verify the performance of the metasurface-based Airy LSFM (meta-Airy LSFM), ex vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) embryos was conducted. The Richardson–Lucy deconvolution technique was applied to further improve the image quality. The experimental results show that the axial and lateral resolution of the meta-Airy LSFM is 2.3 and 0.69 μ m, respectively, while the FOV is significantly improved tenfold, up to 200 μ m. The tightly packed integration of the Airy light-sheet metasurface in LSFM enables wide-ranging biological applications and has great potential to be easily adapted across various LSFM modalities.},

  abstract     = {Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halides have gained significant attention as downconversion phosphors in solid-state lighting and x-ray imaging due to their unique optical properties. However, achieving efficient luminescence under blue light excitation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a novel zero-dimensional hybrid copper iodide [Li(H 2 O)(Benzo-15-crown-5) 2 ] 2 Cu 4 I 6 (abbreviated as [LB] 2 Cu 4 I 6 ), as a highly efficient and blue-light-excitable emitter with potential in lighting and x-ray imaging applications. This compound exhibits an ultrabroad excitation band spanning from 250 to 500 nm, upon blue light, ultraviolet, or x-ray excitation, delivers strong broadband yellow emission centered at 541 nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 92.1%. Benefiting from their strong photoexcitation under blue light, high PLQY, and good environmental stability, a high-performance white light-emitting diode was developed, achieving a commercial-level luminous efficiency of 101.6 lm W −1 , a high color rendering index of 87, and a record half-lifetime of 2352 h. Additionally, [LB] 2 Cu 4 I 6 demonstrates outstanding x-ray scintillation properties with a high light yield of 83 904 photons MeV −1 , a low detection limit of 72.3 nGy s −1 , and a competitive spatial resolution of 10.3 lp mm −1 for x-ray imaging. This work provides a new avenue for exploring highly efficient and blue-light-excitable luminescent metal halides toward multifunctional applications.},

However, their Curie temperatures remain far below room temperature and/or the ferroelectric polarization is nearly vanishing. Here, an inequivalent charge strategy is reported that simultaneously enhances the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering in Bi 2 FeMnO 6 double perovskite thin films, effectively exploiting the tunability of chemical strain and valence. Abnormal lattice distortion and differential charge compensation ensure robust ferroelectricity (16.6–29.2 μ C/cm 2 ) and approximately sevenfold enhancement from 8.3 to 60 emu/cm 3 in ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures of both ferroic orderings exceeding 800 K, which is the best high-temperature metrics for existing multiferroic systems. Since ferroelectricity originates from Bi ions and octahedral distortions, this effectively avoids small polarization and weak A–B site coupling. This mechanism is expected to reignite interest in type I multiferroics and prompt a reexamination of current schemes for overcoming the incompatibility of the multiple ferroic orderings. Our work provides an important technological path and experimental insight for the development of room-temperature multiferroics by leveraging the tunability of double perovskites.},

Electronic band structure calculations reveal an indirect bandgap of 4.15 eV. The magnetic exchange interaction tensor was calculated by DFT-based four-state energy mapping on Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and was subsequently employed in Monte Carlo simulations, revealing distinctly novel spin configurations across the heterostructure, transitioning from spin-spiral and vortex states in the absence of a magnetic field, to skyrmion and anti-skyrmion phases with an external magnetic field applied.},

While manipulation techniques such as strain (via substrates), electric fields, and temperature are commonly employed, switching induced by charged defects between different polar topological structures remains a rarely observed phenomenon. In this study, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies can effectively enable the switching between flux-closure and center-type topological structures in PbTiO 3 (PTO) nano-island arrays. Supported by evidence from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, and piezoresponse force microscopy, we demonstrate that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies favors the formation of center-type domains, while the topological structure transitions to the flux-closure configuration following elimination of oxygen vacancies via in situ annealing under various gas atmospheres. This deterministic switching between the two polar topological structures highlights the critical role of charged defects and opens new avenues for the manipulation of polar topological structures in future applications.},

  abstract     = {Heterojunctions are indispensable for fabricating high-performance organic photodetectors. However, traditional structures—such as planar heterojunctions (PHJs) and bulk heterojunctions (BHJs)—face significant challenges. PHJs often suffer from limited exciton dissociation in thick films, while BHJs experience considerable charge transport barriers. Although quasi-planar heterojunctions have been proposed to address these issues, controlling their nanoscale interface remains complex and material-dependent, limiting their applications. Herein, we introduce novel interpenetrated heterojunctions (IPHJs), formed by penetrating a secondary organic semiconductor layer into a porous bottom layer during annealing. This innovative structure is revealed to possess efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Remarkably, organic photodiodes (OPDs) featuring PM6:N2200 IPHJs demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a responsivity (R) of 36.5 A/W, a specific detectivity (D * ) of 8.6 × 10 12 Jones, and a response time (τ) of 30 μ s, representing state-of-the-art performance for OPDs. Furthermore, extending the IPHJ concept to tri-layer interpenetrated heterojunctions (T-IPHJs) shows significant promise for organic phototransistor applications. The PM6:N2200 T-IPHJ devices exhibit a responsivity exceeding 44.7 A/W, a D * value reaching 5.23 × 10 14 Jones, and a τ of 70 ms. These results show the potential of IPHJs to advance the field of high-performance organic photodetectors and related devices.},

Due to its larger bandgap and higher optical damage threshold, LT can be employed for efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. Here, we report on fabrication of monolithic, high-quality LT metasurfaces, composed of periodic arrays of LT truncated square pyramids, created by partially etching of a LT thin film layer using a focused ion beam milling process. These pyramidal structures introduce discrete translational symmetry, which allows for the folding of guided-mode dispersion into the first Brillouin zone, leading to the formation of guided mode resonances with Q-factors that can be easily controlled by the height of LT pyramids. The measurements show a Q-factor up to approximately 640 at 786 nm. By leveraging the strong field localization of these high-Q resonances, we demonstrate enhanced second-harmonic generation at 393 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 0.042%, establishing a new benchmark for the UV harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces. Moreover, our fabrication technique can be readily adapted to a wide range of other material platforms, opening new avenues for the development of high-quality UV metasurfaces and advanced nonlinear photonic meta-devices.},

However, the stochastic nature of resistive switching (RS) in memristors often leads to poor device stability and uniformity, hindering the scalability required for real-world applications. Here, we present a novel phase segregation strategy to achieve uniformly distributed self-assembled Ni nanofilaments within a BaTiO 3 matrix, enabling local deterministic redox reactions for RS, as confirmed by comprehensive structural, local, and macroscopic RS studies. This approach yields drastic enhancement in cyclic performance and device uniformity, with the average cyclic variances of Set voltage and low resistance state down to 1.4% and 9.6%, respectively. The devices also exhibit excellent endurance (10 9 cycles) and ultrafast programming speed (down to 100 ns) and achieve over 5-bit level long-term memory states. The enhanced cyclic stability and device uniformity translate to high training and learning accuracies (95%) in a three-level deep neural network, with 1-bit inputs. Our phase segregation strategy provides a generic pathway to overcome the long-standing challenge of device variability in neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the Indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage ( ⁠ V < ℏ ω / e = 2.0 V ⁠ ) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.},

The combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopic experiments and first-principles calculations shed light on the temperature-dependent behavior of Fe3 d –Ge4 p orbital hybridization and corroborate its significant impact on the magnetic properties of FeGe.

While Ga 2 O 3 exhibits promising material characteristics for applications in harsh environments, its commercial viability remains under debate, particularly when compared to materials such as aluminum nitride (AlN) and diamond, which possess superior intrinsic properties. This perspective addresses the critical challenges that currently impede the widespread commercialization of Ga 2 O 3 -based devices. These challenges include a relatively immature technology base, the difficulty in achieving stable p-type conductivity, inherently low thermal conductivity, the presence of crystallographic defects (nano- and micro-voids), and elevated fabrication costs, all of which negatively impact device reliability and scalability. Mitigation strategies, such as heterojunction implementation, the development of thermal management solutions such as wafer bonding, and defect passivation approaches, are also under investigation. The near-term feasibility of commercially viable Ga 2 O 3 -based power electronic devices is a central focus of this discussion. The current status is that Ga 2 O 3 development is far advanced relative to either diamond or especially AlN power electronics but is hampered by lack of a broad base of substrate vendors and a compelling vision for device implementations that provide sufficient improvement over SiC power devices. There are strong geographic differences in device focus, with China prioritizing implementation in grid applications while the United States/Europe appear to consider Ga 2 O 3 devices more for defense and aerospace applications.},

While significant progress has been made, these methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited by the complexity of multicomponent catalysts and reaction systems. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative tools for accelerating catalyst discovery and optimization. AI-driven approaches enable high-throughput screening of materials, prediction of catalyst performance, and real-time reaction mechanisms, offering a more efficient alternative to conventional experimentation. This review examines the current state of catalyst development for green H 2 production, highlighting the role of AI in optimizing hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER).

However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for 100+ qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits shielding from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation—multilayer shielding design, materials, fridge line filtration, cryogenic setup configurations, and shielding efficiency evaluation methods developed over the last 10 years.

This review examines recent developments in microstructured optical coatings designed based on geometric optics principles, highlighting their role in two key areas: energy harvesting and energy saving. In the first category, microstructured surfaces enhance photovoltaic performance through improved sunlight steering and capture. In the second category, they enable passive radiative cooling by efficiently emitting heat as thermal radiation while transmitting or reflecting solar radiation. Compared to nanostructured coatings, microstructured designs offer distinct advantages for large-area applications, including compatibility with scalable fabrication techniques and precise, angle-selective optical control. The review covers both horizontal (roof- or ground-mounted) and vertical (building-integrated) configurations, underscoring how each configuration demands specialized microstructural strategies to address different incident sunlight conditions and thermal management challenges. Through a detailed survey of state-of-the-art designs and materials, this review highlights the potential of microstructured optical coatings to advance sustainable energy technologies and gives insight into their role in mitigating global energy and climate crises.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving landscape of energy storage technologies, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries maintain significant market relevance despite the prominence of lithium-ion systems. The global Ni-MH market continues to grow steadily, reflecting their continued importance in applications demanding safety, environmental compatibility, and reliability. This review provides a critical analysis of electrochemical techniques used to investigate metal hydride electrodes for Ni-MH batteries. We examine the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of hydrogen storage in intermetallic compounds, focusing on the correlation between gas-phase hydrogen interactions and electrochemical processes. The review systematically analyzes various methods including cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT and PITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For each method, we discuss theoretical foundations, practical applications, and fundamental limitations when applied to metal hydride systems. Our analysis reveals significant challenges in the direct application of methodologies originally developed for liquid-phase electrochemical systems to solid-state metal hydride electrodes. This methodological transfer without appropriate modifications has resulted in inconsistent data interpretation and discrepancies in reported parameters, particularly for hydrogen diffusion coefficients determined by different techniques. We identify common methodological errors and provide guidelines for more accurate experimental design and data analysis. The critical examination presented in this review demonstrates the necessity for researchers to carefully consider the fundamental differences between liquid-phase and solid-state electrochemical processes when selecting and applying characterization methods. Given the continued importance of Ni-MH batteries in energy infrastructure, establishing reliable characterization protocols is important for advancing the fundamental understanding and technological development of metal hydride electrode materials.},

However, these materials struggle to simultaneously meet the technical requirements of high-capacity, rapid, and reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In recent years, both theoretical predictions and experimental research have indicated that nontraditional hydrogen storage materials based on hybrid adsorption mechanisms (such as physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, Kubas-type interactions, static electric polarization, and weak chemical adsorption)—namely, MXene materials—are promising for rapid and high-capacity hydrogen storage under normal conditions.

  abstract     = {The rise of high-performance functional devices has driven significant breakthroughs in various research fields, with ultrafast laser processing offering unprecedented opportunities for advanced device fabrication. This review summarizes recent progress and future prospects for ultrafast laser in fabricating functional optical, semiconductor, and sensor devices. Central to these advances is a deeper understanding of ultrafast laser–matter interaction physics, including nonlinear optical effects, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, and laser-induced plasma dynamics. These phenomena govern carrier excitation, energy deposition, and subsequent structural modification. We further review how such interactions enable controlled refractive index changes, selective ablation, and nanoscale material structuring in photosensitive, dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic substrates. Key applications are then reviewed, including ultrafast laser fabrication of optical devices (e.g., optical waveguide devices, optical data storage elements, optical elements, and artificial compound eyes, integrated photonic devices), semiconductor devices (e.g., semiconductor light-emitting devices, photodiodes, solar cells, and photodetectors), and sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors, flexible sensors, and biochemical sensors). Recent breakthroughs showcase ultrafast laser-induced precision in device miniaturization, improved optoelectronic characteristics, and integration of complex functions (e.g., topological photonic circuits fabricated via sub-100-nm laser writing, 5D optical data storage in glass with > 1 TB/cm 3 density, perovskite solar cells achieving 25.7% efficiency through laser-induced phase engineering, alongside plasmonic biosensors with 100× sensitivity enhancement, and stretchable graphene sensors for wearables). Finally, this review discusses core challenges, such as enhancing the scalability of ultrafast laser processes for industrial-scale production and optimizing laser-material interactions to improve device reliability and performance. Future efforts should address key challenges such as the limited scalability of ultrafast laser processing and the incomplete understanding of laser–matter interactions at ultrafast timescales. Integrating ultrafast lasers with AI-driven control, beam shaping, and advanced materials such as 2D heterostructures may enable smarter and more multifunctional device platforms. A unified theoretical framework is also needed to guide precise and efficient fabrication. These directions highlight critical opportunities for bridging current limitations and enabling transformative advances.

Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe the structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.},

Despite their widespread adoption, LiBs face challenges like performance decrease, reduced lifespan, and safety risks, all closely tied to battery degradation. This review systematically examines the factors influencing LiB degradation, dividing them into intrinsic and extrinsic categories. Intrinsic factors include material chemistry, manufacturing inconsistencies, and design limitations, while extrinsic factors cover operational conditions such as temperature, charge–discharge rates, state of charge, and depth of discharge. The degradation factors influence the degradation mechanisms, and these correlations are discussed in detail. Additionally, this study highlights mitigation strategies and tradeoffs, including advanced electrode designs, surface modifications, and optimized battery management systems. By consolidating current research, this review provides insights into overcoming the challenges associated with LiB degradation, aiming to guide future developments in achieving safer, more durable, and efficient energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Bone, cartilage, and their composites in various joints are the most important components that form the skeletal structure and enable motion and movements of the body. Their disease and/or loss are most debilitating and afflict millions of Americans, reducing productivity and deteriorating quality of life. Due to limited treatments, scientists, engineers, and clinical doctors are investigating new tissue engineering solutions. In tissue engineering approaches, scaffolds are artificially designed temporary matrices that accommodate stem/progenitor cells and provide both physical and biological signals to guide cell differentiation and 3D tissue regeneration but eventually degrade and leave behind regenerated functional tissues or organs. Therefore, scaffolds often substantially benefit from mimicking certain features of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and designing certain engineered features to facilitate cell repopulation, mass transportation, and mechanical and biological cues for cells to regenerate tissue. This review article focuses on the design, synthesis, fabrication, and functionalization of nanofibrous materials to mimic the ECM, deliver biological signals, and integrate various engineering design features such as pore shape, size, connectivity, tissue architectures, and anatomic tissue/organ shapes to guide 3D tissue regeneration. In addition to biological and physical principles of scaffold design and fabrication, we also provide several examples of specific applications of these advanced nanofibrous scaffolds for bone, cartilage, and their associated composite tissue regeneration in osteochondral defects. We also discuss the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature of these research directions, the importance of collaborations across disciplines, and the perspectives of future developments in the field.},

However, challenges such as high defect densities, small grain sizes, and unstable n-type conduction have limited their practical application. In this paper, we review the progress in the solid-phase crystallization of Ge thin films on insulating substrates. We first discuss conventional processes with excessive nucleation that lead to poor crystallinity and electrical properties. We then introduce advanced solid-phase crystallization strategies, highlighting the critical role of controlling the amorphous deposition temperature to control atomic density, increase grain size, and reduce acceptor defects. Additionally, the incorporation of tin (Sn) has been shown to passivate grain boundaries, while the modulation of film thickness and the introduction of interfacial layers have demonstrated the ability to mitigate carrier scattering at the substrate interface. This review also addresses impurity doping techniques for precise Fermi level control, strain engineering effects on grain boundary barrier energies, and metal-induced lateral crystallization for grain alignment. These innovations have culminated in achieving record-high carrier mobilities of 690 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for p-type and 450 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for n-type films, approaching single-crystal performance. The insights provided herein will pave the way for the development of high-performance Ge-based thin-film transistors and flexible electronic devices via low-temperature processing.},

  abstract     = {The field of 2D materials has grown dramatically in the past two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computing applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. To overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest, including graphene, phosphorene, MoS 2 , CrI 3 , VSe 2 , GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.},

  abstract     = {Mie scattering between incident light and nanoparticles (NPs) plays a vital role in improving the performance of optical and photonic devices, such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. While traditional far-field spectroscopy and electromagnetic simulations have been used to study Mie scattering, these methods lack real-space imaging capabilities, limiting their ability to capture single-particle scattering phenomena. Scanning probe microscopy-based nanoscopy techniques have become essential for studying Mie scattering at the nanoscale to address this limitation. This review explores the theoretical foundations of Mie scattering and the role of near-field microscopy in bridging the gap between theory and experiment through high-resolution imaging. By focusing on real-space imaging, we highlight the practical aspects of Mie scattering and its applications in fields such as biosensing, photocatalysis, and materials science. Nanoscopy techniques allow for direct visualization of scattering processes in nanostructures, offering more profound insights into how NPs interact with light at the nanoscale. Additionally, we discuss the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance near-field analysis, providing more accurate interpretations of Mie scattering phenomena. In conclusion, combining advanced nanoscopy and AI-driven analysis will significantly advance our understanding of Mie scattering and its diverse applications in various scientific and technological fields. The synergy between cutting-edge imaging methods and computational simulation not only enriches our theoretical understanding of scattering phenomena but also accelerates the development of next-generation photonic devices, paving the way for a wide range of practical applications across scientific and technological domains.},

In the magnetic measurements, this requires the use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which is a highly sensitive magnetic device for detecting changes in minute magnetic fluxes. In this review, two types of SQUID magnetometers for pressure ( P ) of up to 30 GPa are reviewed. One is a commercial SQUID magnetometer with a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) covering a wide temperature range of 1.8–400 K, and the other is a vibrating-coil SQUID magnetometer equipped with DAC, which provides more accurate measurements. The former was used for oxygen molecules, molecule-based magnets, permanent magnets, organic radial ferromagnets, and lanthanide ferromagnets, whereas the latter was applied to organic radial ferromagnets, samarium (Sm), and an iron-based superconductor. Further developments of accurate magnetization measurements at high pressures are important for condensed matter studies on magnets and superconductors.},

Such high efficiencies are currently only possible using four or more junctions to partition the broad solar spectrum into bins where each subcell efficiently collects a narrow range of photon energies. High-efficiency, wide-bandgap (1.7–2.2 eV) absorbers play a crucial role in multi-junction solar cells by efficiently converting visible photons into electrons and delivering them at high voltage. Since all subcells are interconnected in series, the widest bandgap junction produces both the highest voltage and highest power in the stack. Wide-bandgap absorbers also present the greatest materials challenges in the stack, including high aluminum content, lattice mismatch, lack of heterojunction barriers, and the sensitivity of phosphides to defects such as vacancies and oxygen. We review the history, current status, and opportunities for wide-bandgap III-V solar cells, ranging from ∼1.7 eV for the top subcell of III-V/Si hybrid tandems to >2.2 eV for the top subcell of a 6+ junction stack.

  abstract     = {Thermal-driven multi-carrier transport is essential for both scientific research and technological applications in electronic, spintronic, and energy conversion devices. This article reviews the fundamentals of phonon, electron, spin, and ion transport driven by temperature gradients in solid-state and soft condensed matter, and the microscopic interactions between energy/charge carriers that can be leveraged for manipulating electrical and thermal transport in energy conversion devices, such as electron–phonon coupling, spin–phonon interaction, and ion–solvent interactions. In coupled electron–phonon transport, we discuss the basics of electron–phonon interactions and their effects on phonon dynamics, thermalization, and nonequilibrium thermal transport. For the phonon–spin interaction, nonequilibrium transport formulation is introduced first, followed by the physics of spin thermoelectric effect and strategies to manipulate them. Contributions to thermal conductivity from magnons as heat carriers are also reviewed. For coupled transport of heat and ions/molecules, we highlight the importance of local molecular configurations that determine the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient, which is the key to improving the efficiency of low-grade heat energy conversion.},

Unlike electrostrictive and magnetostrictive effects, it does not involve complex circuits, therefore offering a promising prospect of accomplishing the advanced, compact, and remote-control devices. The key step to produce the light-induced strain of practical value is to design highly efficient photostrictive materials. Based upon the nature of the material systems to be explored for micro-optomechanical devices, the photostriction in inorganic–materials-based systems, including semiconductors, transition metal oxides, halide perovskites, and ferroelectrics in bulk and two-dimensions, are summarized herein. For each material, the feasible strategies of compositional engineering, processing conditions, and sample sculpturing, with a special focus on the meticulous tailoring of multiple phase boundaries in representative ferroelectric systems to produce significant photostriction, are given. Since ferroelectric photostriction is accounted as the superposition effect of photovoltaic and inverse piezoelectric effects, both effects are introduced and discussed. Finally, perspectives on future research of photostrictive materials are added. We believe that this review will bring new insights in producing highly efficient photostrictive materials for the commercial production of upcoming state-of-the-art micro optomechanical devices.},

While acoustic patterning has demonstrated remarkable control over microscale spatial configurations, its scalability into three-dimensional (3D) fabrication has remained constrained by challenges in bonding limitations and vertical stacking. To solve this challenge, hybrid acoustic-assisted 3D printing integrates acoustophoresis with established methods, such as direct ink writing and stereolithography, enhancing material deposition accuracy, microstructure alignment, and porous structuring of 3D printed products. However, these hybrid systems remain tethered to layer-by-layer architectures, limiting the full potential of acoustic techniques. Recent breakthroughs in standalone acoustic 3D fabrication, leveraging levitation, focusing, and ejection, have unlocked potential in contactless, layerless, and flexible multi-material assembly. Acoustic levitation systems enable mid-air construction on non-planar surfaces, and focused ultrasound techniques facilitate deep-penetration polymerization and acoustic droplet ejection advances nozzle-free droplet-based bioprinting.

  abstract     = {Accurate determination of light power and wavelength is fundamental to nearly all optical and laser applications. However, simultaneous and precise measurements of these two parameters remain a critical challenge due to intrinsic cross-sensitivity in conventional devices. Here, we propose and demonstrate a dual-parameter decoupling strategy based on photothermal whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities, enabling parallel measurements of both optical power and wavelength without cross-sensitivity. Optical absorption of the pump light by the composite microcavity produces increased temperatures that are proportional to the pump power and wavelength of the light, resulting in a wavelength shift in the WGM resonance of the microcavity. We demonstrate a record-high photothermal tuning sensitivity of ∼−4 nm/mW and an ultralow detection limit of thermal power down to 4 μ W, both of which surpass all previous schemes by more than an order of magnitude. With a linear response to the pump wavelength, the designed microcavity allows for near-infrared wavelength measurement over a broad bandwidth from 780 to 1064 nm. Importantly, by introducing the decoupling strategy that employs spectral changes of two microcavities with asymmetric responses, we demonstrate parallel measurements of both optical power and wavelength with high accuracy. As the first proof-of-principle demonstration of a single optical power–wavelength measurer using optical microcavities, our work could advance various applications relying on miniaturized and precise optical metrology devices.},

  abstract     = {Developments in communication technologies depend on the parallel progress in materials innovation, data processing devices, and their strategic integration. Terahertz (THz) science and technology is the latest field to witness phenomenal growth in 6G communication and quantum materials devices. Such advancements depend on the ability to control both the amplitude and phase-shift of THz radiation, with the latter being particularly crucial. Currently, free-space THz phase shifters exploit the intrinsic changes in carrier density, resulting in a weak response that can be amplified by metamaterial structures, but at the expense of a significantly reduced bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate a novel mechanism that leverages only the intrinsic property of magnetoelastic coupling to induce a giant THz phase modulation. An unprecedentedly large phase-shift of 3.35π radians at ∼0.9 THz occurs during the magnetoelastic phase transition between 72 and 35 K in Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 . This is accompanied by a remarkable figure-of-merit that is four to five times greater and spans a significantly broader spectral range than that of other above π/2 free-space modulators. Corroborated by theoretical calculations, we show that the spin–phonon coupling dynamics have a defining influence in altering the dielectric function that underlies these properties. These findings present the prospect of integrating magnetoelastic quantum materials in emergent THz communication tools, which rely on phase-shift modulation for information processing.},

Using rigorous first-principles calculations, we identify tetragonal tantalum nitride ( t -TaN) as a narrow bandgap semiconductor that uniquely achieves both high thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ ⁠ ) and high carrier mobility ( ⁠ μ ⁠ ). At room temperature, t -TaN demonstrates an extraordinary κ of up to 677 W m −1 K −1 , surpassing that of most widely used semiconductors. This remarkable κ arises from the synergistic effects of phonon bunching and a substantial frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which significantly suppresses phonon–phonon scattering. Even more strikingly, t -TaN exhibits exceptional hole μ exceeding 4700 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature, outperforming all known high- κ bulk semiconductors. This ultrahigh μ is attributed to its elevated Fermi velocity and weak electron–phonon coupling, stemming from its unique electronic and phononic structures. These findings position t -TaN as a compelling candidate for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications, while also offering a transformative perspective for discovering high-performance semiconductors with dual advantages.},

  abstract     = {Visual perception, memory, and adaptation processes are critical functions in biological systems that enhance responsiveness, improve survival fitness, and reduce information redundancy in complex environments. Therefore, the development of adaptive bionic vision systems with high efficiency, low complexity, and minimal energy consumption has become a key objective. However, most adaptive devices suffer from either complex structures or non-reconfigurable functionalities, hindering the further application for bionic vision systems. Here, for the first time, an asymmetry-Schottky-barrier MoS 2 phototransistor is demonstrated for reconfigurable visual system with visual selective memory and graded adaptation functions. More importantly, the device exhibits a new record with the ultra-low energy consumption of ∼90 zJ per synaptic event. Several important adaptive behaviors, such as the sensitivity, desensitization, accuracy, and self-recovery, are successfully realized and adjusted by asymmetry-Schottky-barriers. These results pave a new way toward the efficient, low-energy, and reconfigurable bionic visual systems for applications of machine vision, bionic robotics, and human-machine interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Structural superlubricity at incommensurate van der Waals interfaces leads to ultra-low friction coefficients. In this study, we try to apply a similar strategy to reduce the barrier of sliding ferroelectricity in van der Waals bilayers/multilayers with commensurate interfaces, since the writing speed in ferroelectric memories would be enhanced almost exponentially upon such reduction. A major challenge is that incommensurate interfaces are generally non-ferroelectric, and our solution is asymmetric across-layer stacking. We propose a type of superlubric sliding ferroelectricity in homobilayers separated by a hetero-layer, where the polarizations stem from symmetry breaking in across-layer commensurate stacking configurations. Meanwhile, the incommensurate interfaces of adjacent layers lead to unprecedented low switching barriers. For example, the switching barrier of 3R bilayer MoS 2 will be, respectively, reduced by around two or one order of magnitudes (0.027 and 0.167 meV/atom) if they are separated by a graphene or BN monolayer, and the required voltage for switching can be about one order of magnitude lower. Such superlubric sliding ferroelectricity widely exists in various similar sandwich trilayer systems, where symmetry breaking induced by across-layer stacking configurations may also lead to considerable polarizations. With switching barriers three–four orders of magnitude lower compared with prevalent ferroelectrics, epochal applications, such as superlubric nanogenerators and picosecond ferroelectricity, may become feasible.},

  abstract     = {Broadband self-powered photodetectors have attracted great attention owing to their capacity to detect a wide range of wavelengths and save energy. However, the majority of existing broadband photodetectors are limited in their detection range by the material bandgap, making it difficult to achieve detection from ultraviolet to infrared wavelength, and the response performance is not uniform for each waveband. Additionally, a significant disparity persists between self-powered photodetectors and conventional semiconductor photodetectors with regard to pivotal photodetection parameters, such as responsivity. To address these problems, a broadband self-powered photodetector based on two-dimensional WSe 2 /three-dimensional 4H-SiC heterojunction is proposed. The wide bandgap of 4H-SiC and the narrow bandgap of WSe 2 , in conjunction with the built-in electric field of the heterojunction and the metal/semiconductor interface, enable the device to detect light from 200 to 1100 nm and achieve a uniform high-performance response to the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths simultaneously. Under 275 nm illumination ( V ds = −1 V), the device demonstrates a responsivity and detectivity of 25.7 A/W and 3.85 × 10 12 Jones, respectively, and exhibits an ultra-fast rise/decay time of 42/42 μ s under 635 nm illumination ( V ds = −1 V). Moreover, under V ds = 0 V and 635 nm illumination, the responsivity and detectivity of the device are 1.22 A/W and 2.67 × 10 11 Jones, respectively. The device exhibits great capability in high-performance, broadband, self-powered light detection, providing a new direction for the development of next-generation energy-saving, high-sensitivity optoelectronic integration technology.},

Here, we synthesized Cs 4 PbBr 6 and Mn-doped Cs 4 PbBr 6 (Mn:Cs 4 PbBr 6 ) perovskite single crystals. Magnetization measurements reveal that Mn:Cs 4 PbBr 6 exhibits a ferromagnetic behavior at 30 K. Complementary density functional theory calculations suggest that the observed magnetism arises from the introduction of single-spin energy states by the doped Mn in the bandgap. Moreover, we observed a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect at room temperature in the Mn-doped samples. This NPC phenomenon is attributed to the absorption and desorption of oxygen molecules on the surface of Mn:Cs 4 PbBr 6 crystals.

The manufacturability of device quality β-Ga 2 O 3 epitaxial films at scale is urgently needed. Using a production-ready closed-coupled showerhead MOCVD reactor with in situ reflectance monitoring, this study presents a detailed investigation of the impact of growth parameters on the epitaxial growth of β-Ga 2 O 3 on both (010) and (001) oriented native substrates, as well as on c-plane sapphire substrates with 0°–8° off-axis orientations. By tuning the showerhead–susceptor gap and mapping the other growth parameters, including annealing, nucleation, growth temperature, reactor pressure, and substrate orientation, we achieved state-of-the-art crystal quality, extraordinary wafer-level thickness uniformity of <1% variation for both 2-in. and 4-in. substrates for growth rates as high as 7.2 μ m/h. All growth was performed using TMGa and pure O 2 as the precursors and N 2 as the carrier gas instead of the more widely used argon; no detectable nitrogen and carbon incorporation was observed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. For the homoepitaxy of Si-doped β-Ga 2 O 3 films on (010) substrates, a room temperature Hall mobility of 148 cm 2 /V s was achieved at a carrier concentration of 1.26 × 10 17 cm −3 , with a growth rate of 2.6 μ m/h. For the heteroepitaxy on sapphire, off-axis substrates exhibited enhanced crystallinity, as shown by the continued reduction of x-ray diffraction rocking curve full width at half maximum from 2834 to 1300 arcsec for 0° and 8° offcut sapphire substrates, respectively. The results demonstrate the scalability and potential advantages of this reactor design for manufacturing-scale β-Ga 2 O 3 growth and offer new insights into the controllability of uniform high-quality films for power electronics applications.},

In this study, a single crystal of Mg 4.8 Ag 1.4 Sb 4 has been successfully synthesized, demonstrating an ultralow thermal conductivity of approximately 0.6 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature. Structure determination based on single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis identifies the F m 3 ¯ m space group and the mixed occupancy of Mg atoms (∼60 at. %), Ag atoms (∼17.5 at. %), and vacancies (22.5 at. %) at the 8 c site. These crystallographic site-occupation disorders lead to substantial phonon scattering, which is the primary cause of the observed low thermal conductivity. First-principles calculations reveal high anharmonic scattering rates and short mean free paths in Mg 4.8 Ag 1.4 Sb 4 . Complementary molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the anomalous atomic vibrations of Ag atoms with large amplitudes at 300 K, which induces a low-lying acoustic phonon branch and enhanced phonon density of states at 0.6 THz. This phenomenon accounts for the enhanced anharmonic scattering rates at elevated temperatures, inducing a further reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.

  abstract     = {Lamellar membranes fabricated through the layer-by-layer stacking of two-dimensional nanosheets hold great promise in the field of nanofiltration (NF) owing to the existence of abundant nanochannels that function as excellent nanofilters. However, the NF performance of these lamellar membranes is severely limited by the irregularity of the nanochannels and the stacking defects of the nanosheets. To address this issue, a facile approach was proposed in this study, which involved the modification of lamellar MXene membranes intercalated with Ag nanoparticles (Ag@MXene) using tea polyphenols (TPs). Upon the TP modification, the initial wrinkles present in the MXene nanosheets were flattened, which effectively reduced the stacking defects and increased the regularity of the nanochannels. Consequently, the water permeability of the TP-modified Ag@MXene (Ag@MXene-TP) membrane significantly increased up to 137.7 Lm −2 h −1 ·bar −1 , a value that was three times the permeability of the pristine MXene membrane. Importantly, the Ag@MXene-TP membrane maintained a high dye rejection rate, with values of 95.85% for Rhodamine B and 97.30% for Congo Red. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidated the underlying mechanism for the water permeability enhancement. It was found that the adsorption of TPs on the MXene surface prevented the aggregation of MXene nanosheets by shielding the electrostatic attraction between the MXene nanosheets and the Ag nanoparticles. In addition, the enhanced regularity of the nanochannels was also found to cause largely reduced water transport resistance. This pre-modification strategy of MXene nanosheets with TPs provides a new way to build MXene-based nanochannels with improved regularity for high-performance NF membranes.},

To control the transport of topological carriers in such materials becomes a central issue. However, the topological bands in real materials are normally intricate, leaving obstacles to understanding the transports in a physically clear way. Here, we proposed an effective Weyl picture to effectively describe the macroscopic transport for topological semimetals with effective Weyl bands and simplified parameters. The essential sign regularity of anomalous Hall and Nernst transports was revealed by connecting to the chiralities of Weyl nodes and carrier types. A generalizable temperature scaling was verified by experimental transports of magnetic topological materials. Upon a double-Weyl picture, a concept of Berry-curvature ferrimagnetic structure, as an analogy to the real-space magnetic structure, was further proposed and well described the emerging sign reversal of Nernst thermoelectric transports in temperature scale. Our study offers a convenient tool for scaling the Weyl-fermion-related transport physics and promotes the modulations and applications of magnetic topological materials and quantum devices.},

In this work, we present a p-type CuO x /WSe 2 phototransistor that achieves both high responsivity and broad bandwidth. Using CuO x nanoparticles with abundant copper vacancies for broadband light absorption and two-dimensional WSe 2 as a high-mobility channel, this device demonstrates an exceptional responsivity of up to 1.8 × 10 5 A/W across wavelengths from 365 to 810 nm. The high performance originates from hole injection from defect-rich CuO x into WSe 2 , combined with electron trapping in vacancy states. The weak van der Waals interaction at the interface effectively decouples the optical absorption (in CuO x ) from charge transport (in WSe 2 ), enabling high gain without sacrificing response speed.},

We report an optimal volume of fluid over a 2D micro-resonator that increases the Q by up to 1000% compared to that in air. We have conducted precise experiments on piezoelectric, circular, membrane-type micro-resonators of 4 mm diameter fabricated using microelectromechanical systems technology on silicon-on-insulator wafers. The top side of the resonator was filled with different volumes of a fluid, i.e., fluidically loading only on one side of the membrane rather than entirely immersing the device, and its Q was measured through resonance tracking by actuating the resonator with an appropriate voltage. We found the existence of an optimal volume of fluid that maximized the Q. We argue that this phenomenon is a result of a balance between the enhancement of kinetic energy of the resonator due to mass loading of the fluid and the energy dissipation through viscous and acoustic radiation losses in the fluid medium. This remarkable enhancement in Q substantially improves the sensitivity of the resonator, with important implications for diverse applications such as biosensing and chemical detection. Our findings challenge the prevailing understanding of resonant sensing in fluids, providing new avenues for the development of highly sensitive sensors.},

The developed model demonstrates significant enhancement in spatial resolution, achieving up to 50 nm through the integration of Kelvin probe force microscopy and atomic force microscopy data. The predicted nanoscale Raman image reveals abnormal behaviors associated with strain-induced lattice perturbations, such as the presence of compressive and tensile strains within identical nanoscale wrinkles. Afterward, we interpreted the trained model using explainable artificial intelligence techniques, uncovering synergistic contributions to the Raman features across each input dataset within the nanoscale region. Our analysis demonstrates that the model effectively reflects key strain-induced lattice behaviors, highlighting its nanoscale sensitivity to structural perturbations. Finally, we validated these findings using quantum mechanical calculations, which confirmed the strain-induced changes in Raman-active modes.

Here, we systematically investigate the impact of SnO X on single-junction perovskite solar cells to understand the working mechanism of SnO X in the perovskite top cells. We discuss the correlation between the SnO X process and the photovoltaic parameters using steady-state photoluminescence, external quantum efficiency, space-charge-limited current measurements, and numerical simulations. We observe that the efficiency increased with thicker SnO X and the results suggest that thicker SnO X not only decreases the series resistance of perovskite solar cells but also has the potential to suppress nonradiative recombination. The improved buffer layer is finally used to produce a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with an efficiency of 32.84% (with a corresponding efficiency of 31.81% calculated using the short-circuit current density from the external quantum efficiency measurements).},

Traditional methods for mitigating these hazards are often based on active transducers that are either inconvenient, energy intensive, or utilizing chemicals that are detrimental to the environment and lacking long-term stability. To tackle the challenges of in situ monitoring and mitigating fogging and icing hazards on structural surfaces, we explored an integrated platform by combining electromagnetic (EM) metamaterials and piezoelectric thin film-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) technologies. Icing monitoring was performed using EM metamaterial based on SAW electrodes with advantages of wireless and non-contact detection, and effective de-icing functions were achieved through harnessing mechanical vibrations, acousto-thermal, and acoustic streaming effects generated by the SAWs. This integrated platform is modular and scalable up for practical applications requiring fogging/icing detection and prevention systems. Our results have shown that the resonant frequency of the metamaterial device was decreased with accumulation of condensation on the surface of the device, which showed the fulfillment of sensing and monitoring. Results also showed that as the applied SAW power was increased, the time taken for de-fogging and de-icing were significantly decreased.},

However, achieving accurate blood biopsy for cancer pathological diagnosis presents substantial challenges. Herein, we have developed a precision blood biopsy technology utilizing a malignant cell-targeted nanoprobe for lung cancer diagnosis. The nanoprobe functionalized with SYL3C-conjugated hyaluronic acid and the KALA-GE11 peptide can efficiently deliver the loaded molecular beacons into heterogeneous circulating malignant cells (CMCs) in whole blood to detect diverse intracellular mRNA markers, including the proliferation marker Ki67, the oncogenic marker c-Myc, and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) typically expressed in specific types of lung cancers. The simultaneous detection of various markers not only reduces false-negative rates caused by the high heterogeneity of CMCs but also provides accurate insight into the specific heterogeneity of CMCs for individual patients. The nanoprobe can differentiate lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). TTF-1 is abundant in CMCs of LAD and SCLC but is relatively less common in SCC. c-Myc is more frequently overexpressed in CMCs from LAD and SCLC. Notably, Ki67 is upregulated in most CMCs across all lung cancer types. Furthermore, this approach can sensitively identify malignant cells from early stage lesions clinically classified as noninvasive carcinoma in situ . This technique holds significant clinical potentials for the early detection and precise characterization of lung cancer. Importantly, this strategy is adaptable for detecting other biomarkers, thereby extending its applicability to the diagnosis of various cancer types.},

  abstract     = {Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have emerged as highly attractive alternatives to conventional commercial off-the-shelf electronic sensors and systems due to their ability to offer miniature size, reduced weight, and low power consumption (i.e., SWaP advantages). These features make MEMS particularly appealing for a wide range of critical applications, including communication, biomedical, automotive, aerospace, and defense sectors. Resonant MEMS play crucial roles in these applications by providing precise timing references and channel selections for electronic devices, facilitating accurate filtering, mixing, synchronization, and tracking via their high stability and low phase noise. Additionally, they serve as key components in sensing applications, enabling detection and precise measurement of physical quantities for monitoring and control purposes across various fields. Temperature stability stands as a paramount performance specification for MEMS resonators and oscillators. It relates to the responsivity of a resonator's frequency to temperature variations and is typically quantified by the temperature coefficient of frequency (TC f ). A constant and substantially large absolute TC f is preferred in MEMS temperature sensing applications, while a near-zero TC f is required for timing and other MEMS transducers that necessitate the decoupling of temperature effects on the resonance frequency. This comprehensive review aims to provide an in-depth overview of recent advancements in studying TC f in MEMS resonators. The review explores the compensation and engineering techniques employed across a range of resonator types, utilizing diverse materials. Various aspects are covered, including the design of MEMS resonators, theoretical analysis of TC f , temperature regulation techniques, and the metallization effect at high temperatures. The discussion encompasses TC f analysis of MEMS resonators operating in flexural, torsional, surface, and bulk modes, employing materials such as silicon (Si), lithium niobate (LiNbO 3 ), silicon carbide (SiC), aluminum nitride (AlN), and gallium nitride (GaN).

The intrinsic piezoelectricity of PVDF, driven by its polar β -phase, enables dynamic responses to mechanical stimuli, such as physiological movements or external forces, generating localized electrical potentials that modulate critical signaling pathways to enhance tissue repair. Applications span multiple organs: in bone regeneration, PVDF scaffolds promote osteogenesis through mechanoelectrical coupling; in neural engineering, they facilitate axonal growth and myelination; in cardiac repair, they synchronize cardiomyocyte contraction; and in skin healing, they accelerate re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. Despite these advances, challenges persist, including optimizing piezoelectric output, ensuring long-term biocompatibility, and achieving controlled biodegradability. Future directions highlight the integration of PVDF with smart functionalities and the exploration of organ-specific signaling mechanisms to advance clinical translation. This work underscores the potential of PVDF-based materials as multifunctional platforms for next-generation regenerative therapies.},

  abstract     = {Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in materials degradation, posing a risk not only to existing infrastructure but also to a broad range of emerging and rapidly growing industries. Addressing MIC challenges across diverse environments and operational conditions requires advanced, durable, and effective materials. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a compelling frontier in materials science, distinguished by their complex compositions and exceptional properties, which arise from unique microstructures, the atomic arrangement of multiple principal elements, and the synergistic effects of their combinations. Many HEAs demonstrate superior corrosion resistance in comparison to conventional alloys, and their concept enables antimicrobial functionalization. From this perspective, antimicrobial HEAs emerge as promising candidates for MIC prevention and mitigation. Despite this potential, the microbiology community and corrosion industry professionals are rarely aware of HEAs, while HEA researchers, seeking new development directions and prospective applications, may not yet recognize the pressing MIC challenges and R&D needs. This review serves as a comprehensive guide for the interdisciplinary community, closing the gap between HEA research and its potential applications in corrosion protection, with emphasis on MIC. It provides a detailed overview of HEAs and conventional alloys exposed to MIC environments, evaluating their performance and exhaustively incorporating the vast majority of existing research on HEAs containing antimicrobial metals. The paper builds bridges and explores opportunities for intersectoral collaboration among applied physicists, materials scientists, corrosion experts, and microbiologists in both laboratory and industry settings.},

  abstract     = {Quantum sensing has witnessed rapid development and transition from laboratories to practical applications in the past decade. Applications of quantum sensors, ranging from nanotechnologies to biosensing, are expected to benefit from quantum sensors' unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. Solid-state spin systems are particularly attractive platforms for quantum sensing technologies because room temperature operation is viable while reaching the quantum limits of sensitivity. Among various solid-state spin systems, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond demonstrated high-fidelity initialization, coherent control, and high contrast readout of the electron spin state. However, electron spin coherence due to noise from the surrounding spin bath and this environment effect limits the sensitivity of NV centers. Thus, a critical task in NV center-based quantum sensing is sensitivity enhancement through coherence protection. Several strategies, such as dynamical decoupling techniques, feedback control, and nuclear spin-assisted sensing protocols, have been developed and realized for this task. Among these strategies, nuclear spin-assisted protocols have demonstrated greater enhancement of electron spin coherence. In addition, the electron and nuclear spin pair of an NV center in diamond naturally allows the application of the nuclear spin-assisted sensitivity enhancement protocol. Owing to long nuclear coherence times, further enhancement of sensitivity can be achieved by exploiting active nuclear spins (e.g., 14 N, 13 C) in the proximity of an NV center as memory ancillas when coupled with the NV center. Here, we review the spin properties of NV centers, mechanisms of the nuclear spin-assisted protocol and its gate variation, and the status of quantum sensing applications in high-resolution nuclear spin spectroscopy, atomic imaging, and magnetic field sensing. We discuss the potential for commercialization, current challenges in sensitivity enhancement, and conclude with future research directions for promoting the development of nuclear spin-assisted protocol and its integration into industrial applications.},

Inspired by the biological visual perception system, the devices integrate sensing, computing, and memory in a single functional unit. Compared with the electronically controlled memristor, the introduction of optical signals can further improve the computational efficiency and physically integrate the sensing unit and the processing unit. This efficient and intelligent information processing method can effectively overcome the bottleneck of traditional computing under von Neumann architecture. However, the development of optoelectronic brain-like devices is still in the preliminary stage, and its mechanism is complex and not uniform. Therefore, it is necessary to deeply understand the quantum process between optical input and electrical output to provide a better reference for the development of this field. This article aims to comprehensively review the latest progress in optoelectronic brain-like devices, summarizing the device performance and structures. It also provides a comprehensive summary of multiple mechanisms under different material systems, such as direct photoelectric conversion or photoelectric conversion triggering subsequent effects. In addition, a variety of potential application scenarios for optoelectronic devices are introduced. Finally, we present some possible problems in the development of this field.

In the framework of weak measurement, Aharonov, Albert, and Vaidman introduced the concept of postselection and thereby defined the weak value. In recent research, weak-value measurement (WVM) has offered a novel perspective for studying intricate problems in quantum mechanics, leading to many conceptual breakthroughs. More importantly in practice, WVM has shown an unprecedented impact on precision sensing. In this review, we begin by presenting the fundamental theory of WVM based on quantum parameter estimation, from which the effects of weak-value amplification and weak-coupling amplification can be derived. The two effects can significantly improve the precision in various sensing schemes based on WVM. We point out the technical advantages that enable the WVM schemes to outperform the conventional ones under the same measurement conditions. Notably, the capability of information compression is underscored, which is garnering increasing attention in the field of quantum metrology. This review aims to show the possibility for broadening the application of WVM to address more critical problems, and on the other hand, for leveraging its advantages to accomplish tasks that are currently unattainable, such that WVM could play a more important role in the future of precision sensing.},

They can be used to generate unique identities, linked to their structure, by measuring features associated with them. Optically read PUFs (O-PUFs) are a subset that utilizes optical imaging techniques to create these database of identities. They offer a promising solution to the perpetual challenge of counterfeiting by providing a robust authentication solution. The metrics chosen for evaluation are varied across the field; there is a lack of consensus in the figures of merit used for evaluation, as well as the protocols and standards used for assessing this specific subset of PUFs. This work reviews the progress in the development of evaluation techniques to date, and it highlights important differences in the statistical assessment of O-PUFs. A summary of the most popular metrics used in the literature in the past decade is presented, and the core metrics are isolated and mathematically defined. These are then distilled into recommendations of best practice for assessing and comparing different technologies. An open-source package, providing a full testing suite, is presented to standardize testing in this field. Finally, novel methods for evaluating the performance of O-PUFs over time are also proposed.

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cell (PSC) is currently considered as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies for the next generation, which strongly demands the development of scalable process for PSC manufacturing. When scaling up a state-of-the-art solution process for perovskite to a large area, a comparably poor film quality generally results from the perovskite ink flow particularly with nonvolatile solvent. Therefore, the design of perovskite ink inducing a high film quality in scalable process, as well as allowing a wide window for coating speed, is the most important for scalable manufacturing to assure industrial benefits with low-energy consumption and high throughput. In this review, the progress of perovskite ink for scalable process has been thoroughly understood closely relating to the nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, where the respective roles of solvents are distinguished with their limitation.},

  abstract     = {By integrating the virtues of vision and touch, vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) achieve an artificial tactile capability that transcends the natural, demonstrating superior performance unattainable through either sense alone. VBTS, as an innovative sensor, boasts commendable performance metrics and has found extensive applications across various domains. Nevertheless, a comprehensive synthesis regarding the perceptual performance achievable by VBTS is currently lacking. Moreover, the performance parameter evaluation systems for VBTS are not standardized, and the strategies for enhancing these metrics remain unclear. Here, the significant advancements in VBTS over recent years are summarized, from sensing mechanisms to application scenarios. The review particularly focuses on parameters that assess performance and novel strategies in hardware design aimed at improving these performance parameters, including key performance indicators (e.g., range, spatial resolution, and sensitivity), along with error, temporal parameters, miniaturization, and stability. This review also discusses the sensing capability and application scenarios, such as item identification, grasp control, material property detection, and multimodal perception. Finally, perspectives on VBTS are provided. We expect that this review enables researchers to rapidly comprehend the capabilities and performance of VBTS, and offers references for the selection or design of its different modules.},

Expansion Microscopy (ExM) has emerged as a powerful and accessible technique that enhances resolution by physically enlarging the specimen. Importantly, the principles of ExM provide a unique foundation for combinations with SRM methods, pushing the boundaries of achievable resolution. This review explores the fundamental principles of ExM and examines its successful integration with various SRM techniques, including fluorescence fluctuation-based SRM, structured illumination microscopy, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, and single-molecule localization microscopy. We discuss the applications, strengths, limitations, and resolutions achieved by these combined approaches, providing a comprehensive guide for researchers to select the most suitable method for their specific scientific needs. Key considerations when combining ExM with SRM include the impact on fluorophores, the requirement for specialized buffers, and the challenges posed by the sensitivity of expanded hydrogels to temperature and hydration. Strategies to address these challenges, such as optimized labeling techniques and gel re-embedding, are discussed in detail. This review aims to assist researchers in navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of ExM and SRM, facilitating the development of tailored imaging pipelines to advance our understanding of biological systems at the nanoscale.},

  abstract     = {The 2019 report of ferroelectricity in (Al,Sc)N [Fichtner et al. , J. Appl. Phys. 125 , 114103 (2019)] broke a long-standing tradition of considering AlN the textbook example of a polar but non-ferroelectric material. Combined with the recent emergence of ferroelectricity in HfO 2 -based fluorites [Böscke et al. , Appl. Phys. Lett. 99 , 102903 (2011)], these unexpected discoveries have reinvigorated studies of integrated ferroelectrics, with teams racing to understand the fundamentals and/or deploy these new materials—or, more correctly, attractive new capabilities of old materials—in commercial devices. The five years since the seminal report of ferroelectric (Al,Sc)N [Fichtner et al. , J. Appl. Phys. 125 , 114103 (2019)] have been particularly exciting, and several aspects of recent advances have already been covered in recent review articles [Jena et al. , Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 58 , SC0801 (2019); Wang et al. , Appl. Phys. Lett. 124 , 150501 (2024); Kim et al. , Nat. Nanotechnol. 18 , 422–441 (2023); and F. Yang, Adv. Electron. Mater. 11 , 2400279 (2024)]. We focus here on how the ferroelectric wurtzites have made the field rethink domain walls and the polarization reversal process—including the very character of spontaneous polarization itself—beyond the classic understanding that was based primarily around perovskite oxides and extended to other chemistries with various caveats. The tetrahedral and highly covalent bonding of AlN along with the correspondingly large bandgap lead to fundamental differences in doping/alloying, defect compensation, and charge distribution when compared to the classic ferroelectric systems; combined with the unipolar symmetry of the wurtzite structure, the result is a class of ferroelectrics that are both familiar and puzzling, with characteristics that seem to be perfectly enabling and simultaneously nonstarters for modern integrated devices. The goal of this review is to (relatively) quickly bring the reader up to speed on the current—at least as of early 2025—understanding of domains and defects in wurtzite ferroelectrics, covering the most relevant work on the fundamental science of these materials as well as some of the most exciting work in early demonstrations of device structures.},

  abstract     = {Human brain is capable of optimizing information flow and processing without energy-intensive data shuttling between processor and memory. At the core of this unique capability are billions of neurons connected through trillions of synapses—basic processing units of the brain. The action potentials or “spikes” based temporal processing using the regulated flow of ions across ion channels in neuron cells allows sparse and efficient transmission of data in the brain. Emerging systems based on confined fluidic systems have provided a framework for a new type of neuromorphic computing with lower energy consumption, hardware-level plasticity, and multiple information carriers that emulate natural processes and mechanisms of human brain. These systems mimic neuronal architectures by harnessing and modulating ion transport along artificial channels. The spikes-induced ion-to-surface interactions within these fluidic systems enables the control of ionic conductivity to achieve synaptic plasticity for the realization of brain-inspired functionalities such as memory effect and signal transmission. Herein, this review provides an overview of recent advances in fluidic devices such as memristors and other computing components, covering their basic operations, materials and architectures, as well as applications in neuromorphic computing. The review concludes with a brief outline of the challenges that these emerging technologies face and an outlook for the development of fluidic-based brain-inspired computing.},

  abstract     = {Spinel cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4 , CFO) nanoparticles (NPs) are a major focus of fundamental science and technological innovation due to their distinctive mix of magnetic, electrical, and chemical characteristics. CFO NPs have outstanding chemical stability, modest saturation magnetism (∼80 emu/g), a high Curie temperature (∼793 K), and significant magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These characteristics, further improved by cation substitution and surface functionalization, enable a wide range of applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of CFO NPs, covering their synthesis methods, physicochemical characterization, surface modifications, and diverse applications. We compare the environmental impact, scalability, yield, and particle size control of a variety of synthesis techniques, including co-precipitation, hydrothermal, sol-gel route, combustion method, microemulsion, thermal decomposition, electrochemical synthesis, polyol method, and green synthesis methods. The sustainable alternative of green synthesis, which employs plant- and microbe-mediated biosynthesis, is becoming increasingly important in the biomedical and environmental sectors. Furthermore, we explore advanced surface functionalization techniques that employ monomeric, inorganic, and polymeric stabilizers to improve the biocompatibility and stability of CFO NPs. The effects of cation substitution (such as transition metals and rare-earth dopants) on the physicochemical and magnetic properties of CFO NPs are examined in detail, addressing challenges like cost and stability in real-world applications. Moreover, the present review provides a detailed discussion correlating structural, morphological, magnetic, dielectric, optical, and electrical properties of CFO with synthesis methods and modifications. The traditional energy storage and conversion applications of CFO are comprehensively discussed. Additionally, the review highlights magnetic applications, biomedical applications (e.g., MRI contrast agents, magnetic hyperthermia, and biosensors), the role of CFO in electronics and optoelectronics, purification and catalysis applications, as well as advances in electromagnetic technologies. Emerging applications, including their roles in quantum computing, nanorobotics, tissue engineering, and bioimaging, are also discussed, emphasizing the cutting-edge potential of CFO NPs in multifunctional technologies. The objective of this review is to critically evaluate recent advancements, challenges, and future research directions to bridge the divide in understanding CFO NPs. This systematic evaluation establishes a strong foundation for researchers, allowing them to investigate novel applications of CFO NPs in both current and emerging technological domains.},

The pursuit of improvements in microbubble engineering requires a detailed understanding of fluid flow behavior in microfluidic systems, which is where the motivation for this work originates from. This work provides an extensive review of the theoretical, experimental, and numerical investigations reported in the literature to understand microbubbles formation using microfluidic devices. The evolution of gas–liquid interfaces during microbubble formation, the pinch-off mechanism, and the confinement effect on microbubble size and production rate have been discussed. The scaling laws for the prediction of microbubble diameter and microbubble formation regimes maps providing details about the interplay of different forces have also been reviewed. Furthermore, the developments in CFD simulations based on different interface tracking schemes for microbubble formation in microfluidic devices, along with the recent developments and strategies to upscale microbubble production rate in microfluidic devices, have also been discussed.

  abstract     = {A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QMs) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MMs), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists—a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor in this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies and forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed, as well as stability and generalizability—many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol—the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible—though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle exploration and design of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the technical design space (the speed-accuracy trade-off) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks (from a machine learning-centric point of view) of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, and envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.},

As compared to the strategies enhancing thermoelectric performance, the related research works focusing on endurance mechanisms during long-term working, however, are insufficient and should be systematically evaluated for making broad applications. Specifically, systematic issues divided into mechanic, thermodynamic, and kinetic sections could play a predominated role in challenging different constituents per the intrinsic mechanisms, and the inferior stability of chalcogenides limits further developments in the next decades. In this review, typical material systems like Pb-, Cu-, and Bi-based chalcogenides as well as several emerging compounds like Ag-, Sn-, and oxygen-containing compounds would be referred and discussed extensively, focusing on the endurance ability. Subsequently, four kinds of mechanisms at different levels would be systematically summarized and investigated: first, considering the key roles on affecting mechanical stability and optimizing the compositions for forming proper bonding strength and microstructures for high density are required. Second, it is crucial to explore the interactions between the elemental vapor pressure and the service temperature in chalcogenides. Third, the uncertainties introduced by phase-transition phenomena cannot be ignored. In addition, nano-precipitates from low melting point components also put forward high requirements on the endurance. Furthermore, the coincided improvements could benefit the enhanced stability and output performance of applied devices. These unique advances combined with the corresponding strategies for long-term endurance demonstrate the potential of high-performance chalcogenides for large-scale power generation applications.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction to value-added chemicals for sustainable and clean energy is hindered by its considerable ionization potential (IP) and negative adiabatic electron affinity (EA), which makes CO 2 a chemically inert molecule, leading to its challenging and unfavorable conversion under ambient conditions. To cope with this challenge, novel catalysts have been developed to lower the activation energy for CO 2 conversion reactions. However, the low activity, selectivity, and deactivation of catalysts limit their industrial applications. This scenario demands the development of next-generation, highly active, selective, and long-term stable catalysts for CO 2 conversion based on the reaction mechanism and microkinetics. This review summarizes and unifies the current catalyst design concepts for the thermochemical CO 2 conversion to C1 products via heterogenous catalysis. In addition, recommendations are made to leverage thermal-catalysis knowledge to design plasma-activated catalysts. Four reactions were reviewed and analyzed for producing single-carbon (C1) organic products, including reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, dry reforming of methane (DRM), CO 2 methanation, and CO 2 hydrogenation. Each section focuses on one reaction to elaborate on the reaction mechanism and current status for experimental and computational-based development of catalysts, including unsupported mono-metals, supported mono- and bimetallic catalysis, and transition carbide catalysts, depending on the reaction followed by the potential causes of catalyst deactivation. Finally, directions for future development are outlined with recommendations to translate the thermal catalysis concepts at a specific level for a rational catalyst design to catalyze CO 2 conversion to C1 products under a non-thermal plasma (NTP) catalytic system.},

  abstract     = {Over the past two decades, the successful growth of high-quality wide-bandgap III-nitrides has made the realization of a broad range of new device applications, including optoelectronic and microelectronic fields. Through monolithic integration of photonic and electronic devices simultaneously, different functional modules can be integrated on the same wafer, eliminating parasitic effects caused by redundant external components, enhancing system robustness and saving chip area. The scalable integrated circuits have the great potential for optoelectronic hybrid integration. This paper reviews the latest research progress in the monolithic integration of III-nitride devices in optoelectronics and microelectronics in recent years, especially the system integration of gallium nitride-based light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and high-electron-mobility transistors. We further analyze the development status and challenges of photonic integrated circuits and power monolithic integrated circuits from the perspectives of process fabrication and device structure. The applications of III-nitride monolithic integrated systems are presented in detail, including sensing and on-chip optical communication. Finally, we summarize the current state of development, opportunities, and challenges in III-nitride monolithic integration, providing insights into the advancement of wide-bandgap semiconductors in the post-Moore's law era.},

In this work, we introduce a new series of organic nonlinear optical salt crystals tailored for THz wave generators. The newly designed fluorinated cationic chromophore, 6-fluoro-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)-1-methylquinolinium (OH6FQ), has been incorporated with various fluorinated or non-fluorinated anions into six different ionic crystals. Notably, the tetrafluorinated crystals, composed of fluorinated OH6FQ cations and trifluorinated anions, meet essential requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including large macroscopic optical nonlinearity, optimal facet orientation in as-grown crystals with mm-size, plate-like morphology, and relatively low THz absorption across both the entire-molecular phonon and anion-stretching vibration regions. These tetrafluorinated crystals exhibit over 20 times higher optical-to-THz amplitude conversion efficiency compared to inorganic ZnTe, with a broad bandwidth extending up to 16 THz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tetrafluorinated ionic organic THz crystals, showing promising potential for diverse THz photonic and nonlinear optical applications.},

  abstract     = {It is thought that schemes for quantum imaging are fragile against realistic environments in which the background noise is often stronger than the nonclassical signal of the imaging photons. Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows an exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. This measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.},

Here, we establish for the first time the intrinsic evolution laws of Fabry–Pérot bound states in the continuum (FP-BICs), revealing that the Q factor is inversely proportional to the square of phase/frequency detuning and to the nonradiative decay rate, enabling directional engineering of FP-BIC resonances. We propose an all-dielectric multilayer film metasurface to create an optical resonator and its perfectly mirrored counterpart, inducing FP-BICs and validating the conclusions. We experimentally demonstrated the evolution of the Q factor with frequency detuning, achieving a maximum Q factor of 610 in the visible.

  abstract     = {Controlling and enhancing light–matter coupling at subwavelength scales is an essential requirement in the realm of meta-photonics. Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a standout platform for delivering high-quality (Q) factor resonances and near-field electromagnetic hotspots. However, in the terahertz (THz) domain, experimental validation of high-Q BICs resonances with strong robustness and advanced maneuverability in such all-dielectric photonic systems remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and feasible fabrication approach to unlock the full potential of BICs-inspired resonances within the array of silicon cross elliptical resonators. Our results suggest that the designed THz-MS can support two symmetry-protected BICs with a topological charge of ±1 and several accidental BICs with a topological charge of +1 simultaneously. By introducing small perturbations to the individual resonator, the original two symmetry-protected BICs transform into quasi-BICs that bow to the inverse-square law. Astoundingly, for larger symmetry breaking, two additional BICs can be observed in the asymmetric THz-MSs surpass typical inverse-square rule, hence presenting a supererogatory degree of freedom for tailoring BICs resonances on demand. We bear out theoretical findings by transmission experiments implemented on the fabricated samples. We observe experimentally ultrasharp dual quasi-BICs resonances with a highest measured Q factor of up to 371, a level of performance that was previously unattainable with all-dielectric THz-MS on a substrate. The results mark an important step toward enriching the family of BICs and promise exciting opportunities in the field of THz optoelectronic devices and metadevices.},

  abstract     = {The obtention of quantum-grade rare-earth-doped oxide thin films that can be integrated with optical cavities and microwave resonators is of great interest for the development of scalable quantum devices. Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y 2 O 3 ) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y 2 O 3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er 3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Solar-blind UV polarization detection and imaging can reflect more detailed optical information, which is vital for developing next-generation deep UV optoelectronic devices. β-Ga 2 O 3 with ultra-wide bandgap is an ideal candidate for solar-blind UV detection application. However, the bulky nature of Ga 2 O 3 limits its application in miniaturized, integrated and multifunctional devices, and polarization imaging based on Ga 2 O 3 photodetector has not yet been realized. Here, we report a convenient method to prepare 2D β-Ga 2 O 3 flakes via liquid-metal-assisted exfoliation. Benefiting from high crystallinity and polarization-sensitive absorption of prepared ultrathin β-Ga 2 O 3 flake in monoclinic structure, the β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetector exhibits an ultra-fast response speed (100/78 μ s for rise/decay time) and a prominent anisotropy ratio (∼2.8) of polarization photoresponse under 265 nm illumination. An unambiguous detection of linearly polarized light has also been realized by the double symmetry-breaking of twisted β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetectors. Moreover, a four-layer twistedly stacked detection system further enables a one-step and well-defined polarization imaging with high resolution (150 × 150 pixels) to acquire spatial polarization information. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing ultrathin 2D gallium oxides and demonstrates a promising route to realize well-defined solar-blind polarization imaging in a simple manner.},

Here, we demonstrate a significant shift of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in ferromagnetic films placed between two superconductor gating layers. Through deliberate modifications of the interface structure using various insertion layers, we have determined that the superconducting proximity effect has a minimal impact on the modulation of ferromagnetic resonance characteristics. Instead, our findings strongly support very recent theoretical predictions that emphasize the phenomenon of ultrastrong coupling between Kittel magnons and Cooper pairs arising from the superconducting magnetoelectric effect. We propose that this ultrastrong coupling not only provides a precise method for determining superconducting parameters like the London penetration depth but also lays the foundation for the manipulation of spin waves through superconductors in future magnonic circuits.},

  abstract     = {As an effective method for thermal management technologies, doping or substitution has been extensively utilized to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of various materials. Intensive studies have been conducted about the phonon mechanism of isoelectronic alloying since the 1950s. Very recently, the specific role of aliovalent doping was elucidated in the half-Heusler NbFeSb system. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity through aliovalent doping by combining first-principles calculations and neutron diffraction studies for the case study of the TiCoSb half-Heusler system. The softening of the acoustic branches induced by aliovalent doping can effectively reduce the phonon group velocities. Moreover, the introduction of compensating defects, resulting from changes in the Fermi level, plays a vital role in decreasing the relaxation time of phonons, as demonstrated by the analysis of neutron powder diffraction. Due to these two factors, doping with adjacent elements results in a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (for instance, Ni doping at the Co site in the TiCoSb half-Heusler system), especially in the low-temperature range. Our findings provide valuable insight into the phonon scattering mechanism in aliovalent-doped materials and demonstrate the role of compensating defects in heat transport, which is applicable to other doped semiconductor systems.},

The untethered nature and size of these robots enhance maneuverability and accessibility within complex vascular networks, potentially improving clot removal efficiency. We explore mechanical fragmentation, chemical lysis, and hybrid dissolution techniques that combine mechanical fragmentation with chemical lysis, highlighting their potential for targeted and efficient blood clot removal. Through experimental validation using an ex vivo endovascular thrombosis model within the iliac artery of a sheep, we demonstrate direct revascularization of a 13-mm-long, 1-day-old blood clot positioned inside the left common iliac artery. This was achieved by deploying a UMR into the abdominal aorta within 15 min. Additionally, both mechanical fragmentation and hybrid dissolution achieve a greater volume rate of change compared to no intervention (control) and chemical lysis alone. Mechanical fragmentation exhibits clot removal with a median of 0.87 mm 3 /min and a range of 2.81 mm 3 /min, while the hybrid approach demonstrates slower but more consistent clot removal, with a median of 0.45 mm 3 /min and a range of 0.23 mm 3 /min.},

However, so far, there has been no report of flexible phototransistors that simultaneously achieve both high mobility and detectivity. Additionally, phototransistors are conventionally relied on thick channel layers and previous thin channel layers based devices only show poor performance. Here, we report flexible phototransistors based on ultrathin niobium-doped indium oxide (InNbO, 5 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO, 3 nm) channel layers, which possess high mobility (49.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and high detectivity (3.02 × 10 14 Jones) simultaneously. Significantly, the devices offer a broad spectral responsivity (from violet to green emissions). We postulate that the high mobility can be ascribed to the diffusion of Sn atoms (from ITO) and conduction band offset (between InNbO and ITO), while the high detectivity originates from the low dark current. To illustrate the capabilities of flexible phototransistors, we demonstrate both a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display pixel circuit and an imaging system. Our approach unlocks new possibilities to achieve flexible phototransistors with superior performance, which suggest a great potential in next-generation flexible, stretchable, bendable, and low-cost electronics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a prominent branch of non-linear optics (NLO) heavily reliant on conventional bulk NLO crystals. However, the difficulty in downsizing these crystals imposes technical limitations on the future of miniaturized NLO devices. Tellurene emerges as a promising candidate to overcome these restrictions, excelling in electrical applications and believed to possess a giant second-order optical susceptibility comparable to conventional NLO crystals. In this study, a face-to-face substrate configuration is employed for the synthesis of ultrathin tellurene via PVD. Our findings reveal that tellurene's SHG performance surpasses that of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by two orders of magnitude, with maximum efficiency when the flake thickness is between 16 and 20 nm under various wavelengths. High sensitivity to thickness variation encourages post-growth thinning through hydrogen plasma etching, enabling precise engineering of the flake thickness for optimal SHG. This establishes a foundation for controlled tellurene thickness, further broadening its potential in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic and electrochemical devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of the bulk has made a deep understanding of the physics of BAs elusive. Building on the theory of the ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [Choe et al. , Phys. Rev. B 103 , 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, specifically explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt a neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way that maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to the CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be accurately described by the sum of localized point dipoles that exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, regardless of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation < 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be easily applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.},

While most previous works have focused on isotropic BMR, arising from isotropic band structure or the spin Hall effect, we report on a strongly anisotropic BMR (ABMR) observed at the KTaO 3 Rashba interface, characterized by a unique low-symmetry Fermi surface. For the first time, we have successfully achieved significant regulation of ABMR through the application of gate voltage. Our quantified analysis reveals a profound link between the tunable anisotropy in Rashba spin splitting and the precise modulation of the Fermi level filling, highlighting its central role in governing gate-modulated ABMR. Additionally, we introduce a rigorous physical model that provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying gate-voltage-controlled ABMR. This control over electronic processes in low-dimensional systems holds immense potential for both fundamental physics research and the development of advanced multi-channel spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Bi 1− x Sb x alloys are classic thermoelectric materials for near-cryogenic applications. Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi 1− x Sb x alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron–phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( ⁠ ≪ 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p -type compositions to meet or exceed the current n -type alloys.},

  abstract     = {As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron–phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by ∼ 800 % at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.},

This study focuses on three-terminal synaptic transistors utilizing graphene and P(VDF-TrFE) to achieve dynamic reconfigurability between excitatory and inhibitory response modes, which are crucial for mimicking biological functions. The devices operate by applying different top gate spikes (±25 V and ±10 V) to modulate the polarization degree of P(VDF-TrFE), thereby regulating the carrier type and concentration in the graphene channel. This results in the effective realization of enhancement and inhibition processes in two neural-like states: excitatory and inhibitory modes, accompanied by good neural plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and spike-time-dependent plasticity. With these features, the synaptic devices achieve brain-like memory enhancement and human-like perception functions, exhibiting excellent stability, durability over 1000 cycles, and a long retention period exceeding 10 years. Additionally, the performance of the artificial neural network is evaluated for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 92.28%.

Although these applications are dependent on the optical performance, the origin of the optical absorption in electrochromic oxides is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the electrochromism of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides can be described by a combination of polaron and bipolaron hopping. Based on the valences of the metallic constituents, we model experimental optical absorption spectra by polaron theory and assign two prominent absorption peaks to polaronic and bipolaronic charge transfer excitations. However, in the special case of V 2 O 5 , three peaks were necessary to fit the optical spectra. The activation energies of polaronic and bipolaronic hopping were remarkably similar for all the cathodic oxides studied. Within the framework of polaron absorption, V 2 O 5 would be categorized as a cathodic oxide, rather than as a mixed anodic/cathodic material as in the conventional picture. We emphasize that our findings here not only offer a profound understanding of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides but also pave the way for exploring electrochromic oxides with dual-band modulations.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving pentalayer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity of pentalayer rhombohedral graphene to develop nonvolatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less nonvolatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, nondestructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ∼6 nW required per write operation and ∼2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed nonvolatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Micro- and nano-electromechanical systems resonators have been regarded as powerful tools for precision mass detection, and their abilities to measure these in a liquid environment open various opportunities for biosensing, chemical analysis, and environmental monitoring. Apart from overcoming issues of fluidic damping and electrical interfaces, there is a great challenge of bringing microanalytes to these devices with the required precision and scaling for high throughput sensing. Herein, we address the above challenges by proposing a self-excited localized acoustic manipulation methodology based on a piezoelectric micromechanical diaphragm resonator (PMDR). Such a PMDR integrates acoustofluidics and mass sensing functions in tandem on a single device. Particle enrichment is realized within tens of seconds and the limit of detection is enhanced by mitigating common issues such as low capture rate and non-uniform distribution. The developed PMDR is versatile in its applicability to a range of particle sizes and densities for both acoustofluidic actuation and in situ mass sensing. This work addresses long-term technical challenges of inaccurate and inefficient measurement of liquid phase resonance mass sensing with great application potentials in biochemical detection and environmental monitoring.},

We review the design of acoustic metamaterials and the physical mechanisms underpinning their performance and related manufacturing methodologies, while also examining potential issues and challenges affecting the use of metamaterials in acoustics. The complexities of several metamaterial architectures are discussed. A new classification system is proposed to distinguish metamaterial configurations based on the typology of the channels inside the acoustic meta-atom. Several types of acoustic metamaterials architectures, such as perforated and micro-perforated panels, acoustic foams, resonators, various geometrical paths, and piezoelectric patches, are also discussed. The fundamental acoustic mechanisms of these classes of metamaterials are identified and commented on. The paper also describes the main measurement techniques used for acoustic metamaterials and the physical quantities evaluated, providing a guide to characterize and assess their performance. The fundamental challenges of the current metamaterials designs are discussed, with a focus on the complex synergy between architectural patterns of acoustic metamaterials and their thickness.

  abstract     = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been studied intensively, and their practical applications are advancing. The efficiency of light-emitting materials has been improved significantly through the understanding of their emission mechanisms. However, the correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the operating voltage in OLEDs remains unclear, because OLEDs require a complex multilayer configuration that includes many materials other than the emitter. It is difficult to investigate the exact energy diagram for OLEDs, which have many interfaces, and many uncertainties remain regarding the mechanisms of charge injection and recombination. In this review, we introduce both the charge injection and recombination mechanisms in OLEDs and the interface control technology effective for lowering their operating voltage. We explain the electron injection mechanism at organic/cathode interfaces, which is clarified by using organic bases as the electron injection layers. The hole injection mechanism in OLEDs, which is clarified by investigating the correlation between the characteristics of OLEDs and the actual energy levels at organic/anode interfaces, is also introduced. With the elucidation of the charge injection mechanism, holes and electrons can now be injected into various organic materials. These charge injection techniques minimize the voltage required for charge recombination. The correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the minimum voltage required for OLED operation is clarified by controlling the energy levels at organic/organic interfaces. Understanding this correlation enables the design of molecules for ultralow-voltage OLEDs, thereby realizing blue OLEDs with an extremely low turn-on voltage of about 1.5 V.},

These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light–matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level.

  abstract     = {Smart biomaterials have significantly impacted human healthcare by advancing the development of medical devices designed to function within human tissue, mimicking the behavior of natural tissues. While the intelligence of biomaterials has evolved from inert to active over the past few decades, smart biomaterials take this a step further by making their surfaces or bulk respond based on interactions with surrounding tissues, imparting outcomes similar to natural tissue functions. This interaction with the surrounding tissue helps in creating stimuli-responsive biomaterials, which can be useful in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, autonomous drug delivery, orthopedics, and much more. Traditionally, material engineering focused on refining the static properties of biomaterials to accommodate them within the body without evoking an immune response, which was a major obstacle to their unrestricted operation. This review highlights and explains various engineering approaches currently under research for developing stimuli-responsive biomaterials that tune their outcomes based on responses to bodily factors like temperature, pH, and ion concentration or external factors like magnetism, light, and conductivity. Applications in soft and hard tissue engineering, 4D printing, and scaffold design are also discussed. The advanced application of microfluidics, like organ-on-a-chip models, extensively benefits from the intrinsic smart properties of biomaterials, which are also discussed below. The review further elaborates on how smart biomaterial engineering could revolutionize biosensor applications, thereby improving patient care quality. We delineate the limitations and key challenges associated with biomaterials, providing insights into the path forward and outlining future directions for developing next-generation biomaterials that will facilitate clinical translation.},

Recent advancements in both direct and indirect 3D bioprinting offer promising solutions to construct complex vascular networks by allowing precise control over cell and extracellular matrix placement. The process from shape printing of microvasculature to function formation involves dynamic shift of bioink mechanical properties, mechanical microenvironments, and mechanobiology of endothelial and supporting cells. This review explores how biomechanical and mechanobiological principles are integrated into the bioprinting process to develop functional microvascular networks. Before printing, a top-level design approach based on these principles focuses on the interactions among biomaterials, cell behaviors, and mechanical environments to guide microvascular network fabrication. During printing, biomechanical design of bioinks for different bioprinting techniques, along with optimized biomechanical factors of bioprinting process, ensures accurate microvascular structure reproduction while maintaining cell viability. After printing, the emphasis is on creating a suitable mechanical environment to modulate the mechanobiology of multiple steps of neovascularization, including initiation, morphogenesis, lumen formation, stabilization, and maturation of functional microvasculature. Finally, we discuss future developments based on biomechanical and mechanobiological design to drive the bioprinting of functionalized microvascular networks.},

  abstract     = {The advent of artificial intelligence—deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular—has transformed traditional research methods across many disciplines. DNNs are data driven systems that use large quantities of data to learn patterns that are fundamental to a process. In the realm of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs), a common goal is to discover the connection between the AEM's geometry and material properties to predict the resulting scattered electromagnetic fields. To achieve this goal, DNNs usually utilize computational electromagnetic simulations to act as ground truth data for the training process, and numerous successful results have been shown. Although DNNs have many demonstrated successes, they are limited by their requirement for large quantities of data and their lack of interpretability. The latter results because DNNs are black-box models, and therefore, it is unknown how or why they work. A promising approach which may help to mitigate the aforementioned limitations is to use physics to guide the development and operation of DNNs. Indeed, this physics-informed learning (PHIL) approach has seen rapid development in the last few years with some success in addressing limitations of conventional DNNs. We overview the field of PHIL and discuss the benefits of incorporating knowledge into the deep learning process and introduce a taxonomy that enables us to categorize various types of approaches. We also summarize deep learning principles which are critical to PHIL understanding and the Appendix covers some of the physics of AEMs. A few specific PHIL works are highlighted and serve as examples of various approaches. Finally, we provide an outlook detailing where the field is currently and what we can expect in the future.},

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing energy demand has highlighted the need for sustainable, low-carbon, and multi-functional energy solutions. Recently, multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) has become an emerging processing approach to prototype energy storage and conversion devices by enabling the fabrication of complex systems in a single, streamlined process while offering design freedom to customize end-product properties at precise, user-defined patterns and geometries. Moreover, it provides opportunities to fine-tune interfaces and material compositions at the microscale, opening new avenues for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. As MMAM is still in its early stages, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between material chemistry, processing methods, and device design is fundamental to fully realize its potential for developing high-performance energy materials. This review proposes a framework to bridge the gaps between the fundamental principles of processing physics and the practical implementation of various MMAM techniques in fabricating advanced energy storage and conversion devices, highlighting research challenges and future opportunities.},

  abstract     = {While the development of new solid electrolytes (SEs) is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies, revisiting existing materials with significantly improved knowledge of their physical properties and synthesis control offers significant opportunities for breakthroughs. Na 1+ x Zr 2 Si x P 3− x O 12 (NaSICON) SEs have recently regained attention for applications in both solid-state and aqueous redox flow batteries due to their improved electrochemical and mechanical properties, along with their inherent electrochemical stability, air robustness, and low manufacturing cost. Recent improvements in NaSICON have primarily targeted macroscopic property enhancements and synthesis techniques. To enable further breakthroughs in the performance of NaSICON SEs, future efforts should focus on understanding how modified synthesis conditions influence atomic and microscopic-scale features, such as conduction channels, electronic structures, phase distributions, and grain boundaries. These features ultimately control ion conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability of NaSICON and its interfaces. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure-chemistry-property relationships of NaSICON SEs, focusing on atomic and microscopic levels. First, we introduce the proposed ionic conduction mechanisms in NaSICON crystallites. Then, we explore experimental investigations at phase and grain boundaries to assess ionic conduction and interfacial stability. We also examine strategies to address interfacial challenges such as high resistance and chemical reactions between SEs and electrodes, highlighting the difficulties in analyzing interfaces at the nano/atomic scale. Finally, we provide an outlook on advancing microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to enhance insights into NaSICON SEs ionic conduction and interfacial stability, supporting the development of improved long-duration energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear energy emerges as a promising and environmentally friendly solution to counter the escalating levels of greenhouse gases resulting from excessive fossil fuel usage. Essential to harnessing this energy are nuclear batteries, devices designed to generate electric power by capturing the energy emitted during nuclear decay, including α or β particles and γ radiation. The allure of nuclear batteries lies in their potential for extended lifespan, high energy density, and adaptability in harsh environments where refueling or battery replacement may not be feasible. In this review, we narrow our focus to nuclear batteries utilizing non-thermal converters such as α- or β-voltaics, as well as those employing scintillation intermediates. Recent advancements in state-of-the-art direct radiation detectors and scintillators based on metal perovskite halides (MPHs) and chalcogenides (MCs) are compared to traditional detectors based on silicon and III-V materials, and scintillators based on inorganic lanthanide crystals. Notable achievements in MPH and MC detectors and scintillators, such as nano-Gy sensitivity, 100 photons/keV light yield, and radiation hardness, are highlighted. Additionally, limitations including energy conversion efficiency, power density, and shelf-life due to radiation damage in detectors and scintillators are discussed. Leveraging novel MPH and MC materials has the potential to propel nuclear batteries from their current size and power limitations to miniaturization, heightened efficiency, and increased power density. Furthermore, exploring niche applications for nuclear batteries beyond wireless sensors, low-power electronics, oil well monitoring, and medical fields presents enticing opportunities for future research and development.},

Thus, engineering magnetic order in materials such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism holds great scientific and technological interest. Defects such as vacancies, interstitials, and dopants induce local perturbations within the crystal lattice. These perturbations locally disturb the entire symmetry of crystals, resulting in symmetry breaking. Oxides, in particular, exhibit intriguing properties when subjected to defects, which can lead to significant modifications in their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Such defects in non-magnetic oxides can induce magnetic symmetry breaking, leading to the formation of emergent magnetic domains and orderings. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in magnetic breaking symmetries in materials via defect engineering and present our perspectives on how these may lead to new understanding and applications.},

Diamond, Ga 2 O 3 , GaN, and SiC are typical WBS materials. Reliability studies for these four materials and devices are crucial for WBS applications. Traditional means of reliability studies include, but are not limited to, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy et al. However, most of these methods are ex situ studies after material or device failure and thus have some limitations. In situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) is a favorable technology to observe the degradation and failure process of materials and devices in real time, which may provide effective guidance in material growth, device structure design, device process optimization, and reliability improvement.

As a result, a wide variety of PDs on planar substrates have been reported using various light sensitive materials and traditional micro-/nano-fabrication technologies. In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing PDs with flexible form factors and using eco-friendly materials and approaches. These efforts have resulted in exploration of degradable materials and printed electronics as a resource-efficient route for manufacturing and to contain end-of-life issues. This paper reviews such new advances, particularly focusing on flexible PDs based on inorganic (e.g., crystalline silicon, compound semiconductors, metal oxides, etc.) semiconductor nanostructures [e.g., Nanowires (NWs), Nanoribbons (NRs), etc.]. The advantages and disadvantages of various bottom-up and top-down methods explored to realize the nanostructures and the wet (solution-processable) and dry printing and assembly methods to print the nanostructures on flexible substrates, are discussed along with their suitability for various applications. This discussion is supported by a comparative analysis of printed PDs in terms of key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, I Light /I Dark ratio, response speed, and external quantum efficiency. This comprehensive discussion is expected to benefit researchers and practitioners from academia and industry interested in the field of printed and flexible PDs.},

Conventionally, thermal conduction is regulated through heat-carrying acoustic phonon manipulation due to their high group velocities, which are widely utilized in materials such as thermal coatings and thermoelectrics. In recent years, with advancements in thermal transport, optical phonons have been of great interest for tuning thermal conduction, with a particular focus on those with special dispersive behaviors; however, the microscopic mechanisms are significantly different. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of optical phonons, especially those with high weights on thermal conduction in advanced materials, as well as discuss the fundamental mechanisms, including (i) phonon bandwidth, (ii) phonon gap, (iii) avoided-crossing, (iv) phonon nesting/twinning, (v) optical-acoustic phonon bunching, and (vi) multiple optical phonons.},

  abstract     = {Quantum states of light, such as fixed photon number (Fock) states, entangled states, and squeezed states, offer important advantages with respect to classical states of light, such as coherent states and thermal states, in different areas: they enable secure communication and distribution of encryption keys, enable realization of sensors with higher sensitivity and resolution, and are considered candidates for quantum computing and simulation applications. To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.},

This review gives an introduction to the three-wave-mixing processes lying at the core of this approach and illustrates, on basis of the underlying quantum-mechanical description, how they can artificially be manipulated to engineer the corresponding photon characteristics. It then describes how this technique can be employed to realize a number of very different objectives, which are expected to find application across the full range of photonic quantum technologies, and presents a summary of the research done toward these ends to date.},

  abstract     = {Diaper dermatitis and associated infections are common problems that often afflict diaper wearers. These problems will become more prevalent in the future, as our population ages and more people need to wear diapers. An urgent solution is therefore needed to address these problems. Smart diapers have recently attracted much attention for their potential to significantly reduce the occurrence of diaper dermatitis and skin infections, by enabling timely change of soiled diapers via instant notification. Over the past decade, research has focused on the development of wearable technologies that facilitate the progress and commercialization of smart diaper products. Herein, we review the state-of-the-art development of smart diapers and alert systems, including sensing technologies, wireless communication protocols, and data processing strategies, as well as the extension of their capabilities from wetness monitoring to biomarker detection. Their advantages, drawbacks, and overall suitability for different groups of wearers are evaluated. We conclude by discussing the challenges, future research directions, and the potential use of smart diapers in the early diagnosis of diseases.},

Theoretical modeling methodologies, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), efficiently assess electrochemical reaction mechanisms and electrocatalyst performance at atomic and molecular levels. However, its intrinsic algorithm limitations and high computational costs for large-scale systems generate gaps between experimental observations and calculation simulation, restricting the accuracy and efficiency of electrocatalyst design. Combining machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy to accelerate the development of electrocatalysts. The ML-DFT frameworks establish accurate property–structure–performance relations to predict and verify novel electrocatalysts' properties and performance, providing a deep understanding of reaction mechanisms. The ML-based methods also accelerate the solution of MD and DFT. Moreover, integrating ML and experiment characterization techniques represents a cutting-edge approach to providing insights into the structural, electronic, and chemical changes under working conditions. This review will summarize the DFT development and the current ML application status for electrocatalyst design in various electrochemical energy conversions. The underlying physical fundaments, application advancements, and challenges will be summarized.

So, to realize these devices, an extensive study, from fundamental physics to practical applications, becomes essential. In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection, stability, statics, and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions, henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved via two mechanisms: the magnetoresistive tunnel junction TMR effect and topological resistivity. So, a thorough investigation into the skyrmion Hall effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided, concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic computing, including a model of a skyrmion-based SNN architecture achieving over 90% accuracy on MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets. Furthermore, we outline the potential of skyrmion-hosting Majorana zero modes in emerging topological quantum computation and helicity-dependent skyrmion qubits.},

  abstract     = {Solar fuel production through water splitting and CO 2 reduction by employing photocatalytic materials is a paradigm track to present renewable energy sources and lessen global warming. Among these materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated in CO 2 reduction and water splitting to produce chemical fuels. However, pure LDHs suffer from sluggish charge-carrier transport, a great electron–hole recombination rate as well as tend to cause agglomeration. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, numerous modification techniques have been considerably explored to enhance the potential of LDHs toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction. Therefore, this article presents a thorough review of developments made for the construction and modification of LDH photocatalyst properties aiming to enhance water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The review starts with the techniques adopted to synthesize LDH-based structures toward enhanced structure and morphology. The key semiconducting, optical, and electronic properties are studied to understand the conduct of LDH materials toward excellent photocatalytic material. The study then deliberates the techniques such as morphological engineering, hybridization with conducting and semiconducting materials, vacancy creation and defect engineering, components tuning, photothermal catalysis, heterojunction, and heterostructural engineering employed for the enrichment of photocatalytic properties. The study also discusses the steps taken to enhance the adsorption of LDHs and coupling of computational and operando techniques toward semiconducting, structural, and optical properties to investigate the best-performing photocatalysts. The study also reviews the recent advancements of LDH for applications toward water splitting and CO 2 conversion.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising cancer biomarkers due to their encapsulation of molecular signals reflective of originating tumor cells. Conventional analytical methods often fall short in comprehensive EV molecular profiling, necessitating innovative approaches for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. This review focuses on the utilization of nanoplasmonic structures for optical signal detection of EVs, exploring advancements, challenges, and future prospects toward single EV molecular profiling. Nanoplasmonic structures offer enhanced optical readout capabilities, leveraging light iridescence, and plasmonic amplification suitable for the size range and complexity of the EVs. We delve into the research and implications of on-chip methods, shedding light on EVs' role in health and disease. Despite notable progress, opportunities still exist to further develop nanoplasmonic arrays, customizing them for bioanalytes of interest, crucial for both label-free and labeled techniques to attain the objectives of their EV profiling. One such example is the use of specific antibodies for surface functionalization in nanoplasmonic arrays. Other approaches involve tailoring the design of platforms to the physical properties of target EVs, thereby enhancing characterization capabilities. The subsequent sections will cover a curated selection of relevant studies. We later discuss EV analysis through plasmonic nanoarrays in clinical sample scenarios. While patterning methods, such as colloidal self-assembly and e-beam lithography, enable integration with microfluidic systems, facilitating future investigations, few technologies have entered clinical trials. This roadblock highlights the need for further development of cost-effective, detailed molecular profiling methods. Moreover, we discuss avenues like single EV profiling and machine learning to address challenges related to heterogeneity of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Finally, we discuss future opportunities in developing nanoplasmonic-assisted EV profiling and studied their driving advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic realms, such as customizable nanoplasmonic structures coupled with artificial intelligence analysis modules, as a path forward for precise EV molecular profiling, which may enable personalized therapeutic interventions.},

Lower olefins (C 2–4 = ) are widely used as fundamental components in everyday products such as detergents, lubricants, plastic, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetic additives.

The presence of two novel functionalities, i.e., direct and converse ME couplings, makes them ideal candidates for multifunctional devices such as energy harvesters, magnetic field sensors, ME random access memories, and ME antennas. In these ME composites, ME coupling is strongly dependent on the superior physical properties of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Therefore, magnetostrictive materials with excellent piezomagnetic coefficients and piezoelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric coefficients are required to achieve a large ME coupling. Among the various piezoelectric materials, ferroelectric relaxor-PbTiO 3 (PT) single crystals have been used extensively as piezoelectric constituents because of their ultrahigh piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Furthermore, the domain structure and crystal orientation of the relaxor-PT single crystals exhibit extraordinarily large piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Owing to these multifunctional properties, relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites have been widely used for studying direct and converse ME couplings in ME composites in recent years. Relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites show excellent ME coupling, e.g., the highest ME voltage coefficient, equivalent magnetic noise, and output power of 7000 V cm − 1 Oe − 1 @ 23.23 kHz, 6 pT/√Hz @1 Hz, and 19 mW @ 60 Hz, respectively, which are one of the best-reported values in ME composites so far.

An example of such applications in the energy sector is thermal energy storage using phase change materials. In such systems, and indeed in many other thermal systems, an emerging and promising approach involves the use of nanoparticles, which have been extensively studied for their potential to enhance the performance of thermal systems. However, conducting thermodynamic analyses of thermal systems in the presence of nanoparticles proves to be complex and resource-consuming because of the involvement of many parameters, including (i) temperature, molecular structure, and composition of the host fluid in which nanoparticles are either dispersed or in physical contact; (ii) nanoparticle morphology, size, type, and concentration; and (iii) complex interactions between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. This article reviews recent studies on the role of nanoparticles in phase transition processes such as freezing, melting, boiling, evaporation, and condensation. It begins with an overview of phase transition phenomena without nanoparticles, emphasizing the most important controlling parameters, and then examines the underlying physics of nanoparticle-involved phase transitions, critically examining their impact on process speed (transport rates). The article also explores physical phenomena, such as Brownian motion, thermophoresis, microconvection, and nanoparticle agglomeration, and considers their contribution to rate control (enhancement or reduction).

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing (AM) promise unequaled opportunities for simulating fluid behavior, precisely tracking individual droplets, and exploring innovative device designs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in applying AI and AM to droplet microfluidics. The basic physical properties of multiphase flows and mechanisms for droplet production are discussed, and the current fabrication methods of related devices are introduced, together with their applications. Delving into the use of AI and AM technologies in droplet microfluidics, topics covered include AI-assisted simulations of droplet behavior, real-time tracking of droplets within microfluidic systems, and AM-fabrication of three-dimensional systems. The synergistic combination of AI and AM is expected to deepen the understanding of complex fluid dynamics and active matter behavior, expediting the transition toward fully digital microfluidic systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrokinetic energy harvesting (EKEH) has emerged as a promising renewable and carbon-neutral energy source for small and large-scale applications, reducing the reliance on conventional fossil fuels and providing innovative solutions for remote, off-grid applications. The underlying mechanism of EKEH relies on the movement of dissolved electrolytes over charged fluid–solid interfaces through confinements resulting in the generation of useful power. The low energy conversion efficiency typically observed in larger (micrometer) confinements can be substantially mitigated by shifting to nanometer and sub-nanometer regimes. This down-scaling unlocks high selectivity and provides unique opportunities to potentially harness Angstrom-scale interactions to maintain and elevate fluid permeability. However, EKEH at sub-nanometric scales remains fraught with considerable challenges in fabrication, economic viability, scaling of power, and maintenance, significantly impeding its advancement. In this review, we detail the electrokinetic processes that drive energy conversion in the presence of pressure, concentration, and temperature gradients. We examine the key factors affecting conversion efficiency and explore the innovative solutions in the recent literature addressing associated challenges. Additionally, we highlight the role of novel nanomaterials and specialized geometries along with new fabrication techniques that enable high permeation without sacrificing selectivity in nanometer and sub-nanometer confinements. Finally, we delve into the major obstacles that EKEH currently faces to reach its full potential of extracting clean and affordable energy and conclude by offering insight into future developmental directions and potential breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract     = {Nominally pure silica or amorphous SiO 2 is an important material in modern electronics, as well as other fields of science. Normally, it has been utilized for its insulation properties, for example, in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. However, it also can be considered as a wide bandgap semiconductor possessing very large electrical resistivity. The conductivity of various silica films has been studied since the mid-nineteenth century, usually assuming the presence of ionic conductivity. However, in the sense of a wide bandgap semiconductor, the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which ranges over more than four orders of magnitude, can be accurately explained by normal semiconductor behavior under the presumed presence of a deep electron trap/donor residing ∼2.3 eV below the conduction band edge. That is, the conductance is determined by electron motion and not by ions. Experiments have studied the transport of injected electrons (and holes) which are consistent with this viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {The omnipresence of polarized light on the surface of the earth, a result of atmospheric scattering, underscores the significance of detecting this light and extracting valuable information regarding the phase and polarization angle. In recent years, there has been a surge in research on polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials. The essence of these 2D polarization-sensitive photodetectors is rooted in the anisotropic characteristics that arise from the asymmetric crystal lattice of the 2D materials in question. This anisotropy is manifested in both optical and electrical behaviors due to the asymmetrical nature of the crystal structure. This article systematically categorizes anisotropic 2D materials and offers an insightful overview of their crystal structures. It also introduces various optical and electrical characterization techniques designed to elucidate the anisotropic properties of these materials. The focus of the article then shifts to detailing the current state of research in the realm of anisotropic 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. It provides a comprehensive description of the working principles behind polarization-sensitive photodetectors with different structural designs, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that enable their polarization sensitivity. In conclusion, the article summarizes the findings of this review, highlighting the advancements and challenges in the field. Additionally, this review proposes several forward-looking recommendations to guide the future trajectory of research and development in the domain of 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors.},
