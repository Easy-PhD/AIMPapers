  abstract     = {The glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays important physiological roles in the nervous system. Its malfunction is related to neurological disorders, including startle disease (hyperekplexia), which is characterized by exaggerated startle responses to sudden unexpected stimuli, such as noise or touch. Here, we unravel the molecular mechanisms of action of a specific mutation that is linked to startle disease: Asn46Lys (N46K). This residue, in the GlyR extracellular domain, is not directly involved in neurotransmitter binding but can disrupt the neurotransmitter pathway. To understand how, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutated extracellular domain of a homomeric α 1 GlyR, assessing the effects of the Asn46Lys mutation. We then sampled multiple unbinding and binding events by means of metadynamics simulations, with a funnel restraint to limit the exploration in the solvent. By evaluating the binding free energy landscape, we observed a substantial reduction in neurotransmitter binding affinity, which is consistent with experiments. We suggest that such a reduction is linked to the interaction of its crucial glutamic acid residue with the lysine mutation competing with the glycine ligand.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage to wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in two bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that ROS primarily induce structural damage through dehydrogenation reactions and the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds. Notably, the teichoic acid (TA) from S. aureus was found to be more susceptible to damage compared to that of S. pneumoniae , which exhibited stronger antioxidant properties due to its ring structure and chemical modifications. The efficiency of damage increased with ROS concentration, following the order, O > O 3 > OH, with a maximum of 22.22% C–C bond cleavage observed at the highest concentration. In addition, the patterns of damage in the TA of these two bacterial species were significantly different. In S. aureus , WTA damage was predominantly characterized by C–C and C–O bond cleavage in the repeating units, whereas LTA damage was primarily due to the cleavage of C–C bonds in the ring structure. In S. pneumoniae , damage to both WTA and LTA mainly occurred at the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) ring structure and the poly (RboP) site. This study offers new insights into the sterilizing effects of plasma.},

  abstract     = {Silver ions (Ag + ) are known to interact with DNA through nonspecific and specific mechanisms, inducing conformational and mechanical changes in the double helix. In this study, we investigate how varying Ag + concentrations affect the mechanical properties of DNA, in particular, contour length, persistence length, end-to-end distance, and area of occupation, using atomic force microscopy. At low Ag + concentrations, we observe localized stiffening and shortening of DNA molecules, which we attribute to the formation of monoadducts and biadducts with specific DNA bases. These interactions promote the emergence of secondary structures that contribute to DNA compaction and a reduction in contour length. At intermediate concentrations, accumulation of torsional stress and the formation of multiple metal-mediated contacts lead to a global conformational collapse, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the effective persistence length. At the highest Ag + concentration tested (1.5 mM), the uniform distribution of molecular area suggests a widespread structural collapse of DNA. These findings support previous reports of Ag + -induced DNA condensation and reveal a progressive structural transition from extended to globular conformations. The observed behavior provides insights into the biophysical consequences of metal–DNA interactions and may have implications for understanding the molecular basis of the antimicrobial activity of silver ions.},

Despite the absence of surface charge on the (non-polarizable) channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. In addition, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. Here, however, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena in uncharged tapered nanoslits, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.},

In response, surface-grafted polymers undergo a transition from an isotropic brush-layer in a good solvent to heterogeneous patches in CNS. To quantitatively describe this transition, we use the surface coverage θ as an additional order parameter and develop a theoretical model for its calculation, which is compared with the simulations. By further examining θ as a function of CNS concentration, we observe that PDNPs exhibit a collapse-reentry process similar to planar brushes, but with richer details of the two-step reentry behavior: angular isotropy recovery followed by radial expansion. We investigate how this CNS-induced collapse transition influences the reversible adsorption/exclusion of cargo nanoparticles on PDNPs, depending on the size of the cargo and the concentration of the cosolvent.},

  abstract     = {The generalized Langevin equation provides a powerful framework for modeling and interpreting the conformational dynamics of (macro)molecules in solution. However, recent studies have shown that the standard fluctuation–dissipation relation—linking the memory kernel to the statistics of the random force—can include a non-zero cross correlation term between conservative and random forces. This raises questions about how to correctly extract memory kernels from simulation data when this correlation is neglected and whether inverting the Volterra equation to obtain a memory kernel yields a physically meaningful result. In a recent work [Wolf et al. J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 054113 (2025)], we proposed an approximation to account for the cross correlation term. We demonstrate in this work that cross correlations play a significant role in the collapse transition of a hydrophobic polymer under various solvent conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation yields an improved description of barrier crossing times. Notably, we find that this improvement has the same magnitude as the improvement gained by accounting for memory effects.},

The electronic density of states analysis revealed localized states near the Fermi level, with functional groups contributing predominantly to states below the Fermi level, while carbon atoms in non-hexagonal rings contributed mainly to states above it. The functionalization of graphene induces charge localization, while ring disorder disrupts the continuous flow of electrons. By projecting the electronic conductivity along specific spatial directions, we find that both the crystal orientation and the graphene purity significantly influence the anisotropy and magnitude of electronic transport in the composites.

One of the advantages of the present method is that it is applicable to deeply cooled and heavily compressed states where a CO 2 hydrate is formed. The experimental solubility curve against temperature is successfully recovered with an appropriate correction for the self-polarization energy implicitly embedded in the pairwise additive interaction model for water. The solubility of water in liquid CO 2 coexisting with an aqueous solution decreases upon cooling. It is found that the intervening hydrate steadily reduces the solubility of water compared to that assumed to be in direct contact with the aqueous phase. The significant decrease results from the decrease in the chemical potential of water in the hydrate, relocating the boundary from the water/hydrate to the hydrate/fluid. Liquid CO 2 loses its capacity to retain water upon cooling more seriously than that anticipated from the water/fluid boundary, and an excessive amount of water is precipitated into hydrate at low temperatures. The thermodynamic properties thus calculated provide valuable information on problems in the massive transport of CO 2 , specifically the blockage of pipelines and corrosion of vessels.},

  abstract     = {Modeling ionic activity is essential for understanding ion-specific effects in environmental and industrial systems. The microscopic interactions of heavy metal salts in aqueous solutions become increasingly complex with rising salt molality, posing significant challenges for accurately modeling ionic activity. This study applies, for the first time, an electrolyte version of the cubic-plus-association equation of state to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficients of several heavy metal salts in water at 298.15 K. Experimental data for four types of salts—nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc salts—were compiled, and the ion–water binary interaction parameters are regressed from these measurements. The model successfully predicts water activity, osmotic coefficients, and mean ionic activity coefficients across most systems. Without explicit incorporation of ionic association, the average calculation relative average deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for nickel and cobalt salts is 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, extending the applicable molality range up to 5.0 mol/kg water and 5.5 mol/kg water. For solutions of cadmium salts and zinc salts that have been confirmed to contain ion pairs, ion association was introduced into the model for calculation. The calculation results indicate that the consideration of ion association has significantly reduced the calculation deviations. Within the calculated salt molality ranges, the average relative deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for cadmium salts is all below 2.0%, while that for zinc salts is all less than 5.5%, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the micro-level factors influencing activity coefficients and offers recommendations for improving model accuracy under complex conditions.},

We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods.

We find that increasing gold content weakens CO and O adsorption and limits oxygen-induced structural changes, while copper-rich particles undergo pronounced oxidation and reconstruction. Bader charge analysis shows that, in bare nanoalloys, Au withdraws electron density from Cu due to their electronegativity difference. In oxidized Cu–Au nanoalloys, the charge on Cu atoms depends on the number of O neighbors and can reach values typical of Cu 2 O (0.6 e ) and CuO (1.1 e ). On average, the Cu atoms exhibit positive effective Bader charges of ∼0.9 e in these nanoalloys. Our results indicate that models of Cu–Au catalysts under oxidizing conditions must incorporate the full ensemble of metallic and oxidized configurations rather than a single most probable structure to predict true catalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {We report the fragmentation dynamics of multiply charged molecular ions of NO under the impact of highly charged Ar 8+ ions in the intermediate velocity (v p ≈ 1 a.u.) range. Coincidence measurements of ionic fragments from NO q+ (2 ≤ q ≤ 7) were performed utilizing the three-dimensional momentum imaging technique of a recoil-ion momentum spectrometer equipped with a time- and position-sensitive detector and a multi-hit data acquisition system. With a 1.6 MeV Ar 8+ beam, we observed a total of 13 fragmentation channels. Coulomb breakup of the unstable parent molecular ion shows a clear preference for the symmetric charge breakup over the asymmetric one. We have measured the Kinetic Energy Release Distributions (KERDs) for various fragmentation channels. We have also generated the potential energy curves for NO q+ molecular ions using the internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction approach with complete active space self-consistent field wave functions. The obtained KERDs are compared and discussed in the background of the ab initio potential energy curves as well as the simple Coulomb explosion model.},

  abstract     = {4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is a widely utilized DNA sensor, renowned for its strong affinity for the AT minor groove. Despite its essential role as a fluorescent probe in molecular biology and biomedical research, the origins of DAPI’s intrinsic fluorescence and the mechanisms behind its fluorescence enhancement upon DNA sensing remain unresolved. This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fluorescence dynamics of DAPI, both in solution and when bound to detect the AT minor groove of a self-complementary dodecamer duplex DNA. We employed an integrated approach combining femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence, transient absorption, and supported by theoretical calculations. The results reveal an unprecedented ultrafast inter-solute–solvent three-state excited-state proton transfer pathway, which clarifies the root cause of low fluorescence yield and fluorescence dynamics of free form DAPI in aqueous solution. Irrespective of the structural heterogeneity and rotamer conformation of the ground state of DAPI, this involves deprotonation of the excited state at a rate of ∼2.4 ps, followed by proton reuptake by the resulting weakly emissive deprotonated state, leading to direct reformation of DAPI’s ground state at 139 ps. Binding to the DNA minor groove completely inhibits this proton transfer, accounting for the significant fluorescence enhancement observed in the DAPI-DNA complex. Furthermore, the broadband capacity of our time-resolved fluorescence approach enables, for the first time, direct tracking of the fluorescence dynamic Stokes shift of minor groove-bound DAPI, revealing significant dispersive collective solvation dynamics specific to the sensing site. These findings provide valuable insights into how microenvironments dictate DAPI fluorescence dynamics and may assist in the strategic design of light-up sensors for recognizing interior hydration dynamics and local residue motions of DNA.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory’s validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.},

Coarse-grained models for such systems are instrumental in identifying metastable states, providing an effective description of their dynamics, and estimating transition rates. We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning of collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship [F. Legoll and T. Lelievre, Nonlinearity 23 , 2131–2163 (2010)]. The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.},

The multistate behavior of methyl-substitution makes the situation complex; for example, being mono-methylated, di-methylated, or tri-methylated. As a pivotal epigenetic marker, understanding its thermodynamic impact on protein-protein binding is crucial for the elucidation of the regulation mechanism of epigenetic modifications on target genes. To this aim, in this work, we present a cost-effective free energy technique named computational (de)methylation scanning with generalized Born and interaction entropy (dMSGB-IE). Our regime is built on implicit-solvent-based end-point free energy techniques and provides an efficient route to access the (de)methylation-induced affinity change with a screening power comparable to costlier alchemical free energy calculations. We first use a batch of histone-reader recognition protein-protein complexes as illustrative cases, showing the capabilities and reliabilities of dMSGB-IE. Then, we augment the method with the integrative structure prediction tool AlphaFold 3, providing a fully computational workflow for fast estimation of (de)methylation free energies. Based on a batch of testing systems, we validate the practical applicability and highlight the predictive power of the promising integrative modeling workflow.},

Polydispersity of the fluid and strong coupling of rotational and translational motions of the rods are two of the various hurdles in interpreting experimental results in complex fluid environments. Furthermore, the influence of volume fraction, ϕ , and absolute free volume, V free , which changes inherently with δ , on the dynamics is not adequately discussed in the literature. Thus, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the rods under two conditions: (i) constant pressure (in which ϕ changes with δ ) and (ii) constant ϕ . Under constant pressure, it is observed that the rotational relaxation time and, hence, the rotational diffusion constant, D R , vary with rod length, l , as D R ∼ l − α , where the value of exponent α increases from ∼3.0 to 3.2 while varying δ from 0% to 40%. It is observed that the effect of increasing ϕ dominates over the effect of increasing V free . Moreover, hydrodynamic interactions among beads within a rod contribute minimally to rotational dynamics, although partial hydrodynamic screening is observed for center-of-mass motion. Meanwhile, for fixed ϕ systems, increasing δ results in increasing V free and thus enhances tracer diffusion, a trend opposite to that observed under constant pressure.},

  abstract     = {We investigate, using Langevin dynamics simulations, the Rouse-type dynamics of active harmonic bead-spring percolation clusters of square and triangular lattices. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as a random telegraph process with correlation time τ , are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual nodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile forces act between pairs of nodes. For force monopoles, a dynamical steady state is reached where the network is dynamically swollen and the mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior at t > τ , MSD ∼ t ν , with ν = 1 − d s 2 where d s is the spectral dimension, in accord with a previously advanced general analytic theory. In contrast, dipolar forces require diverging times to reach steady state and lead to network shrinkage. Within a quasi-steady-state approximation, the MSD is found to saturate at the same temporal regime t > τ , which is followed by ballistic-like and/or diffusive behaviors. We further extend our study of dipolar forces to dilution regimes above the isostatic threshold, also known as “rigidity percolation”. Here, weak dipolar forces effectively do not shrink the network in steady state. Instead, they induce “rotational swimming” of the network. Yet, for the triangular lattice, an incipient discontinuous collapse transition occurs above a critical force amplitude value. Conversely, we find a continuous crossover to a collapsed state for the non-diluted square lattice, resulting from its marginal stability. We suggest that disordered solids be poised above the isostatic point to be stable against active dipolar forces, provided that the dynamical persistent length remains lower than the spring rest length.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen reduction of Fe 3 O 4 plays a pivotal role in sustainable steelmaking, offering a low-carbon alternative to traditional carbothermic processes. In this study, we employ density functional theory to investigate the dissociative adsorption of molecular H 2 and the subsequent adsorption behavior of atomic H on Fe 3 O 4 (110) surfaces, considering both stoichiometric and O-deficient configurations. Our results reveal that the type and location of O vacancies critically influence both the thermodynamics and kinetics of H 2 activation. Compared to the perfect surface, the presence of O vacancies increases the activation barrier for H 2 dissociation. Twofold coordinated O sites, which are thermodynamically more favorable to form, reduce the reaction exothermicity. Conversely, threefold coordinated O vacancies, though less readily formed, stabilize the dissociated state more strongly but incur the highest activation barrier. For atomic H adsorption, adsorption is strongly favored at O sites over Fe, particularly at hollow sites adjacent to twofold O ions. While O vacancies themselves are not favorable adsorption sites, they alter the local electronic environment and change the H binding strength. Bonding strength, quantified via the integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, shows a strong linear correlation with H adsorption energies across all surface types. This correlation underscores the critical role of H–O orbital hybridization in stabilizing adsorbed H species and provides a quantitative link between adsorption strength and the underlying surface–adsorbate bonding characteristics. Our results offer atomic-level insights into defect-mediated H 2 activation and H adsorption on Fe 3 O 4 , with implications for advancing hydrogen-based processes in steel production, hydrogen storage, and heterogeneous catalysis.},

Dodecylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10) was introduced as a surfactant to enhance the wettability of the Bi2212 sol on the single-crystal substrate, leveraging its excellent miscibility with the sol. The influence of OP-10 modification was examined on both the substrate wettability and the key properties of Bi2212 films, including crystallinity, texture, surface morphology, and superconducting performance. The results demonstrate that OP-10 modification significantly improves the wettability of the Bi2212 sol on SrTiO 3 (100) single-crystal substrates. Consequently, Bi2212 superconducting films with smooth, continuous surfaces and (00 l ) epitaxial growth were successfully achieved on SrTiO 3 (100) substrates.

  abstract     = {Atomic-scale quantum conductance switches based on metallic quantum point contacts allow controlled binary switching of the electrical current between a conducting “on state” and a non-conducting “off state” via an independent gate electrode. Although silver-based quantum switches operate via electrochemical conductance modulation, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework to investigate nitrate anion adsorption on Ag(100), Ag(111), and Ag(511) surfaces under varying electrochemical potentials. The stable configurations of nitrate adsorption on the electrode surfaces as a function of electrode potential are determined using the grand canonical approach within the CHE framework, revealing the surface reconstruction of Ag(511) analogous to the formation of nascent Ag–NO 3 complexes. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the critical phase transition occurs in agreement with the experimental switching threshold. Electronic structure calculations reveal metallic to semiconducting transitions in the reconstructed Ag–NO 3 complex layers, elucidating the mechanism of conductance modulation. The “off state” corresponds to insulating Ag–NO 3 surface complexes, while the “on state” arises from metallic Ag–Ag bridging at lower nitrate coverage under lower control voltage. This study establishes a general framework for anion-mediated quantum switching in transition metals and provides a design for nanoscale electrochemical devices.},

Here, we investigate the pressure-induced structural transitions of the diamond (100) surface using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the volume-Constant Pressure Molecular Dynamics method for finite systems. Eight possible dimerized configurations were identified through an exhaustive method, considering both translational and rotational symmetries, which in turn define eight diamond (100) surfaces. These surfaces are nearly degenerate in energy at zero pressure, but their energy differences become larger under high external pressure. At finite temperatures, the increasing pressure induces graphitization of the surfaces. The transition pressures differ among the various surfaces. By calculating the free energies of the surfaces, we determined the most stable surfaces at various pressures and temperatures and constructed a schematic P–T “phase diagram” to illustrate the stability competition and structural transitions of the surfaces. This study provides a theoretical basis for the efficient utilization of diamond under high pressure and offers insights into the surface properties of materials under extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {2D gallium nitride possesses distinctive electronic states, making it ideal for future optoelectronic devices because of the quantum confinement and enhanced many-body interactions inherent in its atomically thin form. This study explores the impact of molecular doping with Fe(II)-porphyrin (FeP) on these characteristics using first-principle calculations. Contact of the magnetic center Fe with the nitrogen site causes a 17% decrease in the energy barrier for the transition from intermediate spin ( S = 1) to high spin ( S = 2) state, highlighting the sensitivity of spin dynamics to doping sites. Molecular diffusion barriers increase by 9.6 kJ/mol upon spin transition, suggesting that the spin state influences molecular mobility within the material. Exploring spectral functions reveals that FeP doping introduces spin-dependent molecule levels within the bandgap, which may play a role in electron–hole separation and spin injection. In addition, we show that the molecule–substrate coupling lowers the exciton binding energy by 0.1 eV, with further reduction during spin transitions. This weakening is attributed to increased electron mobility, quantified by static polarizability. These results indicate that the molecular spin state can control electronic excitations within substrate materials, presenting a promising strategy for designing spintronic devices.},

The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché–Cahn paper [F. C. Larché and J. W. Cahn, Acta Metall. 21 , 1051–1063 (1973)]. Single-phase crystals in Larché–Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product μN of the number of particles N and their chemical potential μ . Similarly, the grand potential and the product pV of pressure and volume V may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs–Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is recovered by treating the number of lattice sites M as an additional thermodynamic variable. The difference G − μN can be identified with νM where ν is the thermodynamic force conjugate to M . The reinstated Gibbs–Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation under isothermal isobaric conditions. We have worked this out for a uniform one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The coupling between composition and strain is implemented by decomposing pressure in a mechanical component depending on deformed density N / V and an elastic term linear in the volume strain as determined by V / M .

  abstract     = {We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. In addition to amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is the formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases [Hu et al. , Nat. Commun. 6 , 6630 (2015)], and another one is the formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold coordination [Bykova et al. , Nat. Commun. 9 , 4789 (2018)]. Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here, we show that employing metadynamics with Si–O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential [Erhard et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 1927 (2024)], one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions, but the octahedron chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature while, at 600 K, the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.},

In this study, we theoretically design a molecular switch based on a metal-free polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon diradical molecule dominated by strong electron-electron repulsions. By establishing a customized simulation framework that combines density functional theory with the numerical renormalization group method, and with the aid of a side-coupled two-orbital Anderson model, we systematically simulate the quantum transport governed by various kinds of Kondo effects. When the central energy level sweeps upward, the linear conductance tends to reach its unitary limit in the low-temperature regime, driven by the broadening two-stage Kondo effect window. As the side energy increases, a quantum phase transition from the two-stage Kondo effect to the spin-1/2 Kondo effect emerges, resulting in a stable, full conductance plateau. Furthermore, by tuning the exchange coupling between the central and the side orbitals, we simulate the impact of precisely adjusting the intramolecular dihedral angle of the molecule on the transport properties. The linear conductance exhibits a transition from zero to the unitary limit as the molecule smoothly evolves from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic regime. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon systems. Our suggested “ ab initio + model calculation” theoretical framework may offer a promising methodology for exploring the complex Kondo physics in real magnetic nanosystems.},

The present part of this series serves as a prerequisite for the work. The time-dependent rovibrational temperatures of CO were measured during the vibrational excitation process of CO/O 2 /Ar mixtures within the temperature range of 1680–2970 K and pressures of 1.37–2.43 bar to investigate the vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 . The state-to-state (StS) approach was employed in the simulations, where the vibrational energy levels of CO and O 2 are treated as pseudo-species. The datasets of vibrational state-specific reactive and inelastic rate coefficients for CO + O 2 , O 2 + Ar, and CO + O collisions were generated in this paper. The present StS simulations agreed well with the experimental data, whereas the Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfeld (SSH) formula predicted faster CO vibrational temperatures. A sensitivity analysis was then performed and highlighted that the vibration–vibration (V–V) energy transfer between CO and O 2 ( ⁠ τ V − V CO − O 2 ⁠ ) is the key item inducing the discrepancies observed between the SSH results and experimental data. Therefore, a new expression was summarized for calculating τ V − V CO − O 2 based on the present experiments, and it also agreed well with the measured data in the literature at 100–700 K. In addition, the oxidation of CO and the effects of vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 were discussed. Since differences in vibrational temperatures between CO and O 2 were observed during the relaxation process, the refined rate of vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 paves the way for the investigations in Part II.},

  abstract     = {We present a strategy for the quantum control of polyatomic bimolecular reactions using moderately intense, long-pulse laser fields. Bimolecular reactions pose a challenge to quantum control, not encountered in the unimolecular case, due to their complex scattering dynamics and the averaging of their observables over a thermal distribution of reactant states. Our approach bypasses these hurdles; it involves the interaction of a nonresonant, polarized field with the molecular coordinate-dependent polarizability tensor to generate spatially nonuniform Stark shifts of the potential energy surfaces. We focus on the commonly encountered case where the reaction dynamics involve complicating features such as several coupled electronic states, deep potential wells, a high density of vibronic states, and several transition states en route from reactants to products. We consider highly averaged observables, including the canonical and microcanonical rate constants. It is shown that the complexities of polyatomic bimolecular reactions introduce new opportunities for reaction enhancement and control. In particular, the occurrence of one or more potential wells combines with the spatial structure of the polarizability tensor to introduce a vast enhancement that is subject to control by the choice of field parameters. Our results are based on a quantum mechanical theory and ab initio calculations of the potential energy and polarizability tensor. As a model system, we consider the CH ( X 2 Π ) + N 2 ( X Σ g + 1 ) → HCN ( X Σ + 1 ) + N ( S 4 ) reaction, but our results and conclusions are general.},

The experiment has been performed at an incident electron energy of 1270 eV, using a highly sensitive multichannel electron momentum spectrometer with a coverable momentum range up to 9 a.u. The experimental results were compared with the associated theoretical profiles calculated by the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA), the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA), and the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) models, using the relativistic and non-relativistic Kohn–Sham orbitals as the target electron orbitals. The superiority of the DWBA model over not only the PWIA but also the DWIA was found for the whole momentum range up to 9 a.u., demonstrating that the interaction between the projectile and target electrons, as well as the distorted wave effect, plays an important role in explaining the momentum profile of inner-shell ionization. Furthermore, it was experimentally revealed that the branching ratio of the 4d 5/2 and 4d 3/2 ionizations slightly deviates from the value of the non-relativistic ratio and is only weakly dependent upon the momentum over the momenta investigated, indicating that the relativistic effect on the Xe 4d wavefunction is fairly small, as predicted by the theory. These results would provide detailed insight into the relativistic effect on electron distributions and (e, 2e) reaction dynamics for the inner-shell ionization.},

  abstract     = {The use of spectroscopic techniques to resolve the energy level structure of excitonic excited states and to elucidate the interaction mechanisms between excitons in quantum dots is of vital importance for the development and application of such materials. However, various static and dynamic one-dimensional spectroscopic techniques are limited by inhomogeneous broadening effects, making it challenging to directly observe the fine-level energy structure of quantum dots. We developed a 25 kHz shot-to-shot phase-cycling two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy technique to investigate the excitonic energy structure and exciton–exciton interactions in a quantum dot aggregate. Using CdTe/CdSe/ZnS core–shell–shell quantum dots as a model system, we implemented a 36-step phase-cycling scheme to acquire rephasing 2D spectra at zero waiting time under varying excitation powers. In these spectra, both diagonal and off-diagonal features reveal spectral components that are otherwise obscured in one-dimensional spectroscopy due to inhomogeneous broadening. The presence of off-diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra indicates non-negligible interactions between excitons with different transition energies. Power-dependent 2D spectroscopy reveals that, with increasing excitation power, high-energy states exhibit greater resistance to Auger recombination. The experimental method developed in this work may contribute to advancing the theory of excited-state structures and dynamics in quantum dots and other low-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical framework for computing Auger spectra that include spin-orbit interaction is presented. The framework is based on the state-interaction approach using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster wave-functions. The working equations for Auger decay rates are derived within the Feshbach–Fano formalism. The capabilities of the theory are illustrated by the calculation of L-edge Auger spectra of H 2 S and Ar using the Feshbach–Fano and complex basis function (CBF) approaches. The quality of the Feshbach–Fano results depends critically on the treatment of the free-electron state. In contrast to the K-edge spectra for which both plane wave and Coulomb wave treatments yield reasonable results, the Feshbach–Fano calculations yield accurate results for L-edges only when using Coulomb wave (FF-CW). The FF-CW and CBF calculations of Auger spectra in H 2 S and Ar agree well with each other and with the available experimental data. The results highlight the importance of spin–orbit interactions for modeling L-edge Auger spectra.},

  abstract     = {In high-temperature non-equilibrium flows, the traditional Parker rotational relaxation model based on the rigid rotor assumption fails to accurately describe the effects of internal molecular structure on the energy transfer processes, creating a critical bottleneck for precise modeling. This study aims to establish an improved computational framework for rotational relaxation times that incorporates vibrational state-resolved calculations and rovibrational coupling effects to overcome fundamental limitations of existing simplified models. Based on the variable soft sphere molecular model and statistical inelastic cross section theory, an exponential correlation function was introduced to accurately describe transition probabilities between rotational energy levels, establishing a complete state-to-state rotational relaxation time computational model. Through systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, a strict linear relationship between the averaged rotational relaxation time and the model parameter θ ′ was discovered, significantly streamlining the parameter fitting procedure. For N 2 –N 2 , N 2 –N, O 2 –O 2 , and O 2 –O systems, optimal θ ′ values were determined with average relative errors below 0.7% when validated against recent theoretical data. Important computational guidelines were established. The improved model provides theoretically accurate and computationally efficient tools for transport coefficient calculations in hypersonic flow numerical simulations, with significant implications for engineering applications such as atmospheric reentry and interplanetary exploration.},

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics simulations are typically constrained to have a fixed number of particles, which limits our capability to simulate chemical and physical processes where the composition of the system changes during the simulation time. Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal growth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the composition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics simulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and nucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the addition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition function, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low acceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use a reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute particles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated code implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses harmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which can be considered a proxy for the system’s chemical potential. The osmotic pressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of ideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure regulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of an electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations would produce.},

We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super-diffusive-to-diffusive transition in a lattice with long-range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to 10 4 sites, representing an increase of 10 to 40 times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine-learning-based classification and extended reservoir approaches for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.},

DA was successfully performed using experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis electrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble contact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the supercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8192 ensemble members. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step follows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with increased ensemble sizes.

  abstract     = {Flavoproteins are a ubiquitous class of redox proteins, enzymes, and photoreceptors that derive their versatility from the flavin cofactor—a prosthetic group that serves as the main locus of their spectral, photophysical, and (photo)chemical properties. It is thus common for computational modeling of flavoproteins to employ a hybrid approach that treats the flavin quantum mechanically and the remaining atoms classically. Such quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have proven powerful for studying flavoproteins so far, but users are often faced with a choice between treating the flavin electronic structure with ab initio wave function methods or using more approximate methods that allow for more extensive sampling of the protein dynamics. Herein, we present APEC-F 2.0, an automated QM/MM workflow that uses several open-source software packages to construct QM/MM models of flavoproteins. Exploiting the rigidity of flavin’s tricyclic isoalloxazine ring, the APEC approach iteratively optimizes flavin’s geometry in a static MM environment that represents a dynamic protein using a superposition of configurations generated from molecular dynamics. The automation of the code enables the systematic construction of QM/MM models using a common protocol and is suitable for comparing flavin’s spectral, electronic, and chemical properties in different redox, protonation, or excited states in a wide range of flavoproteins.},

By analyzing the temperature-dependent NMR SLR rate data of alkali ions in a wide range of supercooled oxide network liquids, this study reveals a hitherto unknown approximate equality between H R and β . This relationship is shown to be consistent with a model of backward-correlated hopping of mobile modifier ions in a temporally frozen oxide network. Estimation of NMR SLR β for individual alkali ions in mixed-alkali systems offers a pathway to estimate species-specific H R values that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. These findings, when taken together, suggest that β can serve as a proxy for H R and offer new insight into the microscopic nature of glassy ion transport.},

Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all mean-field critical exponents characterizing the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted mean-field exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network’s sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network’s topology.},

Coupled cluster (CC) theory is systematically improvable toward the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation; however, it is very quickly limited by the computational cost of the calculation. Therefore, it has become imperative to develop low-cost methods that are able to reproduce CC results beyond the CC theory with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level of theory. Here, the distinguishable cluster (DC)-CCSDT and singular value decomposed (SVD)-DC-CCSDT methods are examined for their fidelity to the CCSDT(Q) correlation interaction energies for the A24 dataset and are shown to outperform CCSDT and CCSD(T). Furthermore, with (T)-based corrections of the SVD approximation, the SVD-DC-CCSDT method becomes an accurate and relatively low-cost tool for the calculation of previously intractable post-CCSD(T) energies in atomic orbital basis sets of unprecedented size.},

We explore the consequences of this gradient-sensing mechanism for enhancer–promoter (E–P) communication using polymer simulations of the intervening chromatin chain. Directed motion of enhancer-bound condensates can, together with loop extrusion by cohesin, collaboratively increase the enhancer–promoter contact probability. Finally, we investigate under which conditions condensates can exhibit oscillations in their morphology and in the distance to the promoter. Oscillatory dynamics are caused by a delayed response of transcription to condensate-promoter contact and negative feedback from the accumulation of RNA at the promoter, which results in charge repulsion.},

  abstract     = {The development of the microstructure during polymeric spinodal decomposition can be monitored in real time using small-angle scattering. Information about the microstructure can be deduced from measurements of the structure factor—a quantity directly proportional to the scattered intensity. While the time evolution of the structure factor can be measured relatively easily, modeling it has proved to be much more difficult. We believe the latter could be impeding our ability to control spinodal decomposition. Using synthetic data corresponding to two different polymer blends, we investigate the use of dynamic mode decomposition to model the time evolution of the structure factor during polymeric spinodal decomposition. Based on the accuracy and range of the predictions we obtained using dynamic mode decomposition, we believe our results are promising for the use of dynamic mode decomposition in an experimental setting, which could improve our ability to control spinodal decomposition in automated experiments.},

  abstract     = {Polymer density is a critical factor influencing material performance and industrial applications, and it can be tailored by modifying the chemical structure of repeating units. Traditional polymer density characterization methods rely heavily on domain expertise; however, the vast chemical space comprising over one million potential polymer structures makes conventional experimental screening inefficient and costly. In this study, we proposed a machine learning framework for polymer density prediction, rigorously evaluating four models: neural networks (NNs), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). Using a curated dataset of 1432 homopolymers from the PoLyInfo database, our comparative analysis indicated that the GCNN model enhanced by a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) for feature extraction achieves superior predictive accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE = 0.0497 g/cm 3 ; coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.8097) relative to the other models. Experimental validation on six polymers demonstrated strong agreement between measured densities and GCNN predictions with relative errors not exceeding 4.8%. In-depth error analysis combined with SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) and subgroup evaluations reveals fundamental relationships between specific functional groups and polymer density, improving the model’s interpretability. Furthermore, t-SNE visualization and kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis revealed that the D-MPNN framework effectively captures critical chemical space features governing density, explaining the GCNN’s superior performance. This work establishes a reliable and scalable computational framework for high-throughput polymer screening, providing scientific insights into structure–property relationships while positioning density prediction as a prerequisite for incorporating density-dependent properties into polymer informatics and accelerating the discovery of novel polymer materials.},

For a polymer undergoing ideal Rouse dynamics, the slow modes identified by these transformations coincide with the conventional Rouse modes. When applied to the Fourier modes of the segment density, we show that tICA generates dynamics equivalent to dynamic self-consistent field theory (D-SCFT) with a wavevector-dependent Onsager coefficient and a free energy functional subject to the random phase approximation. We then introduce a hidden variable method and a time-local approach to include temporal memory in the tICA-generated dynamics and generalize it to construct continuum models for the nonequilibrium case of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric diblock copolymer melt.},

The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules in the presence of a harmonic potential compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e., the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a quasi-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared displacement.},

Bromide perovskites have a wide bandgap; therefore, they are promising light absorbers for perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells. However, surface defects generally affect the PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells because they serve as trapping and recombination sites for excitons (electron–hole pairs). In this study, density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the molecular passivation of surface defects in Sn-based mixed-halide perovskites. The results showed that a Lewis base is effective for passivating p -type defects. In addition, we established a molecule–defect interaction model to explain the passivation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are well known to give rise to a quantum confined structure of excitons. Because of this quantum confinement, new physics of hot exciton relaxation dynamics arises. Decades of work using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy have yielded initial simple observations, such as estimates of the cooling rate from single pump photon energy experiments. More detailed TA experiments employed variable pump photon energies to measure excitonic state-resolved transition rates. These TA measurements, usually the simplest form, have been employed to characterize QDs and their relaxation dynamics to this day. Yet, these TA measurements are fundamentally lacking in their ability to measure energy-resolved hot exciton cooling, which requires observation of the full cooling history through the real excitonic manifold. Here, we employ coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy (CMDS) to perform an atomistically directed study of hot exciton cooling in CdSe QDs, revealing energy resolved relaxation dynamics. CMDS experiments are compared with simulations and prior TA measurements and simpler theories. Our findings reveal a hot exciton relaxation dynamics landscape. This relaxation dynamics landscape is a linear or sub-linear function of excess energy for different structures of QDs, with a strong size dependence. Our model simulations parameterized by the empirical pseudopotential model reproduces the experimental functional form and the dependence upon QD diameter and shell.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of graphene are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature T and external stress τ . The elastic response is characterized by calculating elastic constants via three complementary methods: (i) numerical derivatives of stress–strain curves, (ii) analysis of cell fluctuation correlations, and (iii) phonon dispersion analysis. Simulations were performed with two interatomic models: an empirical potential and a tight-binding electronic Hamiltonian. Both models predict that the Poisson’s ratio ν of graphene increases monotonically with applied stress. The range of stresses studied spans the entire domain of mechanical stability of the planar structure. Two mechanical instabilities are identified. Under tensile stress, fracture occurs, signaled by the softening of a phonon mode at the Brillouin zone boundary ( K point). At the studied temperatures ( T < 1500 K), auxetic behavior ( ν < 0) appears only at high tensile stresses, near the fracture threshold. Under compressive stress, a spinodal instability associated with long-wavelength wrinkling is observed. Finite-size analysis of this instability at 300 K reveals the existence of a finite surface tension σ in the unstressed membrane, which arises from the anharmonic coupling between out-of-plane and in-plane fluctuations. The surface tension stabilizes the membrane’s flat morphology. In the thermodynamic limit, the onset of the wrinkling instability occurs when the compressive stress matches the surface tension ( τ = σ ). Under this spinodal condition, the area compressibility modulus B is characterized by a scaling law N −1/2 , where N is the number of atoms in the simulation cell.},

Our previous studies have uncovered the strong dependence between melting entropy in the eutectic mixtures and mixing enthalpy, which has been serving as an important reference for glass formation, showing that negative mixing enthalpy largely reduces the melting entropy. In this paper, we focused on the question as to how melting entropy is associated with another classical glass formation criterion of molecule/atom size difference of components. This question has been challenging since it is constantly entangled with the effect of mixing enthalpy and easily smeared. Here, four binary eutectics constituted by molecules with similar structural and chemical characteristics but quite different molecular size were elaborately selected. The extremely low mixing enthalpy measured in four eutectic systems using a C80 microcalorimeter guarantees the neglectable effect of the mixing enthalpy. The determination of melting entropies and the critical cooling rate for glass formation at the eutectic compositions for the four systems uncovers an evident relation between melting entropy and molecular size difference, confirming the compatibility of the two glass formation criteria for mixing systems.},

Both systems turned out to be good glass formers, differing by 17 K in the glass transition temperature, which indicated a strong change in the self-assembly pattern. This supposition was further confirmed by the analysis of dielectric spectra, where, apart from the α -relaxation, also a unique Debye (D)-mode, being a fingerprint of the self-association, characterized by different dynamical properties (dielectric strength, timescale separation from the α -process), was detected in both samples. Further diffraction and infrared investigations, supported by density functional theory computations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed that hydrogen (H)-bonds play a key role in the association in 3P1Pol, while in 3P1Pal, there are at least five different intermolecular interactions involving dipole–dipole forces and π-stacking, as well as extraordinary H-bonds formed between methylene groups neighboring with the formyl unit and carbonyl moiety. Finally, optimized dimeric structures, along with MD simulations, allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism responsible for the D-process in 3P1Pal.

The 35 Cl − dynamics appears to be close to the structural (or α-) relaxation as seen by rheology.

This way, we are able to detect supramolecular rheological signatures not only for HmimCl but also for 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide.

  abstract     = {Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li + ). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr 14 ][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x LiTFSI ≤ 0.3. We find that the charge–charge and density–density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI-doped [pyr 14 ][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density–density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x LiTFSI -sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.},

Calorimetric crystallization proceeded in two steps, originating either from mechanical and stress-induced defects (230–275 °C) or from homogeneously formed nuclei (255–310 °C); both processes exhibited an identical activation energy of 200 kJ mol −1 . At temperatures <230 °C, a Sb 2 O 3 crystalline phase formed along the rhombohedral Sb 2 S 3 structure. The normal growth model with the activation energy of ∼250 kJ mol −1 was used to describe the microscopic crystal growth rate data, and the viscosity–diffusivity decoupling was characterized by Ediger’s parameter ξ varying between 0.40 and 0.55. The crystal growth rate was slightly higher in the film deposited on the glass substrate, with the compressive stress introduced at higher T having only a small effect. Meanwhile, the deposition on the glass substrate led to a significantly higher (especially below the glass transition temperature) nucleation rate, which underlines the key aspect of the crystallization process in very thin chalcogenide films: the formation of nuclei due to the internal stresses arising from the difference of the film/substrate thermal expansion coefficients.},

  abstract     = {The equilibration dynamics of ultrastable glasses subjected to heating protocols has attracted recent experimental and theoretical interest. With simulations of the mW water model, we investigate the devitrification and “melting” dynamics of both conventional quenched (QG) and vapor deposited (DG) amorphous ices under controlled heating ramps. By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlate with the structural stability of the glasses and allow tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. In addition, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1 + d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.},

  abstract     = {Folding and unfolding in molecules as simple as short hydrocarbons and as complicated as large proteins continue to be an active research field. Here, we investigate folding in n -C 14 H 30 using both density functional theory (DFT)/B3LYP calculations of 27 772 local minima and a kinetic transition network calculated for a previously reported potential energy surface (PES) obtained by fitting roughly 250 000 B3LYP energies. In addition to generating a database of minima and the transition states that connect them, these calculations and the PES based on them have been used to develop a simple and accurate model for the energy landscape. The model for the local minima is based on the number of gauche torsions as well as their interactions with neighbors and next-nearest neighbors, resulting in three parameters, which are fitted using the direct DFT results. The transition states are governed by 13 parameters based on differences between the two connected local minima. The model predicts that there are 44 530 local minima (not counting permutation-inversion isomers) connected by 525 028 transition states, including degenerate rearrangements. When compared to the actual stationary points, it achieves a minimum absolute energy error of 43 cm −1 for the local minima and 47 cm −1 for the transition state barriers connecting levels of different energy. The model also provides accurate predictions of the most kinetically relevant folding and unfolding pathways, for example, from very highly excited configurations to the global minimum. In addition, it facilitates the determination of a disconnectivity graph using the Cambridge Energy Landscapes programs.},

  abstract     = {The formation of carbinolamine represents the crucial initial step in the aldol reaction, specifically involving the interaction between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone, facilitated by amine-catalyzed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (amine-MSN). In this process, a nitrogen atom from propylamine, which acts as the catalytic moiety, engages in the formation of a covalent bond with a carbon atom from acetone, leading to the generation of a carbinolamine intermediate. This reaction is significantly influenced by the presence of silanol groups located on the surface of the amine-MSN, which contribute to the catalytic activity. Moreover, the reaction solvent plays a vital role; water serves as an essential solvent that enhances the rate of the aldol reaction. In this work, a comprehensive investigation is conducted to understand the catalytic influence of water explicitly in carbinolamine formation via three distinct pathways: (1) without the assistance of silanol groups, (2) silanol assistance occurs indirectly through hydrogen bonding, and (3) a pathway that showcases direct silanol assistance in the hydrogen atom transfer processes. To analyze the reaction mechanism in the amine-MSN system, this study employs the fragment molecular orbital method, which can accurately treat the complexities associated with large molecular systems like the MSN pore model (Si 392 O 958 H 348 ). The concerted mechanism study reveals that the presence of water molecules significantly lowers the energy barrier associated with carbinolamine formation, thereby enhancing the feasibility and efficiency of the reaction. This insight highlights the pivotal role of the solvent and the nature of catalytic sites in optimizing aldol reactions within mesoporous silica frameworks.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated that in a collision-free vacuum environment, C 6 − exhibits fast radiative cooling from its highly vibrationally excited states through inverse internal conversion (IIC). Since IIC is driven by vibronic coupling, the understanding of vibronic structures of C 6 − is of theoretical significance. Here, we utilize time-dependent density functional theory to calculate the absorption spectrum of C 6 − ⁠ , allowing us to reassign the peaks in the experimental spectrum to the vibronic progressions associated with the C 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u and D 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u electronic transitions. A vibronic coupling density analysis reasonably explains the strong vibronic peaks and validates the reassignment. We also discuss the potential softening caused by quadratic vibronic coupling in the excited states and the partially allowed vibronic transitions. In addition, we show that a pseudo-Jahn–Teller distortion occurs along the ν 4 ( σ u + ) antisymmetric stretching mode due to the pseudo-degeneracy of the A and B states.},

The key findings reveal a clear β -dependent ( β is the angle of alignment) scattering behavior: the β = 90° configuration in the abstraction channel enhances reactivity and dominates the formation of the products at lower vibrational states with increasing collision energy. In contrast, the β = 0° configuration promotes all vibrational states in the exchange channel. Notably, the β = 45° configuration displays the smallest cross sections in both channels due to destructive quantum interference, contrasting with the constructive interference in the β = 90° configuration. Channel competition analysis demonstrates that β = 0°/45° configurations enhance exchange channel dominance, whereas β = 90° favors the abstraction channel. The differential cross section shows that the products in the abstraction channel shift from backward to forward in the β = 0°/45° configuration, while maintaining sideways distributions in the β = 90° configuration, and in the exchange channel, it is always backward scattering. The highest reaction rate in the abstraction channel occurs at the parallel alignment in the temperature region between 200 and 1000 K.},

Among these, protonated carbon chains are of great interest due to the presence of a permanent dipole moment and their relevance in describing astrochemical processes, making their detection possible in cold molecular clouds such as TMC-1. C 5 H + ( ⁠ 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) is an important molecule for understanding the formation and evolution of carbon-rich environments. However, to accurately model its abundance and spectroscopic properties, it is essential to account for its collisional interactions with H 2 , the most abundant molecule in the ISM. In this study, we present a quantum dynamical study for the C 5 H + –H 2 collision, employing high-level CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations to construct an accurate potential energy surface (PES). The PES is further augmented using a neural network fitting model, ensuring spectroscopic accuracy. The PES is expanded into radial components using bispherical harmonics. Then, close coupling methods were used to calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for different rotational transitions of C 5 H + , up to 100 K. Throughout the temperature range, a propensity is observed for even transitions over odd transitions. The rate coefficients for He and H 2 collisions are compared for C 5 H + , C 5 , and C 6 H − . For both low and high temperatures, rate coefficients for C 5 H + are found to be higher than C 5 and C 6 H − for both the He and H 2 collisions.},

This study demonstrates that high-energy kHz pulses can confine 1- μ m-radius polystyrene beads in water within ∼26 μ m. This approach utilizes the unique properties of high-energy pulsed lasers, distinct from continuous-wave and megahertz pulsed lasers traditionally used in optical trapping. The pulsing nature of the kHz laser generates strong instantaneous forces that attract and confine particles within a specific region, inducing a “ping-pong” motion within the confined space. When the laser pulses strike the microparticles, the strong gradient forces pull the particles toward the laser focus, while the scattering force from the laser pushes them away. This interaction creates a dynamic equilibrium, causing the particles to oscillate continuously in a back-and-forth motion until the laser is blocked. This phenomenon differs from conventional optical trapping, which offers unique particle confinement possibilities. When combined with optical trapping, especially at femtomolar concentrations or single-particle conditions, this novel development shows that the kHz laser draws particles from significant distances toward the focal point, enhancing its trapping efficiency. All experiments were conducted on a single setup, varying only laser characteristics, ensuring high credibility in the results.},

Sub-1 cm −1 High-Resolution Broadband SFG-VS (HR-BB-SFG-VS) has shown advantages with high spectral resolution and accurate spectral line shape. However, due to the lower peak intensity for the long picosecond pulse used in achieving sub-wavenumber resolution in the HR-BB-SFG-VS measurement, only molecular interfaces with relatively strong signal have been studied. To achieve detailed understanding and broader applications in molecular interfacial studies with HR-BB-SFG-VS, higher sensitivity and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HR-BB-SFG-VS is required. In this report, we present a systematic effort on the significant improvement of sensitivity and SNR for HR-BB-SFG-VS. Through optimization of laser pulse characteristics, automatic sample height control, and detection conditions, the sensitivity of HR-BB-SFG-VS was improved, reaching a level of 3 × 10 −6 of the SFG signal from the α-quartz standard. The high SNR spectra of various molecular interfaces are thus obtained with exquisite line shapes and fine spectral features. To name a couple of examples, a new hydrogen-bonded water band around 3300 cm −1 can be explicitly identified in the air/neat-water interface spectra and pure chiral spectral peaks at the level of 1 × 10 −5 of the quartz signal were measured at the air/Leucine aqueous solution interface etc. Such improvements in sensitivity and SNR in HR-BB-SFG-VS have brought and shall bring new opportunities and new discoveries with broad applications to molecular interface studies, in addition to the advantage of HR-BB-SFG-VS for its sub-wavenumber spectral resolution and the ability for intrinsic spectral line shape.},

  abstract     = {An explicitly correlated extension of a pair-function based perturbation theory is presented. The reference is obtained as the antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals, termed Strictly Localized Geminals (SLG), which can capture static correlation at mean-field cost. Geminals entering SLG are spin unrestricted, in general, and are expanded in the one-electron basis of the natural orbitals of the unrestricted Hartree–Fock wavefunction. Dynamic correlation is accounted for by perturbation theory (PT) at second order via a Dyall-like Hamiltonian acting as the zero-order operator [Földvári et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 034103 (2019)]. Here, an explicitly correlated (F12) correction is added to SLGPT2 to improve the description of dynamic correlation and enhance convergence with respect to the basis size. The resulting SLGPT2-F12 scheme inherits the fragmented structure of the SLGPT2 method, facilitating an efficient solution scheme. For numerical illustration, the SLGPT2-F12 approach is applied to small diradical systems, mainly focusing on singlet–triplet splittings.},

  abstract     = {We model Auger spectra using second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory combined with complex-scaled basis functions. For this purpose, we decompose the complex MP2 energy of the core-hole state into contributions from specific decay channels and propose a corresponding equation-of-motion (EOM) method for computing the doubly ionized final states of Auger decay. These methods lead to significant savings in computational cost compared to our recently developed approaches based on coupled-cluster theory [F. Matz and T.-C. Jagau, J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 114117 (2022)]. The test set for this study comprises water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and silane. The energies of the final states of Auger decay are obtained with an accuracy comparable to EOM coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) theory. Partial decay widths and branching ratios between KLL, KLM, and KMM decay of K-shell holes in third-row hydrides are in good agreement with EOM-CCSD, while deviations are more significant for second-row hydrides. For L 1 -shell holes, which undergo Coster–Kronig decay, MP2 yields unphysical results. However, we show that a suitable shift of the MP2 energy denominators leads to more reliable branching ratios and spectra for these problematic cases.},

We apply mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC to several neutral atoms and diatomic molecules to obtain the ground and first few excited states of the corresponding dication species, and we observe excellent agreement (to within 0.001 eV) between DIPs obtained from mmfX2C- and four-component DIP-EOMCC calculations that include 3-hole–1-particle (3 h 1 p ) excitations, with either the Dirac–Coulomb or Dirac–Coulomb–Gaunt Hamiltonians. We also compare double IPs for mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC calculations with the full Dirac–Coulomb–Breit Hamiltonian to those from experiment. The mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC with 3 h 1 p excitations leads to errors in absolute double IPs that generally overestimate experimental data for noble gases by 0.1–0.4 eV, whereas the inclusion of 4 h 2 p excitations results in double IPs that are too low by 0.1–0.2 eV, at the large basis set limit.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scales of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields that recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.},

  abstract     = {Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power make FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method’s inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water–methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move, the determinant locality approximation, or the determinant T-move schemes, while the older locality approximation leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes—highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an efficient method, TTN-HEOM, for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme with the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system–bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac–Frenkel variational principle, which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO , tensor equations for non-Markovian structured open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics and one adaptive-rank method with a variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude–Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable of simulating both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum systems interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with an affordable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {We present a self-consistent algorithm for optimal control simulations of many-body quantum systems. The algorithm features a two-step synergism that combines discrete real-time machine learning (DRTL) with Quantum Optimal Control Theory (QOCT) using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Specifically, in step (1), DRTL is employed to identify a compact working space (i.e., the important portion of the Hilbert space) for the time evolution of the many-body quantum system in the presence of a control field (i.e., the initial or previously updated field), and in step (2), QOCT utilizes the DRTL-determined working space to find a newly updated control field for a chosen objective. Steps 1 and 2 are iterated until a self-consistent control objective value is reached such that the resulting optimal control field yields the same targeted objective value when the corresponding working space is systematically enlarged. To demonstrate this two-step self-consistent DRTL-QOCT synergistic algorithm, we perform optimal control simulations of strongly interacting 1D as well as 2D Heisenberg spin systems. In both scenarios, only a single spin (at the left end site for 1D and the upper left corner site for 2D) is driven by the time-dependent control fields to create an excitation at the opposite site as the target. It is found that, starting from all spin-down zero excitation states, the synergistic method is able to identify working spaces and convergence of the desired controlled dynamics with just a few iterations of the overall algorithm. In the cases studied, the dimensionality of the working space scales only quasi-linearly with the number of spins.},

However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH 4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of yttrium (Y) by scandium (Sc), lanthanum (La), and zirconium (Zr). Pure YH 4 , stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature ( T c ) of 84–95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases T c to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H 4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H 4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H 4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed T c of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H 4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without an optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y–H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron–phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance T c in hydride superconductors.},

This extension employs non-exponential basis sets to expand the bath correlation functions, overcoming the reliance of the original cNMSSE on exponential decompositions of the spectral density. Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward–backward stochastic Schrödinger equations and extended hierarchical equation of motion.},

Our method adapts the adversarial learning paradigm, combining a physics-based generator with a neural network discriminator that differentiates between AA and CG trajectories. By adversarially optimizing CG parameters, our approach eliminates the need for predefined kinetic features. Applied to liquid water, it accurately reproduces radial and angular distribution functions as well as dynamical mean squared displacement, even extrapolating long-timescale dynamics from short training trajectories. This framework offers a new approach for bottom-up CG modeling, offering a systematic and principled way to preserve dynamic consistency in complex coarse-grained molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modeling volume-dependent properties of water remains a challenge for density functional theory (DFT), with widely used functionals failing to reproduce key features of the water density isobar, including its shape, density, and temperature of the density maximum. Here, we compare the performance of the RPBE-D3 and vdW-DF-cx functionals using replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) driven by machine-learned force fields. Our simulations reveal that vdW-DF-cx predicts the water density more accurately than RPBE-D3 and reproduces the isobar closely between 307 and 340 K. In contrast, RPBE-D3 underestimates the density across the entire temperature range. However, vdW-DF-cx predicts the maximum density temperature to be ∼30 K higher than experiment. Using the local structure index, we attribute this shift to an onset of low-density, ice-like structures in the vdW-DF-cx-based MD at too high temperatures. Static DFT calculations on water dimers and representative high- and low-density water structures reveal that key features of the density isobars are reflected in the static energy-volume curves. In particular, the equilibrium intermolecular distance and curvature correlate with the maximum density and curvature around the maximum of the density isobar. Similarly, the early onset of the low-density structure is connected to the energetic preference for more structured, low-density water over a less ordered, high-density water structure. Decomposing the exchange–correlation energy reveals that the non-local dispersion energy decisively influences the predicted equilibrium intermolecular distances, whereas the semi-local part governs the balance between low- and high-density liquid structures.},

  abstract     = {Density functional theory (DFT) is a cornerstone of modern electronic structure theory. In the Kohn–Sham scheme, the many-electron Schrödinger equation is replaced by a set of effective single-particle equations. Thus, the full complexity of the quantum mechanical many-particle effects is mapped to the exchange–correlation potential v xc ( r ). Almost all DFT calculations done in practice rely on approximations to v xc ( r ). However, numerical representations of the quasi-exact v xc ( r ) can be obtained from quasi-exact densities by inverting the Kohn–Sham procedure. This inverse Kohn–Sham scheme is an important source of insight into exact DFT. Here, we review the inverse Kohn–Sham problem and explain in detail several aspects of why Kohn–Sham inversion is intrinsically difficult. We then present several inversion schemes and discuss their pros and cons, specifically addressing the effects of statistical uncertainties that are inevitable in quantum Monte Carlo reference densities. We use these schemes to obtain representations of v xc ( r ) that correspond to the ground-state densities that have become available from accurate diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on real space grids for the Li 2 and N 2 molecules, and the C atom. In the latter, the highest occupied orbital has a nodal line and the exchange–correlation potential goes to a different asymptotic value in this direction. As an outlook, we discuss the possibility of interlacing quantum Monte Carlo and Kohn–Sham theory by using the quasi-exact Kohn–Sham determinant to fix the nodes in a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation.},

  abstract     = {Standard algorithms to calculate the diffusion constant from computer simulations are based on either the mean-squared displacement or the velocity autocorrelation function of the tagged particle. They register displacements/velocities caused by random forces, but do not address their physical nature. This deficiency is resolved in the force route to the diffusion constant leading to Kirkwood equation for massive diffusive particles (Brownian motion). Approximate Kirkwood equation becomes exact when the force relaxation time is replaced with the memory time. To formulate the force route to the diffusion constant, memory functions were calculated here from molecular dynamics simulations of six charge mutants of the green fluorescent protein and the plastocyanin protein in a wide range of temperatures. The memory time falls between the velocity and force relaxation times, with the Kirkwood equation overestimating diffusion constants of proteins by a factor of ∼ 4 ⁠ . Diffusion constants from the velocity/displacement route strongly increase with increasing system size. Standard protocols accounting for finite-size effects show serious flaws when applied to protein diffusion by producing system-size corrections far exceeding both the finite-size diffusion constants and their infinite-size extrapolations. Diffusion constants from the force route show much less system-size dependence, and corrected values are mostly independent of the system size.},

In the bubble regime, we identify several distinct types of motion, including an elastic or pinned regime where the probe particle remains inside a bubble and drags all other bubbles with it. There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble and, in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity–force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations. We map the dynamic phase diagram for this system for varied interaction lengths, bubble sizes, and densities.},

  abstract     = {Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between “sticker” sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines whether, upon increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or via a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on binding site topology, we numerically investigate APs made of DNA, where “sticker” sites formed by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, ( AA ) 6 , and the other with two distinct alternating types, ( AB ) 6 . At low temperatures, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the ( AA ) 6 system remains homogeneous, while the ( AB ) 6 system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead–spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- vs inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable and realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depend on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled manner.},

Here, we present a simple model extending the Alexander–De Gennes ansatz for arbitrary chain length distributions, allowing us to easily rationalize the effect of polydispersity, which is a feature of all realistic brushes. This model can predict the interaction of a brush with nanoparticles or an opposing wall, as demonstrated by good qualitative agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.

However, understanding the oxidative decomposition of SPEs on the cathode surfaces and characterizing the resulting cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) remain challenging both experimentally and computationally. This study introduces a new computational protocol based on ab initio molecular dynamics for simulating the decomposition of PEO:LiTFSI SPE on the NMC-811 cathode surface using a combined electron- and Li + -removal simulation approach. This method incorporates the effects of the applied electric potential and Li + migration on electrolyte oxidation during battery charging. The calculations indicate that electrons are withdrawn from both the C–C bonds of PEO and the Ni–O bonds of NMC-811, resulting in C–C bond cleavage and the formation of decomposition fragments. The created Li vacancies in the NMC facilitate coupling between decomposed PEO and exposed surface oxygen. The ROCH 2 O-M species, identified as the major degradation product on the NMC-811 cathode surface, is in agreement with the experimental XPS spectra. This approach provides detailed insights into the oxidative decomposition of PEO-based SPEs and demonstrates its effectiveness in exploring CEI component formation.},

We first provide a description whereby elements of the second-order susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the order parameters ⟨ P 1 ⟩ and ⟨ P 3 ⟩.

This study systematically analyzes molecular mechanics force field parameters for bonded and nonbonded (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions in alkanethiol SAMs with different terminal groups. Using structure optimization and energy decomposition analysis, we assess the impact of force field parameters on key properties, such as the equilibrium tilt angle, ligand packing density, and nanoscale structural organization. Based on this detailed benchmarking, an optimal set of force field parameters has been identified that reproduces the experimentally determined structural and energetic properties of SAMs and ensures their dynamic stability at room temperature.

  abstract     = {In close proximity to quantum emitters (QEs), plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate energy exchange with the QEs, which is known as plasmon–exciton coupling. The strong coupling regime, associated with Rabi splitting, is crucial for advanced nanophotonic devices, including solar cells, single-photon nonlinear optics, and nanolasers. Recently, high refractive index semiconductor NPs (typically Si NPs) have emerged for designing strongly coupled systems. However, their large mode volumes of magnetic Mie resonances have limited their success in achieving strong coupling. This study investigates the plasmon–exciton coupling between an Ag–Si core–shell and a monolayer QE of WS 2 (Ag–Si–WS 2 system) in air and water environments. Here, we compare the coupling dynamics of the hybrid Ag–Si–WS 2 system to that of the Si–WS 2 system as a benchmarking system. Employing Mie’s theory of core–shell scattering, in conjunction with Maxwell–Garnett effective medium theory, we analyze the optical responses of both configurations. Then, we calculate the Rabi splitting frequency for each system to identify the coupling regime. Our results suggest that the Ag–Si–WS 2 system can achieve a deep-strong coupling regime when the Ag core radius is less than 30 nm, with enhanced coupling strength in water compared to air. Conversely, the Si–WS 2 system does not achieve strong coupling in either medium. The hybrid modes in Ag–Si–WS 2 demonstrate remarkable symmetrical spectral characteristics compared to the asymmetric spectral line shape observed in the Si–WS 2 system. The findings suggest avenues for utilizing the plasmon–exciton strong coupling in the Ag–Si–WS 2 system to enhance optoelectronic and quantum electronic devices.},

In this work, we examined the bandgap nonlinearity and composition-dependent bowing in pure-phase α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 epilayers (0 < x < 0.62) grown via laser molecular beam epitaxy on m -plane sapphire substrates. The variations in the x-ray rocking curve full width at half maximum and surface roughness of epilayers with increasing Al composition x follow the trend predicted by the theoretical formation enthalpy of α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys. The high crystalline quality of the α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 epilayers was further confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations. While lattice constants adhered to Vegard’s law, the optical bandgap (5.28–7.22 eV) exhibited nonlinearity, with a bowing factor of 1.33 eV, aligning closely with theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that the observed optical bandgap nonlinear effect in the α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloy primarily stems from charge exchange, rather than volume deformation or strain relaxation effects, providing a pathway for precise bandgap tuning in Ga 2 O 3 for high-performance power electronics.},

  abstract     = {Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) is a critical material in non-linear optics, with significant applications in electro-optical and laser technologies. Despite its importance, the solution properties of KDP remain poorly understood, and to the best of our knowledge, no prior molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have directly probed the structure and behavior of KDP in aqueous solutions. This study presents results from MD simulations of KDP in both solution and solid states and compares four dihydrogen phosphate (DP) force-field models in five different water models. Our results reveal that the solution structure is strongly dominated by the association of the DP anions through direct hydrogen bonding, where the degree of association exhibits a marked concentration dependence in accord with the experiment. Of the four DP models evaluated, two are much better able to reproduce experimental data, including from neutron scattering and ab initio MD simulation results, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the hydrogen bonding patterns that appear to govern local solution structure. We find that the extent of hydrogen bonding between DP anions is also sensitive to the choice of water models, with stronger hydration reducing DP–DP association. We have also examined the two models for both tetragonal and monoclinic crystal structures of KDP and found that these models are able to reproduce the experimental parameters relatively well. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of KDP solutions and lay the groundwork for future investigations into its solution and solid-state properties and behavior.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal ice (I h ), the most common structure of ice, displays a variety of fascinating properties. Despite major efforts, a theoretical description of all its properties is still lacking. In particular, correctly accounting for its density and interatomic interactions is of utmost importance as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of other properties. Deep potentials are a recent alternative to investigate the properties of ice I h , aiming to match the accuracy of ab initio simulations with the simplicity and scalability of classical molecular dynamics. This becomes particularly significant if one wishes to address nuclear quantum effects. In this work, we use machine learning potentials obtained for different exchange and correlation functionals to simulate the structural and vibrational properties of ice I h . We show that most functionals overestimate the density of ice compared to experimental results. Furthermore, a quantum treatment of the nuclei leads to even further distancing from experiments. We understand this by highlighting how different interatomic interactions play a role in obtaining the equilibrium density. In particular, different from water clusters and bulk water, nuclear quantum effects lead to stronger H-bonds in ice I h .},

  abstract     = {In conflict with standard notions of thermodynamics, mesoscopically sized inclusions (“clusters”) of a solute-rich liquid have been observed in equilibrated solutions of proteins and other molecules. According to a complexation scenario proposed earlier, a steady-state ensemble of finite-sized droplets of a metastable solute-rich liquid can emerge in a solution, if the solute molecules can form transient complexes with each other and/or solute. Here, we solve for the thermodynamics of an explicit model of a self-associating fluid in which particles can form transient dimers. We determine ranges of parameters where two distinct dense liquid phases, dimer-rich and monomer-rich, respectively, can co-exist with each other and the solute-poor phase. We find that within a certain range of the dimer’s binding strength, thermodynamic conditions for mesoscopic clusters to emerge are indeed satisfied. The location and size, respectively, of the corresponding region on the phase diagram are consistent with observation. We predict that the clusters are comprised of a metastable monomer-rich dense liquid, while the bulk solution itself contains substantial amounts of the dimer and exhibits large, pre-critical density fluctuations. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase commonly observed during the macroscopic liquid–liquid separation should be dimer-rich, another testable prediction. The present findings provide further evidence for the complexation scenario and suggest new experimental ways to test it.},

  abstract     = {Gold nanocrystals have been widely used in sensing and medicine, where nanocrystal shape can profoundly influence properties. To describe and predict the structure and properties of Au nanomaterials, first-principles studies are the most accurate. Force fields can provide effective surrogates for first-principles calculations, and in the case of Au, many such force fields exist. To clarify the current state of Au structure prediction using force fields, we used parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations to explore the temperature-dependent shape distributions of Au 147 and Au 55 from three different Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) force fields. We used machine learning to classify nanoparticle shapes and observe a wide variation in the temperature-dependent shape distributions among the various force fields, accompanied by a wide range of melting temperatures. We also compared the EAM structures to those from literature studies employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Gaussian process regression machine-learning force field, density functional tight binding, the Gupta potential, and Density Functional Theory (DFT). We re-optimized the lowest-energy structures from each force field/study using DFT and found that the lowest-energy structures for both Au 147 and Au 55 are amorphous. These structures were predicted by the ANN and DFT. Most of the 30 structures with minimum energy for each size are either hollow or partially to totally disordered and not icosahedral, as the sizes of these nanocrystals might imply.},

  abstract     = {Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) leverage superatomic properties via well-defined geometric/electronic configurations to enable novel reactions. The development of SCCs has facilitated atomic-level insights into catalyst design, thereby advancing our understanding of the fundamental nature of catalytic reactions. While orbital symmetry rules guide unimolecular catalyst design, the role of superatomic orbital symmetry in SCC reactivity remains elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated the gas-phase reactions of Ag n − ( n = 7–25) clusters with C 2 H 4 , employing a combination of time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This revealed strong size-dependent reactivity: Ag 7–11, 18–23 − showed remarkable stability, whereas Ag 12–17, 24–25 − adsorbed one or even two C 2 H 4 molecules. The electron clouds of 1S superatomic orbital in Ag 12–15, 24–25 − clusters are partially localized on specific atoms. This partial localization enables effective interactions between the 1S orbital and the π orbital of C 2 H 4 , while concurrently enhancing stability through the formation of bonding orbitals and the d -orbital coupling among silver atoms. Notably, C 2 H 4 adsorption induces structural reorganization of Ag 16, 17 − , resulting in the formation of icosahedral cages. These cages contain highly symmetrical electron clouds that provide symmetrically matched orbitals, favoring secondary C 2 H 4 adsorption and thereby enhancing the stability of complexes. Our research introduces a novel framework for the precision engineering of superatomic clusters while broadening the application scope of the superatomic properties of metal clusters. The discovery of the superatomic orbital symmetry rule sheds light on the activity series of SCCs and offers new insights into precise SCC engineering.},

  abstract     = {The absolute photodetachment cross section characterizes the photostability of atomic and molecular anions against photodestruction by neutralization. The measurement of this quantity has been reported only for atomic and simple molecular ions. In 2006, Wester’s group introduced a novel ion-trap-based technique to measure the absolute photodetachment cross section [Trippel et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 , 193003 (2006)] of OH − . In the present work, we propose a novel methodology to streamline this technique to reduce the measurement time by several orders of magnitude by combining a single experimental rate measurement with a simulated column density distribution of the trapped ions. We validated our approach by reproducing the cross section reported for OH − at 632.8 nm. Using this technique, we report the first such measurement for a molecule of biological interest, deprotonated indole, at a laser wavelength of 403 nm. The proposed scheme is anticipated to have a significant and transformative impact on the development of a comprehensive database for photodetachment and photodissociation cross sections of molecular ions. Furthermore, these measurements have the potential to drive the development of cutting-edge computational codes for cross section calculations, enabling an unprecedentedly detailed understanding of electron dynamics in large molecules and the light–matter interaction.},

  abstract     = {Propargyl radical (•C 3 H 3 ) and butadienyl radical (• i -C 4 H 5 ) are two crucial intermediates in combustion and astrochemistry, particularly in the formation of C 7 H 8 aromatics such as toluene. However, the precise formation mechanisms of the first-ring aromatics through C 3 + C 4 reactions have remained ambiguous. This study explores the detailed potential energy surface (PES) of C 7 H 8 at the •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 entrance reaction channel, alongside conducting kinetic calculations and modeling. The PES reveals distinct mechanistic pathways that depend on the resonance configurations of •C 3 H 3 (propyne-3-yl and allenyl-1-yl). Key C 7 H 8 isomers, including 5-ethylidenecyclopenta-1,3-diene, cycloheptatriene, and norcaradiene, are preferentially formed via the allenyl-1-yl configuration, underlining the significant influence of π electron delocalization of propargyl. Kinetic analysis using the phase space theory and the RRKM/ME method identifies well-skipping reactions, leading to larger resonance-stabilized •C 7 H 7 radical and hydrogen atom through the less dominant allenyl-1-yl configuration reacting with • i -C 4 H 5 . Rate constants for •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 reaction yielding toluene and vinylcyclopentadienyl (vinylCPDyl) + H are determined. Subsequent kinetic modeling indicates that the formation pathway •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 → toluene predominates at low temperatures and pressure, contrasting with other toluene formations via benzyl + H and phenyl + CH 3 reactions. •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 reaction is also notably significant for generating vinylCPDyl at temperatures exceeding 1050 K at 760 Torr. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) typically form in high-temperature scenarios, this research suggests viable low-temperature pathways for toluene, which are important in cooling zones of engines, thereby influencing PAH and soot production via resonance stabilized radical chain reactions.},

On the new PES, the state-to-state quantum dynamics calculations of the Ne( 2 S) + H 2 + /D 2 + ( v 0 = 0, j 0 = 0) reactions are performed. The calculated results indicate that the products of the two reactions are generated by the dissociation of short-lived complexes when the collision energy is slightly larger than the reaction thresholds, whereas a direct abstraction process gradually plays the dominant role as the collision energy increases. The newly constructed PES can be used to further accurately study the quantum dynamics of the Ne + H 2 + reactive system, including the effects of rovibrational excitations and the spatial alignment of reactant molecules.},

  abstract     = {Molecular systems with orbital (near-)degeneracy at the Fermi level tend to adopt a high-spin ground state. In these systems, one often finds low-lying electronic excitations with a lower total spin that can be reached from the ground state by a spin-flip-down excitation. In this work, we present three spin-adapted spin-flip-down time-dependent density functional theory (SFD-TD-DFT) approaches to calculate the excitation energies for these types of electronic transitions. These SFD-TD-DFT methods are based on a restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham (ROKS) formulation within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), giving rise to the ROKS-SFD-TDA family of methods. The three methods differ in the kernel, having different two-electron coupling elements in the resulting working equations. In agreement with earlier work, we find that a noncollinear description of the kernel is vital for producing a decent description of these excitations. In terms of obtaining excitations with a definite spin, we present two fully spin-adapted ROKS-SFD-TDA methods that either stem from configuration interaction with single excitations (SF-CIS) or from the already existing equation-of-motion ansatz (SF-TDA). It is shown that the spin-adaptation in SF-CIS and SF-TDA gives rise to artificial double counting of correlation effects by incorporating double excitations. When discarding this double counting, one ends up with an excited state that is partly spin-adapted (only in the open-to-open configurations). This method is called quasi-spin-adapted SF-TDA (Q-SF-TDA) and is shown to be a stable and efficient method that performs similarly to spin-unrestricted SFD-TD-DFT.},

While scalar-relativistic effects can be incorporated with minimal computational cost, accounting for spin–orbit interactions requires complex frameworks that can be computationally expensive. In this work, we develop a reduced-cost state-interaction approach for simulating near-edge soft x-ray absorption spectra of closed-shell transition metal complexes with relativistic effects incorporated using the ZORA-Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian. The computed spectra closely agree with those obtained with state-of-the-art approaches. This methodology provides a practical and cost-effective alternative to more rigorous two-component methods, making it particularly valuable for large-scale calculations and applications such as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering simulations, where capturing a large number of excited states is essential.},

Our analysis reveals that the relaxation time to equilibrium scales inversely with the square of the memory decay rate λ , i.e., τ relax ∝ λ −2 . To understand the origin of this scaling, we analyze the escape dynamics from a potential well and find that the mean escape time follows the same λ −2 dependence. This indicates that the slow relaxation arises from memory-suppressed fluctuations that delay escape events. To explain these findings, we reformulate the GLE using an auxiliary variable, embedding the non-Markovian dynamics in a higher-dimensional Markovian system. This approach provides a clear physical picture of how memory influences noise, diffusion, and relaxation in non-Markovian systems.},

  abstract     = {Nonequilibrium thermodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding a wide range of physical and chemical processes. While significant advances have been made through frameworks, such as the fluctuation theorem, it remains challenging to define thermodynamic quantities, such as energy, entropy, and free energy, at the local level during nonequilibrium processes. Recently, Jinwoo and Tanaka [Sci. Rep. 5 , 7832 (2015)] have proposed a formalism (the JT formalism) that defines local thermodynamic properties via a path ensemble of microstates over time. In this work, we apply the JT formalism to the polymer collapse process as a model nonequilibrium system to observe the collapse dynamics in terms of the end-to-end distance as the mesoscopic variable. Through extensive Langevin dynamics simulations, we quantify conformational free energy, lost information, and nonequilibrium free energy as functions of time and conformation. Our results validate the JT’s work fluctuation theorem, which relates work and local nonequilibrium free energy. This study highlights the utility of the JT formalism in analyzing dynamic thermodynamic behavior in complex soft matter systems.},

In this work, we introduce a general method for refining and selecting random structures that relies on minimal prior information. The method establishes a quotient graph from the random structure using a near-neighbor finding algorithm, which subsequently guides the refinement of the initial structure. To validate this approach, we apply it to nine distinct systems, and the outcomes indicate that it effectively yields a great number of low-energy structures. This technique could be integrated into most structure prediction algorithms to generate more sound initial structures, thereby expediting the search for ground state structures.},

  abstract     = {Isotope-edited infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing site-specific structures and dynamics within proteins. However, the interpretation is often complicated by spectral congestion and environmental heterogeneity. In this study, vibrational exciton models combined with molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine the frequency distributions and IR spectra of isotope-labeled local modes (ILMs) in parallel coiled-coil dimers. Based on the difference spectra obtained by subtracting the unlabeled spectrum from the labeled one, a new method to estimate labeled local-mode frequencies is proposed. The IR peak positions predicted from both the ILMs and specific normal modes systematically deviate from their corresponding average frequencies, primarily owing to asymmetric broadening. This asymmetry, which is characterized by the skewness of the mode density of states, arises from heterogeneous fluctuations in the local environment. Time correlation analysis revealed that solvation-induced dynamics persist on timescales (0.22–3.30 ps) exceeding the vibrational lifetime, causing incomplete motional averaging and pronounced inhomogeneous broadening. These effects result in skewed frequency distributions and contribute to peak localization errors. The application of asymmetric Gaussian fitting models and perturbative corrections improved the accuracy of the ILM frequency estimates, with sub-wavenumber precision achieved when spectral separation was sufficient. The heptad-repeat architecture of coiled coils further introduced register-specific vibrational patterns, emphasizing the role of the local environment. Collectively, the results highlight the critical role of solvation-induced heterogeneity in shaping isotope-edited IR spectra and demonstrate the need to consider both dynamic and statistical spectral asymmetry when performing high-resolution vibrational analysis of proteins.},

  abstract     = {Three-body interactions have long been conjectured to play a crucial role in the stability of matter. However, rigorous studies have been scarce due to the computational challenge of evaluating small energy differences in high-dimensional lattice sums. This work provides a rigorous analysis of Bain-type cuboidal lattice transformations, which connect the face-centered cubic (fcc), mean-centered cubic (mcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and axially centered cubic (acc) lattices. Our study incorporates a general ( n , m ) Lennard-Jones (LJ) two-body potential and a long-range repulsive Axilrod–Teller–Muto (ATM) three-body potential. The two-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations are evaluated to full precision using super-exponentially convergent series expansions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to computing three-body lattice sums by converting the multi-dimensional sum into an integral involving products of Epstein zeta functions. This enables us to evaluate three-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations to machine precision within minutes on a standard laptop. Using our computational framework, we analyze the stability of cuboidal lattice phases relative to the close-packed fcc structure along a Bain transformation path for varying ATM coupling strengths. We analytically demonstrate that the ATM cohesive energy exhibits an extremum at the bcc phase and show numerically that it corresponds to a minimum for repulsive three-body forces along the Bain path. Our results indicate that strong repulsive three-body interactions can destabilize the fcc phase and render bcc energetically favorable for soft LJ potentials. However, even in this scenario, the bcc phase remains susceptible to further cuboidal distortions. These results suggest that the stability of the bcc phase is, besides vibrational, temperature, and pressure effects, strongly influenced by higher than two-body forces. Because of the wrong short-range behavior of the triple–dipole ATM model, the LJ potential is limited to exponents n > 9 for the repulsive wall, otherwise one observes distortion into a set of linear chains collapsing to the origin.},

We present a simple algorithm for rotating symmetric Cartesian tensors and employ a dispersion potential based on multipole polarizabilities.

  abstract     = {We develop a multiset matrix product state (MPS) approach based on the time-dependent variational principle to solve the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for the fermionic bath and apply it to inelastic vibrational scattering on metal surfaces. By using a Newns–Anderson model with two nuclear degrees of freedom, we investigate the vibrational energy relaxation of NO scattering on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. Our results show that the extent of vibrational relaxation depends strongly on both incident energy and molecule–surface coupling strength. Vibrational relaxation on the Au(111) surface is enhanced with increasing incident energy due to greater transient electron transfer. The dependence on molecule–surface coupling strength and effective metal bandwidth is more complex. In the case of scattering on the Au(111) surface with low initial vibrational excitation, the landscape of the adiabatic potential energy surface plays an important role. Stronger coupling enhances transient electron transfer and leads to more pronounced vibrational relaxation. However, for high initial vibrational excitation, the extent of transient electron transfer remains similar. Larger coupling strength increases adiabaticity and reduces vibrational relaxation. The vibrational relaxation on the Ag(111) surface is found to be more pronounced than on the Au(111) surface, consistent with experimental observations. Our study provides detailed insights into the nonadiabatic dynamics during molecule–surface scattering and demonstrates the utility of the multiset MPS–HEOM approach for studying such processes.},

We also present an asymptotic analysis that shows how the dynamics described by the OD-QMEs for a CT system driven by a CW field turns into rate kinetics governed by field-modified Marcus theory rate constants at long times and high temperatures (when Gaussian statistics is assumed). The ability of off-diagonal driving to open up new CT pathways that can compete with non-radiative pathways is demonstrated in the case of the Garg–Onuchic–Ambegaokar CT model driven by a CW field.},

Over the last few decades, we have developed a general theoretical formulation for PCET that includes the quantum mechanical effects of the electrons and transferring protons, including hydrogen tunneling, as well as the reorganization of the environment and the donor–acceptor fluctuations. Analytical rate constants have been derived in various well-defined regimes. This Tutorial focuses on the vibronically nonadiabatic regime, in which a golden rule rate constant expression is applicable. The goal is to provide detailed instructions on how to compute the input quantities to this rate constant expression for PCET in molecules, proteins, and electrochemical systems. The required input quantities are the inner-sphere and outer-sphere reorganization energies, the diabatic proton potential energy profiles, the electronic coupling, the reaction free energy, and the proton donor–acceptor distance distribution function. Instructions on how to determine the degree of electron–proton nonadiabaticity, which is important for determining the form of the vibronic coupling, are also provided. Detailed examples are given for thermal enzymatic PCET, homogeneous molecular electrochemical PCET, photochemical molecular PCET, and heterogeneous electrochemical PCET.

Using a SIRS model, we systematically examine how variations in the rewiring rate (representing individuals’ behavioral responses to avoid infection) and the average node degree (indicating the population’s contact density) reshape the topography of the system’s potential landscape and alter barrier heights, thereby triggering transitions between bistable and monostable regimes. Our findings reveal that rotational flux acts as a nonequilibrium driving force underlying these transitions, while the entropy production rate quantifies the associated thermodynamic cost. In addition, we identify critical slowing down, time irreversibility, and flickering frequency as effective early warning indicators of critical transitions when the rewiring rate or the average node degree of the network changes. These results offer quantitative tools and potential strategies for anticipating abrupt public health crises.},

While the viscosity of single-component lipid membranes has been extensively studied, significantly less is known about how compositional heterogeneity influences surface viscosity in mixed lipid bilayers. In this work, we employ both atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine surface viscosity trends in binary lipid mixtures composed of lipids with distinct structural characteristics: (i) mismatch in acyl chain lengths, (ii) opposite spontaneous curvatures, and (iii) variations in head group structure. The simulation data are analyzed using the Redlich–Kister model to quantify deviations from ideal mixing behavior. Our findings reveal that the greatest non-ideality in surface viscosity arises when the constituent lipids exhibit opposite spontaneous curvatures. Notably, coarse-grained models fail to capture the correct viscosity trends in systems with more complex intermolecular interactions, indicating that interfacial friction is not accurately represented at reduced resolution.},

  abstract     = {The interaction of amino acids with lipid bilayers dictates fundamental aspects of membrane protein folding, stability, and function. Quantifying the thermodynamics of amino acid solvation within the heterogeneous membrane environment remains a key challenge. Using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (>15 μ s total) and enhanced sampling techniques, we calculated the potential of mean force profiles for all standard amino acids partitioning into a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) bilayer, considering both neutral and charged states of ionizable residues. The resulting free energy landscapes consistently show substantial barriers (>5–60 kJ/mol) for penetrating the hydrophobic core, highlighting the importance of backbone polarity. Most amino acids exhibit preferential stabilization at the membrane interface, driven by a balance of hydrophobic and polar interactions. Charged residues face the largest core penalties but can be stabilized near headgroups via electrostatic interactions and local membrane adaptation. Comparisons with diverse experimental scales confirm qualitative trends but underscore quantitative differences arising from backbone effects and environmental context. This comprehensive dataset provides a basis for the construction of more complex molecular structures using amino acids as building blocks.},

  abstract     = {As a leading candidate for prebiotic synthesis of carbohydrates, the formose reaction has been the subject of extensive investigation. However, formaldehyde’s reactivity enables competing pathways that divert the formose condensation, generating dead-end products. Here, we employ our recently developed roto-translationally invariant potential-driven molecular dynamics to investigate the side pathways in the formose reaction network, identifying several new reaction mechanisms. Complementary density functional theory calculations with transition state optimization demonstrate the Cannizzaro disproportionation (yielding methanol and formate) as the dominant competing pathway, exhibiting a lower Gibbs free energy barrier (16.5 kcal mol −1 ) than both formaldehyde dimerization (26.9 kcal mol −1 ) and the formose autocatalytic cycle (18.0 kcal mol −1 ). In addition, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas may also form as by-products, with respective formation barriers of 24.2, 28.4, and 32.3 kcal mol −1 . These results advance our understanding of reaction competition in prebiotic carbohydrate synthesis.},

  abstract     = {For the past two decades, the ionic current blockade-based readout approach has been the basis of nanopore single-molecule sensing technology. Here, we introduce “nanopore electrometry,” a readout method based on measuring the modulation of the local electric field due to the translocation of the target molecule. Through comprehensive multiphysics and molecular dynamics simulations, we establish the unique strengths of nanopore electrometry that can open up new frontiers in nanopore based molecular detection. For instance, electric field concentration inside the nanopore combined with the rapid decay of the field due to charge screening leads to an asymmetric sensitivity of nanopore electrometry to the charge of the target, i.e., one can sense only cations or only anions depending on the location of the electric field sensor or the direction of the external electric field. Furthermore, simultaneous measurements from multiple local electric field sensors can be utilized for self-referenced error correction and to compensate for translocation velocity fluctuations. Finally, nanopore electrometry can also be used to detect translocations without requiring liquid electrolytes.},

Remarkably, we have observed a close alignment between the two sides of the relation in all cases we examined.

The fluctuations of molecular dimensions as well as the rotations of the molecule inside the pores require special attention to the definition of the molecular size descriptors for diffusive transport in the pores. Within the framework of the previously proposed theory of the steric free energy barrier, we suggest an effective spherical model of a molecule of an arbitrary shape and define two size descriptors—the effective average radius of the molecule and its variance. The two geometric parameters effectively encode both the fluctuations of the molecule and its rotation in the pore. Once determined for a molecule, they can be used to estimate the steric free energy in a pore of arbitrary radius. The results can be applied to diffusive transport through biological nanopores as well as to size-exclusion molecular filtering.},

  abstract     = {We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of charge exchange dynamics in low-energy Li + collisions with a MoS 2 surface, focusing on the neutralization of backscattered projectiles. Using low-energy ion scattering, we measure charge-state-resolved time-of-flight spectra for incident energies between 2.5 and 8.0 keV, under different scattering geometries and azimuthal orientations. The results reveal neutralization fractions ranging from 20% to 35% for projectiles scattered from Mo atoms, with a slight but reproducible increase with increasing energy. These values correspond exclusively to single binary collisions between Li and Mo atoms, with negligible formation of negative ions and no significant dependence on azimuthal or entrance/exit angles. The experimental results are interpreted using a time-dependent resonant charge transfer model based on the Anderson Hamiltonian in the infinite- U limit. The model incorporates the interaction of the Li 2 s level with the Mo-projected local density of states, calculated within a bond-pair formalism. Theoretical predictions reproduce well the magnitude of the measured neutral fractions, although they underestimate their energy dependence at higher energies, an effect possibly related to the omission of excited-state channels such as the Li 2 p level. A qualitative comparison with charge transfer involving sulfur atoms reveals consistent trends but a systematic overestimation by the model, likely due to reionization effects in complex multi-atom trajectories. These results demonstrate the importance of local electronic structure in charge exchange processes and highlight the need for extended models that include excited states and multi-site interactions.},

A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion of water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic confining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics simulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near a non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a hydrophobic surface, revealing a pronounced diffusion enhancement within several water layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed diffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with a quantitative accuracy, using the universal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the diffusion rate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, which has so far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids, can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is shown that the law can be used for the analysis of water dynamics under nanoscale hydrophobic confinement, which is currently a subject of intense research activity.},

Due to the immiscibility of the conducting salt phase (salt + solvent) and the diluent phase, LHCEs feature a complex microstructure of two phases forming an internal interface. In this study, we not only investigate the lithium coordination structure in the conducting salt phase but also the size and composition of its interface to the diluent phase by Voronoi tessellations. Furthermore, we investigate the influence on the ion transport by evaluating Onsager coefficients. We show that an LHCE containing the surface-active anion TFSI – creates an anion-rich internal interface, leading to enhanced ion dissociation and anticorrelated ion movement. On the other hand, the smaller FSI – anion with a more localized charge distribution and less amphiphilic character shows no enrichment at the internal interface, but rather a depletion. By increasing LiFSI concentration, we even observe a solvent-rich internal interface due to a large and branched Li–anion network. Furthermore, the less diffuse interface and enlarged Li–anion network lead to lower ion–ion anticorrelations and a stronger convective flux of the conducting salt phase, which is compensated by a flux of the diluent phase, especially in the higher concentrated LiFSI based LHCE.},

Pulse studies (3–5.5 V) reveal dynamic current responses linked to oxygen vacancy-based conductive filaments (CFs). A mechanistic model attributes RS to Vo migration and CF growth/dissolution between electrodes, with HRS1/HRS2 showing polarity-dependent asymmetry.

The coadsorption systems were created in two ways: either by the oxidation of the chlorinated Ag(111) surface or by chlorination of the oxidized sample. Depending on the stoichiometry, a series of new well-ordered coadsorbed structures containing both oxygen and chlorine atoms has been discovered. The DFT analysis has shown that all the structures correspond to the reconstruction of the silver (111) surface. Moreover, the reconstruction is formed by silver triangles with atoms occupying either fcc or hcp positions. Most chlorine and oxygen atoms occupy nearly fourfold positions similar to those in the p (4 × 4)-O and (3 × 3)-Cl reconstructions. A characteristic feature of all coadsorbed structures is the presence of bright objects, which we associate with ClO 3 and ClO quasimolecules. Using DFT, we calculated the O 1s binding energies for all oxygen atoms in the structures. The binding energy of oxygen atoms in the nearly fourfold positions is 528 eV [as in the Ag(111)- p (4 × 4)-O phase], while the binding energies of oxygen atoms in ClO 3 and ClO quasimolecules are 531 and 530 eV, respectively, indicating their electrophilic nature.},

Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) to ∼136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to ∼70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the ITC for both directions of heat flow.},

We illustrate that measurement of the null angles obtained in both schemes may be used together to calibrate the SFG response between three polarization combinations. We then demonstrate that these two null angles provide the required phase information to determine the surface hyperpolarizability ratio, even at buried interfaces where calibration is typically more difficult, and without requiring a heterodyne scheme. This makes extracting the electronic structure information directly from the SFG spectra more accurate and truly independent of the molecular orientation distribution.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we show how to maximize absorption of plasmonic nanoparticles in terms of size, geometry, and material. We determined that the main effect dictating the optimal amount of optical losses is radiation damping, and how it depends on nanoparticle size and geometry. Based on this, we find that for many combinations of sizes and geometries, losses in pure metals are far from optimal. To overcome the aforementioned issue, alloying is presented as a straightforward and flexible way of modulating the optical losses. Furthermore, strategies for tuning the optical losses to values above, between, and even below those in pure plasmonic metals are developed in terms of selecting the right alloy composition. In some cases, alloys showed a multifold increase in absorption when compared to pure plasmonic metals. The physical reasons governing such changes are elucidated based on the electronic structure changes during alloying of different metals, which enables generalization of the results to other systems. In addition to increasing absorption, electronic structure changes can also be utilized for channeling the absorbed energy to suit different purposes, such as hot carrier generation for photocatalysis or solar energy harvesting. Overall, these results establish alloying as a powerful tool for designing nanostructures for applications that utilize light absorption.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid photocatalysts consisting of molecular catalyst functionalized semiconductors have attracted intense recent interest in solar fuel applications. Charge transfer interactions between the molecular catalyst and semiconductor have long been recognized to affect catalyst properties by controlling photoinduced charge separation across the semiconductor/molecule interface. In this paper, we investigate how such an interaction can also affect Fano resonance between the catalyst vibration and the intraband absorption of semiconductors. Using [Re(3,3′-disulfide-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO) 3 Cl] (ReS 2 ) functionalized CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) as a model system, we show that the CO stretching mode of the catalyst can interact with the broad intraband absorption of conduction band (CB) electrons. Detailed analysis shows that the Fano resonance asymmetry factor q decreases at larger ZnS shell thicknesses. This experimental finding is consistent with a theoretical model that assumes the vibronic interaction leading to the observed Fano resonances is mediated by effective charge transfer interactions between the QD conduction band electron and the adsorbed catalyst. Because of the type I band alignment in the CdSe/ZnS QDs, an increasing shell thickness leads to a decreasing CB electron density at the ZnS shell surface, reducing electronic coupling and the charge transfer interaction with the adsorbed catalysts.},

  abstract     = {CuWO 4 shows promise as a suitable material for solar-driven water splitting to aid progress towards sustainable and carbon-free energy generation. In this work, we report a computational study of catalytic water splitting and hydrogen generation at CuWO 4 surfaces, employing calculations based on the density functional theory with on-site Coulomb and long-range dispersion corrections (DFT+U-D3). We have analyzed three potential thermodynamic and kinetic reaction profiles at the pristine CuWO 4 surface and one potential profile at the reduced CuWO 4 surface, examining the structural and electronic properties of the intermediates, as well as the transition states along the different pathways. Our findings reveal that along the pathway on the reduced surface, oxygen vacancies introduced in the surface led to under-coordinated Cu and W atoms and localized excess electrons, which significantly enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction.},

In the on-state of the device, the system is typically brought into the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature, where the atomic mobility is sufficiently high to cause demixing driven by the electric field. The electromigration force F responsible for ionic migration is proportional to the electric field E via the effective charge Z * ( F = | e | Z * E , where e is the electron charge), which is thus of great relevance for the electrothermal modeling of the devices. In this work, we computed Z * for a prototypical GeAsSe selector alloy by leveraging a non-equilibrium Green’s function method based on density functional theory. The effective charges in the metallic liquid were obtained by calculating the atomic forces, including the wind force, in the presence of both an electric field and an electronic current.},

Through the five-step screening method, the suitable catalysts, respectively, applicable to the generation of vinyl chloride (CH 2 CHCl), ethylene (CH 2 CH 2 ), and ethane (CH 3 CH 3 ) were finally determined. The limiting potential of Fe@TGCN for reducing 1,2-DCE to CH 3 CH 3 is lower, at −0.47 V ( gauche -C 2 H 4 Cl 2 ) and −0.50 V ( trans -C 2 H 4 Cl 2 ), respectively. The activity mechanism indicates that Fe@TGCN is at the vertex of the volcano plot, confirming that the intensity of its interaction with the reactants is in optimal equilibrium. In addition, we further examined the influence of hydroxyl modification on the selectivity of DCEDR. The results show that hydroxyl modification significantly weakens the adsorption strength of intermediates (such as *CH 2 CH 2 Cl) through a steric hindrance effect and electron delocalization, as well as reduces the desorption energy of CH 2 CH 2 and enhances its selectivity. This study provides theoretical guidance for the rational design of DCEDR electrocatalysts and reveals the key role of ligand modification strategies in regulating the reaction pathway.},

  abstract     = {Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are valuable as solid lubricants because of their layered structure, which allows for easy shearing along the basal planes. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we conducted a first-principles study of the sliding properties of several TMD bilayers: MoS 2 , MoTe 2 , WS 2 , WSe 2 , VS 2 , VSe 2 , TaS 2 , TaSe 2 , TiS 2 , TiSe 2 , HfS 2 , ZrS 2 , MoS 2 WS 2 , and MoS 2 VS 2 . Given the crucial role of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in accurately describing the interlayer interactions in TMD bilayers, we employed vdW-corrected DFT functionals. Our research confirms the dominance of vdW effects by estimating the fraction of interlayer binding energy attributable to these interactions. We also examined how the choice of different vdW-corrected DFT functionals might influence quantitative results. Using MoS 2 as a reference TMD bilayer system, we found that most other TMD bilayers studied exhibit stronger interlayer bonds and greater corrugation. However, TiSe 2 shows a profile similar to MoS 2 , while, interestingly, TiS 2 , VS 2 , and ZrS 2 are characterized by weaker bonding and lower corrugation than MoS 2 . We explored relationships between various properties of TMD bilayers, with a particular focus on potential connections between tribological and electronic properties often characteristic of solid interfaces. To this end, we evaluated adhesion energies, work of separation, charge density redistributions in interface regions, differential charge densities, and corrugation. While corrugation and, therefore, resistance to sliding generally tend to increase with the size of the chalcogen element and are typically proportional to the adhesion energy, the relationships between other structural, energetic, and electronic properties do not follow a single, well-defined trend.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing single/dual atom catalysts as well as the crystallographic plane effect to promote the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted extensive attention. However, there are few works to combine the two effects with the surface plasmon resonance effect based on the first-principles periodic slab models. Our calculated results can be summarized as three points. First, we investigated the adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of *N 2 and *NNH on Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) facets with single or dual Fe atoms doped. The strongest end-on and side-on adsorption occur at single and dimer Fe atoms doped Au(100) surfaces, respectively. More importantly, the N 2 side-on adsorption configuration significantly reduces the ΔG of the first hydrogenation step. Second, we investigated the reason why there is a lower adsorption ΔG for the N 2 side-on adsorption on dimer-Fe-doped Au(100). It was discovered that the interatomic distance of the Fe dimer exhibits a strong correlation with adsorption strength. When the Fe dimer is doped on the Au(100) surface, the dimer will relax due to local strain, enabling a stronger N 2 side-on adsorption. Finally, we compared the photon absorption capacity between side-on and end-on nitrogen adsorption configurations, revealing that the latter exhibits enhanced light absorption capability at lower photon energies and across broader wavelength ranges. This theoretical research highlights the superiority of the N 2 side-on adsorption configuration in plasmonic photoelectrochemical NRR and shows the influence of surface local strain and dynamic relaxation for side-on adsorption, which could be referenced to design efficient side-on adsorption catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Catecholamines (CAs), endogenous neurotransmitters, accumulate in pulmonary fluids under pathological conditions (e.g., chronic stress and pulmonary inflammation), yet their oxidation fate within the microenvironment—a high-oxygen and air–liquid interface—remains unclear. Here, we employ a microdroplet system (a platform mirroring microenvironment interfacial properties) to investigate the interfacial oxidation of CAs, under environmentally relevant conditions. We demonstrate that •OH generated at the air–liquid interface dominates CAs-to-toxic product conversion, with reaction rates surpassing bulk-phase kinetics by over six orders of magnitude. Unlike conventional electrocatalytic methods, this process requires no catalysts, oxidants, or external energy inputs—only nebulized aqueous droplets. The mechanism, validated by MS/MS analysis, extends universally to six CAs, completing oxidation within hundreds of microseconds. Moreover, we demonstrate that environmental factors, such as pH, metal ions, and antioxidants, can significantly modulate the oxidation pathway and intermediate formation of CAs in microdroplets. This work advances the understanding of endogenous chemical toxicity in air–liquid interface microenvironments and provides a predictive framework for assessing oxidative hazards in patients with CA dysregulation under environmental stress.},

Here, we utilize the magneto-photoluminescence (Magneto-PL) effects as an effective tool to reveal the underlying spin-related opto-physical process in 3D LHPs. We find that the magneto-PL effects of 3D LHPs CH 3 NH 3 Pb(Br/I/I x Cl 1-x ) 3 thin films are negative and tunable at room temperature, indicating the remarkable suppression of their PL emission intensity by magnetic fields. Moreover, the largest magneto-PL magnitude of −3.60% is realized in CH 3 NH 3 PbI x Cl 3−x thin film at a magnetic field strength of ±1 T; oppositely, in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 thin film, it is merely −0.75%. Combining magneto-optical spectroscopy and crystallographic analysis of 3D LHP thin films, we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay of the Rashba SOC-driven spin mixing and Zeeman splitting between dark singlet and bright triplet excitons, promoting spin conversion from dark excitonic states to bright states. In addition, we demonstrate that the Rashba SOC is tunable and has a direct relationship with the crystalline phase transition and grain size by modifying halide-components, which leads to the halide-components dependent magneto-PL effects in 3D LHP thin films. This work paves the way for improving the luminescence property of opto-spintronics materials via modulating Rashba SOC.},

In this paper, a device consisting of a two-dimensional grating, a magneto-optical material layer, and a metal plate is proposed, which can realize polarization-independent nonreciprocity. Two pairs of complementary nonreciprocal peaks can be obtained for TE and TM polarizations in the wavelength range of 10.3–10.8 μ m, with nonreciprocal efficiencies exceeding 89% and up to 92%. Moreover, at the wavelengths of 10.696 and 10.760 μ m, the polarization-independent nonreciprocal phenomenon can be formed; meanwhile, the efficiency exceeds 87.5% and reaches up to 92%. At polarization-independent nonreciprocal peaks where resonance occurs, through careful analysis of the distribution of electromagnetic fields and the use of coupled mode theory, we have discovered the physical mechanisms that form nonreciprocal phenomena and verified the data.

Here, we present a comprehensive study on the fast-structural relaxation phenomenon observed in V 2 O 3 thin films grown by the pulsed laser deposition technique using a Nd:YAG pulsed infrared laser source. To assess the quality of the interface, structural change, and chemical composition, a quantitative analysis of the transmission electron microscopy images was conducted. Strain analysis reveals that structural relaxation in V 2 O 3 thin films occurs rapidly within the initial ∼4 nm from the film–substrate interface. This relaxation mechanism involves the formation of dislocations near the interface. These findings suggest that enhanced strain coupling at the film–substrate interface contributes to the observed relaxation behavior, underscoring the sensitivity of V 2 O 3 ’s strongly correlated metallic phase to crystalline defects and structural disorder. Understanding these interfacial relaxation dynamics is critical for the design and optimization of V 2 O 3 -based functional devices.},

The optical response of monolayers is entangled with the substrate on which they are grown or deposited on, often a two-dimensional material itself. Understanding how the properties of the two-dimensional monolayers can be tuned via the substrate is therefore essential. Here we employ angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectroscopy on highly ordered molecular monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to systematically investigate the angle-dependent optical response as a function of the thickness of the hBN flake. We observe that light reflection and emission occur in a strongly directed fashion and that the direction of light reflection and emission is dictated by the hBN flake thickness. Transfer matrix simulations reproduce the experimental data and show that optical interference effects in hBN are at the origin of the angle-dependent optical properties. While our study focuses on molecular monolayers on hBN, our findings are expected to be general and relevant for any 2D material placed on top of a substrate given the ubiquitous presence of optical interferences. Our findings demonstrate the need to carefully choose substrate parameters for a given experimental geometry but also highlight opportunities in applications such as lighting technology, where the direction of light emission can be controlled via substrate thickness.},

Compared to the well-studied LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 (001) interface, the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 (110) interface remains relatively unexplored. Here, we investigate the interfacial properties of n -type LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 (110) heterostructures, including cleavage energy, two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formation, and the effects of biaxial strain, using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that the (110) interface has a higher cleavage energy than the (001) interface, indicating stronger interfacial bonding interactions. In addition, we find that a critical LaAlO 3 thickness of five unit cells is required to induce 2DEG formation in the (110) heterostructure, compared to four unit cells in the (001) system. Notably, biaxial strain in the (110) heterostructure induces behavior opposite to that observed in the (001) system. Compressive strain reduces the polarization strength in the LaAlO 3 film, lowering the critical thickness required for 2DEG formation, whereas tensile strain enhances polarization, increasing the critical thickness for 2DEG formation. This contrasting strain response in the (110) and (001) heterostructures can be explained by their distinct crystallographic orientations at the interface.

  abstract     = {This study exposes novel spin filtering phenomena in ultra-thin MoS 2 films deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The novelty lies in the explicit dependence of spin polarization and filtering efficiency on the film thickness. MoS 2 , a transition metal dichalcogenide, exhibits promising spintronic properties due to its intrinsic spin–orbit coupling and the potential to control spin orientation. We prepared MoS 2 films of various thicknesses on ITO substrates and investigated their spin-filtering behavior using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Results reveal that the degree of spin polarization is highly sensitive to the MoS 2 layer thickness, with ultra-thin films (4 nm) exhibiting reverse spin polarization compared to thicker films (10–15 nm). This spin flipping is attributed to the structural deformations in MoS 2 thin films, such as twisting and folding, that break spatial symmetry and induce chirality. These chiral distortions modulate the electronic states and promote spin-selective transport in the crystal. The findings underscore the tunability of spin filtering in MoS 2 /ITO structures through geometric control, offering valuable insights for developing chirality-assisted spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Supercooled liquids exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors: At the microscopic level, the dynamics is heterogeneous spatially, known as dynamic heterogeneity. At the macroscopic level, the shear viscosity decreases as the shear rate increases with a power law, known as shear thinning. The relation between these two universal dynamical phenomena remains elusive. With simulations of several model liquids in two and three dimensions, we show that they are quantitatively bridged by localized elasticity embodied as transient clusters that elastically respond to shear. Prominent dynamic heterogeneity emerges right after the massive yielding of these clusters, which is initiated by shear transformation zones and facilitated by elasticity-mediated interaction. With this picture, a scaling law relating shear thinning to the characteristic length of dynamic heterogeneity is found.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbors. These pseudo neighbors enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam–Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyze bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real–real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob–Andersen model and its mean field variant, real–pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behavior with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T K . We propose a phenomenological relation between T K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.},

Because this novel approach involves no restrictions on the type of interactions and the nature of the species in solution, it provides a powerful tool to gain understanding of the role played by solute–solvent intermolecular interaction asymmetries either in the presence or absence of hydrogen bonding interactions. Finally, we illustrate the formalism through a detailed analysis of the anomalies of aqueous ethanol solutions and test some conjectured hypotheses underlying the anomalies that point to their plausible connection to changes in the hydrogen bonding between species.},

  abstract     = {The inclusion of Nuclear Quantum Effects (NQEs) in molecular dynamics simulations is increasingly recognized as essential for accurately modeling systems involving light nuclei, particularly hydrogen. Classical approaches, such as standard ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), are not suited to predict key quantum-mechanical phenomena such as zero-point motion and proton tunneling, which can critically influence the structural behavior. This is especially true in H-bonded systems, where the strength and directionality of interactions are highly sensitive to quantum delocalization. In this work, we investigate the impact of NQEs on liquid hydrogen fluoride (HF) at standard conditions and subjected to strong external electric fields by comparing classical nuclei AIMD and path-integral AIMD simulations. HF presents a rich H-bonding network and strong molecular dipole moments, leading to the manifestation of important NQEs even in the absence of the field. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that quantum effects significantly alter the response of bulk liquid HF to applied electric fields, leading to enhanced proton delocalizations favoring the protolysis reaction 2 HF ⇌ H 2 F + + F − . Similarly to water, indeed, the inclusion of NQEs lowers by one-third the field threshold necessary for dissociating HF molecules [i.e., 0.15 V/Å (classical) vs 0.05 V/Å (quantum)] and increases proton mobility. These differences become particularly evident under moderate-to-strong field strengths, where quantum simulations predict molecular dissociation and Grotthuss diffusion processes that are either absent or underestimated in classical AIMD simulations, though the general mechanism for proton migration is unaltered by the inclusion of quantum effects.},

In this work, we investigate the influence of the variation in halide ions (F − , Cl − , Br − , I − ) of choline salts used on the thermodynamic and physicochemical properties of choline halide-based DESs. Our findings show that the density of choline halide-based DESs decreases nonlinearly with an increasing mole fraction of water, following a trend based on the size of the halides, with choline iodide showing the highest density. Temperature-dependent density data reveal that the thermal expansion coefficient decreases slightly with increasing water content, indicating a more stable volume at a higher mole fraction of water. The excess molar volume ( V E ) of the DES mixtures exhibits complex behavior depending on the choline halide used, with both negative and positive V E values observed across different water mole fractions. These variations are linked to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the DES components and water molecules. In addition, viscosities decrease with increasing water content, suggesting the disruption of hydrogen bonding networks and enhanced mobility of the ions, which contributes to the observed increase in conductivity. The excess molar Gibbs energies, enthalpies, and entropies of activation have also been determined.},

Although numerous studies have investigated nanoconfined water systems, most have exclusively focused on symmetric hydrophobic confinement. In contrast, the phase behavior of water under asymmetric hydrophobic/hydrophilic confinement remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically studied the compression properties, phase diagram, and freezing/melting transitions of two-dimensional (2D) water/ice (monolayer to trilayer) confined between mica and graphene nanoslits. We establish a compression phase diagram in the plane of nanocapillary width and pressure, revealing that symmetry breaking of water–surface interactions induces unique 2D ice structures. In particular, we report four previously unidentified 2D ice phases: monolayer triangular ice (ML-TI), bilayer AA- and AB-stacked triangular/hexagonal mixed ice (BL-AB-THMI and BL-AA-THMI), and trilayer triangular/hexagonal mixed ice (TL-THMI). These structures emerge from the synergistic interplay between the templating effect of the mica surface and confinement effects. Our study fills a fundamental gap in the physics of asymmetric nanoconfinement, provides new mechanistic insights into structural transitions, and offers guidance for nanotechnology applications.},

The thermal transport characteristics of CO 2 hydrates are of particular importance in these promising applications. Here, the role of CO 2 molecular occupancy and external electric fields on the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of sI-type CO 2 hydrates is explored using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Results reveal that increasing CO 2 occupancy in large 5 12 6 2 cages enhances κ by up to 27.2%, while small 5 12 cages contribute minimally (<1%). The water framework dominates heat transport (>90%), with CO 2 @5 12 6 2 and CO 2 @5 12 cages contributing ∼17%–18% and <1%, respectively, mediated by synergistic host–guest interactions. External electric fields reduce κ by around 4%–5% due to enhanced low-frequency phonon localization in CO 2 and intensified anharmonic scattering. Phonon analyses, including phonon density of states, phonon lifetime, phonon participation ratio, and spectral energy density, reveal that CO 2 occupancy suppresses water lattice vibrations, while electric fields redistribute phonon modes, reducing delocalization.

However, the experimental measurements of the thermal properties of high-temperature molten salts suffer severe obstacles due to their strong corrosiveness and toxicity, necessitating high-precision multiscale predictive models. This study focuses on the Na 2 CO 3 –NaCl–KCl ternary eutectic molten salt system, integrating experimental measurement with deep potential molecular dynamics simulation to systematically investigate its high-temperature thermal properties. The experimental results show that the melting point, enthalpy of fusion, and specific heat capacity of ternary eutectic salt is 852.65 K, 392.00 J/g, and 1.268 J/(g K), respectively, indicating the outstanding heat storage capacity. Initial datasets generated from first-principle molecular dynamics are optimized using the DP-GEN enhanced sampling strategy, and the simulation results reveal that the density decreased from 1.776 g/cm 3 (873 K) to 1.690 g/cm 3 (1073 K), with a maximum deviation of 2.68% compared to experimental data. The specific heat capacity is 1.276 J/(g K), exhibiting a negligible error of 0.63% against experimental values. Viscosity declined from 3.117 mPa s (873 K) to 1.755 mPa s (1073 K), consistent with the Stokes–Einstein relationship, while thermal conductivity slightly decreased with rising temperature. This study validates the high accuracy and reliability of the DP model in predicting thermal properties of molten salt and provides theoretical insights for material design and operational optimization of high-temperature molten salt thermal energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Molecular crystals with hydrogen bonds undergo a phase transition and symmetrization of the hydrogen-bond network at high pressures. Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) also undergoes a similar phenomenon; however, the pressure at which it occurs remains unclear. This study employed the path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) and static density functional theory calculations to investigate hydrogen-bond symmetrization in LiOH crystals at high pressures. The nuclear quantum effects centralized the protons and significantly lowered the pressure required for hydrogen-bond symmetrization (∼500 GPa in PIMD, compared with the 1200 GPa recorded in the static density functional theory calculations). Furthermore, the pressure required for symmetrization in the deuterated system [PIMD(D)] was higher than that required in the nondeuterated system [PIMD(H)]. This indicated that the H/D isotope effect significantly affects the hydrogen-bond symmetrization. These results demonstrate that nuclear quantum and isotope effects significantly affect hydrogen-bond symmetrization in LiOH under extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {Interatomic Coulombic electron capture (ICEC) is an environment-mediated process in which a free electron attaches to a species by transferring excess energy to a neighbor. While previous theoretical investigations assumed fixed nuclei, recent studies indicate that nuclear dynamics significantly influences the ICEC process. In this work, we incorporate the vibrational motion into an analytical model of the ICEC cross section, including both energy and electron transfer. To validate this approach, we compare the results to the adiabatic-nuclei approximation based on fixed-nuclei ab initio R-matrix calculations. We apply our theory to the helium–neon dimer, which is ideal for studying diverse dynamical effects. We show that while vibrational dynamics can slightly reduce ICEC efficiency, ICEC remains dominant over photorecombination and can trigger dimer dissociation. Accounting for the nuclear motion also enables to describe the broadening of the electron spectrum and enables evaluation of temperature-dependent cross sections—capabilities beyond the reach of fixed-nuclei approaches.},

  abstract     = {The physics of particle recollisions offers a window into the complex dynamics of interactions between charged particles and external fields. While simple classical models often describe these recollisions by focusing on the motion driven by an external field alone, e.g., the three-step model in high harmonic generation, this assumption excludes the possibility of chaotic behavior. In this work, we explore how chaotic motion emerges in recollision processes by including the strength of the Coulomb potential as a parameter. Through a continuous scan of system parameters, we uncover the transition from regularity to chaos. Interestingly, we find a transition from regular to chaotic to regular motion as a function of the 2D scan of Coulomb strength and field strength. In addition, scanning over the initial phase of the driving field allows us to identify the sensitive dependence on initial conditions characteristic of chaotic motion. Our findings reveal that the system can exhibit chaotic dynamics on timescales much longer than the initial recollision.},

In addition to these natural CIs, an external electric field can create light-induced conical intersections (LICIs), as the dipole–field interaction shifts the coupled potential energy surfaces. This work explores the effect of LICIs on the minor molecular (NH + H 2 ) channel of ammonia photodissociation, building on prior work that studied the major radical (NH 2 + H) channel. The molecular channel can involve intersystem crossing to the low-lying triplet state. A Floquet Hamiltonian was used to simulate the dynamics of ammonia photodissociation in the presence of an external laser field. A total of 230 000 quasi-classical trajectory surface-hopping calculations were performed with SHARC using recently reported diabatic potential energy matrices, dipole matrices, and spin–orbit coupling matrices, which were fitted using neural networks. With the field off, 0.04% of trajectories with a total energy of 8.4 eV yielded triplet NH. With an electric field strength of 0.02 Ha/ea 0 , over 0.3% of trajectories yielded triplet NH (an eightfold increase), and this value was even larger for higher field strengths.},

Under various doping conditions and droplet sizes ranging from 10 4 to 10 6 helium atoms, both neutral argon and xenon clusters can exhibit foam-like structures, in which helium atoms reside between rare gas atoms and inhibit the formation of a fully bound structure. Under comparable doping conditions and droplet sizes, argon clusters exhibit even fewer bound structures, best described by more dispersed distributions compared to xenon clusters. Under low doping conditions—despite differences in droplet sizes (10 4 vs 10 6 helium atoms per droplet)—argon clusters yield broad, Gaussian distance distributions. Moreover, increasing the doping pressure while maintaining the same droplet conditions promotes the formation of more tightly bound clusters, with a greater contribution from the van der Waals distance in the overall pair-distance distributions. Finally, electron impact ionization of both rare gas clusters triggers a collapse of the foam-like structures, resulting in clusters that are most accurately described by a single dominant interatomic distance.},

  abstract     = {Single-atom catalysts has emerged as a groundbreaking concept in catalysis, where individual metal atoms are anchored on supports such as carbon-based materials, oxides, or nitrides, serving as isolated active sites for catalytic reactions. In the present study, we theoretically explore the geometries, bonding properties, electronic structures, and potential catalytic performances of the recently synthesized one-dimensional (1D) M-porphyrin chains, in which the M–N 4 –C motif acts as the active site for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Three configurations of 1D M-porphyrin chains (M = Ni, Zn) were investigated, including (a) M-porphyrin ribbon, (b) butadiyne-linked M-porphyrin, and (c) M-porphyrin-fused graphene nanoribbons. The calculation results reveal that all those 1D M-porphyrin chains are semiconductors. Energy decomposition analysis combined with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) shows that the metal–ligand interaction in Ni-porphyrin is stronger than that in Zn-porphyrin. Compared to Zn-porphyrin chains, Ni-porphyrin chains exhibit stronger adsorption and superior electron transfer capabilities, which is attributed to enhanced orbital hybridization between the Ni 3d atomic orbitals and adsorbed oxygen 2p orbitals. The catalytic reaction pathways of these chains are similar for all those SACs and depend slightly on linker types, highlighting the importance of the local environment of the M–N 4 –C coordination framework. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of SACs with tailored properties, offering significant potential for applications in energy conversion and environmental catalysis.},

The temperature dependence of the THz absorption spectra of powdered CH 4 @C 60 was measured between 5 and 300 K. At temperatures below 50 K, the THz spectrum of CH 4 shows a single line centered at 214 cm −1 , which broadens and shifts to a higher energy as the temperature increases. These effects are explained by the anharmonicity of the CH 4 –C 60 interaction potential function. The model involves the center-of-mass motion of CH 4 in a spherically symmetric potential well. Line intensities are modeled by invoking an electric dipole moment induced by the translational displacement of CH 4 from the center of the cage C 60 . The potential function and the dipole moment parameters were derived from the temperature dependence of the THz absorption spectra and compared with the parameters of previously studied endofullerenes. The quantum chemistry calculations reproduce the CH 4 translation motion frequency and the potential function remarkably well.},

The main conclusion is that SBCT, or exciton localization, is hindered in bent molecules. The proposed model introduces a key novelty: two reaction coordinates are required to describe SBCT in bent molecules, whereas linear systems can be adequately described by using a single coordinate. The model predicts that (i) bending reduces the degree of dissymmetry and induces nonmonotonic changes in the dipole moment, and (ii) the TDM of fluorescence exhibits monotonic increase or decrease with bending, contingent on the parity of the lower excited state. Crucially, the two-dimensional framework accounts for both the magnitude changes and rotational effects of the dipole moment and the TDM. The predictions of the model are aligned with available experimental data, validating its conclusions. Additionally, the article provides simple formulas for quantifying symmetry-breaking extent and TDM magnitudes (for absorption and fluorescence), offering practical utility for experimentalists in designing studies and interpreting results. These insights advance the design of optoelectronic materials, where controlled symmetry breaking is critical.},

A line list for the B 2 Σ + –X 2 Σ + transition system of CaF was calculated and extended from v ≤ 20 to v = 35 using empirical potential functions obtained through a direct-potential fit approach with observed transition frequencies. The line strengths were predicted using the scaled transition dipole moments calculated ab initio . The simulated intensities and transition positions with the present line list agree well with the spectra of high-resolution molecular spectroscopy from the literature and of LIBS from this work. Based on the simulated spectra of the CaF B–X system, the derived temperatures with the LIBS spectra vary across different wavelength regions. For example, with the same spectrum of delay time t = 13 μ s, the obtained temperatures with λ ≈ 514–529 nm and λ ≈ 514–570 nm are 4000 and 5500 K, respectively. However, this discrepancy decreases with increasing delay time. For t = 23 μ s, the obtained temperatures (3700 ± 200–4000 ± 100 K) are already in agreement within the estimated uncertainties. Self-absorption in the spectrum also influences the simulated temperature. Excluding the influences from self-absorption, the derived temperature (6000 ± 200 K) with the CaF molecular spectrum of λ ≈ 529–542 nm of t = 13 μ s is close to the ionization temperature (6600 K) obtained with the Saha–Boltzmann fit from the observed atomic/ionic lines of Ca in the plasma. The present line list can be adopted in plasma diagnostics and in sensitive detections of fluorine with the CaF spectrum in hot environments.},

We simulate exciton dynamics in systems with different architectures—including single-ring and stacked ring configurations of varying sizes—initialized in one of their symmetry-protected dark states. For single-ring systems, our findings reveal how different initial dark states influence exciton transfer during the discharge phase, how ring size affects the discharge rate, and how noise impacts storage efficiency as a function of ring size. For stacked ring systems, we demonstrate how the efficiency of exciton transfer to the sink depends on the inter-ring coupling strength.

  abstract     = {In the interstellar medium (ISM), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are believed to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of all interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their potential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry. This, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of the possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected cyanocyclopentadiene, c-C 5 H 5 CN. Given the physical conditions of the dense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is crucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be satisfied. In such case, an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance involves taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species—He or H 2 . In this paper, the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of the most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene) with He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates high anisotropy and is characterized by a global potential well of −101.8 cm −1 . Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling method for total energies up to 125 cm −1 . The resulting rotational state-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients for temperatures up to 20 K and propensity rules are also discussed.},

The MLP is based on the combination of high-dimensional neural network atomic potentials using the DeePMD-kit package, trained on prior ab initio molecular dynamics data, with selective treatment of the excited molecule, allowing us to capture complex energy redistribution dynamics in condensed-phase environments. In particular, the MLP is capable of accurately describing the desorption process of a single CO molecule within an aggregate of 50 CO molecules, in excellent agreement with both previous theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. The MLP provides a much finer description of the translational and rotational energy distributions, capturing their character with high fidelity and allowing a more detailed comparison with experimental results. Furthermore, the analysis of the rotational energy, resolved over specific translational energies, revealed new insights into the coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom during the photodesorption process. This novel approach opens new perspectives for extensive statistical studies on desorption energies and detailed investigations of surface molecule excitations and the exploration of larger-scale models incorporating periodic boundary conditions to simulate more realistic CO aggregates.},

Here, we systematically investigate the excited-state properties of corrole complexes with diverse peripheral substitutions and central atom coordination through time-resolved fluorescence, femtosecond transient absorption spectra, and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that aromatic substituents affect frontier molecular orbitals, prompting intramolecular charge transfer. Coordination with main group P(V) and Ga(III) enhances macrocycle rigidity and symmetry, significantly boosting fluorescence emission rates and absorption efficiency of the Soret band, while improving intersystem crossing probabilities. Transition metal Mn(III) accelerates charge transfer from ligands to metal and shortens internal conversion and intersystem crossing times via d–pπ bonding interaction. This study establishes a foundational understanding for designing high-performance photosensitizers.},

  abstract     = {The belt shaped functionalized hydrocarbon receptors have attracted great interest because of their special “frustum-like” configuration, in which the openings at the upper and lower ends (dual-functional sites) are more beneficial when used as ion recognition sites. In this paper, the binding behaviors of the belt shaped dual-functional hydrocarbon receptors for halogen anions (Cl − and Br − ) and alkali metal cations (K + , Rb + , and Cs + ) were investigated in depth using density functional theory calculations. It is found that anion/cation binding can be enhanced and synergistically regulated by counterion and the corresponding conformational changes of the receptor, which well reflects the electrical complementary matching and mutual reinforcement effects. The nature of the receptor–ion interactions was further elucidated by combining the noncovalent intermolecular interaction with molecular electrostatic potential analysis. The complexation process of Cs + /Cl − with the receptor was dynamically tracked using ab initio molecular dynamics simulation.},

Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) is a powerful tool to probe these processes; however, conventional optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) based on fluorescence intensity suffers from environmental noise in biological systems. Here, we demonstrate that lifetime-based ODMR overcomes these limitations and delivers robust nanoscale measurements in both aqueous and physiological environments. Comparative studies across dry, deionized water, and simulated body fluid conditions have revealed that lifetime-based ODMR preserves spectral fidelity and contrast despite intensity fluctuations, whereas intensity-based methods fail. In addition, we characterized the microwave-induced thermal effects, showing that lifetime-based sensing enables precise temperature tracking under dynamic conditions. This study established lifetime-based ODMR in FNDs as a superior technique for nanoscale quantum sensing in complex biological medium solutions, paving the way for applications such as intracellular thermometry and real-time biomolecular interaction studies.},

This result is a generalization of our previously obtained exact formula for the 1-body wave function. As in the 1-body case, here we show that for many-body ground wave functions that cannot achieve variable separation, our method is still far more efficient than the conventional basis expansion method both in representing the wave function and in calculating the energy. The exact factorization ansatz proposed in the present case study shall provide important insight into the general structure of many-body wave functions.},

The determination of an optimal path length requires a predefined step size, while the ideal step size must account for errors along the selected path. Ensuring reversibility further complicates this tuning problem. In this paper, we present a method for locally adapting the step size in NUTS that is an instance of the Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework. Our approach guarantees reversibility with an acceptance probability that depends exclusively on the conditional distribution of the step size. We validate our step-size-adaptive NUTS method on Neal’s funnel density and a high-dimensional normal distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness in challenging scenarios.},

Despite containing identical chemical species (K + , OH − , and H 2 O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from 30 meV Å −1 (at training concentration) to 90 meV Å −1 (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol l −1 ) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56–17.89 mol l −1 ), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide–hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations—a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.},

Although our ansätze do not explicitly include correlations between individual electron groups, we show that they accurately reproduce the underlying physics and chemical properties, such as dissociation curve, dipole moment, reaction energy, ionization energy, or atomic sizes. We identify the optimal number of core electrons and define physical core sizes for Li to Mg atoms. Our results demonstrate that core electrons can be effectively decoupled from valence electrons. We show that the core part of the WF remains nearly constant across different molecules and their geometries, enabling the transfer and reuse of the core part in WFs of more complex systems. This work provides a general framework for WF decomposition, offering potential advantages in computing and studying larger systems, and possibly paving the way for ab initio development of effective core potentials. Although currently limited to small molecules due to scaling, we highlight several directions for extending our method it to larger systems.},

Yet, our analysis tools allow one to reliably extract energy-transfer times between different regions or constituents of the multimolecular system, the structure of transition densities, and the relative degree of excitation of constituents. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing the excitation-energy transfer between six bacteriochlorophyll molecules from the B850 ring of the light-harvesting complex 2 of the purple bacterium Rhodoblastus acidophilus. Our analysis shows that energy is transferred through this system on a time scale of ∼45 fs.

Here, it is generalized to treat fermion systems with odd numbers of spins. Elementary modules made of primitive spin-pair modules augmented by an odd-spin tag module are classified into various module classes and further mapped to geometric building blocks of various sizes and shapes to illustrate the hierarchical structure and symmetry of the state space. Spin eigenfunctions are generated from linear combinations of single-spin-tagged or triple-spin-tagged elementary modules using only symmetry and orthogonality conditions, and universal recursive relations for systems with arbitrary odd numbers of spins can be obtained. This work explores the structure and symmetry of the state space of fermion systems that complement previous studies, which may provide new insights into general quantum many-body systems and spin dynamics.},

However, SAPT0/aug-cc-pVDZ and SAPT2+/aug-cc-pVDZ total interaction energies on average rely on error cancellations, so they should be used with caution when parameterizing SAPT-based force fields and intermolecular potentials. SAPT2+(3)/aug-cc-pVTZ shows quantitatively accurate component energies, making it the preferred choice for applications when feasible.

While for weak excitonic coupling, cross peaks can be understood as the incoherent mixing of linear signals of the two chromophores, these features reflect excitonic delocalization as the coupling increases. We highlight that A-2DES offers enhanced sensitivity to coherent excited-state dynamics, particularly in the intermediate-coupling regime, where it provides higher contrast compared to its coherent-detected counterpart. Finally, we show the different influences of static disorder on the line shapes of diagonal and cross peaks. Notably, since cross peaks exhibit rephasing capability for increasing excitonic coupling, the contribution of incoherent mixing becomes less significant in inhomogeneous samples.

  abstract     = {Low resolution coarse-grained (CG) models provide exceptional computational efficiency for simulating soft materials. Consequently, many studies employ CG models to determine free energy surfaces along order parameters or reaction coordinates of interest. However, because CG models average over atomic details, it is challenging to determine the energetic and entropic contributions to the resulting free energy surfaces. In this work, we present a rigorous and predictive CG framework for computing these energetic and entropic driving forces based upon simulations at a single temperature. This dual approach employs distinct variational principles to independently approximate the exact CG interaction potential, W ( R ), and its energetic component, E W ( R ). This dual approach determines the free energy surface, a φ ( x ), along an order parameter, φ ( x ), via simulations with W ( R ). The dual approach then determines the energetic driving force, u ̄ φ ( x ) ⁠ , by evaluating E W ( R ) for the sampled configurations. The entropic driving force, s ̄ φ ( x ) ⁠ , is indirectly inferred, s ̄ φ ( x ) = u ̄ φ ( x ) − a φ ( x ) / T ⁠ . Importantly, this entropic contribution reflects both the CG configuration distribution and the atomic details that have been eliminated from the CG model. We demonstrate that the dual approach reasonably describes the energetic and entropic driving forces between a pair of nonpolar solutes in a polar solvent. In contrast, naïvely estimating energetics with the CG interaction potential provides a qualitatively incorrect description for these driving forces.},

L - and M -edge spectra are often addressed via variants of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based on SO calculations. Here, we present a computationally efficient implementation based on single-particle calculations with core holes within the frozen-core approximation. Combined with a semiempirical energy shift and a fixed SO splitting for each core level, this allows for a computationally cheap, while overall accurate, prediction of experimental spectra on the absolute energy scale. The spectra are compared to about 40 times slower linear-response TDDFT calculations for molecules and show similar or even better matches with experiment. An exception is multiplet effects that we analyze in detail and show that they cannot be covered by a single-particle approximation. A similar picture emerges for solids, where good qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement to experimental XAS and electron energy-loss spectra is achieved.},

In this work, we present a new constrained NEO (cNEO) formulation for density functional theory (cNEO-DFT) calculations in the context of extended periodic systems. Using the nudged elastic band method, we discuss an application of the cNEO-DFT approach to studying the adsorption of a hydrogen molecule on the Si(001) surfaces. The calculation shows how NQE impacts the reaction energetics. The proton density changes are computed along the reaction pathways. This work demonstrates the capability of the new cNEO-DFT method to study a wide range of chemical processes, such as surface reactions where the quantum nature of light atoms like protons is non-negligible.},

  abstract     = {While molecular dynamics (MD) is a very useful computational method for atomistic simulations, modeling the interatomic interactions for reliable MD simulations of real materials has been a long-standing challenge. In 2007, Behler and Parrinello first proposed and demonstrated an artificial neural network machine learning (ANN-ML) scheme, opening a new paradigm for developing accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulation studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of materials. In this paper, we show that an accurate and transferable ANN-ML interatomic potential can be developed for MD simulations of the La–Si–P system. The crucial role of training data in the ML potential development is discussed. The developed ANN-ML potential accurately describes not only the energy vs volume curves for all the known elemental, binary, and ternary crystalline structures in the La–Si–P system but also the structures of La–Si–P liquids with various compositions. Using the developed ANN-ML potential, the melting temperatures of several crystalline phases in the La–Si–P system are predicted by the coexistence of solid–liquid phases from MD simulations. While the ANN-ML model systematically underestimates the melting temperatures of these phases, the overall trend agrees with experiment. The developed ANN-ML potential is also applied to study the nucleation and growth of LaP as a function of different relative concentrations of Si and P in the La–Si–P liquid, and the obtained results are consistent with experimental observations.},

  abstract     = {The dissociation dynamics of N( 4 S u ) + C 2 (a 3 Π u ) under hypersonic conditions is critical for modeling radiative heating in aerospace thermal protection systems, yet it remains unexplored due to computational limitations. This work focuses on the systematic study of N + C 2 collision-induced dissociation (CID) processes using molecular dynamics simulations with 50 000 quasi-classical trajectories (QCT) per rovibrational state on a global 1 2 A″ potential energy surface to obtain cross sections (CS) and state-specific thermal rate coefficients (1000–20000 K). The results demonstrate that vibrational excitation dominates dissociation dynamics, with vibrational quantum states significantly lowering energy barriers and facilitating bond dissociation at reduced collision energies. In addition, we integrate quasi-classical trajectory simulations with neural networks, utilizing simulation datasets per rovibrational state to train our genetic-algorithm-optimized neural network. This framework achieves 99% prediction accuracy ( R 2 = 0.99) across all validation sets for state-specific dissociation CS and rate coefficients. We develop an effective CS model through machine learning (ML) to generate rate coefficient datasets covering all possible rovibrational levels. This machine learning approach reduces computational costs by three orders of magnitude compared to direct QCT calculations. Finally, this study further examines the proposition by Truhlar et al. regarding the influence of multi-electronic-state potential energy surfaces on the dissociation rate coefficients, including the application of modified rate-coefficient formulas to the current system. This study bridges the gap in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for this system. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the combined MD and machine learning approach can generate comprehensive datasets from limited discrete data points. This creates a high-quality database for modeling non-equilibrium hypersonic flows and highlights the benefits of machine learning in reactive MD simulations.},

  abstract     = {Highly flexible Jastrow factors have found significant use in stochastic electronic structure methods such as variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo, as well as in quantum chemical transcorrelated (TC) approaches, which have recently seen great success in generating highly accurate electronic energies using moderately sized basis sets. In particular, for the latter, the intrinsic noise in the Jastrow factor due to its optimization by VMC can pose a problem, especially when targeting weak (non-covalent) interactions. In this paper, we propose a deterministic alternative to VMC Jastrow optimization, based on minimizing the “variance of the TC reference energy” in a standard basis set. Analytic expressions for the derivatives of the TC Hamiltonian matrix elements are derived and implemented. This approach can be used to optimize the parameters in the Jastrow functions, either from scratch or to refine an initial VMC-based guess, to produce noise-free Jastrows in a reproducible manner. Applied to the first row of atoms and molecules, the results show that the method yields Slater–Jastrow wavefunctions whose variances are almost as low as those obtained from standard VMC variance optimization, but whose energies are lower and comparable to those obtained from energy-minimization VMC. We propose that the method can be used both in the context of the transcorrelated method and in standard VMC as a new way to optimize Jastrow functions.},

We performed orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) calculations for jellium clusters, which are accurate models for real metal clusters. We also investigated the response to external, time-independent perturbations. In general, the DSLP Pauli potential significantly enhances the accuracy of OFDFT calculations compared to the popular second-order KE gradient expansion and the Thomas–Fermi–Weizsäcker functional. Thus, the DSLP Pauli potential can be further applied to real applications of metal nanoparticles.},

Yet, the relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect’s images may lead to spurious, unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell, causing a very slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit (TDL). In this article, we introduce a “defectless” embedding formalism such that the embedding field is computed in a pristine, primitive-unit-cell calculation. Subsequently, a single (i.e., “aperiodic”) defect, which can also be charged, is introduced inside the embedded fragment. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues, achieving a very fast convergence to the TDL. Furthermore, using the toolbox of post-Hartree–Fock methods, this scheme can be straightforwardly applied to study strongly correlated defects, localized excited states, and other problems for which existing periodic protocols do not provide a satisfactory description.},

Its methylated form, Me 4 CB8, achieves better solubility yet maintains its biocompatibility, thus serving as a promising supramolecular container. Host–guest binding involving the methylated ring is difficult to model due to the lack of an accurate transferable force field and the complex binding-mode space when coordinating structurally complex abused drugs (e.g., fentanyl with multiple aromatic rings). In this work, we present a thorough characterization of cucurbituril host–guest coordinations in a batch of practical detoxification situations with enhanced sampling techniques in conjunction with the most accurate fixed-charge parameter set. An enhanced sampling technique is coupled with high-accuracy recalibrated force fields (B97-3c calculations for host and r2SCAN-3c for abused drugs, achieving a practical accuracy limit of fixed-charge modeling of host–guest systems). While the predicted binding thermodynamics agree with experimental values, additional all-atom insights into the multi-modal binding behavior and the nature of host–guest interactions that are absent in experimental measurements are characterized using a combination of force-field energetics and quantum mechanics-based energy decomposition analysis. Overall, this workflow provides a broadly applicable strategy for the mechanistic understanding of supramolecular detoxification systems and, more importantly, predictive modeling that enables the rational design of therapeutic carriers and antidotes.},

  abstract     = {A new protocol for recording correlations in the spin system preserved during photodriven quantum teleportation in molecular triads is proposed. It is assumed that an electron can be transferred from donor ( D ) to acceptor ( A ) by photoexcitation and that reduction of the stable radical ( R ) by the acceptor radical anion can take place. The protocol is based on the three-pulse stimulated spin echo sequence, with the first and third microwave pulses selectively applied to the spin R and the second microwave pulse applied to the spin D . Only those molecules in which the state of spin R is teleported to spin D contribute to the spin echo. The echo is formed only when the spin state of radical R after the first microwave pulse is dephased, transferred to the state of D by the laser flash and conserved by the second microwave pulse, and reversed to the state of radical R by charge recombination and refocused after the third pulse. The proposed procedure allows the state in which the radical is reduced to be studied even when its lifetime is short compared to the spin evolution. It also might be useful for investigating the validity of the Haberkorn approach to determining the spin decoherence rate induced by the recombination of the radical pairs. Possible perspectives on the preservation of the correlation between the electron and the nuclear spins in the context of quantum phenomena in spin chemistry research are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Coherent modified Redfield theory is employed to describe photoinduced proton-coupled electron transfer for a model Hamiltonian. This formalism is an extension of Redfield theory to capture weak to moderate system–bath coupling strengths, and the dynamics is secular and non-Markovian. In the model Hamiltonian, the electron is coupled to the proton and a phonon bath and is initially photoinduced from the ground electronic site to a donor site. At small bath reorganization energies, the system parameters, such as the energy bias between the donor and acceptor sites and overlaps of the vibronic states, play a crucial role in influencing the population decay and isotope effect. The energy bias decides the spacing between adjacent pairs of donor–acceptor levels as well as the energetically favorable acceptor states for the non-adiabatic transition. For the models we considered, the overlaps of the donor–acceptor wavefunctions of the proton are larger than those of deuterium. When the population is initially distributed over several donor vibrational states, the H/D population decays faster for the case that has the smaller adjacent donor–acceptor spacing. The donor population decay shows an inverse isotope effect when this spacing is smaller for deuterium than for protons. These models demonstrate a subtle balance between the spacing and overlaps in deciding the rate of population decay. Weak electron–phonon coupling leads to coherent oscillations in the electronic population decay and proton wavepacket dynamics. Larger coupling strengths lead to wavepacket localization and the transition to incoherent population decay.},

The particle-mesh approximation (PM) breaks the symmetry of pair interactions between objects and destroys the exact conservation of momentum and angular momentum. Here, the effects of the PM approximations are examined by performing “brute-force” simulations with and without the PM approximation. However, the exact simulations can only be performed for a small “dwarf galaxy” of ≈500 objects. The simulations show that the stability of the galaxy is sensitive to the approximations, which sooner or later lead to the objects being released from their bound rotation. However, the stability of the dwarf galaxy can be ensured by modifying Newton’s gravitational long-range attractions from an inverse square attraction to an inverse attraction, a gravity modification often proposed in the f ( R ) modified general relativity theory.},

  abstract     = {The microcanonical analog of the Lindemann mechanism for unimolecular reactions, or microcanonical Lindemann mechanism (MLM), is discussed. The mechanism makes explicit a central role of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) in mediating rates of unimolecular reactions. Under conditions of ergodic dynamics, the MLM predicts single-exponential kinetics with a rate constant that is generally smaller than the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory estimate. The RRKM theory rate is reached in the limit where rates of IVR from states of the activated complex to non-reactive states of the reactant are much greater than rates of transition from states of the activated complex to states of the product. We discuss the MLM in the context of experimental results for conformational isomerization, one irreversible, the photoisomerization of trans -stilbene, and another reversible, cyclohexane ringinversion. This Perspective aims to address and clarify misunderstandings that persist as to the role of IVR in unimolecular reaction kinetics. We also discuss, in the context of the MLM, a means to estimate rates of vibrational relaxation from states of the activated complex to non-reactive states from available energy-dependent unimolecular reaction rate data, which we believe is new.},

  abstract     = {The density of a protein molecule is a key property within a variety of experimental techniques. We present a computational method for determining protein mass density that explicitly incorporates hydration effects. Our approach uses molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the volume of solvent excluded by a protein. Applied to a dataset of 260 soluble proteins, this yields an average density of 1.296 ± 0.001 g cm −3 , notably lower than the widely cited value of 1.35 g cm −3 . Contrary to previous suggestions, we find no correlation between protein density and molecular weight. We instead find correlations with residue composition, particularly with hydrophobic amino acid content. Using these correlations, we train a regressor capable of accurately predicting protein density from sequence-derived features alone. Examining the effect of incorporating water molecules on the measured density, we find that water molecules buried in internal cavities have a negligible effect, whereas those at the surface have a profound impact. Furthermore, by calculating the density of a titin domain and of the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin over molecular dynamics trajectories, we show that individual proteins can occupy states with close but distinguishable densities. Finally, we analyze the density of water in the vicinity of proteins, showing that the first two hydration shells exhibit higher density than bulk water. When included in cumulative density calculations, these hydration layers contribute to a net increase in local solvent density. Overall, we find that proteins are less dense than previously reported, which is offset by their ability to induce a higher density of water in their vicinity.},

  abstract     = {Chlorosulfolipids are the main component of the polar lipid of the flagellar membrane in sea algae and are also known as the major cause of seafood poisoning. Despite the active research on the synthesis of these chlorosulfolipids as potential new drugs, there has been no clear understanding of how they are organized into a stable biological membrane, which is mainly due to their peculiar structure containing hydrophilic sulfate and chloro groups in their tail region. In this study, we have performed hybrid coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to understand the structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties of binary mixture membrane systems consisting of Danicalipin A (DANI), one of the representative chlorosulfolipids, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl- s n-glycero-3- O -4′-( N , N , N -trimethyl)-homoserine (DPTS) lipids. We have observed that at low DANI concentration, DANI is intercalated into one of the leaflets of DPTS bilayer membranes with a y-shaped conformation, consistent with previous experiments. On the other hand, at high DANI concentration, DANI forms a stable monolayer membrane as predicted by our previous simulation study. In the intermediate DANI concentrations, however, DANI molecules tend to reside near the bilayer membrane center to facilitate water penetration through the membrane, affecting the stability of the biological membrane. In addition, there exists a gel-to-liquid crystalline transition in the DANI concentration between 30% and 40%, which was confirmed by both structural and dynamical properties such as the membrane volume, pair distribution function, and diffusion coefficients. We have also investigated the effects of temperature on the phase behavior of the mixture membrane system and found little sensitivity in the range of T = 273–323 K.},

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for meeting the Department Of Energy (DOE) storage targets. This study employs grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the usable gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities of hydrogen in newly synthesized Zn- or Cd-based MRT (Moldova Research Team) MOFs. These results are systematically compared to those of carefully selected MOFs that share either similar metal compositions or analogous pore structures and densities. Among the four MRT MOFs examined, MRT2 and MRT4 stand out as the most promising, exhibiting remarkable hydrogen storage capacities at ambient and low temperature and moderate pressures (25–35 MPa). In particular, the total volumetric and gravimetric storage capacities of MRT2 and MRT4 exceed the DOE targets at 77 K and ∼5 MPa. Their hydrogen storage performance at room temperature proves highly competitive when assessed against MOFs with comparable metal compositions or porosity-density characteristics. The autonomy range of a hydrogen vehicle using MRT2 or MRT4 has been assessed, revealing that it can match that of a compressed hydrogen system while operating at lower pressures, but requiring a larger tank volume.},

  abstract     = {Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of tin silicon oxide was performed via an ALD supercycle on an amorphous carbon (a-C) layer, which serves as the mandrel in self-aligned double patterning (SADP) techniques. This approach addresses limitations of conventional ALD SiO 2 processes using ozone (O 3 ) as the oxidant, which can lead to degradation of a-C mandrel or collapse of the SiO 2 spacer itself under aggressive scaling. In this study, tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn) and bis-diethylaminosilane (BDEAS) were used as Sn and Si precursors, respectively, with H 2 O as the oxidant to avoid damage to the a-C layer. SiO 2 was not grown via a single ALD process due to the low reactivity of BDEAS with H 2 O. Nevertheless, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that Si was incorporated into the film grown by the supercycle of ALD SnO x and SiO 2 . Notably, it is observed that the growth characteristics of tin silicon oxide exhibited a nonlinear dependence on the cycle ratio. Understanding this unexpected behavior is crucial for SADP, as it affects growth per cycle and film characteristics, such as etch rate and surface roughness. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations suggest that hydrogen abstraction between TDMASn and Si–H groups enable the growth of tin silicon oxide. Finally, transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that the a-C layer remained undamaged during the ALD process, whereas a few seconds of ozone exposure caused the ashing of the a-C layer.},

It was observed that the current density significantly increased with temperature as a consequence of enhanced kinetics and electrolyte characteristics, while a detriment to the potential output was identified and predominantly attributed to variations of photovoltaic characteristics. Moreover, it was demonstrated that mass transport enhancement reaches its maximum contribution at 45 °C, followed by a slowdown in the observed trends at higher temperatures, which may lead to improved design development and optimized working conditions.},

The defects, such as grain boundaries, often exist and play an important role in determining their physical and chemical properties. In this work, by means of first-principles calculations, the effects of a typical grain boundary (composed of 5–7 membered rings) and uniaxial strains on electronic and transport properties of WSe 2 monolayers are systematically investigated. It is observed that the local atomic arrangements, particularly the inter-grain spacing and elastic strains, significantly affect electronic and transport properties. The underlying mechanism is carefully elucidated. Furthermore, the flexoelectricity enhanced piezoelectric properties of WSe 2 monolayers with grain boundaries are clarified. Our findings demonstrate that grain boundary engineering and strain modulation offer a versatile approach to tailoring the electronic and transport properties of 2D TMDs.},

Solvent mixtures can control the interaction between the nanoparticles and solvents, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed for an interface between a decanoic acid-modified Al 2 O 3 and a binary mixture of organic solvents. Cyclohexane and ethanol were selected as a good solvent and a poor solvent for the modifier, respectively, and their volume fraction for preparation was varied. For any volume fraction of ethanol, ethanol was adsorbed onto the Al 2 O 3 surface patches without modifiers. Cyclohexane was preferentially distributed around the modifier. The work of adhesion was calculated as a measure of interfacial affinity using thermodynamic integration. For systems with ethanol, the work of adhesion was significantly larger than for those with cyclohexane, owing to the strong interaction of the Al 2 O 3 surface with the adsorbed ethanol; however, this result, that is, the obtained affinity, is not consistent with the experimental dispersion results of surface-modified nanoparticles. To focus on the interaction between modifiers and surrounding solvents, the work required to strip solvents from the modifier was calculated, excluding the contribution of adsorbed ethanol. The required work decreased after the ethanol fraction surpassed a specific threshold, indicating that the affinity can be related to the distribution of solvent species near the modifier layer. This work provides an evaluation method and insights into the effect of a solvent mixture on the interfacial affinity at the molecular level.},

The results from our model reveal a complex bandgap opening mechanism in zigzag-edged hexagonal GALs (ZH-GALs), where specific inter-ribbon connections and quantum confinement cause the localization of π -electrons between antidots, leading to the elimination of energy levels degeneracy. We also observe that the anisotropy of rectangular ZH-GALs is enhanced as the defect radius increases, indicating a transition from GALs-like to graphene nanoribbons-like bandgap behavior. This study tells us that more than 1/9 ZH-GALs have considerable bandgaps, addressing the deficiency in band structure engineering between regimes dominated by defect scattering and quantum confinement.},

The importance of long-ranged electrostatics is assessed as a function of shear rate by comparing Ewald and reaction field treatments. An appropriate comparison is achieved through the implementation of the proper Lees–Edwards boundary conditions within the ESPResSo++ simulation software. Our results demonstrate that, while structural properties are relatively insensitive to the electrostatic treatment, the more accurate treatment via the Ewald approach is essential for studies of dynamics, in particular, at lower shear rates. Furthermore, we identify a critical shear rate beyond which structural and dynamical properties begin to deviate from equilibrium behavior, while remaining largely unchanged below this threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the dynamic heterogeneity of the liquid decreases as a function of increasing shear rate, which can be primarily explained by the faster dynamics induced by the shear flow. These results hold relevance for investigations of process-dependent properties of ionic-liquid-based materials.},

The equation is applied to the crystallization of glass-forming liquids with different kinetic behaviors and validated by comparison to experimental data and numerical simulations for the crystallization of glassy Fe 80 B 20 (at. %). The application of Kissinger’s method to analyze crystallization kinetics is subsequently justified for well-defined conditions. However, it is shown that the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of crystal growth rates in glass-forming liquids can be more precisely determined by using the present model to fit the peak position, shape, and height for a series of crystallization exotherms. The implications of these analytical expressions for the design and development of glass-forming systems for a broad range of applications are considered, and the application of this JMAK rate equation to other transformations during continuous heating is explored.},

To understand how these interactions lead to its amine photoproduct, we employ time-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy where TMA is pumped by a 200 nm femtosecond laser pulse and analyze the results with the help of electronic structure calculations of the excited state potential energy surface relevant to the process. Our combined experimental and theoretical study indicates that from the decay of the initially prepared 3p z state (time-constant 400 fs), internal conversion through the remaining 3p manifold (4.4 ps) and the 3s state (67 ps) states competes with ultrafast photodissociation, forming ground state dimethyl amidogen (DMA) and CH 3 ( ν 2 = 4) radical products. Decay of the 3s state reveals the formation of a second product pair, forming DMA in a low-lying excited state, DMA ( A ̃ 2 A 1 ) ⁠ , and vibrationally cold CH 3 . We suggest that the rapid dissociation channel arises from a near-planar geometry accessed in the 3p z state and the longer time channel arises from the excited state population, accessing a pyramidal geometry in the 3s state.},

The mechanism construction process of NH 3 , DME, and NH 3 /DME avoided the mechanism simplification step, which can greatly reduce the number of species and reactions. Finally, the NH 3 chemical reaction mechanism containing 18 species and 43 reactions, the DME chemical reaction mechanism containing 34 species and 51 reactions, and the NH 3 /DME chemical reaction mechanism containing 44 species and 93 reactions were developed. The laminar burning velocity and ignition delay time of NH 3 , NH 3 /H 2 , DME, DME/H 2 , and NH 3 /DME combustion under a wide range of initial conditions were validated.

However, most of such interesting clusters were sporadically discovered; is there any systematic method to explore all possible high symmetrical clusters? Herein, we propose an idea to systematically construct high symmetrical structures based on a novel conjugate-dual (co-dual) concept. A co-dual structure would be constructed by conjugately combining one high symmetrical polyhedron and its corresponding dual. In such co-dual structures, the symmetry of the original polyhedron could be kept or even promoted in some special cases. This provides a way to explore high symmetrical polyhedra and leads to a new cluster family, co-dual clusters. In this paper, we have systematically studied the spherical co-dual clusters with one- or two-element shells and found a series of stable cage-like and core–shell clusters. The co-dual structures would be a new treasure box for hunting novel clusters.},

The results show that HQBT successfully undergoes the first excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) under photoexcitation. Subsequently, through the first cis –trans isomerization process of dihedral angle torsion, a minimum energy conical intersection (MECI) is formed between the ground state and the first excited state. The MECI continues the second cis –trans isomerization to generate the trans -keto structure. At this point, a new intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed and experiences the second ESIPT, thus achieving long-range transport of hydrogen protons. This careful theoretical research has significant guiding significance for the design of intelligent and efficient tautomeric molecular switches in the future.},

The theoretical spectra were calculated using equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory for ionization potential combined with the time-independent double-harmonic adiabatic Hessian approach. For all three thiouracils, the first ionization potential is found between 8.4 and 8.7 eV, which is 1 eV lower than for the canonical nucleobase uracil. Ionization bands up to 12 eV show strong vibrational progressions and are well reproduced by the calculations. These bands are attributed to the ionization of (primarily) sulfur- and oxygen-localized valence molecular orbitals. For higher binding energies, the calculations indicate that nonadiabatic couplings are important for the interpretation of the photoelectron spectra.},

We explore the nuclear singlet relaxation of an isotopolog of squarate in a high-pH aqueous solution. The 1,3– 13 C 2 -isotopolog of squarate exists as a minority species of 1– 13 C 2 -squarate.

The 13 C signals from the 1,2– 13 C 2 and 1,3– 13 C 2 species are selected using geometric double-quantum filtration, and the double-quantum coherence is converted to singlet order and back again using customized double-quantum-to-singlet (DQ2S) and singlet-to-double-quantum (S2DQ) pulse sequences.

The resulting equations assume that the system’s phonons follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population, and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we adopt the fluctuation–dissipation theorem and consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron–phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in-phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.},

The results of these simulations agree with our previous simulation results in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble, a virial equation of state of metrological quality, and the most accurate experimental data for the speed of sound in helium within their mutual uncertainties.

  abstract     = {Molecular simulations play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and material sciences, enabling the study of complex dynamic properties within systems. Coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as indispensable tools in this domain, facilitating the sampling of large-scale systems and extending simulation timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches involve a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that may be crucial for understanding the underlying processes. To address this challenge, a recommended strategy is to identify key CG conformations and employ backmapping methods to retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods often yield suboptimal geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. In contrast, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but may lack transferability between systems or be tied to specific CG mappings. In this study, we present HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that utilizes deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM is capable of handling any type of CG mapping, providing a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Grounded in local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and can be applied across systems of varying composition and sizes. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through a range of biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates atomistic coordinates for a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer. The high-fidelity HEroBM backmapping enables researchers to effortlessly transition between CG and all-atom simulations, opening unprecedented avenues for molecular investigations.},

Despite the different number of bound states supported by PES B and PES M , the ignition points from STS and Arrhenius rates are at ∼ 1 0 − 6 s whether or not reverse rates are from assuming microreversibility or explicitly given. Conversion from NO to N 2 is incomplete if Arrhenius rates are used, but complete turnover is observed if STS information is used. This is due to non-equilibrium energy flow and state dynamics, which requires a state-based description. Including full dissociation asymptotically leads to the correct 2:1 [N]:[O] concentration with little differences for the species’ dynamics depending on the PES used for the STS information. In conclusion, concentration profiles from coarse-grained simulations are consistent over 14 orders of magnitude in time using STS information based on two different high-level PESs.},

  abstract     = {Nanoscale fluid–ion transport is investigated in biophysical chemistry, drug delivery, protein sequencing, etc. Currently, fast three-dimensional models for fluid–ion transport through biological nanopores are unavailable. This study, therefore, focuses on the simulation and parallelization of nanoscale fluid–ion transport on multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). Nanoscale fluid–ion transport is described through the fourth-order Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Bikerman model coupled with the Navier–Stokes equations. The model incorporates the effect of ionic and non-ionic interactions, ion solvation, nonlocal electrostatics, and the finite size of particles. Governing equations are discretized using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). For complex geometries, the immersed boundary method has been incorporated with the LBM. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed model, electro-osmotic flow through a relatively large biological nanopore has been simulated. Parallelization on multiple GPUs has enabled us to perform simulations for a full three-dimensional channel geometry. Results showed a good match with the published data. We captured local variations in concentration and fluid flow in both axial and radial directions. Furthermore, flow circulation around the channel was also observed. The impact of external potential difference and the finite size of the particles on the flow has also been assessed. Using our in-house code, we achieved a performance of 1982 × 10 6 lattice updates per second on 8 A100 80 gigabyte GPUs. The methodology presented here provides an accurate and fast simulation methodology for characterizing symmetric/asymmetric nanopore properties. This model can help in enhancing the fundamental understanding of nanofluidics and characterization of the nanopores.},

  abstract     = {Calculating the kinetics of rare-but-important conformational transitions in complex biomolecules is a significant challenge in computational biophysics. Because of the long timescales needed to observe such processes, regular molecular dynamics simulations are too slow to sample these events by direct integration of the equations of motion. Recently, the weighted ensemble method has gained significant popularity for its ability to compute the rates of conformational transitions in biomolecular systems using unbiased simulations. However, the progress coordinate(s) of the weighted ensemble simulation should be carefully designed to capture the slow degrees of freedom of the system. Here, we demonstrate the application of a machine learning approach, harmonic linear discriminant analysis, which builds a predictive model for class membership, to design progress coordinates for weighted ensemble simulations. We test the accuracy and efficiency of this technique for computing the kinetics of the conformational transition of alanine dipeptide and the unfolding of a small protein. The key advantage of our data-driven approach is its minimal system knowledge requirement, which potentially extends its applicability to more complex and physiologically relevant systems.},

  abstract     = {The sequence–structure–function paradigm in biology states that a protein’s amino acid sequence determines its unique folded state structure, which in turn dictates its unique biological function. This classic concept has been severely challenged by the discovery of metamorphic and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Metamorphic proteins can fold into multiple native structures and perform multiple functions. IDPs, on the contrary, remain unstructured under physiological conditions but can fold to a unique structure upon binding to a target protein and show functionality. Here, we present a statistical mechanical model of protein folding with multiple native states and analyze their folding phase diagrams. While recovering the classic sequence–structure–function paradigm for a single native state, our model shows metamorphicity at a lower number of native states. An expansion of the unfolded region in the phase diagram at a higher number of native states, making the unfolded state the stable state under physiological conditions, indicates the emergence of an IDP-like scenario. Folding upon binding scenario of IDPs has also been demonstrated when an energetic bias is introduced for a specific native state. A regaining of the folded region upon biasing, increasing the folding propensity of the system, with folding toward a specific native state, is shown. Therefore, our model is general enough to reproduce the classic sequence–structure–function, metamorphicity, intrinsic disorderness, and folding upon binding scenarios of proteins.},

Quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) simulations find the experimentally measured negative temperature-dependence of the rate for the exchange reaction and describe the experiments within error bars. Similarly, QCT simulations for a recent potential energy surface (PES) at a comparable level of quantum chemical theory reproduce the negative T -dependence. Interestingly, both PESs feature a “reef” structure near dissociation, which has been implicated to be responsible for a positive T -dependence of the rate, inconsistent with experiments. For the dissociation reaction, the T -dependence correctly captures what is known from experiments but underestimates the absolute rates by two orders of magnitude. Accounting for an increased number of accessible electronic states at high temperatures yields near-quantitative agreement. A neural network-based state-to-distribution model is constructed for both PESs and shows good performance in predicting final translational, vibrational, and rotational product state distributions. Such models are valuable for future and more coarse-grained simulations of reactive hypersonic gas flow.},

  abstract     = {The adsorption of a “solid-like” monolayer on a crystalline substrate can produce distortions in the monolayer which are describable as mass-density-waves. These mass-density-waves can lead to a fixed alignment between the monolayer and the substrate crystal axes that may not be aligned with any high-symmetry direction of the substrate surface, a phenomenon known as rotational (orientational, Moiré) epitaxy. The driver of rotational epitaxy has been attributed to the partial matching of the symmetry of the substrate surface, to that of the over-layer (i.e., high-order commensurate phases), and to the competition between longitudinal strains (compressions) verses transverse strains (shears) in the mass-density-wave distortions caused by the mismatch between these two symmetries (i.e., the rotated incommensurate phase). In this work, we will examine both these scenarios within a new formalism, one using a fully non-linear approach to the calculation of the Fourier amplitudes that describe these distortions. The effects on the monolayer due to the substrate are found to be well-described by this formalism, which also has important pedagogical and calculational aspects. Within our proposed framework, the high-order commensurate phase shows up (using the language of structural phase transitions) as a partial regaining of the symmetry though a “lock-in transformation.” This work builds upon and extends the earlier work of Novaco and McTague. Both classical and quantum regimes are explored, and the limits of this new approach are tested against other calculations. The extension and application of this framework to other systems, such as two-dimensional van der Waals hetero-structures, is briefly discussed.},

Demonstrated on the EQ-SANS instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source, the approach generalizes to general SANS instruments with a two-dimensional detector. A key result is the discovery of a dimensionless convergence metric revealing a universal power-law scaling in profile evolution across soft matter systems. When time is normalized by a system-specific characteristic time t *, the variation in inferred profiles collapses onto a single curve with an exponent between −2 and −1. This trend emerges within the first ten time steps, enabling early prediction of measurement sufficiency. The method supports real-time experimental optimization and is especially valuable for maximizing efficiency in low-flux environments such as compact accelerator-based neutron sources.},

Using this approach, we investigate the decay process of the 2a 1 ionized state of the water dimer. For the 2a 1 vacancy in the proton donor water molecule, ICD is observed in our simulations. In addition, we have identified a novel dynamical process: at the initial stage, the proton generally undergoes a back-and-forth motion. Subsequently, the system may evolve along two distinct pathways: in one, no proton transfer occurs; in the other, the proton departs again from its original position and ultimately completes the transfer process. In contrast, when the vacancy resides in the proton acceptor water molecule, no proton transfer occurs and ICD remains the sole decay channel.},

In this study, we focus on evaluating the efficiency of DM21 functional on the task of optimizing molecular geometries and investigate how the non-smooth behavior of neural network-predicted exchange–correlation energy and potential affects the final geometry precision. We implement geometry optimization for the DM21 functional in PySCF and compare its performance with traditional functionals on various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that numerical noise coming from the neural network outputs contaminates numerical nuclear gradients required for geometry optimization. We also found that a numerical differentiation step in the range of 0.0001–0.001 Å is required to obtain sufficiently smooth nuclear gradients. Furthermore, we show that the non-smoothness of DM21 can be reproduced by adding random normally distributed noise to local energies of an analytical SCAN functional, allowing one to efficiently estimate the optimal numerical differentiation step for geometry optimization of a given molecule. Our findings show that DM21 does not outperform analytical functionals in the accuracy of optimized molecular geometries and is significantly slower, which limits its practical applicability to chemical calculations.},

A prominent example is the two-electron Harmonium model, which has been widely studied over the past three decades to gain insights into the nature of the electron–electron correlations in many-electron quantum systems. Building on our previous work [Riyahi et al. , Phys. Rev. B 108 , 245155 (2023)], we introduce an analogous model consisting of an electron and a positively charged particle (PCP) with variable mass, interacting via Coulomb forces while confined by external harmonic potentials. Termed the exotic Harmonium model, this provides insights into the electron–PCP correlations, a cornerstone of the emerging field of the ab initio study of multi-component many-body quantum systems. Through a systematic exploration of the parameter space and numerical solutions of the corresponding Schrödinger equation, we identify two extreme regimes: the atom-like and the particle-in-trap-like behavior. The electron–PCP correlation dominates in the atom-like regime, significantly influencing physical observables, while its role diminishes in the particle-in-trap-like limit. Between these two extremes lies a complex intermediate regime that challenges qualitative interpretation. Overall, the exotic Harmonium model offers a powerful framework to unravel the electron–PCP correlations across diverse systems, spanning particles of varying masses and conditions, from ambient to high-pressure environments.},

The performance for liquid-state properties of models that include 1-bond, 2-bond, and 3-bond charge-flow is probed for chloroform and acetonitrile through measurements of dielectric constants, dipole moments, and infrared spectra. The results indicate that models allowing charge-flow only between directly bonded atom pairs (1-bond) lead to significant deviations compared to models incorporating 2- and 3-bond contributions, suggesting that restricting charge-flow solely between directly bonded atom pairs omits important physical contributions. In addition, modeling polarizability via charge-flow inherently leads to an anisotropy description of the molecular polarizability tensor, with the level of anisotropy constituting a major component in the electrostatic response. The results also suggest that modeling the molecular polarizability by only charge-flow tends to overestimate the electric polarization and, thus, indicate that combinations of rank-0 and rank-1 polarizability are required for an accurate modeling of the electric response.},

  abstract     = {Rare events are a common yet challenging topic in many fields of interest. Among many importance-sampling-based rare event simulation methods, forward flux sampling (FFS), established on the effective positive flux framework, is a widely used rare event sampling method due to its simplicity and less restrictive nature. FFS is commonly assumed to work well under diffusive regimes, whereas for correlated systems, the initial flux simulation needs to be either sufficiently long or initiated from multiple uncorrelated starting points to sample a sufficient number of uncorrelated points, and the short timescale recrossing over the energy barrier may result in a potentially overestimated reaction rate. To solve the above-mentioned problems, the author(s) propose an iterative method by regarding the space of the initial outgoing trajectory distribution as the state space of a discrete time Markov Chain (DTMC) process. Upon convergence of the DTMC process by iteratively applying the probability kernel, the initial outgoing trajectory distribution converges to the stationary distribution, and the associated measurable converges to the expected value. Numerical results show that the system is able to converge to its stationary distribution with poor initial outgoing trajectory distribution leading to either orders of magnitude higher or lower estimations of reaction rate compared to its expected value. Meanwhile, the proposed method is able to obtain the recrossing free reaction rate in strongly correlated systems, which could be an order of magnitude smaller than that obtained via the standard FFS method.},

Among the approaches tested, the B86bPBE-XDM, PBE-D3, revPBE-D3, rev-vdW-DF2, SCAN+rVV10, and PBE0-D3-ATM functionals achieve the closest agreement with DMC for the carbon dioxide–graphene interaction. The vdW-DF2, rev-vdW-DF2, and PBE0-D4-ATM functionals perform better for the competitive adsorption of water and carbon dioxide.},

  abstract     = {The chief motivation for the failure of drugs in clinical trials is their low bioavailability caused by the inability to cross the cell membrane. Understanding drug–membrane interactions is crucial for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the permeation of simvastatin and fluvastatin across three lipid bilayer models representing normal and cancer cell membranes. Free energy profiles reveal that simvastatin, due to its higher lipophilicity, interacts more strongly with lipid environments, preferentially permeating cancer-like symmetric membranes. Fluvastatin, in contrast, shows less selective behavior across different membrane types, consistent with its charged nature. Statin insertion perturbs membrane structure, increasing area per lipid and decreasing bilayer thickness and lipid order. These findings highlight how membrane composition and asymmetry govern passive drug diffusion and suggest that selective membrane interactions may reflect the differential anticancer potential of statins. The results provide mechanistic insights into structure–permeability relationships and support the strategic use of realistic membrane models in drug discovery and repurposing efforts.},

The main finding is that surface properties of polydisperse polymers in solution are well-described by the average degree of polymerization N ̄ ⁠ , independent of the shape or variance σ 2 of the chain length distribution. Polymers with longer chain lengths are found to preferentially adsorb at the surface in the weak adsorption regime. Analytical expressions are derived for the adsorbed amount and surface tension. The results are in quantitative agreement with numerical self-consistent field computations, as long as the ratio σ 2 / N ̄ 3 is small compared to the static structure factor of Gaussian chains.

Notably, when a PEG chain is immersed in water, the surrounding water molecules play a key role in driving conformational changes of this macromolecule. In this study, we explore the solvation behavior of PEG under mechanical strain using molecular dynamics simulations, with an interatomic potential obtained from machine learning. Our focus is on the transition from the favored coil-like conformation to an extended one under external force. Through analyses of radial distribution functions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation dynamics, we uncover how mechanical stretching influences the local hydration environment. Moreover, we disentangle the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the conformational stability of PEG in water. Surprisingly, our neural network potential model identifies dewetting of PEG C-atoms, and not water H-bonding with PEG O-atoms, as the main enthalpic driving force for the coiling of PEG in water.},

  abstract     = {Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs–Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions. Three distinct surface tensions—the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions—play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.},

  abstract     = {The thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical properties of graphite anodes significantly influence the performance of lithium-ion batteries. Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations were employed to examine the effects of defects in graphite on these properties. In particular, the influence of three types of defects—Stone–Wales (SW), single vacancy (SV), and double vacancy (DV)—at defect densities below 0.4% was analyzed, including their impact on graphite density, charge transfer, voltage, lithium-ion diffusion, and mechanical stability. The results show that defects in graphite form bridge, ylide, and spiro configurations, with structural stability decreasing in the order of SV > SW > DV. As defect density increases, the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient decreases significantly from 4.71 × 10 −8 to 3.75 × 10 −11 Å 2 /ps as lithium concentration increases from Li 0.02 C 6 to LiC 6 . In contrast, for Li 0.02 C 6 , the diffusion coefficient rises with increasing defect density, from 2.94 × 10 −9 to 1.29 × 10 −9 Å 2 /ps. Mechanical analysis reveals that increasing defect density reduces Young’s modulus from 936.49 to 743.54 GPa and ultimate tensile strength from 94.59 to 58.50 GPa, highlighting the detrimental effect of defects on graphite's mechanical stability. Defects introduce localized electronic states within the bandgap, promoting lithium-ion diffusion at higher concentrations and disrupting the graphite structure to create new diffusion paths. These findings underscore the critical role of defect engineering in optimizing graphite anode performance and provide insights for the design of high-performance anode materials.},

This blockage was ultimately overcome by phonon-assisted flipping of the hot carrier’s spin, allowing it to pair with its band edge counterpart within tens of picoseconds. To test the generality of this novel phenomenon, the same approach is used here on nanodots of another II–VI semiconductor, CdTe. Despite difficulties arising from slower electron cooling rates and faster bi-exciton recombination times relative to CdSe, the results demonstrate similar spin blockades to hot bi-exciton cooling in CdTe nanocrystals. This study confirms the general occurrence of spin blockade phenomena in II–VI quantum dots, underscoring the potential of this mechanism for assisting hot electron harvesting.

  abstract     = {The determination of the phase diagram of carbon dioxide by using exclusively experimental techniques has been prevented by the strong metastabilities of solid phases and the hysteresis in some phase transitions. Quantum mechanical methods have played a crucial role in this field helping the characterization of the molecular/non molecular character of the phases. Nowadays, it is well-established that CO 2 -I, CO 2 -II, CO 2 -III (first termed as VII), and CO 2 -IV phases are molecular phases in contrast with high temperature and high pressure non-molecular phases such as CO 2 -V and CO 2 -VI. In this work, we explore the ability of the molecular force field TraPPE to describe the molecular part of the carbon dioxide phase diagram by using classical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. As it will be shown, this model predicts very accurately the fluid-I transition line and the stability of phases CO 2 -I, CO 2 -II, CO 2 -III, and CO 2 -IV in well-defined regions of the phase diagram. The main shortcomings are the small size of the stability regions of CO 2 -II and CO 2 -III and the appearance of CO 2 -II, CO 2 -III, and CO 2 -IV phases at too low pressures. In addition, the densities of the solid phases are only well-predicted for CO 2 -I and at pressures lower than 3 GPa. At higher pressures, the density is underestimated for all the solids. The results clearly indicate that although the TraPPE model does a reasonable job in describing the phase diagram of CO 2 , there is still room for improvement.},

Notably, the positive temperature dependence of f (rising from 0.575 at 190 K to 0.808 at 280 K) and a small activation energy ( E a = 1.92 kJ/mol) demonstrated the dominance of a direct 3 (AA)* → S 1 reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) mechanism while excluding the hypothesized 3 (AA)* → T 2 → S 1 cascade. These results not only resolve longstanding debates concerning f -enhancement but also provide a rationale for designing annihilators that exploit low-barrier RISC pathways to circumvent spin-statistical constraints.},

The unique interatomic interactions present in the internal cavity vs the exterior of PA are carefully investigated using equilibrium MACE MD simulations for two representative Na(H 2 O)@PA and Na@PA complexes in aqueous solutions. Our careful analyses of radial distribution functions and coordination numbers show that the presence of confined water in Na(H 2 O)@PA has profound modulating effects on the nature of the interactions of the encapsulated ion with the oxygens of the PA cavity. Using well-converged MACE-accelerated multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics simulations with nanosecond timescales, two different associative (ion exchange) and dissociative (ion ejection) ion transport mechanisms were carefully investigated for Na + as one of the most abundant and representative ions present in seawater and saline solutions. By comparing systems with and without confined water, it was found that the presence of only one pre-encapsulated confined water in Na(H 2 O)@PA dramatically changes the free energy landscape of ion transport processes. It was also found that the contraction and dilation of the two windows present in PA directly influence the Na + and H 2 O transport. The results from this work are helpful, as they show a viable path toward tuning the ion exchange and transport phenomena in aqueous solutions of POM molecular clusters and frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Isotope effects in the Be + ( 2 P 3/2 ) + HD reaction were investigated using an integrated ion trap and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer at a collision energy of 285 K (E coll /k B ). The total rate constant was measured to be (1.4 ± 0.1) × 10 −9 cm 3 /s, consistent with predictions from classical capture theory. The branching ratio of BeD + + H to BeH + + D was determined for the first time and found to be 3.7 ± 0.6, indicating a significant isotope effect. Comparisons with the pairwise energy model and phase space theory suggest that the reaction does not proceed through a purely abstraction or insertion mechanism. Time-dependent quantum dynamics calculations further underscore the importance of accurately describing short-range interactions to reproduce the observed branching behavior. These results establish a well-characterized benchmark system for studying isotope effects and reaction mechanisms in ion–molecule collisions under quantum-state control.},

  abstract     = {Gold clusters serve as ideal models for probing chemical bonding theories and their reactions with O 2 provide valuable insights into the O 2 activation mechanisms on gold-based catalysts. While extensive research has been conducted on pristine gold clusters, investigations into the reactivity of nonmetal-doped gold clusters remain limited. Here, we explore the reactions of Au n O − ( n = 5–20) with O 2 using cluster reaction experiments and density functional theory calculations, and our findings reveal that many Au n O − exhibits a structure–activity relationship different from those of pure gold clusters and small gold oxide clusters. In these Au n O − , the oxygen atom bonds with two or three adjacent gold atoms, creating a metal oxide unit, while the remaining gold atoms constitute a metallic component. The reactivity of these Au n O − is predominantly dictated by its metallic part, which is affected by the ease of electron transfer to O 2 . The decomposition of these Au n O − into oxide and metallic components aligns with the strategy of partitioning ligand-protected noble metal clusters into a covalent outer shell and a metallic core and also enriches the emerging framework of the superatomic molecule concept in cluster science. Moreover, these insights offer valuable clues for understanding the behavior of gold clusters supported on oxide surfaces.},

In this study, we investigate the Cl + CH 3 CN reaction using quasi-classical trajectory simulations on a previously developed, high-quality, full-dimensional potential energy surface. By selectively exciting individual vibrational modes of the CH 3 CN reactant, we systematically analyze their influence on reaction probabilities and cross sections and, in the case of the major H-abstraction channel, on scattering and attack angle distributions, as well as product energy partitioning across a range of collision energies. Furthermore, a vibrational mode-specific product analysis, combined with energy-based Gaussian binning, was conducted to examine how initial mode excitation influences product state distributions. Our results reveal that excitation of specific reactant vibrational modes can enhance the H-abstraction probability without altering the overall reaction mechanism. A significant portion of the initial vibrational energy is transferred to the internal energy of the products, while the collision energy primarily contributes to their translational energy. The CH 2 CN product exhibits well-defined, mode-specific vibrational excitation patterns, reflecting distinct energy redistribution pathways during the reaction. These findings provide deeper insight into the role of vibrational energy in promoting or altering chemical reaction pathways in a polyatomic system.},

Here, we study the formation of those two interactions in the context of dimerization of flexible molecules. Using supersonic expansions, we created the conditions to form 2-phenylethylamine homodimers and 2-phenylethylamine⋯2-phenylethanol heterodimers. Structural information was then extracted using mass-resolved excitation spectroscopy. The experimental data were interpreted on the light of computational predictions carried out at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level. Both dimers present a collection of interactions, in addition to the formation of hydrogen bonds. Clearly, the OH⋯N interaction is stronger than the NH⋯N interaction due to the better donor character of the hydroxyl group. However, despite the difference in hydrogen bond strength, both dimers present similar behavior and structure. Comparison with other systems based on similar interactions helps in understanding these results.},

Using fragment-localized state-consistent molecular orbitals, this approach enables direct construction of all diabatic states at the same root. Each diabatic state is formed as a linear combination of a set of diabatic configurations. The validity and effectiveness of DDSC have been demonstrated through its application to the LiH and (C 2 H 4 ) 2 + molecules. The results show that this method is suitable for constructing both valence and Rydberg diabatic states. One of the key advantages of DDSC is its ability to directly compute diabatic couplings, which can be converted to non-adiabatic coupling vectors along the reaction coordinate. The DDSC method efficiently builds the diabatic potential energy matrix, especially for systems with clear fragment partitions and weak inter-fragment interactions, such as charge transfer reactions.},

  abstract     = {Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) have emerged as promising alternatives for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) due to their drastically shorter atmospheric lifetimes (days to weeks vs years to decades for CFCs and HCFCs) and significantly lower global warming potential. While HFOs’ rapid degradation minimizes their direct environmental accumulation, the ecological risks posed by their reactive degradation intermediates—particularly hydrofluorocarbonyl oxide (HFCOO), a fluorinated Criegee intermediate generated via HFO-ozone reactions—require urgent mechanistic clarification. The atmospheric persistence and chemical reactivity of HFCOO are intrinsically governed by its excited-state dynamics, where competing photochemical pathways determine whether it undergoes ultrafast dissociation or survives to mediate secondary pollutant formation. In this paper, we examine the deactivation mechanism of HFCOO by employing high-level electronic structure calculations and on-the-fly surface hopping dynamic simulations. Our results reveal that the first excited singlet state (S 1 ) of HFCOO is a dark state populated via nπ* transitions, while the second excited singlet state (S 2 ), accessed through ππ* transitions, is crucial for O–O bond cleavage. We find that both syn- and anti-configurations of the S 2 state exhibit rapid O–O bond dissociation, producing hydrofluorocarbonyl (HFCO) and excited oxygen atoms within 30 and 50 fs, respectively. Our study underscores the ultrafast photodissociation dynamics of HFCOO in the atmosphere, contributing valuable insights into the environmental safety assessment of HFOs and improving atmospheric models for predicting their ecological impacts.},

Various reaction observables, such as reaction probability, integral cross sections (ICSs), rate constants, and energy disposal mechanism, are investigated at both state-selected and state-to-state levels. Attempts are made to analyze the reaction mechanism by combining the observed results. Total reaction probability for different J (three-body total angular momentum) collisions and ICSs at state-selected and state-to-state levels show rich resonances, a consequence of the well present in the underlying potential energy surface. The low-energy (∼0.074 96 eV) collision-induced dissociation channel affects the reaction, showing visible effects on reaction observables. These results are significantly different from the previously reported results, which likely improves the understanding of lithium chemistry in the early universe.},

  abstract     = {The photostability of DNA and RNA bases to ultraviolet radiation is essential to life, as evidenced by their ability to dissipate excess electronic energy via ultrafast internal conversion. Understanding how the functionalization of pyrimidine and purine affects electronic and structural relaxation pathways is crucial for insights into their selection as life's building blocks. It is also relevant for developing fluorescent biomarkers and photosensitizers for therapeutic applications. This study investigates how the functionalization of the C5=C6 bond in pyrimidine with heavier amino groups instead of hydrogen atoms to form 4,5-diaminopyrimidine, or with an imidazole ring to form purine, affects the photophysical properties and electronic and structural relaxation pathways observed in pyrimidine. The excited-state dynamics of 4,5-diaminopyrimidine, pyrimidine, and purine are disclosed using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy, supported by quantum chemical calculations. It is shown that the lowest-energy absorption band of 4,5-diaminopyrimidine is significantly red-shifted compared to that of purine and pyrimidine in both aqueous solution and acetonitrile, while the fluorescence quantum yield also increases. In acetonitrile, the initial 1 ππ* state population in 4,5-diaminopyrimidine decays radiatively and nonradiatively to the ground state and can also intersystem cross to populate a long-lived triplet state. In contrast, intersystem crossing is suppressed in aqueous solution, leading to relaxation of the 1 ππ* state population through fluorescence emission and internal conversion to the ground state. Our results demonstrated that both the strategic functionalization of pyrimidine and the solvent properties play important roles in tuning the optical properties and the electronic and structural relaxation pathways of the pyrimidine derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Kramers’s rate theory forms a cornerstone for thermally activated barrier crossing. However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes the analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most studies have thus focused on obtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium. Instead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system of a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a double-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path integral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key timescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE and SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a well at time t ≪ τ B , where τ B is the Brownian diffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point appears in the effective potential constructed from the density at t ⪅ τ B . Shortly after, the existence of a second potential well can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly, this timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant deviations from the equilibrium limit unless t ≫ τ B . We further calculate the current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric potentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory at a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height. Our results have important implications for controlling activated processes at finite times and demonstrate the importance of reaching long enough times to faithfully construct potential landscapes from experimental or simulation data.},

We demonstrated this principle on methyl-type and methane-type rotors, both in protonated and deuterated forms. We showed that the spin-tunneling problem in these cases is equivalent to solving a few spin-only problems where the tunneling interaction appears in the form of an effective spin Hamiltonian.

  abstract     = {We present a cost-reduced approach for the distinguishable cluster approximation to coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and iterative triples (DC-CCSDT) based on a tensor decomposition of the triples amplitudes. The triples amplitudes and residuals are processed in the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) basis. Truncation of the SVD basis according to the values of the singular values together with the density fitting (or Cholesky) factorization of the electron repulsion integrals reduces the scaling of the method to N 6 , and the DC approximation removes the most expensive terms of the SVD triples residuals and at the same time improves the accuracy of the method. The SVD basis vectors for the triples are obtained from the approximate CC3 triples two-electron density matrices constructed in an intermediate SVD basis of doubles amplitudes. This allows us to avoid steps that scale higher than N 6 altogether. Tests against DC-CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) on a benchmark set of chemical reactions with closed-shell molecules demonstrate that the SVD-error is very small already with moderate truncation thresholds, especially so when using a CCSD(T) energy correction. Tests on alkane chains demonstrate that the SVD-error grows linearly with system size, confirming the size extensivity of SVD-DC-CCSDT within a chosen truncation threshold.},

  abstract     = {Rotational diffusion is a fundamental physical process that determines the rotational motion of proteins in solution. It plays a role, for example, in molecular association processes and in theories of spectroscopic experiments in solution. In addition to experimental methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful method to investigate rotational diffusion. Diffusion models are fitted to rotational correlation functions extracted from the simulations. In this work, we conducted a time-dependent analysis of the model parameters prior to fitting, using extended all-atom MD simulations of ubiquitin as a model system. A comparison to Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations confirms whether the rotational dynamics observed in MD actually follow the theory of Brownian rigid-body diffusion. In addition, the analysis reveals correlation time intervals that are suitable for fitting anisotropic, semi-isotropic, or isotropic diffusion models. To this end, a two-step optimization scheme is employed that combines a global and a local search in parameter space. BD simulations are used to estimate uncertainties of the diffusion coefficients and directional uncertainties of the principal axes. We found that ubiquitin exhibits nearly semi-isotropic rotational dynamics, in good agreement with the experimental NMR data. The approach is general and can be used to investigate, for example, the rotational diffusion of molecules in various biomolecular environments or to compute NMR relaxation parameters of proteins.

  abstract     = {The methanol molecule is a sensitive probe of astrochemistry, astrophysics, and fundamental physics. The first-principles elucidation and prediction of its rotational–torsional–vibrational motions are enabled in this work by the computation of a full-dimensional, ab initio potential energy surface (PES) and numerically exact quantum dynamics. An active-learning approach is used to sample explicitly correlated coupled-cluster electronic energies, and the datapoints are fitted with permutationally invariant polynomials to obtain a spectroscopic-quality PES representation. Variational vibrational energies and corresponding tunneling splittings are computed up to the first overtone of the C–O stretching mode by direct numerical solution of the vibrational Schrödinger equation with optimal internal coordinates and efficient basis and grid truncation techniques. As a result, the computed vibrational band origins finally agree with experiment within 5 cm −1 , allowing for the exploration of the large-amplitude quantum mechanical motion and tunneling splittings coupled with the small-amplitude vibrational dynamics. These developments open the route toward simulating rovibrational spectra used to probe methanol in outer space and in precision science laboratories, as well as for probing interactions with external magnetic fields.},

By exploiting the variation in optical constants near atomic absorption edges, RSoXS enables unprecedented contrast between organic materials and unique sensitivity to molecular orientation. Despite its growing importance over the past 15 years, particularly in organic electronics research, detailed guidance on proper implementation and analysis has been limited. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to the technique, starting with the fundamental principles of near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and RSoXS contrast mechanisms. Using multi-walled carbon nanotubes as an illustrative example, we walk through best practices for sample preparation, measurement procedures, and data analysis. We present both model-free analysis approaches and detailed modeling using the open-source NIST RSoXS simulation suite. We intend this tutorial to serve as a practical resource for both new practitioners and experienced researchers, enabling quantitative analysis of molecular-scale structure in soft materials.},

This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered.

In this article, we analyze the role of elastic bending energy in the in vitro self-assembly of a spherical capsid in the limit where such energetic contribution dominates over compression stress. The model predicts that the capsid closes prematurely, and its final size is completely determined by a dimensionless constant f r , which is the ratio of the bending modulus to the line tension of the edge. In addition, we compute the critical size, the nucleation barrier, and the assembly rate of capsids and compare our results with those previously obtained by the original classical nucleation theory of viral capsids, where the elastic energy was neglected. Our model suggests that the competition between line tension and bending energy accelerates the rate of capsid nuclei production and causes capsids to close at suboptimal sizes, suggesting that capsomers have optimal bending angles that differ from the values measured in native viruses.},

We study water evaporation from chitosan-based hydrogels both for gels in close proximity and for essentially isolated gels. We find that water evaporation from single gels is diffusive, as for pure water drops, but that it happens more slowly. We interpret this difference in terms of a steady-state where the equilibrium properties entering the problem are effectively lower. In the case of many gels, the evaporation process becomes one-dimensional due to water-vapor saturation of the local environment of the gels. Using an electric analogy, we model the transition between the two cases, ultimately illustrating pathways for tuning the water retention properties of polymer hydrogels.},

In this work, we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe’s position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests that stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.},

The relative electronic density and spin population of each oligomer atom are obtained within the framework of different formalisms. The stabilization of different spin charge carriers in different poly(3-alkylthiophene)-based oligomers is shown. The role of the hybridization of the molecular orbitals of oligomers in stabilizing these charge carriers on an oligomer chain is analyzed. The main parameters of the spin Hamiltonian of spin charge carriers formed in compounds with various structures and morphologies are determined. A significant change in the electronic and magnetic properties of these charge carriers is shown to occur upon the modification of oligomers with graphene-like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons owing to hyperfine coupling of their extended π-conjugated structures. Magic numbers of some graphene-like additives with stabilized structural and electronic parameters were determined. This interaction is initiated by spin polarization, depends on the polycyclicity of the aromatic additive, and is characterized by several extremes. This effect was assumed to arise as a result of cross-coupling of oligomers and graphene-like subsystems with enhanced stability and electronic or/and magnetic properties. It enhances their hyperfine exchange coupling, and it affects a barrier for the spin magnetization switching. Such composite spin-filter functionality can be used in fully organic spin‒controlled molecular devices. This should have an impact on the wide fields of fully organic spintronics, nanotechnology, and quantum devices by controlling and manipulating spin and charge.},

Despite significant advances in understanding the driving forces behind LLPS, the specific impact of different types of interactions on phase separation behaviors remains underexplored. In this study, we utilized dissipative particle dynamics simulations to analyze the network structure, material properties, and dynamic behavior of intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) chains under hydrophobic and specific interactions with varying strengths. Our results demonstrate that while both hydrophobic and specific interactions can lead to phase separation, they produce distinct behaviors. Hydrophobic interactions promote the formation of more dynamic clusters, whereas specific interactions result in more stable condensates due to longer bond lifetimes and reduced mobility among IDP chains. Notably, the viscosity and diffusion coefficients of the condensates varied significantly between the two types of interactions, reflecting their differing material properties. Furthermore, in the case of alternating chains, specific interactions were not sufficient to induce phase separation structures. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of interaction types in shaping the phase separation behaviors of IDPs, providing valuable insights for fine-tuning the properties of biomolecular condensates.},

In this study, a one-to-three QC 1544 nm emission was first developed in an Er 3+ single-doped Ca 2 ScSbO 6 phosphor system. The Ca 2 ScSbO 6 host was selected since it possesses moderate maximum-phonon energy, which suppresses non-radiative relaxation while maintaining phonon-assisted energy transfers between Er 3+ ions. Spectroscopic measurements elucidated the QC mechanisms that two-step energy transfers, including ET1: 4 S 3/2 ( 2 H 11/2 ) + 4 I 15/2 → 4 I 9/2 + 4 I 13/2 and ET2: 4 I 9/2 + 4 I 15/2 → 4 I 13/2 + 4 I 13/2 processes, are responsible for the three-photon generation. The radiative transitions, non-radiative relaxations, and energy transfers of pertinent levels were taken into consideration when calculating the QC efficiencies for Er 3+ doped Ca 2 ScSbO 6 phosphors with varying Er 3+ concentrations. The concerned radiative transition rates of Er 3+ in Ca 2 ScSbO 6 were calculated in the framework of Judd–Ofelt theory, while the non-radiative transition rates were derived based on the energy gap law. The maximum energy transfer efficiencies for ET1 and ET2 were determined to be 99% and 93%. Finally, the QC efficiencies for Er 3+ doped Ca 2 ScSbO 6 phosphors were calculated, and the maximum value was confirmed in the 20 mol. % Er 3+ doped sample to be 232%. The primary reason for the deviation of the QC efficiencies from the theoretical maximum value of 300% was attributed to the fluorescence self-quenching of Er 3+ .},

  abstract     = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMS) are among the most promising porous materials for gas adsorption and separation, owing to their strong and selective interactions with guest molecules. However, simulating adsorption in such systems with high accuracy and efficiency remains a key challenge due to the need to model complex guest–MOF interactions and framework flexibility. Classical force fields often lack the precision to capture these effects, while ab initio methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale, long-timescale simulations. In this work, we developed a neural network potential (NNP) trained on highly accurate density functional theory (PBE-D4/def2-TZVP) level data derived from a single representative fragment of the Mg-MOF-74 framework, a prototypical OMS-containing MOF, with CO 2 molecules. Despite the limited training domain, the NNP accurately captured both intra- and inter-molecular interactions in the CO 2 –Mg-MOF-74 system, including those involving the open metal sites. We integrated this NNP into a hybrid molecular dynamic and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation workflow, enabling accurate modeling of CO 2 adsorption in flexible MOFs. This approach allows accounting for both framework dynamics and complex host–guest interactions with chemical accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the crucial role of framework flexibility in adsorption behavior and demonstrate that fragment-based NNP, when combined with advanced simulation techniques, offer a powerful and efficient approach for realistically modeling adsorption processes in MOFs with open metal sites.},

The extraction of activation energy from fatigue rate and FE switching speed analysis results shows that PEALD HZO has inherent defects during the deposition step, and the FE switching speed of PEALD HZO degraded faster under cycling stress than that of THALD HZO. XPS analysis results show that under cycling stress, oxygen vacancies are formed faster in PEALD than in THALD HZO. Furthermore, dynamic domain phase analysis shows that the electric fields required for switching in the relaxation to creep ( E 1 ) change in THALD HZO by +46%, while the electrical fields required for the transition from creep to flow ( E 2 ) rarely change under the cycling stress. However, E 1 and E 2 values of PEALD HZO change by +19% and −10%, respectively, depending on the cycling stress.},

  abstract     = {As a promising two-dimensional (2D) material, phosphorene has attracted tremendous research interest in both fundamental research and potential applications. Up to now, black phosphorene, blue phosphorene, violet phosphorene, and ultrathin nanosheets of red phosphorus have been successfully synthesized by mechanical exfoliation or epitaxial growth, while the synthesis of 2D white phosphorus (WP) has not been achieved. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of monolayer WP on Cd(0001) by means of low temperature (90 K) deposition. Scanning tunneling microscopy observation and first-principles calculations demonstrate that the monolayer WP is comprised of parallel dimer rows of P 4 molecules, resembling the a – c plane of γ-phase WP. The monolayer WP is semiconducting with a bandgap of 1.5 eV. Increasing the substrate temperature to 120 K leads to the formation of a quasi-3 × 3 superstructure with building blocks of P 4 nonamers. Voltage pulses from STM tip result in the structural transition from the quasi-3 × 3 superstructure to a 3 × 1 superstructure, of which the latter consists of alternating dimer rows and polymerized monomer rows. These observations demonstrate the essential role of dimerization, trimerization, and polymerization of P 4 molecules in the formation of 2D white phosphorus.},

  abstract     = {Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as a hole transport layer in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the PSS chains on the surface of PEDOT:PSS can absorb water molecules in humid environments, which accelerates the degradation of the perovskite at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface (hereafter referred to as the PP interface). In addition, the mismatched valence band levels between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite result in a high defect density at the PP interface, leading to significant open-circuit voltage loss. To address these issues, inspired by semiconductor etching processes, we employed an ethanol solution of potassium sorbate to etch the surface of PEDOT:PSS. After etching with ethanol, the sorbate anion and potassium ions from potassium sorbate fill the positions left by the etched PEDOT and PSS chains, forming new electrostatic interactions. This not only improves the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS but also improves the energy level matching between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite, facilitating hole transport at the PP interface. As a result, the open-circuit voltage of the device increased from 1.085 to 1.144 V, and the power conversion efficiency improved from 17.54% to 21.10%. The –C=O group of potassium sorbate also acts as a Lewis base, forming a Lewis adduct with the uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions at the PP interface, significantly reducing the defect density and enhancing the stability of the PSCs. This approach provides new insights and methods for improving both the efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs.},

  abstract     = {A novel scenario for the yielding of three-dimensional crystals in the quasistatic limit is presented. To this end, a face-centered cubic Lennard-Jones crystal under deformation and periodic boundary conditions is studied using Monte Carlo simulation in combination with successive umbrella sampling. As a reaction coordinate, a non-affinity parameter X is introduced. In terms of this parameter, the yielding of the crystal can be described as a phase transition, where at the system-size-dependent yield strain ɛ (y) , a deformed crystal, the “ N phase,” transforms into a nearly stress-free state, the “ M phase.” The N – M phase transition is dominated by the long-ranged elasticity of the crystal. As a consequence, there are no mixed states of both phases. Moreover, the free energy barrier between them is not associated with interfacial contributions, but rather scales with the total volume V of the crystal, implying non-convexity of the X -dependent free energy F ( X ). On the path from the N to the M phase with increasing X , the free energy F ( X ) develops two kinks that are associated with jumps of a field conjugate to the non-affinity parameter X . At the first kink, corresponding to the maximum of F ( X ), there is the nucleation of a partial slip plane, associated with the formation of a stacking fault that is circumvented by a loop of Shockley partial dislocations. At the second kink, at a lower free energy, the dislocations are annihilated leaving behind the stacking fault around now fully developed slip planes. The resulting M phase is inhomogeneous with periodically repeating stacking faults around the fully developed slip planes (here, the distance between the slip planes is determined by the periodic boundary conditions and the initial orientation of the crystal in the simulation box).},

We scrutinize the claim that a generic relaxation stretching is found close to T g , while varying stretching is established at high temperatures. The TFPI spectra observed in this work reveal no change of the stretching over a large temperature range, and a Cole–Davidson susceptibility yields stretching parameters within β CD = 0.39–0.80. The spectra display a high-frequency excess wing contribution, which prohibits a single power law description of the high-frequency flank of the main relaxation. Corresponding PCS decays measured close to T g display no change in the stretching either. Yet, the PCS spectra are overall broader than the TFPI spectra. They exhibit some variation and are superiorly described by a Kohlrausch function with β K = 0.52–0.73. Three of the eight systems significantly deviate from the previously reported generic relaxation function. We do not find indications that the spectral width changes within a narrow temperature interval to bridge the different stretching monitored by the two techniques. In addition to other possible explanations, we consider a sharp transition of the dynamics in the ns range not covered by the two techniques so far. Comparing PCS spectra of weakly polar liquids with their dielectric spectra, we find counterexamples of the claim that they become identical; the PCS spectra are narrower in these cases. Still, in this limit, the dielectric spectra display identical spectral shapes.},

This structure spontaneously forms from a disordered state, consistently with predictions obtained in an equilibrium system with similar geometrical properties under conservative dynamics. By varying the area fraction, we also observe stable coexistence between a granular fluid and an isolated square crystal. Using realistic simulations based on the discrete element method and an idealized collisional model integrated via event-driven molecular dynamics, we not only reproduce experimental results but also help to gain further insights into the non-equilibrium phase coexistence. Through the direct phase coexistence method, we demonstrate that the system shows behavior highly similar to an equilibrium first-order phase transition. However, the crystal remains at a higher granular temperature than the fluid, which is a striking non-equilibrium effect. Through qualitative arguments and supported by kinetic theory, we elucidate the role of the coupling between local structure and energy transfer mechanisms in sustaining kinetic temperature gradients across the fluid–solid interface.},

The values were obtained using molecular simulations with polarizable DLM/2022-BK3 force fields. In most cases, our results show excellent agreement with experiments and often similar or better predictive capability compared to the most accurate polarizable models available in the literature developed for simulations of anhydrous alkali halides. Relatively worse predictions are observed for salts in which very small anions strongly polarize large cations. Our results for density, energy, chemical potential, and heat capacity of melts and crystals, and also melting temperatures, confirm the excellent phase transferability of the force fields used. They also serve as a substitute for missing experimental data for rubidium and cesium halides and highlight inaccuracies in some experimental data for the densities of LiBr, NaF, and NaBr crystals found in the literature.},

To orient the domains in an external magnetic field, thulium ions were added to the system (replacing sodium in the surfactant with thulium and adding more TmCl 3 ). The critical behavior of the forward scattering and the correlation length were observed to be more mean-field-like. This can be explained by the presence of the trivalent thulium ions mediating between water and butyric acid. The high- Q scattering could be distinguished in the different directions and the ideal two-dimensional critical composition fluctuation exponent η xy = 1/4 was observed, while the other exponent η z = −0.08 ± 0.06 was slightly negative due to a finite acceptance angle and the finite magnetic field. The orientationally averaged high- Q exponent x of this study is well-explained by η xy = 1/4 of the two-dimensional Ising behavior and η z = 0.},

The following two peculiarities had been experimentally observed: (i) the electrical conductivity, σ , of Li-systems is extremely lower than that of the other alkali metal counterparts and (ii) the Nernst–Einstein conductivity, σ NE , derived from the self-diffusion coefficients, D + and D − , of LiFSA and LiFTA is lower than the real conductivity, σ > σ NE , which is usually the other way around. Hypothetical MD simulations made by increasing the size or decreasing the valence of Li + revealed that the strong interaction between neighboring cation and anion caused by the high surface charge density on Li + is responsible for both (i) and (ii). Theoretical consequences derived from the momentum conservation and the separation of σ into its components in terms of velocity correlation coefficients proved that, in addition to these features, the significant mass difference between a cation and anion for the Li-systems leads to (iii) the almost exclusive contribution of Li + to σ and (iv) a positive contribution of the Li + –Li + cross correlation, which is negative for other systems. Hypothetical simulations at high temperatures, at which the anions actually decompose, suggested that features (i), (ii), and (iv) stem from the “intermediate” temperature range at which these salts are fluid.},

  abstract     = {Efficient large-scale computer simulations of aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the complexity of these systems evidences the difficulties in describing solution properties without due account of polarization. Different strategies to remedy this problem are parameterizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of solvated ions. In this work, we compare results from TIP4P/ ɛ and OPC models, which are parameterized to predict the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The performance of the models is rated according to the Vega–Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P/ ɛ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally well, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/ ɛ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, and densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, but also surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid–vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/ ɛ to describe densities of NaCl solutions for models parameterized to their crystal and melt properties only. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz–Berthelot rule, or tune the ion’s Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and show that a robust parameterization can be achieved without invoking the concept of charge scaling.},

This work is based on the classical theory of nucleation. Formulas for the nucleation energy, incorporating linear tension as well as the influence of the nucleation surface curvature on surface tension, were employed for two distinct scenarios: the nucleation being formed on a convex (spherical) nanosubstrate or on a flat nanosubstrate. From the equilibrium condition of a spherical-cap nucleus on a convex surface, an equation defining the wetting contact angle by the standard angle of a large nucleus on a flat surface was obtained, and from the condition of the extremum of the nucleus energy, an equation for its critical radius was obtained. The method of successive approximations by the small parameter was utilized to solve these equations. A similar approach was adopted for the case of spherical-cap nucleation on a flat surface. This approach enabled the derivation of explicit expressions for the wetting function on both convex and flat substrates. The analysis of the obtained dependencies demonstrated that incorporating the linear tension and the Tolman effect resulted in a reduction of the energy required for heterogeneous nucleation. This effect is most significant on well-wetted convex nanosubstrates.},

  abstract     = {The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete image of interactions in electrolytes. Theories that extend the diluted Debye–Hückel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales that, however, turned out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoids detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here, we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive molecular dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite overcharged solvent-in-salt states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric, and transport modifications; on the other, we have quantified the resulting nanoscale ion organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypotheses or phenomenological parameters, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has possibly been misinterpreted.},

Optical absorption spectra and XANES pre-edge features confirm the absence of significant Fe 2+ , indicating that iron is predominantly present as Fe 3+ . The optical absorption spectra exhibit characteristic features of Fe 3+ ions, including a blue shift of the absorption edge as Li 2 O content increases, which is attributed to the conversion of BO 3 to BO 4 units. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Fe 3+ ions are present in tetrahedral coordination, with the coordination number increasing at low Li 2 O concentrations. Raman spectroscopy further confirms that iron alters the connectivity of the borate network by disrupting superstructural borate units and forming links with boron atoms, particularly when Fe 3+ occupies tetrahedral sites.},

  abstract     = {Following the previous study with an extensive range of quantum calculations involving different electronic states of the BN − anion [Dulitz et al. , Phys. Scripta 100 , 055411 (2025)], we now extend that work by modeling the quantum dynamics of the collision cooling of its rotational states in order to investigate possible paths for bringing this molecular anion down to temperatures of a few Kelvins. This specific ionic system is of direct interest when modeling experiments in cold ion traps where He or Ar atoms can function as the chief buffer gases that drive the anions down to the low trap temperatures. We employ accurate, ab initio calculations of the potential energy surfaces for the title system in its ground electronic state, interacting with either He or Ar atoms. We then obtain a wide range of inelastic cross sections and the ensuing rate coefficients in order to model the quantum kinetics of the time evolution of the cooling steps under different temperature and trap conditions. The results are analyzed and employed to estimate the cooling efficiency paths provided by various trap arrangements for the title anion. The results show that—using either of the two investigated species—the buffer gas cooling process very efficiently brings the anions to their lowest rotational states. These findings are very promising for future applications in the field of anion laser cooling.},

  abstract     = {The structural and physical/chemical properties of metallic materials are closely linked to the composition and configuration of their molten state. In this study, the evolution of the local structure in Al–Zn alloys with varying compositions during the quenching process was investigated using on-the-fly machine learning force field (MLFF) simulations based on ab initio molecular dynamics. The results indicate that the first coordination shell of the Al–Zn alloy melt undergoes an anomalous expansion within a specific temperature range, which deviates from the previously reported linear negative expansion, such as metallic Al, Zn, and Sn. The temperature interval of the anomalous expansion decreases with increasing concentration of Zn. Local structural changes, including the abnormal increase in coordination number and the emergence of a shoulder in the second peak of the bond angle distribution function, further confirmed the presence of the anomalous expansion. In addition, the slope of the energy–temperature relationship and the activation energy of diffusion change upon temperature decrease, which suggests that this phenomenon is associated with atomic diffusion driven by thermal excitation. The anomalous expansion is also confirmed in a larger system (over 10 4 atoms) by MLFF simulations with first-principles accuracy. We found that an increase in cluster radius induces a decrease in pressure due to the interfacial energy of the cluster at ∼1200–1100 K for Al–38Zn melts, which in turn leads to a looser arrangement of the atoms. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms governing atomic structure evolution and liquid–liquid transitions.},

In particular, we focused attention on the free energies associated with the exchange of the connective/dangling characteristics of a pair of protons located at key subunits of the trimer. In one of the processes, the isomerization produces a modification in the topology of the cluster’s connectivity pattern, from branched-like to chain-like motifs. In contrast, along the other transformation, reactant and product states are both chain-like and equivalent. Changes in associated free energies were computed following reversible paths described in terms of order parameters involving angular degrees of freedom. As a common feature, along both isomerizations, we registered concomitant migrations of the excess proton. The strongly confining, single-well characteristics of the potential energy surface along the asymmetric stretch coordinate promote compact, ∼ 0.35 Å long structures for the isomorphic polymer associated with the itinerant proton, which persist along the complete isomerization path. These observations suggest the absence of tunneling contributions to the resulting mechanisms that control the proton transfer process. Estimates for the corresponding isomerization rates are also computed.},

However, key aspects of the internal conversion process in the GFP chromophore derivatives remain largely unclear. Based on quantum chemical methods and on-the-fly nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, we investigated the ultrafast photoinduced cis–trans isomerization phenomenon in the para-amino (NH 2 -HBDI) derivative of the GFP chromophore, which is intrinsically non-fluorescent. We demonstrate that upon excitation to the excited (S 1 ) state, there occurs nonselective progression along the distortion of exocyclic methine-bridged imidazolinone (I) and phenylamine (P) bonds, leading to ultrafast nonradiative relaxation via S 1 ( 1 ππ *)/S 0 internal conversion. This internal conversion process is facilitated by multiple S 1 /S 0 conical intersections with dominant imidazolinone (Φ I ) dihedral rotations. Our results provide insight into the effect of the amino group on the dynamics of fluorescent probes. Therefore, these observations contribute to a valuable understanding of photoinduced switching phenomena and find a relation between structure and dynamics.},

The hydrogen bond interaction between the excited vibrational stretches of H 2 O (symmetric stretching mode in v = 1) and OH vibration of the γ-phosphate of the ground state ATP leads to efficient intermolecular energy flow, which is followed by intramolecular energy distribution in ATP. The phosphorus–oxygen chain functions as an efficient pathway for energy distribution to the ribose moiety and then ultimately to the terminal stretches of the adenine moiety, distributing most of the available energy to high-frequency OH, CH, and NH bonds on a sub-picosecond scale, while the hydrogen bond maintains its lifetime of ∼2 ps.},

However, their activation and transformation remain challenging due to the intrinsic chemical inertness of the C(sp 3 )–H bonds, particularly under mild reaction conditions. Gas-phase metal clusters serve as an ideal platform for probing mechanisms of alkane activation at a molecular level. Herein, we systematically investigated the reactions of gas-phase tantalum oxide anions (Ta x O y − , x = 1–5, y = 1–7) with CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 combining mass spectrometry experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Among the 27 mass-selected clusters, the Ta 2 O 4 − cluster has exceptional reactivity, converting ethane and propane to free alkenes with rate constants significantly higher than other reactive clusters. In contrast, most clusters, including Ta 2 O 1–3 − and Ta 2 O 5 − , have negligible reactivity or conventional dehydrogenation pathways to form free H 2 . The DFT calculations revealed that the unique reactivity of Ta 2 O 4 − originates from its distinct electronic and geometric structures. In the reaction of Ta 2 O 4 − with C 2 H 6 , the flexible geometric structures of the critical transition state (TS) result in a high number of vibrational states above the TS, which leads to alkene rather than dihydrogen formation. A novel strategy to tune metal cluster reactivity and product selectivity toward alkanes is thus provided.},

This study investigates the electronic structure, spectroscopy, and photochemistry of the ClSCl and ClClS isomers, with implications for their potential role as near-UV absorbers in Venus’ atmosphere. High-level CCSD(T) and MRCI+Q calculations indicate that ClSCl is the global minimum, but ClClS is 2.34 eV higher in energy. For ClSCl, the photo-absorption cross-section displays a strong deep-UV peak at 197 nm and a much weaker band centered near 370 nm. In contrast, ClClS shows two comparatively intense near-UV bands at 350 and 271 nm. Potential energy surface analyses show that ClSCl’s excited states undergo non-adiabatic coupling upon near-UV irradiation, with deep-UV excitation leading to rapid ClS + Cl formation. Although both isomers absorb in the same near-UV spectral range as the unknown Venus absorber, these isomers are photochemically unstable under the actinic UV radiation and so are unable to play major roles.},

The control exhibited by such effects on each microscopic passage from reagents to products in defined initial and final quantum states has been characterized. In particular, the collisions of reagents in selected quantum states lead to the formation of the reaction transition state in specific configurations that open the passage to ionic products in the ground and in the first excited electronic state.

While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.},

  abstract     = {Spin crossover (SCO) in transition metal (TM)-containing solid state materials remains a challenge for the electronic structure calculations as some of the electronic states may have a significant multi-reference character. The periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method accurately describes strong correlations in TM-containing crystalline systems. In this work, pEHCF has been applied to study the electronic structure of the high spin and low spin states in the Fe(pyridine) 2 Ni(CN) 4 metal–organic framework (MOF). The relative energy of the spin states involved in SCO has been calculated, and the degeneracy line exhibiting a strong dependence on the distance between an Fe ion and the CN groups has been identified. The degeneracy line also displays a step-like dependence on the position of the pyridine ligands in the narrow interval of 2.08–2.10 Å, while outside this interval, the dependence is weak. Low-temperature paramagnetism of the Fe(pyridine) 2 Ni(CN) 4 SCO-MOF has been explained by the triplet ground state of Ni in the square-planar coordination with the CN groups. The electronic structure of a recently synthesized Fe 2 (H 0.67 bdt) 3 SCO-MOF has been also investigated. This MOF contains two types of Fe ions and exhibits unusual spin crossover behavior above room temperature. Our calculations confirm that in the temperature range of 300–423 K, Fe 2 ions undergo a spin transition from quintet (S = 2) to singlet (S = 0), while Fe 1 ions exist in the low-spin configuration in both initial (300 K) and final structures (423 K).},

MD simulations were carried out for bulk supercooled liquids and solutions in contact with ice. Solute and water hydrogen bonding, orientational and translational order, and hydrogen bond jump dynamics were compared in bulk and as a function of distance from the solute molecules. Reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine interfacial widths, friction coefficients ( κ ) with ice, and solution phase viscosities ( η ). Ionic solutes were found to reduce orientational and translational ordering near the ice interfaces. However, in bulk liquids, we find a correlation between orientational ordering and the statistics of water hydrogen bonds—a donor–acceptor imbalance in water has the greatest impact on ordering in the bulk liquids. Although ionic solutions exhibited similar effects on the water structure, the effect on dynamics depends most directly on donor–acceptor imbalance. Solutes that are hydrogen bond acceptors were found to slow hydrogen bond lifetimes relative to hydrogen bond donors. We also observed a direct correlation between the liquid phase hydrogen-bond jump times and shear viscosity. Finally, of all the solutes studied, only DMSO and sodium formate exhibited increased friction at the ice–water interface.},

  abstract     = {Understanding energy transport at the nanoscale is an open and fundamental challenge in the molecular sciences with direct implications for the design of new electronics, computing devices, and materials. While nanoscale energy transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces, particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system—a molecular junction—subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis, a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect—heat transport hysteresis—that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices.},

  abstract     = {There have been rapid developments in new spectroscopic methods to collect coherent multidimensional optical spectra using incoherent action-detection schemes such as fluorescence or photocurrents. Recently, we demonstrated the acquisition of two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of molecular ions cryogenically cooled in the gas phase measured from photodissociation of a weakly bound N 2 “tag” molecule. Important differences exist between traditional multidimensional spectra and their action-based counterparts, which are now just being fully realized. Here, we apply standard nonlinear response theory in the pure-dephasing limit to model the cryogenic ion 2D IR spectra of the complex fac - R e ( C O ) 3 ( CH 3 C N ) 3 + in the carbonyl stretch region. The simulated spectra show overall good agreement with the experiment and provide key insights into some of the unique characteristics of action-based 2D spectra. Notably, cryogenic ion 2D IR spectra only display bleaching features and inherent cross peaks between all excited vibrational modes. Action-based 2D IR spectra, therefore, can be measured even in the absence of anharmonicity and anharmonic coupling between modes. While the response from any single mode can be fully modeled from parameters measured in the linear spectrum, under multi-mode excitation both diagonal and cross-peak intensities also depend on the relative dipole moment orientations of other vibrational modes on the same molecule, a quantity not available from linear spectra and often not easily obtained in traditional nonlinear spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {The transport through a medium is primarily identified with the rate of the process and population densities inside it. The environmental conditions, such as the viscosity and temperature of the system, effectively the diffusion coefficients, govern stochastic transports. In addition, the structure of the potential characterizing the medium plays a crucial role in determining the key features of the transitions and relaxations. Here, we explore the importance of detailed information about the medium of transport in terms of the diffusion coefficient and the position of the reference point at which the rate is measured. Our study reveals that the varying positions of the states considered and the diffusion coefficient characterizing them have significant impacts on the integrated understanding of the kinetics of the diffusion-limited processes. We consider the left-to-right well transition in a double-well potential. We vary the location of the reference point systematically in the right well to measure the state-dependent rate. Interestingly, we observe that the rate exhibits a power-law relation with the distance from the barrier top. Another important perspective of our study is to consider varying diffusion coefficients for the two wells to account for the state-dependent fluctuations and explore their effects in the determination of rates of the transport processes. The observations reveal some critical aspects regarding the fundamental roles of the originating and target states in transport. The results of the current study not only enrich the elemental understanding of diffusion-controlled kinetics but also indicate the paths in developing advantageous technologies based on optimizing the conditions of transport.},

  abstract     = {The integration of machine learning (ML) with density functional theory has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the accuracy of density functional methods. While practical implementations of density functional approximations (DFAs) often exploit error cancellation between chemical species to achieve high accuracy in thermochemical and kinetic energy predictions, this approach is inherently system-dependent, which severely limits the transferability of DFAs. To address this challenge, we developed a novel ML-based correction to the widely used B3LYP functional, directly targeting its deviations from the exact exchange-correlation functional. By utilizing highly accurate absolute energies as exclusive reference data, our approach eliminates the reliance on error cancellation. To optimize the ML model, we attribute errors to real-space pointwise contributions and design a double-cycle protocol that incorporates self-consistent field calculations into the training workflow. Numerical tests demonstrate that the ML model, trained solely on absolute energies, improves the accuracy of calculated relative energies, demonstrating that robust DFAs can be constructed without resorting to error cancellation. Comprehensive benchmarks further show that our ML-corrected B3LYP functional significantly outperforms the original B3LYP across diverse thermochemical and kinetic energy calculations, offering a versatile and superior alternative for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the influence of light–matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned into resonance with a vibrational transition directly leading to the formation of the corresponding product, even when that transition is spectroscopically dark. However, tuning cavity frequency to match an absorption-dominant transition shared across both reaction pathways does not necessarily result in pronounced rate enhancements and selectivity. Together with an additional analysis using an asymmetric double-well model, we highlight the greater complexity of underlying factors governing chemical reactivity, which extend beyond considerations of transition dipole strengths and thermal population distributions that shape linear spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found that in all scenarios, the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our proof-of-concept study confirms at a fully quantum-mechanical level that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.},

This dependence raises the question of whether N should be treated as the integral of the total electron density for systems with noninteger (fractional) N . We answer this question negatively by observing that the Fermi–Amaldi functional is identical with the exact exchange functional for any number of fermions or bosons occupying the same spatial orbital and in systems where occupied orbitals have zero differential overlap. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports that the preservation of certain properties of N -dependent functionals requires treating N as a parameter. Our analysis also suggests that the Fermi–Amaldi functional is discontinuous within a given spin-channel of the total electron density and continuous on the boundaries between different spin-channels at N = 1. This implies that the jump discontinuity of the exact exchange–correlation potential observed at N = 1 is a correlation effect. The last conclusion is illustrated with numerical calculations.},

It makes it possible to use a general potential without requiring integrals and quadrature. An important disadvantage of collocation is the need to work with nonsymmetric matrices. Eigenvalues of a large matrix are best computed with an iterative method, but iterative eigensolvers are much more efficient for symmetric matrices. Heretofore, it has been costly to use collocation when the basis set and Hamiltonian matrix are large. We demonstrate that it is possible to systematically make the collocation matrix whose eigenvalues one must compute more and more symmetric and propose an efficient iterative eigensolver for a nearly symmetric matrix. Little is known about exploiting near symmetry. We use a combination of filter diagonalization and an iterative linear solver powered by a three-term recursion relation. We test the ideas with a 6-D Hamiltonian and show that accurate energies are obtained despite the asymmetry.},

To extend iFCI beyond previous basis set limitations, this work introduces a novel natural orbital (NO) screening approach, incremental NO full configuration interaction (iNO-FCI). By consideration of the importance of virtual orbital selection in the convergence of iFCI, iNO-FCI maximizes the consistency between orbitals selected for each correlated body. iNO-FCI employs a principle of cancellation of errors and ensures that the same set of virtual NOs is used for interdependent terms. This strategy significantly reduces computational cost without compromising precision. Computational savings of up to 95% are demonstrated, allowing access to larger basis sets that were previously computationally prohibitive. iNO-FCI is herein introduced and benchmarked for several difficult test cases involving double-bond dissociation, biradical systems, conjugated π systems, and the spin gap of a Cu-based transition metal complex.},

Results for grand canonical or isothermal–isobaric ensembles are recovered when either the volume or the number of particles are fixed, while consistency with Einstein’s thermodynamic theory is also encountered. A water-like Ising model illustrates how the standard mean-field approach proceeds in the ensemble, while it validates the correctness of our fluctuation formulas numerically.

Here, we investigate the escape properties of run-and-tumble particles, a special kind of self-propelled particle characterized by a constant self-propulsion speed and random tumbling of heading direction, from a random potential that combines an asymmetric smooth component with spatially random perturbations (SRPs). The statistical reversal of escape direction is primarily governed by both self-propulsion speed and tumbling rate. SRPs tend to enhance the escape probability over the higher barrier relative to the base smooth potential in most cases and remarkably reduce the peak of the first passage time distributions in both escape directions, resulting in long tails. Specifically, we find that the logarithm of mean first passage time shows a linear dependence on the intensity and correlation length of SRPs. However, in contrast to the significant influence on the escape process, the SRPs have a weak effect on the overall shape of the probability density function except for some small-scale fluctuations.

  abstract     = {Understanding how the electronic structure of electrodes influences electrocatalytic reactions has been a longstanding topic in the electrochemistry community, with predominant attention paid to metallic electrodes. In this work, we present a defect physics perspective on the effect of semiconductor band structure on electrochemical redox reactions. Specifically, the Haldane–Anderson model, originally developed to study multiple charge states of transition-metal defects in semiconductors, is extended to describe electrochemical redox reactions by incorporating the solvent effect, inspired by the Holstein model. The solvent coordinate and the actual charge on the redox species in reduced and oxidized states are assumed to be in instant equilibrium, and the transitions between these states are defined by the framework of Green’s function. With these treatments, the charge state transitions are handled in a self-consistent manner, and the implications of charge self-consistency (or, equivalently, charge self-regulation) on electrocatalysis can be investigated explicitly. We first confirm that this self-consistent approach is essential to accurately depict the hybridization effect of band structure by comparing the model-calculated ionization potential and electron affinity, as well as the redox potential of the species, with those obtained from density functional theory calculations. Next, we illustrate that the effect of charge self-consistency is key to obtaining a fuller understanding of the catalytic activities of semiconductor electrodes and the source of asymmetry in reorganization energies, which is often observed in prior ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we discuss how band structure impacts redox reactions in the strong coupling limit. Finally, we compare our work with other relevant studies in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Quantum critical systems are extremely sensitive to parameter variation near the critical point. Moreover, the derivatives with respect to the order parameter may exhibit divergence. This quantum criticality is widely utilized to enhance the performance of quantum metrology. In this study, we take the dissipative quantum Rabi model (QRM) as an example and use the bath-engineering technique to simulate the dissipative QRM to explore the impact of the quantum criticality on the quantum metrology under dissipation. We numerically calculate the dynamics of the inverse variance of the dissipative QRM around the critical point by using the quantum-simulation method and compare our results with those obtained by the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). Our simulations show that in the case of the strong dissipation or the high temperature, the precision does not exhibit divergence when approaching the point of the quantum phase transition, and the enhancement of quantum metrology by quantum criticality is relatively limited. More importantly, the quantum-simulation method based on the bath-engineering technique can accurately simulate the dynamical evolution of the critical system and consumes significantly fewer resources as compared with the HEOM. Thus, it can be an alternative solution for investigating the dynamical evolution of larger critical systems for quantum metrology.},

Motivated by recent experimental observations of loops, here, we discuss some of their statistical properties. In particular, we highlight that the transition-state rate is not only an upper bound on the true reaction rate but also a physical property of the loops. We further find that loops can be unambiguously divided into two sub-ensembles. Those consist of short loops, which are brief excursions from the transition state, and long loops that get trapped in the reactant or product wells before eventually returning to the barrier. Finally, we show that the loop time distribution contains information about both the reaction rate coefficients and their transition-state-theory counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Comprehending sound attenuation is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. Despite decades of studies, the underlying mechanism of sound attenuation in glasses is still debated. In this perspective, we review recent work on sound attenuation in amorphous solids. We focus on the role of defects and heterogeneous elasticity, and we also discuss attenuation in model amorphous solids without defects. We review our definition of attenuation defects and show that they strongly influence sound attenuation. However, we also find another contribution to sound attenuation that cannot be attributed to attenuation defects. We confirm an earlier result of Kapteijns et al. [Kapteijns et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 081101 (2021)] that heterogeneous elasticity theory predicts relative changes of sound attenuation in model two-dimensional glasses if the configuration-to-configuration elastic constants fluctuations are used to quantify the heterogeneity. We extend this finding to similar three-dimensional glasses. We end by discussing the Euclidean random matrix model, which exhibits Rayleigh scaling of sound attenuation but does not have quasi-localized excitations and, thus, probably does not have sound attenuation defects. We propose that the mechanisms behind sound attenuation can be more fully understood by approaching the problem from two directions: one where the strong influence of defects is studied and another where sound attenuation is studied in defect free, although disordered, materials.},

Polaritonic states are distinguished by the inheritance of light and matter properties together. The cavity quantum electrodynamics picture of a two-level system interacting with a photon can define these states. Here, polaritonic devices perform classical operations through the collective interactions of an Avogadro number of molecules. By doing so, the newly formed states inherit a low effective mass and, therefore, behave similar to lightweight carriers of charge. At the same time, it possesses a collective coherence length as large as the mode volume of the cavity. This allows us to engineer hybrid devices that are specific in functions with quantization in both energy and momentum. This perspective gives glimpses of our views on polaritronics and its applications in quantum sensing and communication. We also pitch into understanding the limitations of such techniques along with the future outlook to obtain outperforming devices for real-world applications.},

Under appropriate control, homonuclear dimer (diatom) dissociation (half-collision) and the inverse process of atom-pair collisions are shown to reveal translational (EPR-like) entanglement that enables molecular wave packet teleportation. When such processes involve electronic-state excitation of the diatom, the fluorescence following dissociation can serve as an entanglement witness that unravels the molecular-state characteristics and evolution. Such entangling processes can also exhibit anomalous quantum thermodynamic features, particularly temperature enhancement of a cavity field that interacts with dissociated entangled diatoms.},

By extending the standard approach to FRET to include energy transfer (ET) channel to the environment, we show that, in the absence of plasmonic enhancement effects, the Förster radius, which defines the characteristic distance for efficient FRET, is reduced due to a competing ET process. We demonstrate that the reduction in the Förster radius can dramatically affect fluorescence from large ensemble of molecules whose emission kinetics is dominated by FRET-induced concentration quenching. In particular, we perform numerical calculations for dye-doped polymer films deposited on top of a metallic substrate to find that, at high dye concentrations, the emission kinetics slows down considerably as compared to the same films on a glass substrate, in sharp contrast to acceleration of single-molecule fluorescence near the metal. Furthermore, the effective fluorescence decay rate exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with varying film thickness, consistent with the experiment, indicating a non-trivial interplay between the metal quenching and concentration quenching mechanisms.},

It is a versatile and widely used tool for scientists studying protein aggregation kinetics, as it enables the isolation and separate study of discrete reaction steps contributing to protein aggregation, specifically elongation and secondary nucleation. However, the seeding levels required to achieve dominating effects on each of these steps separately have been established largely by trial-and-error due in part to the lack of availability of integrated rate laws valid for moderate to high seeding levels and generally applicable to all common underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, we improve on a recently developed mathematical method based on Lie symmetries for solving differential equations and with it derive such an integrated rate law. We subsequently develop simple expressions for the amounts of seed required to isolate each step. We rationalize the empirical observation that fibril seeds must often be broken up into small pieces to successfully isolate elongation. We also derive expressions for average fibril lengths at different times in the aggregation reaction and explore different methods to break up fibrils. This paper will provide an invaluable reference for future experimental and theoretical studies in which seeding techniques are employed and should enable more sophisticated analyses than have been performed to date.},

Previous experiments and simulation studies have shown that such systems are capable of forming a two-dimensional kagome lattice at room temperature. However, it is well established that the crystallization is strongly hampered by the formation of long-lived metastable aggregates. For this reason, recent studies have investigated activity , i.e., self-propulsion of the Janus particles, as a mechanism to accelerate the formation of stable kagome structures [S. A. Mallory and A. Cacciuto, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 141 , 2500–2507 (2019)] at selected state points. Here, we extend, first, the investigations of active Janus colloids for a broader range of densities and temperatures. We also characterize in detail the associated nucleation of kagome clusters, as well as their structure in the steady state. Second, to make contact with the equilibrium case, we propose a simple activity time protocol where an initially chosen activity is switched off after a finite time. With this protocol, we not only find kagome structures in a much broader range of densities than in the purely passive case but also obtain a kagome crystallization boundary very close to that proposed in earlier Monte Carlo simulations.},

For a single particle, small rings lead to reduced diffusive motion, while large rings render activity to the particle. For multiple particles, the particles not only feel their own attractive ring but are also attracted by the rings around all other particles. As expected, for ring sizes larger than the particle diameter, the feedback leads to crystallites whose lattice constant is set by the feedback ring radius. However, here, we demonstrate that for long delays (compared to the Brownian time), the colloidal particles start to oscillate around their lattice positions, with the crystallites ultimately collapsing to a close-packed lattice whose lattice constant corresponds to the particle diameter. This effect is caused by the time delay between the particle misplacement within the lattice and the corresponding change in the feedback force. Furthermore, we show that apart from the expected hexagonal crystallites, the time delay may result in the formation of uncommon new states in the case that the ring size is chosen slightly smaller than the particle diameter.

The indirect approach for determining the caloric response is used in combination with molecular dynamics simulations based on the Gay–Berne model.

However, extracting properties related to the free energy, such as the force (or pressure) on confining walls, does not readily emerge from conventional polymer dynamics simulations due to the entropic contributions inherent in these free energies. Here, we propose an alternative method to compute such forces and the associated free energies, based on empirically measuring the average force required to confine a polymer chain between parallel walls connected by an artificial elastic spring. This measurement enables us to interpolate the expression for the free energy of a confined self-avoiding chain and offers an analytical expression to complement the classical theory of ideal chains in confined spaces. Therefore, the significance of our method extends beyond the findings of this paper: it can be effectively employed to investigate the confinement free energy across diverse scenarios where all kinds of polymer chains are confined in a gap between parallel walls.},

  abstract     = {A combined density functional theory and microkinetic study of the ketonization of acetic acid on facets of CeO 2 has been performed to understand the reaction mechanism by identifying the key reactive intermediates and active surface structures. The overall Gibbs free energies of activation, i.e., the difference between the transition state of the C–C coupling step and the surface-bound acetates, were determined to be 2.08 and 1.81 eV on CeO 2 (111) and 2.01 and 1.52 eV on CeO 2 (110) involving bidentate and monodentate acetates, respectively. Micro-kinetic analysis revealed that monodentate acetate (minor surface species) is more reactive than bidentate one (major surface species), and the (110) surface is more active than the (111) surface. The α-H abstraction step is mainly controlled by the basicity of the surface O sites, while the configuration of the adjacent Ce–O pairs determines the C–C coupling step, and together, they dictate the overall ketonization activity. Compared with CeO 2 (111), a stronger basicity of surface O 3c on CeO 2 (110) facilitates efficient α-H abstraction, whereas a matching configuration of the adjacent Ce–O pairs enables facile C–C coupling, resulting in a higher ketonization activity. Detailed structural analysis revealed that the two adjacent Ce–O pairs in a rhombus configuration on the same Ce–O–Ce chain of the CeO 2 (110) surface form the most active ensemble for the ketonization of carboxylic acids via monodentate carboxylates. The understanding and insights will benefit the design of efficient ketonization catalysts based on transition metal oxides.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of CO 2 to value-added compounds is an important part of the effort to store and reuse atmospheric CO 2 emissions. Here, we focus on CO 2 hydrogenation over so-called inverse catalysts: transition metal oxide clusters supported on metal surfaces. The conventional approach for computational screening of such candidate catalyst materials involves a reliance on density functional theory (DFT) to obtain accurate adsorption energies at a significant computational cost. Here, we present a machine learning (ML)-accelerated workflow for obtaining adsorption energies at the metal–oxide interface. We enumerate possible binding sites at the clusters and use DFT to sample a subset of these with diverse local adsorbate environments. The dataset is used to explore interpretable and black-box ML models with the aim of revealing the electronic and structural factors controlling adsorption at metal–oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the explored ML models can be used for low-cost prediction of adsorption energies on structures outside of the original training dataset. The workflow presented here, along with the insights into trends in adsorption energies at metal–oxide interfaces, will be useful for identifying active sites, predicting parameters required for microkinetic modeling of reactions on complex catalyst materials, and accelerating data-driven catalyst design.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen production from water electrolysis is mainly affected by the high overpotential and slow reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the feasible strategies for achieving energy-saving hydrogen production. In this work, a cactus-like nickel sulfide–lanthanum carbonate hydroxide (NiS x –LaCH) composite was synthesized on the surface of Ni foam by a hydrothermal method and sulfurization process for the first time. This cactus-like structure can significantly improve the specific surface area of the catalyst and the electrolyte accessibility. The coupling of NiS x and LaCH brought about the electron structure redistribution and enhanced the stability and conductivity. The generated synergistic effect of NiS x –LaCH/NF improved the adsorption of urea/water molecules and the intrinsic catalytic activity. It exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction, which can drive the current density of 100 mA cm −2 at low potentials of 1.36 V and −0.26 V, respectively. Assembling NiS x –LaCH/NF into urea electrolysis system can reduce the cell voltage by 0.22 V compared to water electrolysis. This indicates that using UOR instead of OER could achieve energy-saving hydrogen production and has promising prospects in treating urea-rich wastewater.},

  abstract     = {Organic polymer photocatalysts have gained much interest in recent years, largely because of their photocatalytic activity toward sacrificial hydrogen production from water. Time-resolved electronic absorption spectroscopy is commonly employed to understand the photophysical processes occurring following photon absorption, which in turn is used to rationalize photocatalytic activities. The homopolymer of dibenzo[ b , d ]thiophene sulfone ( P10 ) is a well-studied and high performing photocatalyst for sacrificial hydrogen evolution from water. While sacrificial reagents are well documented as a prerequisite for this reaction, their roles in the picosecond–nanosecond photodynamics have yet to be determined using transient electronic signatures. By employing lifetime density analysis of time-resolved electronic absorption spectra of P10 in a variety of solvent mixtures, we show that the electron polaron (the required charge for hydrogen evolution) is produced on the 0.5–100 and 50–800 ps timescales via excitonic quenching by triethylamine and methanol, respectively, two common sacrificial electron donors. We conclude that there is significant pre-association of triethylamine with the P10 polymer, resulting in efficient excitonic quenching. This mechanism competes effectively with radiative excitonic relaxation, which occurs on similar timescales, reducing exciton losses and improving polaron yields.},

  abstract     = {Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes, ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine molecules aggregated in the crystalline α -phase and an SPP on a planar gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump–probe spectroscopy to separate the system’s fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and, thus, the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton–plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.},

Straight and kinked dislocations of 60° and screw character residing on shuffle and glide set planes are investigated. Except for the 60° shuffle, all these dislocations are sessile: they do not move for modulus-normalized resolved shear stresses up to 0.11 or higher. Straight 60° shuffle dislocations move at different critical resolved shear stresses, depending on the orientation of the core relative to molecules in the crystal as well as on the sense of loading. The lowest modulus-normalized stress to move a straight 60° shuffle dislocation is 0.044: comparable to the Peierls barrier of diamond. Depending on their structure, kinks can either pin the dislocation or lower its critical resolved shear stress to a modulus-normalized level of 0.037. Our work shows that proton ordering does not ease dislocation glide in hexagonal ice. We discuss the consequences of these findings for theories of plastic flow in ice I h and ice XI.},

The theory also provides a solid starting point for calculating glassy dynamics starting from the microscopic forces. Network liquids, which interact via long-lived, geometrically constraining interactions, such as covalent bonding, have competing energy scales for bond breaking events and for collective particle rearrangement events. In this paper, we show microscopic calculations via the RFOT theory can predict how glassy dynamics depends on the degree of bonding, focusing on mixtures of network-forming particles with non-bonding impurities as in familiar window glass. By introducing soft-core nonbonding interactions, we show that the viscosity and fragility of the network liquid model can be computed as a function of composition, temperature, and density or pressure. We find that the fragility in the strong-bond limit depends only on composition and not on the bond breaking energy and describes well corresponding measurements in sodium or potassium silicates. The model predicts that materials with weaker bonds may show a non-monotonic trend in the fragility as a function of composition.},

We introduced two thiocyanate vibrational probes, methyl thiocyanate (CH 3 SCN, neutral) and ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN, anionic), which selectively localize in specific nano-domains. 2D NMR provided insights into solvent structure and probe location, while 2D IR captured solvation dynamics. Our results show that these small probes do not alter the solvent structure, regardless of charge. However, solvation dynamics depend on long-range electrostatic ordering in the DES and the local shielding effects of the nano-domain where the probe resides.

  abstract     = {Condensation and cavitation in water play a crucial role in industry and atmospheric science. We employ molecular dynamics to investigate and compare both nucleation phenomena at 450 and 550 K, taking cavitation data mostly from our recent study [Lamas et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 158 , 124504 (2023)]. We obtain interfacial free energies across a wide range of supersaturation through direct coexistence, seeding, and, using a novel approach, also through spontaneous nucleation simulations. The consistency between these methods supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory even for nuclei as small as two molecular diameters in radius. Condensation at 550 K occurs several orders of magnitude faster than at 450 K due to the lower interfacial free energy. Unlike Lennard-Jones systems [Sanchez-Burgos et al. , Phys. Rev. E 102 , 062609 (2020)], cavitation and condensation are not governed by the same interfacial free energy trend. For condensation, interfacial free energy is nearly constant at 550 K and increases slightly at 450 K with nucleus size. For cavitation, in contrast, it decreases at both temperatures, leading to a higher cavitation rate. The kinetic pre-factor, influenced by the parent-phase density, further enhances the cavitation nucleation rate. Finally, the orientational ordering of interfacial molecules weakens with temperature and curvature, but no clear link between molecular structure and interfacial free energy is found. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective on the thermodynamic and molecular factors governing nucleation in water, bridging the mechanisms of condensation and cavitation across different temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Recent computational studies have examined the structural relaxation time τ α of cooled liquids, the atomic diffusivity D within grain boundaries of crystalline materials, and the interfacial regions of bulk, thin film, and nanoparticles of crystalline materials under equilibrium conditions. They have revealed the general occurrence of string-like collective atomic motion and its importance for understanding the typically non-Arrhenius dynamics of all these materials. In the present work, we extend our study of this type of collective motion in crystalline metal materials to consider the α – β displacive structural transition of titanium from its lower temperature hexagonal close-packed to body-centered cubic structure as the temperature ( T ) is elevated. In particular, we employ molecular dynamics simulation and focus on the role of string-like collective motion in mediating this displacive transition and the dynamics of the phase transformation process. Above the α – β transition temperature, as the temperature increases, we observe that the scale of collective motion progressively decreases, and the activation free energy of the moving interface of the new phase is well-described by the average string length L s , similarly to τ α of glass-forming liquids. As a special feature of this transition, we find that the strings are localized in channels having a temperature-dependent width within the crystal. We thus find another physical example of a class of materials in which collective motion plays a crucial role in material dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The potential energy curves (PECs) for the ground and low-lying excited states of AuTe are calculated using multireference configuration interaction with the Davidson correction, incorporating spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The ground state of AuTe is identified as the Ω = 3/2[(1) 2 Π 3/2 ] state. Spectroscopic constants for the ground and low-lying excited states are derived from the computed PECs and generally exhibit excellent agreement with available experimental results. In addition, the experimental energy level ordering of the Te atom, in which the 3 P 0 state lies below the 3 P 1 state, is successfully reproduced by incorporating both the second-order SOC and dynamic electron correlation effects. The analysis indicates that while second-order SOC contributes to lowering the energy of the 3 P 0 state, including the dynamic electron correlation is essential for achieving the correct energy ordering. The spin–orbit (SO) effect in the ground state of AuTe is found to be negligible, resulting from the mutual cancellation of SO contributions from Au and Te atoms, which is rationalized through the natural bond orbital analysis. These results offer valuable insights into the fundamental nature of gold–chalcogen bonding and serve as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical investigations of AuTe and related systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of vinyl iodide (VI), examining its molecular properties and photodissociation dynamics using high-level ab initio and density functional theory methods explicitly incorporating spin–orbit coupling (SOC). To align with experimental results, accurately determining the bond dissociation energy requires an explicit consideration of SOC. For ab initio calculations, correcting for basis set superposition error proves essential for obtaining quantitatively accurate values consistent with the experimental value. We calculate vertical excitation energies and systematically characterize the potential energy curves (PECs) along the C–I dissociation coordinate. This study establishes explicit excited state assignments for VI for the first time, highlighting the significant role of triplet states, particularly the 4A′ and 4A″ states in photodissociation dynamics. These states are found to contribute the broad UV absorption band around 250 nm mainly through σ* ← n″ and σ* ← n′ excitations rather than the previously proposed π* ← n″ excitation. Our calculated PECs provide theoretical validation and detailed explanations for the experimentally observed wavelength-dependent quantum yields and anisotropy parameters of I( 2 P 3/2 ) and I*( 2 P 1/2 ) species.},

  abstract     = {8-oxoguanine (OG) is a prevalent DNA lesion and exhibits a significantly lower oxidation potential than natural nucleic acid components, making the formation of OG •+ radical cation the most efficient hole trap in the one-electron oxidation of DNA. Nitric oxide ( • NO) is a precursor to reactive nitrogen species and plays multiple roles in biological activities, including DNA base nitrosation and enhancement of DNA radiosensitivity in radiotherapy. Herein, we report the reaction of • NO with 9-methyl-8-oxoguanine radical cation (9MOG •+ ), a model compound for OG •+ nucleoside. 9MOG •+ was generated via redox dissociation of [Cu II (9MOG) 3 ] •2+ and its reaction with • NO was investigated using electrospray ionization guided-ion beam mass spectrometry as a function of kinetic energy. Multiple coupled reaction potential energy surfaces were computed using spin-projected ωB97XD, DLPNO-CCSD(T), and CASPT2 methods, with theoretical results benchmarked against experimentally determined reaction thermodynamics. The synergistic experiment and computation revealed distinct reaction mechanisms and dynamics across the open-shell singlet, close-shell singlet, and triplet states formed in radical–radical collisions. Comparison with the reaction of • NO with guanine radical cation (G •+ ) [Benny and Liu, J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 085102 (2023) and Benny et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 161 , 125101 (2024)] addressed the resemblances and distinctions between • NO reaction dynamics with OG •+ vs G •+ . On the one hand, both systems present spin–orbit charge transfer, forming vibrationally excited NO + (ν + = 1) product ions. On the other hand, OG •+ demonstrates lower nitrosation efficiency than G •+ due to few pathways, less favorable thermodynamics, and constrained stereodynamics. Only the closed-shell singlet [5-NO-9MOG] + product was detected. This study provides new insights into • NO-mediated DNA damage.},

  abstract     = {The photodissociation dynamics of CH 3 S radicals was studied at different excitation energies within the first absorption band. The CH 3 S radicals were produced with a broad vibrational energy distribution from the photodissociation of CH 3 SH at 210 nm, which allowed us to study the effect of the vibrational excitation on the photodissociation dynamics. The photofragments, CH 3 (ν), S( 3 P J ), and S( 1 D) were detected by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization schemes in slice-imaging experiments, and the corresponding translational energy and angular distributions were obtained for each fragment. Vibrationless CH 3 S radicals are excited to the A ̃ 2 A 1 state that predissociates via three possible dissociative states ( ⁠ a ̃ 4 A 2 , B ̃ 2 A 2 , and 4 E), leading to the formation of CH 3 (ν = 0), CH 3 (ν 2 ) with inverted population and S( 3 P J ) with J = 0, 1, and 2. Instead, vibrationally excited CH 3 S radicals are excited in the Franck–Condon region of the B ̃ 2 A 2 dissociative state, where they dissociate directly to produce fast and anisotropic S( 3 P 0 ) fragments, according to the adiabatic correlation established by the new calculated potential energy curves reported in this work. The B ̃ 2 A 2 state is crossed by the dissociative 4 E state, and this crossing leads to the formation of slower and less anisotropic S( 3 P 1 ) and S( 3 P 2 ) fragments that apparently correlate with CH 3 populated with one quantum in the C–H stretch (ν 1 ), suggesting that this vibrational mode is involved in the non-adiabatic dynamics associated to the B ̃ 2 A 2 / 4 E crossing. Finally, S( 1 D) fragments show a Boltzmann-like kinetic energy distribution with an isotropic angular distribution, associated with slow fragments produced by statistical dissociation from the locally excited A ̃ 2 A 1 state of CH 3 S.},

To obtain precise EA values of molecular species, we implement rotational envelope simulations of photoelectron energy spectra of molecular anions. Benchmark simulations for the well-characterized OH − successfully reproduce our cryogenic SEVI experimental spectra. Through application of this methodology to NO − and O 2 − , we establish EA(NO) = 0.029 24(46) eV and EA(O 2 ) = 0.4477(10) eV, markedly enhancing the precision of these fundamental parameters compared to previous determinations.},

Absolute ion numbers in the crystal were determined for the experimental data with a percentage error of ∼10%. This analysis can be performed in a few seconds for an individual crystal image, and therefore, the method enables the objective, and efficient, analysis of such images in real time. The approach adopted also shows promising performance for identifying Ca + ion numbers in images of mixed-species crystals, thereby enhancing the experimental methodologies for studying the kinetics and dynamics of cold ion–molecule reactions.},

  abstract     = {Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) is a well-known technique to study gas-surface processes, and it is characterized by two main quantities: the adsorbate binding energy and the pre-exponential factor. While the former has been well addressed in recent years by both experimental and computational methods, the latter remains somewhat ill-defined, and different schemes have been proposed in the literature for its evaluation. In the astrochemistry context, binding energies and pre-exponential factors are key parameters that enter microkinetic models for studying the evolution over time of the chemical species in the universe. In this paper, we studied, by computer simulations, the effect of different pre-exponential factor models using water, ammonia, and methanol adsorbed on amorphous and crystalline ices as test cases: specifically, the one most widely used by the astrochemical community (Herbst–Hasegawa), the models provided by Tait and Campbell, and an extension of the Tait formulation including the calculation of the vibrational partition function. We suggest the methods proposed by Tait and Campbell that provide TPD temperature peaks within 30 K of each other while avoiding demanding quantum mechanical calculations, as they are based on tabulated data. Finally, when the explicit inclusion of the vibrational partition function is needed, we propose a cost-effective strategy to include all the thermal contributions in the partition functions without the need for performing a full vibrational calculation of the whole system.},

  abstract     = {Detailed balance, the correct thermalization of electronic state populations, is an essential and elusive property of quantum–classical non-adiabatic dynamics methods. While some methods can reproduce detailed balance through physically well-motivated algorithmic adaptations, or by construction of a conserved Hamiltonian function, the physical mechanism leading to detailed balance is not understood from first principles. Coupled trajectory mixed quantum–classical (CTMQC) dynamics may provide some insight into the question, as it can be derived from first principles in the exact factorization theorem of full quantum mechanics. Although we find that the current conventional flavor of CTMQC, which conserves energy across the ensemble of trajectories (known as CTMQC-E), fails to reproduce detailed balance as in Ehrenfest dynamics, we show that a similar variant, where total energy is conserved on each trajectory independently, provides a major improvement over Ehrenfest with respect to detailed balance. Moreover, we show that the theory achieves convergence of the mean electronic potential energy with the number of energy levels that successively increase in energy. This new variant is shown to, by simulations on the Tully models and double arch model, retain a good description electronic populations and coherence compared to exact quantum dynamics. We explain the thermalization mechanism through the additional terms that distinguish CTMQC from Ehrenfest dynamics. We show that the improvement can be explained via geometric contributions to the nuclear force, resulting from the quantum momentum, which act to oppose motion when electrons decohere upward in energy and act to enhance motion otherwise, somewhat emulating the mechanism of frustrated hops. These results have considerable implications for the applicability of CTMQC to condensed phase simulations.},

The dimer is modeled in terms of a two-level system that represents the excited electronic states of the monomers, which are coupled to a dissipative bath of vibrational modes with an Ohmic spectral density under diverse conditions that correspond to homo- or heterodimers, weak or moderately strong exciton–vibration coupling, high- or low-frequency vibrations, and high or low temperature. Through the equivalence class path integral algorithm, the averaging with respect to static disorder is performed with computational effort comparable to that of a single SMatPI calculation. We find that static disorder alters the dynamics and equilibrium properties of the RDM in significant and often subtle ways, which can mimic effects associated with stronger or weaker dissipation. The impact of disorder is most pronounced at low temperatures, where it tends to suppress coherence and often induces upward shifts in the population of the higher-lying state, while the effects on the off-diagonal RDM element and the eigenstate populations depend nonmonotonically on the asymmetry parameter. At high temperatures, the population shift is weaker and reversed for some parameters.},

  abstract     = {Constructing an accurate approximation to nonadiabatic rate theory that is valid for arbitrary values of the electronic coupling has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical chemistry. Ring-polymer instanton theories offer a very promising approach to solve this problem, since they can be rigorously derived using semiclassical approximations and can capture nuclear quantum effects such as tunneling and zero-point energy at a cost similar to that of a classical calculation. A successful instanton rate theory already exists within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, for which the optimal tunneling pathway is located on a single adiabatic surface. A related instanton theory has also been developed for nonadiabatic reactions using two weakly coupled diabatic surfaces within the framework of Fermi’s golden rule. However, many chemical reactions do not satisfy the conditions of either limit. By employing a tunable dividing surface that measures the flux both along nuclear coordinates and between electronic states, we develop a generalized nonadiabatic instanton rate theory that bridges between these two limits. The resulting theory approximates the quantum-mechanically exact rates well for the systems studied and, in addition, offers a novel mechanistic perspective on nonadiabatic reactions.},

The 1 kJ/mol level of accuracy for correlation energy estimates of moderate-size systems and typical reaction energies can be achieved with relatively high compression rates of amplitude tensors via rejecting singular values smaller than ∼ 1 0 − 4 ⁠ . For the most extensive system studied (the YbCl 7 cluster used for modeling of the ytterbium center in the ytterbium dichloride crystal), only ∼ 3 % of compressed double amplitudes were shown to be significant. Thus, the rank reduction for the relativistic coupled cluster method with single and double theory, improving its computational scaling, is feasible. The advantage (if not necessity) of using the Goldstone diagrammatic technique rather than the “antisymmetrized” Brandow one is underlined.

The design and control of novel layered architectures requires a microscopic understanding of their intra- and inter-layer interactions. Ab initio simulations, based on, e.g., density functional theory, often provide valuable insights regarding their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and electronic properties. However, such calculations are often computationally demanding, thus limiting the treatment to relatively small length and time scales. Classical molecular dynamic simulations, based on physically motivated force-fields, may offer a viable computationally efficient alternative, when parameterized appropriately against ab initio reference data for small model systems. The general strategy usually relies on a separate treatment of intra- and inter-layer interactions. When considering the latter, popular isotropic potentials, such as those presented by Lennard-Jones and Morse, often fail to simultaneously capture binding and sliding physics. Therefore, anisotropic interlayer force fields, based on the Kolmogorov-Crespi scheme, have become the tool-of-choice. In this review, we summarize progress in the field of anisotropic interlayer force field, including the fundamental theoretical framework, parameterization, and representative applications to selected physical properties. We also discuss potential directions for further advancement, based on state-of-the-art developments in simulation technologies.},

  abstract     = {Catalyst dissolution and surface restructuring are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, often leading to formidable activity–stability trade-offs and obscure electrochemically induced surface species that severely hinder the understanding and optimization of electrocatalysts under diverse harsh operating conditions. As even state-of-the-art characterization techniques lack the resolution and efficiency for the unambiguous elucidation of decomposition kinetics and reconstruction dynamics at electrocatalytic interfaces, many atomistic modeling approaches—following the recent advances in physics-driven machine learning—have been widely used to facilitate the atom-by-atom understanding and rational engineering of electrocatalyst stability and dynamics. This Perspective systematically assesses classical and data-driven approaches in theoretical surface science and computational catalysis, recognizing their achievements and highlighting their limitations in throughput, efficiency, accuracy, bias, transferability, and scalability toward enabling realistic and predictive modeling of electrocatalyst degradation and reconstruction. By examining different methods spanning first-principle simulations, surface sampling, neural network interatomic potentials, and generative deep learning models, it is underscored how such data-driven computational techniques help elucidate the precise nature of various key interfacial atomistic processes to address existing technical challenges in surface modeling and provide a new paradigm to optimize dissolution kinetics and restructuring dynamics for electrocatalyst design.},

The ions in EAN are treated as spheres interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential with an embedded point charge and a permanent dipole moment. We show that our simulation results for EAN are consistent with experimental data and then explore the effects of the molecular parameters on the viscosity of ionic liquids. Our results indicate that viscosity monotonically increases with ionic charge and dipole moment but non-monotonically changes with ionic diameter (or molar volume). This non-monotonic trend arises from the competition among the electrostatic interactions, molecular packing, and size asymmetry between the cation and anion. Our model also shows that long-lived ion pairs result in higher viscosities.},

Our findings indicate that the 1 C 4 glucopyranose ring conformation can stabilize the sucrose conformer, appeared only in the GLYCAM06 and OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A force fields.

Despite a quantitative understanding of dilute solutions, an analytical theory for concentrated ones has remained a challenge for almost a century, although a number of parameters and effects incorporated into theories increase with time. Here, we show that the conductivity of univalent salt solutions can be perfectly interpreted using a simple model that relies on a modified mean-field description of electrostatic interactions and on a classical approach to calculating colloid electrophoresis. We derive a compact equation, which predicts that the ratio of conductivity to that at an infinite dilution is the same for all salts and depends only on the product of the harmonic mean of ion hydrodynamic radii and the square root of concentration. Our equation fits very well the data for inorganic salts (up to a few mol/l), although at a very high dilution, the relaxation correction seems necessary.},

Four low-energy complex isomers were predicted, among which the global minimum was experimentally identified through agreement between theoretical and measured rotational constants. The phenyl substituent was found to introduce additional non-covalent interactions beyond the typical C CO 2 ⋯O tetrel bond, including secondary C⋯O CO 2 tetrel bond and C–H⋯O CO 2 weak hydrogen bond, which collectively stabilized the complex and distorted the epoxide ring. Further π-electron localization and natural orbital for chemical valence analyses revealed that the phenyl ring modulated local electron density, while comparative calculations of binding energy further indicate that the synergistic weak interactions between styrene oxide and CO 2 contribute to enhancing the structural stability of the styrene oxide–CO 2 complex. These results shed light on substituent-controlled CO 2 recognition in epoxide frameworks, offering molecular-level insight that may inform the design of functional materials for CO 2 capture and chemical transformation.},

The S( 1 S) + CS(X 1 Σ + ) channel was directly observed from the measured images of S( 1 S) products in the wavelength range of 290.10–336.88 nm. The translational energy distributions and angular distributions of fragments have been derived. Rovibrational states of the CS(X 1 Σ + ) co-products were partially resolved in the translational energy spectra and can be populated up to the energy limit of the available energy. Experimental results also show that the product anisotropy parameters are β 2 > 0 and β 4 ∼ 0. The latter indicates that the intermediate state reached by the first one photon excitation has a quite long lifetime, while the former suggests the molecules undergo a parallel transition from the intermediate state to the final state upon the second photon excitation and then experience a fast dissociation process. Combined with previous studies, we propose a possible dissociation mechanism: after absorbing two photons in the range of 290.10–336.88 nm, the CS 2 molecule may undergo a sequential transition 1 A 1 ( 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) ← 1 1 B 2 ( 1 Δ u )/ 1 A 2 ( 1 Δ u ) ← X 1 Σ g + ⁠ , then directly dissociate or couple to other electronic states and dissociate.},

Using computational simulations based on Redfield theory, we analyzed how microcavity coupling influences energy relaxation and transfer within and between LH2 aggregates. Our results show that the exciton transfer rate between B850 rings follows a square dependence on the light–matter coupling strength, in agreement with Fermi’s golden rule. Interestingly, the energy transfer rate remains almost independent of the number of LH2 complexes. This behavior is explained by the molecular components of the polaritonic wavefunction overlaps. These findings highlight the crucial role of cavity-induced polaritonic states in mediating energy transport and provide a theoretical framework for optimizing microcavity environments to enhance exciton mobility in light-harvesting systems and related photonic applications.},

We take pyrene as an example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affect the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in the IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing the theoretical IR spectra generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the experimental IR spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy, which utilizes the infrared multiple photon dissociation. All simulations are accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first-principles accuracies while keeping computational costs low. We have found that the harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are investigated in detail. These findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar dust.},

The global energy minimum of the dimer, in which a strong hydrogen bond forms between the two OH groups, does not yield the most intense spectral features. Instead, bands from a higher energy structure are prominent and derive from dimers held together primarily by a single and far weaker –C≡C–H⋯O–H hydrogen bond. This suggests that helium nanodroplet encapsulation kinetically traps the dimers in a local minimum on account of the rapid cooling and low temperature.

In this work, we have introduced a “perturbation-sensitive” density to construct the natural spinor basis, termed FNS++. Using FNS++, we achieve excellent accuracy when compared to experimental data and other theoretical results, even after truncating nearly 70% of the total virtual spinors. We also present pilot applications of the 4c-LRCCSD method to calculate the polarizability spectra of 3 d transition metals. By employing the FNS++-based 4c-LRCCSD, we have been able to compute polarizabilities for systems with over 1200 virtual spinors, maintaining low computational cost and excellent accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce several approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis (ISA) method based on exponential basis functions. These approximations are categorized into linear and non-linear models, referred to as LISA and NLIS, respectively. By particular choices of hyperparameters in the NLIS model, both LISA and the Minimal-Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method can be reproduced. Four LISA variants are constructed using systematically generated exponential basis functions derived from the NLIS model applied to atomic systems. The performance of these LISA variants and NLIS models is benchmarked on 15 small molecules, including neutral, anionic, and cationic species. To facilitate comparison, we propose several metrics designed to highlight differences between the methods. Our results demonstrate that LISA, employing Gaussian basis functions derived from the NLIS model on isolated atomic systems, achieves an optimal balance of computational accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, particularly in minimizing the objective function.},

These spin-adapted cumulants enable rigorous treatment of both S ̂ z and S ̂ 2 symmetries in quantum systems, providing a foundation for spin-resolved electronic structure methods. We show that complete spin adaptation—referred to as complete S -representability —can be enforced by constraining the variances of S ̂ z and S ̂ 2 ⁠ , which require the 2-RDM and 4-RDM, respectively. Importantly, the cumulants of RDMs scale linearly with system size— size-extensive —making them a natural object for incorporating spin symmetries in scalable electronic structure theories. The developed formalism is applicable to density-based methods, one-particle RDM functional theories, and two-particle RDM methods. We further extend the approach to spin–orbit-coupled systems via total angular momentum adaptation. Beyond spin, the framework enables the adaptation of RDM theories to additional symmetries through the construction of suitable irreducible tensor operators.},

Spin-constrained unrestricted HF (c-UHF) states are used to define a manifold of basis states for the Hill–Wheeler equations, which are discretized and solved as a non-orthogonal configuration interaction expansion. The method was tested on two-electron systems that are dominated by static and/or dynamic correlations. In a minimal basis set for H 2 , the resulting GCM quickly captures the ground-state full configuration interaction energy with just a few c-UHF states, whereas second-order perturbation theory on top of the GCM is needed to recover over 90% of the correlation energy in the cc-pVDZ basis set.},

For elongated species, this can require orientational alignment with the pore axis. We perform benchmark analyses for such solution-phase systems where one of these species is elongated in order to quantify the dependence of this passing propensity, P , on pore diameter and on the rotational diffusion coefficient, D r , of the elongated species. In particular, we consider the passing of a spherical and an elongated spherocylindrical shaped species in a cylindrical pore in an implicit solvent, where these species cannot overlap. Passing is mediated by diffusive Brownian motion of these species as described by strongly damped Langevin dynamics. We quantify scaling of P for pore width just above the threshold where passing is sterically blocked, and also reveal a significant decrease in P for lower D r . We also consider the dependence of P on the aspect ratio of the elongated species and obtain an exact result in the limiting regime of large aspect ratio.},

Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.},

  abstract     = {Mixed quantum-classical methods, such as surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics, have proven useful for describing molecular processes involving multiple electronic states. These methods require propagating many independent trajectories, which is computationally demanding. Therefore, we propose the single potential evaluation Ehrenfest dynamics (SPEED), a variation of Ehrenfest dynamics where all trajectories are propagated using a common local quadratic effective potential in the diabatic representation. This approach replaces the computational cost of propagating multiple trajectories with the evaluation of a single Hessian at each time step. We demonstrate the equivalence of standard Ehrenfest dynamics and SPEED in two realistic systems with (at most) quadratic diabatic potential energy surfaces and vibronic couplings: a quadratic vibronic coupling Hamiltonian model describing internal conversion in pyrazine and a model of atomic adsorption on a solid surface. The efficiency gain of our approach is particularly advantageous in on-the-fly ab initio applications. For this reason, we combined SPEED with the ALMO(MSDFT2) electronic structure method, which provides the diabatic potential describing charge transfer between two molecules. We find that SPEED qualitatively captures the temperature dependence of the hole transfer rate between two furan moieties and accurately predicts the final charge distribution after the collision. In contrast, but as expected, our approach is insufficient for describing photoisomerization of retinal due to the high anharmonicity of the potential energy surfaces already in the diabatic representation.},

Simulations were done using both classical and quantum nuclear dynamics, this last via ring polymer molecular dynamics. Similar effects of the cavity are obtained in both cases. Namely, whereas the infrared spectrum is observed to be split for all cavity frequencies, no effects on structural properties are detected. In addition, transport and dynamical properties, including the diffusion coefficient, molecular reorientation, and hydrogen bond jump exchange times, show no effect due to cavity coupling when an extended statistical analysis is performed.},

So far, the precise nature of the postulated precursor has also remained elusive in state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics models, including single-moving CO molecules. In the present work, we have constructed a density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential energy surface that is valid for all ionic degrees of freedom of the system, comprising many molecules at various coverages and moving surface atoms. Our Langevin dynamics with electronic friction based on the new potential energy surface identified the precursor state as dynamically trapped molecules around 6 Å from the surface that arise from adsorbate–adsorbate interactions.

We present in this work two fundamental advances in particle-based, bottom-up CG theory for systems obeying quantum statistical mechanics. We first expand the bottom-up CG formalism to include indistinguishable quantum particles, including bosons and fermions. We next introduce a variational optimization procedure for CG model parameterization, which is founded on the relative entropy minimization (REM) principle, and then bridge the classical and quantum REM methods through a semiclassical expansion in terms of the Feynman path centroid. We provide numerical examples of REM CG models of distinguishable and indistinguishable quantum systems, including as examples a harmonically trapped bosonic system and liquid water. The theoretical results presented here constitute a means to accelerate simulating thermal quantum systems, ranging from distinguishable particle systems at higher temperatures to quantum indistinguishable particle systems at lower temperatures.},

Here, we present an efficient method to estimate MFPT from fixed-length MD simulations by leveraging the single-exponential tail (SET) behavior of first-passage time distributions in monomer-transition-based nucleation processes. Our approach allows for the estimation of MFPT for censored samples using information from uncensored ones via the characteristic decay rate of the SET, eliminating the need to observe complete nucleation trajectories. We validate this method using both artificial nucleation datasets and unbiased MD simulations of CO 2 hydrate nucleation. The results demonstrate that, with an appropriate choice of simulation length and number of independent runs, the SET-based approach accurately recovers the full MFPT and nucleation parameters while substantially reducing computational costs.

  abstract     = {Trehalose, in the presence of water, exhibits the strongest bioprotective effects among disaccharides across a wide temperature range. To elucidate the molecular origin of trehalose’s superiority, it is important to compare the hydration state of different disaccharides under dilute conditions, which selectively reflects the interactions between water and single solute molecules without interferences from other disaccharide molecules, in terms of the following hydration properties: hydration number, reorientational cooperativity, and reorientational relaxation time. Specifically, the solute dependence of those hydration properties at different concentrations and different temperatures is worth investigating although such comprehensive understandings are yet to be achieved. In this study, we performed dielectric spectroscopy (from 80 MHz to 1 THz) on 0.5%–5% aqueous solutions of maltose, sucrose, and trehalose at 283, 298, and 313 K. The concentration-dependent analysis at 298 K revealed an almost identical hydration number (∼25 hydration water per solute molecule) and reorientational cooperativity (∼1.2 times greater than bulk water) for all the disaccharides. However, hydration water surrounding trehalose, with ∼three times slower reorientation than bulk water, exhibited the longest reorientational relaxation time among the three disaccharides, by up to 10%. The temperature-dependent analysis also showed that trehalose significantly differs only in reorientational relaxation time even at 283 and 313 K. These results demonstrate that, compared to maltose and sucrose, the hydration water surrounding trehalose is characterized only by its slowest reorientation and not by the hydration number or reorientational cooperativity. Our findings offer a possible mechanism of the superior bioprotective effects of trehalose to other disaccharides.},

  abstract     = {Many biological and nanotechnological processes rely on the self-assembly of tubular structures. For this reason, theoretical models that offer insights into this process and ways to control its final outcome are essential. In this work, we study the conditions under which tubules are self-assembled spontaneously from free subunits in solution and explore the possible formation pathways using classical nucleation theory and an elastic model in the stretching-dominated regime. We find that a dimensionless number, B ⁠ , that measures the relative importance of bending with respect to line tension, controls the fate and polymorphism of the tubules. In our model, the assembly process starts from the spontaneous formation of a curved patch that eventually closes into a tube following a combination of two generic mechanisms: (i) curvature fluctuations, which are dominant for B ≤ 1 and (ii) aspect-ratio fluctuations, mainly occurring when B ≫ 1 ⁠ . Using mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we describe the kinetics of formation of closed tubes and determine the final radii distribution of the assembled tubes, which can significantly differ from the equilibrium one. This work opens the way to optimize the efficiency of assembly and control the radius of different tubular nanostructures, such as viral, carboxysome, or DNA origami tubules.},

  abstract     = {The role of particle shape in evaporation-induced auto-stratification in polydisperse colloidal suspensions is explored with molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of spheres and aspherical particles. A unified framework based on the competition between diffusion and diffusiophoresis is proposed to understand the effects of shape and size dispersity. In general, particles diffusing more slowly (e.g., larger particles) tend to accumulate more strongly at the evaporation front. However, larger particles have larger surface areas and therefore greater diffusiophoretic mobility. Hence, they are more likely to be driven away from the evaporation front via diffusiophoresis. For a rapidly dried bidisperse suspension containing small and large spheres, the competition leads to “small-on-top” stratification. Here, we employ a computational model in which the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to particle mass. For a mixture of spheres and aspherical particles with similar mass, the diffusion contrast is reduced, and the spheres are always enriched at the evaporation front as they have the smallest surface area for a given mass and, therefore, the lowest diffusiophoretic mobility. For a mixture of solid and hollow spheres that have the same outer radius and thus the same surface area, the diffusiophoretic contrast is suppressed, and the system is dominated by diffusion. Consequently, the solid spheres, which have a larger mass and diffuse more slowly, accumulate on top of the hollow spheres. Finally, for a mixture of thin disks and long rods that differ significantly in shape but have similar mass and surface area, both diffusion and diffusiophoresis contrasts are suppressed, and the mixture does not stratify.},

When colloidal particles smaller than the epitaxial particles were included as additives, the formation ratio of the two hexagonal structures changed depending on the size of the additive particles. To examine the dependence of the formation ratio of the two hexagonal structures on the size of the small colloidal particles, Brownian dynamics simulations were performed. Under a high particle density and strong interaction conditions, the hexagonal structure with a lower formation ratio without additives became the major product when additives much smaller than the epitaxial particles were included. Conversely, the hexagonal structure with a higher formation ratio without additives became difficult to form in the presence of additive particles. The effect of additive particles on the formation rates of hexagonal structures depended on whether the additive particles could intrude into the space between the substrate and epitaxial layer. Both hexagonal structures became more difficult to form as the additive particle size increased. At a specific ratio of the additive particle size to the substrate particle size, the formation ratio of the structure present in a lower content without additive increased because of the generation of a precursor structure.},

All samples displayed a Johari–Goldstein relaxation, and three of them displayed a structural relaxation; both processes originated from coupled Alg–H 2 O motions in the hydrated amorphous fraction. Charge conduction in all samples was dominated by Grotthuss proton shuttling (either in bulk water/ice or in hydration layers). H 2 O-rich samples displayed the H-bond network relaxation of ice, with an activation energy between 25 and 31 kJ mol −1 , close to the energy of formation of one H-bond per H 2 O molecule. This relaxation was faster in the quenched hydrogel than in the slowly crystallized hydrogel and the frozen solution, likely due to a smaller average size of ice domains in the former; the latter samples display two separate ice relaxations, likely due to ionic impurities in the ice domains in contact with the Alg chains. The Na-Alg powder equilibrated in a water-vapor saturated atmosphere also displayed the local relaxation of bulk-like amorphous water with an activation energy of 51 kJ mol −1 , equivalent to two H-bonds per H 2 O molecule. Most samples displayed spectral changes between 260 and 270 K due to ice melting. In the fast-quenched hydrogel, a premelting transition was observed at 220 K.},

A comparison between experimental results and electromagnetic (EM) calculations revealed that a large EM enhancement factor ( F R ) at the HS appears in the visible to NIR regions owing to EM coupling between localized plasmons of the NP and surface plasmons of the NW. This ultrabroad resonance of the coupled plasmons enables the observation of two-photon-excited emissions with CW laser excitation. A comparison of the dependence of the NP diameter, NW diameter, and gap distance on two-photon-excited emissions further demonstrated that the large HS-by-HS variations in the emission intensities were mainly induced by the sensitivity of F R to the gap distance at the HSs. We also experimentally and theoretically investigated the propagation of two-photon-excited emission light to a neighboring NP on the NW via surface plasmons.},

This study investigates the impact of high dose 60 Co γ-ray irradiation on defect characteristics in CsPbBr 3 perovskite crystals and highlights their radiation stability. An emphasis is placed on the origins of defects and mechanisms of charge transport. Radiative recombination due to free and trapped/bound excitons, as well as band tailing associated with point defects and structural disorder, were determined based on (PL) analysis. Thermally stimulated current (TSC) spectroscopy revealed a range of trap levels between 0.14 and 0.64 eV (in the temperature range of 77–300 K) in both the reference and irradiated samples. In addition, the TSC analysis revealed good retention of the low concentrations of cesium and bromine vacancies, as well as lead interstitials, with total concentrations of ∼9.09 × 10 12 per cm 3 for the reference sample and a slightly lower value of ∼7.27 × 10 12 per cm 3 for the 60 Co γ-irradiated sample. Despite the presence of these defects, no significant changes were observed in energy resolution or the hole mobility-lifetime product. The apparent stability of trap concentrations following 1 Mrad 60 Co γ-irradiation is indicative of the material’s radiation hardness. The findings demonstrate that the intrinsically low defect concentrations in CsPbBr 3 are not severely affected by high dose 60 Co γ-ray irradiation, positioning it as a compelling candidate for advanced radiation detectors and other optoelectronic applications.},

In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan (propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane center owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in the membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void population near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of Prodan.},

We examine three distinct droplet geometries: a spherical cap, an oblate spheroidal cap, and a pancake shape, and we observe that the approximated droplet shape depends on the droplet size and the interfacial tensions. For small droplets on a smooth solid substrate, the droplet shape is assumed to be a spherical cap. However, as the droplet size increases, the equilibrium shape of the droplet becomes deformed due to the effect of gravity. The actual equilibrium contact angles, here referred to as microscopic contact angles, are determined by Young’s law and are independent of droplet size or axisymmetric shape. Macroscopic contact angles are obtained by approximating the droplet shape with a geometric model and minimizing the free energy without assuming the validity of Young’s law. We extend this concept to larger droplets and systematically compare these macroscopic angles with the microscopic ones. Our results demonstrate a correlation between the macroscopic contact angle and droplet size, with significant deviations from Young’s law, increasing with droplet size. These findings are consistent with the Allen–Cahn model. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of the chosen measurement method on the accuracy of the contact angle, which varies with droplet size. In addition, the contact angle hysteresis—caused by varying liquid–solid and solid–gas interfacial tensions, which describes an intermolecular rearrangement of the liquid and gas species in an adsorption layer on the microscopic scale—is also influenced by the droplet size.},

In addition, the specific structural characteristics of water and boric acid dissociation products were determined on Zr or Zr–Nb substrate. The hydrogen embrittlement at severe accident temperature was elucidated by the intense corrosion reactions and a large number of H radicals penetrating into the Zr substrate. Due to the further dissociation of boric acid complexes and release of more corrosive radicals, Zr corrosion was exacerbated at extremely high temperature, which was quite different from the Zr corrosion suppression of boric acid at low operating temperature.

  abstract     = {We have employed molecular dynamics simulations and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectral calculations to investigate how a hexadecanol (HDC) monolayer at the surface of an aqueous NaI solution influences the effects of iodide ions. When the aqueous NaI surface is exposed to air, the presence of iodide ions causes a significant change in the orientation of O–H groups at the interface compared to the neat water/vapor interface. Three distinct regions have been observed in the VSFG spectrum of the water–NaI/vapor interfacial system: O–H groups hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules (water-HB), O–H groups hydrogen-bonded to negative ions (ion-HB), and dangling O–H groups without any hydrogen bonds. Overall, O–H groups in each region are oriented upward. When the aqueous NaI surface is covered with HDC monolayers, two distinct regions, ion-HB and water-HB, are found in the VSFG spectrum. In the water-HB region, the observed VSFG spectrum is due to the cancellation of the intensity of up-oriented O–H groups hydrogen-bonded to HDC and down-oriented O–H groups hydrogen-bonded to water. No dangling O–H peak is observed since HDC monolayers completely cover the aqueous surface. The ion-HB peak has the opposite orientation when HDC monolayers are present on the surface in the water–NaI/HDC interfacial system compared to the water–NaI/vapor interfacial system. In stark contrast to the water–vapor interface, the spectral contribution from O–H groups hydrogen-bonded to I − is drastically reduced when alcohol is present at the surface, directly reflecting the diminished interfacial ion propensity.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the outstanding performance of memristors in brain-like parallel computing and data processing, especially in the efficient recognition of handwritten digits and complex patterns, they are regarded as key components for next-generation artificial intelligence systems. This study developed a memristor based on the P–N heterostructure CdS/Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CdS/CZTSSe). The results indicate that the Ag/CdS/CZTSSe/Mo memristor exhibits stable non-volatile bipolar resistive switching. By investigating the conductivity mechanism of the device, a resistive switching model is established that regulates the conductive filaments of Cu ions in the heterojunction. This device not only demonstrates a concentrated Set/Reset voltage distribution, good durability (>200 cycles), and time retention characteristics (>10 4 s) but also features continuously adjustable conductance under electrical pulse square wave stimulation. Such a behavior enables the memristor to simulate important biological synaptic functions, including excitatory postsynaptic current, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, and short-term/long-term plasticity and paired-pulse facilitation. Furthermore, neuromorphic simulations validated that the artificial neural network model using this memristor achieved a 94.1% recognition rate for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digits. These results significantly advance the development of heterojunction memristors in artificial synapses and lay a foundation for future neuromorphic applications.},

  abstract     = {Understanding ionic migration mechanisms in solid-state materials is of paramount importance for advancing rechargeable batteries technologies. Combining first-principle calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we reveal a novel mechanism of ionic migration in 3D tunnel-type H 2 V 2 O 5 , a newly developed cathode material formed by proton pre-intercalated α -V 2 O 5 , where hydrogen bonds dynamic play a critical regulatory role. We demonstrate the rotation behavior of –OH groups and the synergistic coupling between the –OH rotation and divalent ion migration in H 2 V 2 O 5 . The paddle-wheel mechanism, as we referred to here, enables ultralow migration barriers ( E b ) of 0.56 eV for Zn 2+ and 0.44 eV for Mg 2+ . In a sharp contrast, this mechanism was not observed for monovalent cations (such as Li + ) using the climbing image nudged elastic band (NEB) method, which yields E b of 0.57 eV. However, by MD simulations, we obtained the activation energy E a of 0.23 eV for Li + migration. The discrepancy was found to lie in the paddle-wheel mechanism, which needs to be activated at elevated temperature (≥150 K) for Li + migration and, therefore, cannot be captured in NEB calculation at 0 K. Our results thus highlight the importance of understanding the paddle-wheel mechanism, meanwhile, the potential of proton pre-intercalated α -V 2 O 5 for cathode materials of both monovalent and divalent ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {Oceans are essentially an electrolyte solution. The experimental study of physical and chemical processes occurring in oceans remains challenging, so molecular dynamics simulations may be of great help. We have recently demonstrated that simulations using a state-of-the-art force field can accurately describe the thermophysical properties of seawater by employing a detailed chemical model of the solution. Here, we extend our previous work by investigating additional properties that require simulations on larger samples and time length scales. First, the extended time and size scales of our simulations allow for a relatively precise determination of the electrical conductivity, a fundamental property of seawater for which accurate experimental data are available, serving as a further test of the employed force field. Second, the incorporation of CO 2 into the sample enables us to evaluate its diffusion coefficient D C O 2 ⁠ . No experimental measurements or computational simulations have yet provided estimates of carbon dioxide diffusivity at salinity levels and compositions representative of actual oceanic environments. To validate our results, we have also determined D C O 2 in pure water. Our simulation results show excellent agreement with experimental data in pure water, which reinforces our confidence in the predicted CO 2 diffusivity in seawater. This study provides a rigorous test of the reliability of the Madrid-2019 force field (together with TraPPE for CO 2 ) in saline environments. From this perspective, relevant challenges can be addressed, such as the sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the deeper ocean, CO 2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers, and seawater freezing (for desalination purposes).},

  abstract     = {Using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate supercooled liquids formed at cooling rates below and above the critical cooling rate (CCR). By analyzing the distribution of short-time averaged potential energies (DPE) and crystallization behaviors, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids: the glass-forming regime (GFR) and the crystal-forming regime (CFR). For systems cooled below CCR (CFR), the DPE exhibits a sharp peak, indicative of reduced configurational entropy. In contrast, liquids cooled above CCR (GFR) display a broad DPE distribution, reflecting higher configurational entropy. These findings establish a robust classification framework for supercooled liquids. Further analysis reveals a crossover temperature ( T x ) in both regimes, consistent with the freezing temperature ( T f ). Near T x , crystallization barrier–temperature relationships exhibit abrupt changes. Below T x , CFR crystallizes marginally faster than GFR, whereas above T x , the influence of cooling rates on crystallization rates diminishes. These results further categorize GFR and CFR into high- and low-temperature sub-regimes, highlighting the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in supercooled liquids.},

This process is accompanied by dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by persistent dynamic spatial correlations. This study investigates how dynamic heterogeneity influences the applicability of the Navier–Stokes equations to the flow of supercooled liquids. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we subjected a two-dimensional supercooled liquid to a localized dipolar force field and compared the resulting steady velocity field with the prediction from the Navier–Stokes equations. Our approach captures a significant breakdown of the Navier–Stokes equations in real space; specifically, supercooled liquids flow more rapidly near the external force than the prediction from the Navier–Stokes equations. Furthermore, this deviation is enhanced by supercooling and is accompanied by the growth of dynamic heterogeneity.},

Using a Soret cell with porous media, we measured Soret coefficients S T over a range of mass fractions relevant for practical applications. The Soret coefficient revealed consistently negative values, indicating thermophilic behavior in which LiBr migrates toward warmer regions under a temperature gradient. Interestingly, while the absolute value of thermodiffusion coefficient | D T | decreases with concentration, the Soret S T = | D T / D | increases in magnitude due to the stronger suppression of molecular diffusion.

The large-amplitude, highly coupled nature of these vibrations presents significant challenges with respect to their assignment. We introduce a new methodology, based on the use of symmetry coordinates for all nine of the torsional and librational degrees of freedom that constitute the intermolecular bending modes in the trimer, which addresses those challenges. The approach ultimately yields expressions for the bend eigenstates as expansions over small numbers of physically meaningful terms, from which the contributions of the torsional and librational excitations to a bending state can be identified and quantified. Results for approximately one hundred bending states with excitation energies below ∼ 560 cm −1 are presented.},

These simulations are performed by calculating trajectories on accurate potential energy surfaces of the low-lying excited states of the neutral dichloromethane molecule. The subsequent time-resolved Coulomb explosions are simulated on the triply charged ionic state, assuming Coulomb interactions between ionic fragments. The dominant reaction channel of photoexcited dichloromethane is CH 2 Cl + Cl two-body dissociation with simultaneous excitation of the CH 2 Cl rotation, which is clearly identified from the Coulomb explosion observables. Both the neutral state trajectories and the simulated Coulomb explosion observables indicate that intra-molecular photoisomerization of dichloromethane is unlikely to occur. Estimating the kinetic energy release using ab initio ionic potential reveals a discrepancy of ∼5–8 eV compared to our simulated values using Coulomb potential. The molecular structural changes during photodissociation are clearly mapped to the ionic-fragment coincidence signals, demonstrating the Coulomb explosion imaging technique as a powerful tool to probe the time-resolved reaction dynamics.},

  abstract     = {A combined experimental and computational approach aimed at systematically exploring unimolecular reaction channels of ionized gas-phase systems—including rearrangements, intramolecular bonds formation, and fragmentation—has been applied to 5- and 6-benzyluracil (5BU and 6BU) molecules, which are used as molecular models of photo-induced interactions between nucleobases and aromatic aminoacids. Photoelectron–photoion coincidence experiments offer a unique view of energy-selected fragmentation channels, while ab initio molecular dynamics of the ionic system, performed with semi-empirical potentials and for long simulation times, can extensively explore possible unimolecular reactive pathways, revealing the detailed molecular identity of the products. Results show that, at lower binding energies, ionized 5- and 6-benzyluracil molecules do not fragment but may nevertheless rearrange to give, mainly in 6BU, cross-linked products. This suggests that ionization can efficiently promote covalent cross-links between interacting proteins and nucleic acids, which can be exploited to isolate and characterize such transient complexes occurring in cellular environments. At higher binding energies, however, fragmentation channels are predominant, mainly involving the decomposition and photo-damage of the uracil moiety. Several fragmentation products have been characterized, and the differences in fragment abundances and fragmentation mechanisms between the two benzyluracil isomers have been outlined.},

  abstract     = {Changes in pH within a system containing dissociable sites affect the protonation and deprotonation of these groups, thereby influencing their physical properties. In response, the system modifies their surface charge, affecting electrostatic interactions, aggregation, stability, and structural behavior. Although the pH can be tuned in experiments, it is difficult to model this phenomenon using simulations or theoretical approaches. Here, we perform hybrid Monte Carlo-molecular dynamics simulations to model charge regulation effects in an equimolar colloidal charged system. We compare charge regulation effects with those of a system in which the charges of colloidal nanoparticles are not dissociable. The comparison between the two cases modifies the phase diagram, and it changes the volume fraction where a percolation network of nanoparticles is found. Charge regulation is found to destroy network formation, as the charge in the nanoparticles is modified because of the cooperativity dependency of the degree of charge dissociation sites among the nanoparticles favoring cluster formation. Our work suggests that the ionic and/or electronic conductivity in functionalized nanoparticles can be modified by changing pH values. It also guides the experimental design of oppositely charged nanoparticles as inks for 3D printing processes.},

  abstract     = {The ro-vibrationally excited state D 2 (X 1 ∑ g + , v = 1, J = 15) was prepared using stimulated Raman pumping, and its collisional rotational relaxation behavior with D 2 and N 2 molecules was experimentally investigated at 297 K. The effective lifetime of D 2 (1,15) was determined by measuring time-resolved CARS signals in both pure D 2 and D 2 –N 2 systems. Combining the Stern–Volmer equation, the self-relaxation rate coefficient for D 2 –D 2 collisions in the pure D 2 system was calculated to be (2.3 ± 0.1) × 10 −14 cm 3 s −1 . The rotational relaxation rate coefficients for D 2 (1,15) molecules colliding with D 2 and N 2 molecules in the D 2 –N 2 system were (0.5 ± 0.1) × 10 −14 and (6.0 ± 0.3) × 10 −14 cm 3 s −1 , respectively. The results show that near-resonant rotational–vibrational (R–V) collisions between D 2 and N 2 accelerate the rotational relaxation of D 2 (1,15), which is the dominant pathway for rotational energy transfer. Time-resolved CARS spectra of D 2 ( v = 1, J = 15, 13, 11) were recorded at 297 K under varying N 2 molar ratios. Kinetic analysis revealed that R–V collisions in D 2 –D 2 interactions primarily induce multi-quantum relaxation ( J = 15 → 11). At lower N 2 molar ratios, a prominent fast multi-quantum relaxation process was observed. As the N 2 molar ratio increased, single-quantum relaxation via D 2 –N 2 collisions became more dominant. The effect of temperature on the rotational relaxation of D 2 (1,15) was studied over the 297–400 K range. At an N 2 molar ratio of 0.3, rising temperatures increased D 2 –D 2 collision frequency, enhancing near-resonant multi-quantum relaxation. Meanwhile, secondary D 2 –N 2 collisions prolonged the time required for single-quantum relaxation to reach its peak population. At an N 2 molar ratio of 0.7, elevated temperatures significantly enhanced D 2 –N 2 energy exchange, leading to a marked increase in D 2 ( J = 13) population, with single-quantum relaxation becoming the dominant energy transfer pathway for D 2 (1,15) molecules.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the solvation preferences of N-confused tetraphenylporphyrin (NCTPP) within dichloromethane mixed solvent systems have been investigated. Findings indicate that the significance of interactions between solvent molecules is comparable to that between the solute and solvent molecules. However, there are limited reports on the photoinduced tautomerism mechanism of NCTPP. In this paper, the effects of N-confusion and substituents on the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) mechanism and photophysical properties of NCTPP derivatives are studied by density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory. Initially, the molecular geometric structure is fully optimized. Electronic structure analysis indicates that the molecule has the local excitation characteristic of ππ * transition. Subsequently, the observed large Stokes shift in emission spectra is attributed to electron perturbations in the π-conjugated ring, induced by N-confusion. Aromaticity analysis confirms that this shift is due to the enhanced localization of electron rearrangement. Finally, potential energy curves are constructed, and the ESIPT reaction rate is computed, along with excited-state non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, demonstrating the dynamic equilibrium of ESIPT. Theoretical studies reveal that N-confusion outside the ring, coupled with benzene substitution, induces electron rearrangement, resulting in enhanced electron localization and a pronounced Stokes shift. This alteration in photophysical properties opens new avenues for applications in photochemistry and materials science.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) is transforming nuclear magnetic resonance and MRI by significantly enhancing sensitivity through the transfer of polarization from electron spins to nuclear spins via microwave irradiation. However, the use of monochromatic continuous-wave irradiation limits the efficiency of DNP for systems with heterogeneous, broad electron paramagnetic resonance lines. Broadband techniques such as chirp irradiation offer a potential solution, particularly for Solid Effect (SE) DNP in such cases. Despite its widespread use, the role of quantum coherence generated during chirp irradiation remains unclear, even though it is a key factor in determining the maximum achievable DNP efficiency. In this work, we use density matrix formalism to provide a comprehensive understanding of the quantum coherence generated during non-adiabatic passages through electron–nucleus double-quantum (DQ) and zero-quantum (ZQ) SE transitions and their impact on Integrated Solid Effect (ISE) DNP under chirp irradiation. Our analysis employs fictitious product-operator bases to trace the evolution of electron–nucleus coherence leading to integrated or differentiated SE. We also explore the role of decoherence in maximizing chirped DNP in microwave power or nutation frequency limited scenarios. These findings provide an understanding of the role of coherence generated during pulsed DNP and magic-angle spinning DNP at different temperature ranges. Our results reveal that quantum coherences generated during non-adiabatic passages critically determine whether the chirped DNP process yields ISE or differential solid effect. By analyzing the evolution of the density matrix in DQ and ZQ subspaces, we show how coherence generation and its decay through decoherence play a decisive role in shaping the net DNP enhancement.},

In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances ( X 1 and X 2 ) with unique lattice coupling. These multiple resonances enable the formation of both self- and cross-coupled biexcitons (mixed biexcitons). Using three spectroscopic techniques—photoluminescence and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES)—we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering the mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton–polarons within layered perovskites.},

High transverse coherence and short-pulsed electrons were generated from a tungsten tip with a diameter of 1 μ m. The transverse coherence length and duration of the electron pulses accelerated to 45 keV were experimentally and numerically characterized under high electron density conditions. The electron diffraction patterns from multi-walled carbon nanotubes with outer diameters of 3–10 nm demonstrated the transverse coherence length of the electron pulses at ∼10 nm. The optical pump (wavelength: 515 nm) and electron diffraction probe measurements on a 2H–MoTe 2 thin film demonstrate a decrease in the intensity of electron diffraction spots due to thermal effects. According to the pump–probe measurements, the electron pulse duration is determined to be in the range of 6–13 ps, evolving as the power 1/3 of the number of electrons in a pulse (250–2300 electrons/pulse at the sample position). This dependence, which differs from pancake-shaped electron pulses emitted from conventional flat metal photocathodes, arises from the hemispherical propagation of electrons emitted from the tungsten tip. The experimental characterization of the electron pulses agreed with the results of the particle-tracking calculations. The developed setup with a high bunch charge and high transverse coherence ultrashort pulsed electron source is suitable for understanding photoinduced structural dynamics in large-periodicity materials in chemistry and biology. The insights obtained in this study should also contribute to the development of point electron sources in ultrafast time-resolved diffractometers as well as ultrafast transmission or scanning electron microscopes.},

In this work, we focus on molecules under a thermal bias imposed by coupling to two electrodes at different temperatures. We demonstrate that within the realm of weak electrode–molecule coupling (Pauli master equations), even far from equilibrium, the molecule can be assigned (at least approximately) an effective temperature at steady state. This is manifested in clustering of the molecular Hamiltonian eigenstates into groups with Boltzmann distributions of occupation probabilities. We demonstrate the emergence of such Boltzmann subspaces under thermal bias and identify the corresponding effective temperature in a variety of molecular junction models, including account for electron–electron interaction, molecular disorder, asymmetric coupling to the electrodes, and the orbital energy density. The results are promising from a practical perspective as we draw guidelines for controlling the temperature of single-molecule electronic devices. The existence of Boltzmann subspaces simplifies our understanding of transport in open quantum systems under thermal bias and holds promise for reducing the numerical effort in simulations of thermally driven molecular junctions.},

  abstract     = {The random phase approximation (RPA), a method for treating electron correlation, has been shown to be superior to standard density functional theory (DFT) approximations in numerous cases. However, the RPA’s computational cost is substantially higher than that of DFT, particularly restricting its application to extended surfaces. The recently introduced embedded RPA (emb-RPA) approach [Wei et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 159 (19), 194108 (2023)] reduces this computational cost by approximately two orders of magnitude. While previous applications of emb-RPA focused on non-spin-polarized systems, here we extend the approach to ferromagnetic ones. Unlike other embedded correlated wavefunction methods, such as embedded complete active space self-consistent field theory, emb-RPA is advantageous for spin-polarized systems because the RPA is compatible with unrestricted DFT solutions, which are eigenfunctions of the spin angular momentum operator S z but not the total spin-squared operator S 2 . By applying emb-RPA with specific magnetization constraints, we achieved a speedup of two to three orders of magnitude (one order when accounting for the one-time embedding potential optimization cost) with only small errors (∼50 meV) compared to full periodic RPA. Moreover, emb-RPA significantly reduces the over-binding errors of DFT approximations. We anticipate that the acceleration enabled by the spin-polarized emb-RPA approach will broaden the applicability of RPA to magnetic materials.},

  abstract     = {The N -representability problem of reduced density matrices represents a fundamental challenge in electronic structure theory. In this work, we focus on the N -representability of transition reduced density matrices and propose a practical approach to embed a p -body transition reduced density matrix (RDM) of an N -particle system into a ( p + 1)-body RDM of an ( N + 1)-particle system. This embedding allows us to apply a unitary evolution algorithm based on a recently developed adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum algorithm to determine the N -representability of reduced density matrices. The algorithm works by effectively applying a sequence of unitary transformations to a given ( N + 1)-particle initial state in such a way that the distance of a projection of its corresponding ( p + 1)-body RDM (embedded p -body transition RDM) to a target is minimized. Our methodology enables the purification of transition reduced density matrices and the reconstruction of approximate wave functions involved in the studied transitions, providing an effective strategy to correct and refine transition density matrices. We validate our approach with numerical simulations on N -particle systems, including a three-electron model system and the H 3 molecule, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, differences of the vibrational energies are often neglected compared to the electronic ones. This leads to the Placzek approximation and the coupled-perturbed methodology, where the transition polarizabilities needed to simulate Raman spectra are calculated at an incident frequency. Within this approximation, the frequency change of the outgoing radiation is neglected, which has a little effect on the simulation of Raman and Raman optical activity spectra in the far from resonance limit. For resonance and pre-resonance, when the incident frequency is close to the energy of an electronic transition, significant error may arise. We analyze this problem and suggest a partial solution through a modification of the polarizability expressions to include a dependence on the vibrational frequencies. For model cobalt complexes, this improved formulation leads to a significant improvement of the spectral patterns.},

We demonstrate that the direct analysis of the imaginary-time density–density correlation function (ITCF) allows for a rigorous assessment of the density and temperature dependence of the previously reported roton-type feature [Dornheim et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 , 255001 (2018)] at intermediate wavenumbers. We clearly resolve the emergence of a second roton at the second harmonic of the original feature for r s ≳ 100, which we identify as an incipient phonon dispersion. Finally, we use our highly accurate PIMC results for the ITCF as the basis for an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor, which additionally substantiates the existence of the second roton in the strongly coupled electron liquid. Our investigation further elucidates the complex interplay between quantum delocalization and Coulomb coupling in the UEG. All PIMC results are freely available online and provide valuable benchmarks for other theoretical methodologies and approximations.},

  abstract     = {Dimerization underpins all macromolecular assembly processes, both on and off the membrane. While the strength of dimerization, K D , is commonly quantified in solution (3D), many proteins, such as the soluble BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) proteins, also reversibly dimerize while bound to a membrane surface (2D). The ratio of dissociation constants, h = K D 2 D K D 3 D ⁠ , defines a lengthscale that is essential for determining whether dimerization is more favorable in solution or on the membrane surface, particularly for these proteins that reversibly transition between 3D and 2D. While purely entropic rigid-body estimates of h ( ⁠ h RIGID apply well to transmembrane adhesion proteins, we show here using MD simulations that even moderate flexibility in BAR domains dramatically alters the free energy landscape, driving enhanced stability of the native dimer in 2D. By simulating BAR homodimerization in three environments, (1) solution (3D), (2) bound to a lipid bilayer (2D), and (3) fully solvated but restrained to a pseudo membrane (2D), we show that both 2D environments induce backbone configurations that produce more enthalpically favorable dimer states. Comparing with theory, we show that this surface-induced or geometric allostery violates the rigid-body estimates to drive h ≪ h RIGID . Remarkably, contact with an explicit lipid bilayer is not necessary to drive these changes, as the solvated pseudo membrane induces this same result. This outcome depends on the stability of the protein interaction, as a parameterization with exceptionally stable binding in 3D does not improve in 2D. Our approach provides simple metrics to move beyond rigid-body estimates of 2D affinities and fully assess whether allosteric effects stabilize dimerization on membranes.},

The main computational difficulties stem from the inclusion of the magnetic field in the Hamiltonian, in particular, from the presence of the angular momentum operator, which leads to a complication of the wave function and introduces a gauge-origin dependence. Addressing these challenges requires advanced modifications to existing routines, which we achieve by implementing gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs) by using GQCP and the capabilities offered by PySCF . This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of the CC theory, opening pathways for more comprehensive investigations in molecular quantum chemistry at strong magnetic fields.},

In this work, we implement a classical electrodynamics–molecular dynamics method to investigate collision-induced emission and radiative association in planar microcavities under variable light–matter coupling strength. We focus on the argon–xenon (Ar–Xe) gas mixture as a representative system, simulating collisions coupled to the confined multimode electromagnetic field. We find that while the effects of a microcavity on collision-induced emission spectra are subtle, even at extremely large coupling strengths, radiative association can be significantly enhanced in a microcavity. Our results also indicate that microcavities may be designed to induce changes in the statistical distribution of Ar–Xe complex lifetimes. These findings provide new insights into the control of intermolecular interactions and radiative kinetics with microcavities.},

Chem. Phys. 158 , 211104 (2023)], was reformulated and extended according to the group function model. A key feature of the reformulation lies in the construction of strongly orthogonal geminals or group functions using general spinorbitals, which allows us to describe strong correlation through breaking both S ̂ 2 and S ̂ z symmetries while maintaining the simplicity of the trial wave functions and variational equations. Numerical analysis of correlated hydrogen clusters suggested that a noncollinear spin state cannot be the ground state in the APSG model. In some cases, when group functions for an odd number of electrons are used, on the other hand, symmetry breaking was observed for a spin-unrestricted, collinear state, and an obtained ground state was noncollinear. The present framework clearly detects instabilities of geminals and group functions and also provides effective reference states for the strongly correlated regime.},

  abstract     = {In pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), enhancement of bulk nuclear polarization requires the repeated application of a microwave pulse sequence. So far, analysis of a one-time transfer of electron spin polarization to a dipolar-coupled nuclear spin has guided the design of DNP pulse sequences. This has obvious shortcomings, such as the inability to predict the optimal repetition time. In an actual pulsed DNP experiment, a balance is reached between the polarization arriving from the unpaired electrons and nuclear relaxation. In this article, we explore three algorithms to compute this stroboscopic steady state: (1) explicit time evolution by propagator squaring, (2) generation of an effective propagator using the matrix logarithm, and (3) direct calculation of the steady state with the Newton–Raphson method. Algorithm (2) is numerically unstable in dissipative DNP settings. Algorithms (1) and (3) are both stable; algorithm (3) is the most efficient. We compare the steady-state simulations to existing experimental results at 0.34 and 1.2 T and to the first experimental observation of X-inverse-X (XiX) DNP at 3.4 T. The agreement is good and improves further when electron–proton distance and electron Rabi frequency distributions are accounted for. We demonstrate that the trajectory of the spin system during one-time application of a microwave pulse sequence differs from the steady orbit. This has implications for DNP pulse sequence design.},

The objective is to deduce the free-energy of formation of the bubbles W ( s ) from the bubble size distribution p ( s ) through the hypothesis of a Boltzmann distribution: W ( s ) = − kT ln p ( s ). The bubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid superimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We first investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice and show that using several mesh values allows for the detection of bubbles in a wide range of sizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can then be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis on the region of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first show that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size is characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution diverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before calculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical expansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this observation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small bubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added to the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the free-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of the tiny bubbles.},

Results highlight the versatility of the method: for instance, a simple adjustment to the sampling strategy during optimization can help escape local-minimum solutions.

However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schrödinger equations of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wave function ansätze to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e., electron–photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. Where possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {We employ a general spectral approach based on the Steklov eigenbasis to describe imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on bounded reactive targets in three dimensions. The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive flux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the exterior Steklov problem. In particular, the eigenvalues are shown to provide the geometric lengthscales of the target that are relevant for diffusion-controlled reactions. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates, we propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this spectral problem for an arbitrary torus and a pair of balls, respectively. A simple two-term approximation for the diffusive flux is established and validated. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and beyond are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then “shooting” a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.},

  abstract     = {Elementary exchange chemical reactions in stirred solutions (e.g., S N 2 reactions) arise from the interplay between the reactive quantum-mechanical event and the roto-translational diffusion of the reaction partners in the medium. We develop a basic stochastic model capable of providing an interpretation of the macroscopic bimolecular rate constants that enter the mass-action kinetic law of bimolecular exchange reactions. The model is based on a simple, yet effective, reaction–diffusion scheme in which the mass transport is described as a diffusive process and the quantum-mechanical reactive events are treated as instantaneous jumps. The two processes are considered kinetically coupled but, as a first approximation, “orthogonal” to each other at the mechanistic level. The methodology is illustrated for the simple reaction of halide nucleophilic substitution to halomethane in aqueous solution, taking bromide and chloride as halides.},

  abstract     = {An ab initio approach formulated under an entropy-inspired repartitioning of the electronic Hamiltonian is presented. This ansatz produces orbital eigenvalues each shifted by entropic contributions expressed as subsets of scaled pair correlation energy terms present in second-order Møller–Plesset (MP) perturbation theory. Under the auspices of Collins’s conjecture, which suggests that the electron correlation energy is approximately proportional to the Jaynes entropy of the one-electron density matrix, we introduce a parameter that controls the accuracy of the resultant one-electron density at the MP2 level. By tuning the density in a somewhat automated way, we achieve one-electron densities on par with those from full configuration interaction for single-bond dissociation. This parameter can then be used to add a Collins’s-like static correlation correction to the energy functional, capturing both dynamical and nondynamical correlation effects in many-electron systems. The performance of the proposed method and its related variants approaches the accuracy of generalized valence bond theory for estimating single bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for a set of small, closed-shell molecules composed of first and second row elements. Our results hold implications for reincorporating the missing (static) correlation energy in regularized perturbation theories, which is typically discarded. Finally, we propose generic BDE parameters (accurate to within 7% on average) that could be used for strongly correlated systems in general.},

In the original method, v W was determined individually for each system via an efficient stochastic short-time TD Hartree propagation for the screened Coulomb interaction, W ( r , r ′). The new parameterization leverages photophysical similarities in exciton binding energies (or exchange interaction attenuation) among molecules with comparable static dielectric responses. We parameterize the inverse dielectric function using a low-order polynomial with error function apodization, calibrated on a few representative molecules, each with its own v W . Using only seven parameters, the parameterized v W is fully grid-independent and broadly applicable within a family of molecules. This enables TDHF@ v W that retains BSE-level accuracy, achieving a mean absolute error of ∼ 0.1 eV compared to experimental optical gaps and representing a five- to tenfold improvement over conventional TD density functional theory or TDHF while reducing the cost to that of standard TDHF.},

  abstract     = {Accounting for dispersion interactions is essential in approximate density functional theory (DFT). Often, a correction potential based on the London formula is added, which is damped at short distances to avoid divergence and double-counting of interactions treated locally by the exchange–correlation functional. Most commonly, two forms of damping, known as zero- and Becke–Johnson (BJ)-damping, are employed, and it is generally assumed that the choice has only a minor impact on performance even though the resulting correction potentials differ quite dramatically. Recent studies have cast doubt on this assumption, pointing to a significant effect of damping for liquid water, but the underlying reasons have not yet been investigated. Here, we analyze this effect in detail for the widely used Tkatchenko–Scheffler and DFT-D3 dispersion models. We demonstrate that, regardless of the dispersion model, both types of damping perform equally well for interaction energies of water clusters, but find that for the two investigated functionals, zero-damping outperforms BJ-damping in dynamic simulations of liquid water. Compared to BJ-damping, zero-damping provides, for example, an improved structural description, self-diffusion, and density of liquid water. This can be explained by the repulsive gradient at small distances resulting from damping to zero that artificially destabilizes water’s tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network. Therefore, zero-damping can compensate for deficiencies often observed for generalized gradient functionals, which is not possible for strictly attractive BJ-damping. Consequently, the improvement that can be achieved by applying a dispersion correction strongly depends on the employed damping function, suggesting that the role of damping in dispersion-corrected DFT needs to be generally reevaluated.},

  abstract     = {Organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs) are a unique class of soft, conjugated polymeric materials. The simultaneous electronic and ionic transport of OMIECs enables a new type of device, namely, organic electrochemical transistors, among other emerging technologies. However, the dynamic nature—where charge transport, doping kinetics, and morphological changes occur concurrently—poses significant challenges in the characterization and understanding of OMIECs. Recent advances in in situ optical techniques, including ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy imaging, have provided valuable insights into the charge transport mechanisms and ionic doping dynamics spanning from the microscopic to the device scale. In this perspective, based on several archetypal OMIECs, we survey how spectroscopic signatures were used to reveal key physical processes in these materials. Looking forward, we propose that ultrafast spectroscopy and microscopy techniques—such as transient absorption spectroscopy, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, pump–probe microscopy, and photothermal microscopy—hold great potential for uncovering more fundamental mechanisms of OMIEC operation, including quasiparticle dynamics, intrinsic electrical conductivity, and carrier mobility, which remain under-explored. Integrating optical characterization with electrochemical measurements will enable in operando studies on state-of-the-art devices, with results further refined by parallel advancements in theoretical modeling. Altogether, we envision in operando optical characterization with spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution across multiple scales as a powerful pathway to advance the understanding of OMIEC mechanisms and their structure–property relationships.},

  abstract     = {Hydration shell properties in proteins remain an active topic of investigation due to their complexity and importance for biological processes. We focused on hydration shell dynamics in the solid state of the globular villin headpiece subdomain (HP36). We utilized 2 H (D 2 O hydration) and 17 O (H 2 17 O hydration) solid-state NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational modeling to obtain a comprehensive picture of water motions, starting from high-amplitude modes such as diffusion and large-angle tetrahedral jumps and progressing to lower-amplitude modes such as 2-site deuteron flips and small-angle fluctuations. The measurements consisted of NMR line shapes as well as laboratory and rotating frame relaxation rates using novel approaches, conducted in the 300–170 K temperature range and at multiple values of magnetic field strengths. They permitted the precise determination of motional parameters such as fractions of different water layers, rate constants, and activation energies. Below about 250 K, both 2 H and 17 O longitudinal relaxation show clear non-exponential behaviors, with at least two components whose T 1 times differ by orders of magnitude. The water layer immediately adjacent to the protein surface remains mobile, as probed by the hydration dependence of NMR relaxation in the 20%–70% w/w water content range. Further, the observed non-exponentiality of 17 O T 1 ρ relaxation at low temperatures suggests an exchange process between the layer adjacent to the protein and loosely bound shells. Based on prior results, we discuss correlations with dynamical changes in the hydrophobic core of HP36, thus obtaining insights into the interconnection of protein and water dynamics.},

Motivated by that and considering the recent interest in designs of polymers with self-propelled monomers, here using Brownian dynamics simulations we study a model copolymer consisting of blocks of passive (P) and active (A) Brownian monomers. Identifying with the popular arrangements of blocks in copolymers, we consider a di-block copolymer P n A m and two tri-block copolymers P m A n P m and A m P n A m , where m and n denote respective block lengths. The results for symmetric compositions of P and A monomers show that when the active blocks are at the end, the polymer conformation gets unusually swelled, even larger than what is observed for a fully active polymer (FAP) of the same length. Although the dynamics of the center-of-mass of all the copolymers show enhanced diffusion and Rouse-like scaling behavior, individual passive and active blocks show anomalous transient super- and sub-diffusive dynamics, respectively. We characterize this anomaly in terms of the dependence of a generalized diffusion constant with the polymer length and activity strength. Furthermore, we explore the effect of variation in the relative compositions of P and A monomers. If the active block is at the center, we find that as the passive monomer fraction x p increases, the copolymer approaches the behavior of the corresponding passive polymer. Surprisingly, when the active blocks are at the end, for x p > 0.5, the size of the copolymer becomes even larger than the size of an FAP of the same length. We rationalize this observation using phenomenological arguments and by probing the individual conformation and dynamics of the blocks. Our results shall encourage design of novel passive–active block copolymers with tunable conformations and block dynamics.},

Structure predictions from the DE simulation for laterally and radially shifted magnetic Janus particles are compared to four published experimental and simulation case studies. The DE simulation captures the orientation and structure of magnetic Janus particles for a range of shifts and a variety of external field conditions using the point dipole approximation. Structural predictions that rely on the reorganization of large clusters of particles were less well represented by the DE predictions.

  abstract     = {Proteins are known to phase separate and form biomolecular condensates that play key roles in cellular functions. Therefore, there is now a growing interest in understanding rational design principles for protein sequences that exhibit rich stimulus-responsive phase behavior. Here, we have developed a minimal lattice-gas model and employed Monte-Carlo simulations to capture rich thermoresponsive phase behavior often observed in computational and experimental studies on disordered proteins. Proteins are modeled as particles with two internal states: a ground state representing the native configuration and a degenerate excited state representing unfolded configurations. The computed phase diagrams reveal an anomalous reentrant phase separation behavior with both upper and lower critical solution temperatures, providing insights into its underlying mechanism. We also explored non-equilibrium effects, such as non-Boltzmann population distributions of native and unfolded states, and enhanced translational diffusion due to non-thermal noise on the phase separation. We find that these factors offer an additional dimension for modulating condensate morphologies. We further extended our model to study phase separation in binary protein mixtures and successfully reproduced complex phase-separated states, including wetted, partially wetted, segregative, and associative phases—observed in computational studies of these systems. This model can be easily extended to mimic proteins with multiple internal (say, partially folded) states, allowing exploration of conformation heterogeneity effects on condensate morphologies. Our findings offer important insights into designing solvent-mediated effective interactions between proteins for controlled phase separation, relevant for engineering functional condensates.},

We examine the phase behavior of the binary mixture while the system is cooled from a high temperature to low temperatures. When the range of attractive interactions approaches the sticky sphere limit, the system undergoes a phase separation at lower temperatures. When quenched rapidly, the system mixes again upon further reduction in the temperature and enters into glassy state. This reentrant mixing is not observed when the system is quenched slowly. In contrast, such a phase separation is not observed in systems with a larger interaction range. In the fast quenching, one of the components of the mixture chooses to be in crystalline configuration while the other being in disordered state when demixing happens.

  abstract     = {We present a combined experimental and numerical investigation into the magnetophoresis behavior of weakly magnetic nanoparticle suspensions in the vicinity of a wire under a non-uniform magnetic field and negligible inertia. The experiments were conducted within a closed rectangular cuvette, with a wire positioned between the poles of an electromagnet. Two types of nanoparticles—paramagnetic manganese oxide and diamagnetic bismuth oxide—were studied across a broad range of concentrations (10–100 mg/l), magnetic field strengths (0.25–1 T), and wire diameters (0.8–3.17 mm). Our experimental findings reveal that, upon the application of a magnetic field, paramagnetic nanoparticles experience a strong, attractive force toward the wire’s periphery. This force generates vortices and secondary flows around the wire, depleting particles from the bulk of the cuvette and concentrating them near the wire surface. The magnetophoresis dynamics of paramagnetic nanoparticles are shown to scale with their initial concentration, wire diameter, and the strength of the external magnetic field. In contrast, diamagnetic nanoparticles exhibit markedly different behavior, with their magnetophoresis dynamics showing minimal dependence on initial concentration and magnetic field strength while being inversely proportional to the wire diameter. Multiphysics numerical simulations complement the experimental observations, revealing the formation of field-induced particle clusters in weakly paramagnetic nanoparticles, which enhance magnetophoresis. In addition, the critical magnetic field threshold for the onset of cluster formation is found to be lower than those predicted by theoretical models for clustering in uniform magnetic fields. Under specific conditions, including high magnetic field strengths and elevated nanoparticle concentrations, diamagnetic nanoparticles appear to undergo field-induced clustering, suggesting a previously unreported aspect of their magnetophoretic behavior.},

  abstract     = {Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel optical, transport, chemical, and mechanical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU ground-state point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, in addition to the standard “stealthy” pair potential. To explore the maximal ranges of the packing fraction ϕ , we investigate the distributions of minimum pair distances as well as nearest-neighbor distances of ensembles of SHU point patterns without and with soft-core repulsions in the first three space dimensions as a function of the stealthiness parameter χ and number of particles N within a hypercubic simulation box under periodic boundary conditions. Within the disordered regime ( χ < 0.5), we find that the maximal values of ϕ , denoted by ϕ max ( χ , d ), decrease to zero on average as N increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large ϕ max ( χ , d ) independent of N , reaching up to ϕ max ( χ , d ) = 1.0, 0.86, 0.63 in the zero- χ limit and decreasing to ϕ max ( χ , d ) = 1.0, 0.67, 0.47 at χ = 0.45 for d = 1, 2, 3, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for ϕ max ( χ , d ) as functions of χ and N for a given value of d in both cases with and without soft-core repulsions. In two and three dimensions, our soft-core SHU ground-state packings for small χ become configurationally very close to the corresponding jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by their pair statistics. As χ increases beyond 0.20, the particles in this family of disordered packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains as χ tends to 1/2. The resulting structure factors S k and pair correlation functions g 2 r reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We show that the degree of large-scale order of the soft-core SHU ground states increases as χ increases from 0 to 0.45 for d = 2, 3. We also compute the spectral density χ ̃ V k ⁠ , which can be used to estimate various physical properties, including electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for the discovery of novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.},

Using this model, we obtain an irreducible representation of the fluid flow produced by an active particle in the periodic geometry of Stokes flow for an arbitrary surface slip. The solution of the active flow is obtained in terms of the lattice sum of the Oseen tensor and its derivatives. The lattice sum is accelerated using the Ewald summation technique. We apply the method to compute explicit expressions for the rigid body motion of hydrodynamically interacting active particles.

Herein, we demonstrate that surface oxygen vacancy engineering through amorphous-LAO capping layer enables multifunctional control of interfacial conductivity, Kondo physics, and Rashba spin–orbit coupling at LAO/STO (001). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements reveal that the formation of oxygen vacancies at the LAO surface triggers charge transfer and insulator-to-metal transition of LAO/STO, with its carrier density increasing from 0.55 × 10 13 to 1.08 × 10 13 cm −2 as the amorphous-LAO thickness grows. The low-temperature resistance upturn exhibits Kondo effect characteristics, with Kondo temperature rising from 10.88 to 35.11 K concomitantly, accompanied by a two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in Kondo resistance, reflecting the transition of Kondo scattering center from Cr to Ti. Magnetotransport further reveals the enhancement of Rashba spin–orbital coupling with Rashba spin splitting energy E so increasing from 2.54 to 4.07 meV and signature of Elliott–Yafet spin relaxation mechanism (spin–orbital relaxation time τ so ∝ elastic scattering time τ el ), suggesting Cr ions as possible spin–orbit scattering impurities.},

  abstract     = {Curvature induces pressure differences across liquid–vapor interfaces and introduces corrections to surface tension that are described by classical thermodynamics in the macroscopic limit via the Tolman length. At the nanoscale, however, deviations from this behavior are difficult to interpret due to the nonlocal character of the stress tensor and the ambiguity in defining bulk phases. We address this by applying Voronoi tessellation to nanodroplets of argon and water to examine how curvature alters the local molecular structure. Unlike conventional density profiles—smeared out by capillary fluctuations—the Voronoi analysis yields a quasi-local geometric observable that can resolve curvature-induced changes in packing even near the molecular liquid surface. We find that inhomogeneity effects extend deep into the droplet interior. Using a simple classic thermodynamic framework to remap the droplet molecular volumes onto those of the flat interface, we find a collapse onto a single trend, suggesting that there are no specific curvature-induced changes beyond those implied by macroscopic thermodynamics. Remarkably, this collapse holds even for droplets smaller than those where classical approaches fail to extract a consistent Tolman length using local pressure tensor definitions.},

Using molecular dynamics, we investigate the adsorption of Rhodamine 6G, Rhodamine B and anthracene on α-cristobalite, α-quartz, gold, and graphene under varying pH conditions. Our results show that van der Waals forces, rather than electrostatic interactions, are responsible for adsorption. Furthermore, we have found that adsorption stability increases with nanoparticle size, while higher pH levels promote surface deprotonation and hydrogen bonding, thereby suppressing adsorption. Hydrophobic adsorbents such as gold and graphene exhibit the strongest adsorption due to their nonpolar nature. These insights provide a deeper understanding of xanthene dye adsorption and, more broadly, the adsorption of hydrophobic molecules, which is critical for optimizing nanoparticle-based applications.},

For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow us to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.},

The C-rate capability and long-term cycling behavior were investigated. The films exhibited up to 30% of the expected practical capacity even at low C-rates. However, 100% capacity was achieved at very low cycling rates below 0.01C. The capacity showed a reversible behavior with changing current density, indicating no film degradation. The C-rate capability experiment showed a square root dependence of capacities on current density, which corresponds to a diffusion-controlled process. The estimated diffusivities from the cycling experiments are independent of the current density. The Li chemical and tracer diffusivities were measured using standard electrochemical and non-electrochemical diffusion measurement techniques. Chemical diffusivities, thermodynamic factor, and hence Li tracer diffusivities were determined from potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments as a function of electrode potential and state of charge (SOC). The diffusivities were found to be approximately independent of potential, SOC, and cycle number. The Li tracer diffusivities were validated by 6 Li tracer diffusion experiments with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The diffusivities obtained by PITT and SIMS were found to be more reliable for Li uptake and release than those obtained by EIS. Based on the diffusion results, a C-rate limit for full film delithiation below 0.01C was calculated due to slow Li diffusion.},

On either (2 × 1)O–Cu(110) or c(6 × 2)O–Cu(110) surface, the deposited Au nucleated into fractal two-dimensional islands and grew further into thin films via a layer-by-layer fashion. Both the (2 × 1) and c(6 × 2) ordered structures persisted notably despite the grown Au thin films, not only as the Au atoms were stacked according to the O–Cu(110) lattice but also as both O and Cu a (referring to the added Cu alternating with O at the O–Cu(110) surfaces) remained at the surface and formed Cu a –O–Au structures to promote the surface stability. In contrast, the Rh on the O–Cu(110) surfaces formed round, structurally ordered three-dimensional nanoclusters, at the expense of the (2 × 1) and c(6 × 2) structures. The Rh clusters grew preferentially in an fcc phase and (110) orientation, as the (110) facet matched better, structurally, with either (2 × 1)O–Cu(110) or Cu(110) surfaces. The disparate structuring of Au and Rh on O–Cu(110) surfaces was controlled by both lattice and energetic effects; in particular, the bond strengths in the order of Rh–Rh > Rh–O > Au–O > Au–Au at the surfaces predominated. The formation of the surface Cu a –O–Au structure, instead of the pure Au multilayers, arose from the stronger Au–O and enhanced Cu a –O bonds in the Cu a –O–Au structure.},

To address this and meet the demand for advanced organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene (2,7-DHN) was studied as a model substance to revisit the riddle of α-resorcinol. Surprisingly, 2,7-DHN crystals expose naphthalene-rich and hydroxyl-rich surfaces along polar c-axis, similar to the packing of α-resorcinol. Single-crystal growth experiments and simulations show that solvent type significantly influences the asymmetric growth and morphology of 2,7-DHN. Compared to α-resorcinol, the “pocket-like” structure of 2,7-DHN plays a more decisive role, thanks to the strong hydrogen bonding and deeper matching between the rougher crystalline surface and solvent molecules. This work aims to provide a new perspective for revealing the riddle of α-resorcinol and investigates the defect control and morphology prediction in organic NLO crystals.},

A detailed analysis of exciton absorption and emission spectra was conducted in the pressure range of 0–10 GPa, focusing on the energy shifts, PL intensity, and lineshape changes with pressure. The pressure coefficients for exciton absorption and PL peaks were ∼70% of the bulk InAs value, with enhanced bandgap nonlinearity tentatively attributed to the higher bulk modulus of QDs compared to bulk material. The pressure-induced shifts in exciton absorption and PL peaks were reversible upon compression and decompression, with no indication of the semiconductor-to-metallic phase transition observed in bulk InAs around 7 GPa. However, PL intensity exhibited partial irreversibility, suggesting defect formation at the core/shell interface under pressure. From the findings of this study, along with previous high-pressure studies on molecular beam epitaxy-grown InAs QDs on GaAs, we infer the importance of the shell in determining the pressure response of exciton absorption and PL in core/shell QD structures with non-negligible interfacial strain and wave function spill into the shell.},

  abstract     = {The vibrational frequency of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on ceria-based catalysts serves as a sensitive probe for identifying exposed surface facets, provided that experimental reference data on well-defined single-crystal surfaces and reliable theoretical assignments are available. Previous studies have shown that the hybrid density functional theory approach using the HSE06 functional yields good agreement with experimental observations, whereas the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE+U does not. In this work, we assess the performance of different exchange–correlation functionals by comparing the meta -GGA functionals SCAN and r 2 SCAN meta -GGA functionals with HSE06 in predicting CO vibrational frequencies on cerium oxide surfaces. The meta -GGA functionals offer no significant improvement for oxidized CeO 2 (111) and CeO 2 (110) surfaces and fail to localize excess charge on the reduced surfaces. Adding a Hubbard U term improves charge localization, but the predicted vibrational frequencies still fall short of HSE06 accuracy. These limitations are attributed to the meta -GGA’s inability to adequately capture facet- and configuration-specific donation and back-donation effects, which influence the C–O bond length and CO force constant upon adsorption. Despite the higher computational cost when used with plane wave basis sets, hybrid DFT remains essential for accurate interpretation of experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous solids exhibit an excess of low-frequency modes in their vibrational density of states (VDoS) beyond the Debye prediction, contributing to their anomalous mechanical and thermal properties. Recently a power-law behavior has been observed in the low frequency regime of their VDoS; however, a precise exponent remains a subject of debate. In this study, we demonstrate that boundary-condition-induced instabilities play a key role in the variability of this exponent. We identify two distinct types of elastic branches that differ in the nature of their energy landscape: Fictitious branches, where shear minima cannot be reached through elastic deformation alone and undergo plastic instabilities, and True branches, where elastic deformation can access these minima. Configurations on Fictitious branches display a VDoS scaling as D ( ω ) ∼ ω 3 , while those on True elastic branches under simple and pure shear deformations exhibit a scaling of D ( ω ) ∼ ω 5.5 . In simulations where this distinction is not made, ensemble averaging leads to a weighted combination of spectra from configurations with different mechanical stabilities, resulting in an exponent close to 4, as commonly reported in the literature. Furthermore, when solids are relaxed to their shear minima, eliminating residual stress, a scaling of D ( ω ) ∼ ω 6.5 emerges in both two and three dimensions. Importantly, our simulations show that the prevalence of solids on Fictitious branches increases with increasing system size. Our findings therefore suggest two possible limiting behaviors for amorphous solids: increasing system size without addressing instabilities may result in a low-frequency VDoS scaling as D ( ω ) ∼ ω 3 , while removing residual stresses in each configuration results in a D ( ω ) ∼ ω 6.5 behavior.},

Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.},

In this study, we explored the Ce–O–N–C system under pressures of 35–55 GPa and temperatures of 1500–1800 K. The introduction of oxygen into the Ce–N system resulted in the formation of a novel oxynitride, Ce 4 O 3 N 4 , characterized by lower-order N–N bonding compared to the triple-bonded N 2 molecule. In addition, we identified a new cerium oxoguanidinate, Ce 2 OCN 3 , in the Ce–O–C–N system. The crystal structures of Ce 4 O 3 N 4 and Ce 2 OCN 3 were determined using single-crystal x-ray diffraction, and their solutions were validated through Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This experimental approach provides a robust method for investigating mixed-anion systems under high-pressure conditions.

  abstract     = {The paradigmatic system of Ca 0.4 K 0.6 (NO 3 ) 1.4 (CKN) as a glass-forming molten salt, simultaneously showing multifaceted relaxation processes of both ion conductivity and liquid–glass transition, is pivotal to both fundamental physics and applied energy technologies, yet critical questions of relaxation dynamics persist after extensive studies over 50 years. The intricate relaxation dynamics of CKN, together with its structural complexity, provide unique testing grounds for the Coupling Model (CM), which has predicted universality of the dynamic processes and their properties in glass-forming materials irrespective of physical structure and chemical composition over the past 45 years, as reviewed recently in Ngai [Prog. Mater. Sci. 139 , 101130 (2023)]. By unifying decades of experimental and theoretical insights on the relaxation behaviors of CKN, many universal properties in both conductivity and liquid–glass relaxation have been extracted for the first time and explained in this paper. We demonstrate that the dual relaxation processes of CKN conform well to CM-predicted universality, including several critical transitions of temperature-dependent properties at T g and T B . Furthermore, the strong coupling of the conductivity relaxation of CKN to its structural relaxation processes is revealed by their related or shared properties. These positive results highlight the universal properties as predicted by the CM and enhance our understanding of the physical origins of structural and ion conductivity relaxation dynamics. Therefore, it not only advances the fundamental science of disordered glasses but also provides a template for studying relaxation behavior of complex systems.},

Distinguishing microscopic structures in the supercooled and high-temperature regimes remains a debated topic. Building on recent advances in machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), our study automatically extracts features, unveiling fundamental mechanisms driving structural changes at varying temperatures. We employ the self-attention mechanism to generate attention coefficients that quantify the importance of connections between graph nodes, providing insights into the rationale behind GNN predictions. By exploring structural changes with decreasing temperature through the GNN + self-attention using physically defined structural descriptors, including the bond-orientational order parameter, Voronoi cell volume, and coordination number, we identify strong correlations between high attention coefficients and more disordered structures as a key indicator of variations in glass-forming liquids.},

The crystals are examined using various techniques to ensure the pure single crystal phase. Among the crystals investigated, only the MAPbCl 3 and MAPbBr 3 crystals display the Faraday rotation effect in a broad visible range. Superconducting quantum interference device measurements conducted at room temperature show diamagnetic behavior of all crystals. Contaminations from magnetic elements, which could possibly induce magnetic anisotropy, are excluded from the secondary-ion mass spectrometry results. The experimental results conclude that the spin-orbital coupling of the lead ion is unlikely to be responsible for the observed Faraday rotation effect. The combined effect of the proton orbital–orbital interactions in the CH 3 NH 3 (MA) cation under optical excitation and confinement of the unit cell is proposed as the underlying mechanism for the observed magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, conclusive results from Faraday rotation measurements conducted on the deuterated d3-CH 3 ND 3 PbX 3 (X = Cl, Br) and d3-CD 3 NH 3 PbCl 3 single crystals demonstrate the involvement of the protons in the MA cation in the Faraday rotation effect; however, not all protons contribute equally to magnetic anisotropy.},

In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold.

In this work, we demonstrate that an energetic disorder, which usually results from a structural disorder, is instead a more essential feature of glass. In particular, we develop a distinguishable-particle glassy crystal, in which particles are ordered in a face-centered cubic lattice and follow particle-dependent random interactions, leading to an energetic disorder in the particle configuration space. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of vacancy-induced particle diffusion show typical glassy behaviors. A unique feature of this molecular model is the knowledge of the complete set of inherent structures with easily calculable free energies, implying a well-understood potential energy landscape.},

For the first time, we uncover the physical mechanism underlying efficient Li + /Na + separation through positively charged nanochannels at the atomic scale. It is demonstrated that the free energy required for Li + to enter the nanochannel is significantly lower than that for Na + . This disparity primarily arises from two key factors: First, Na + must shed more hydration water—including molecules from both its first and second hydration shells—when entering the nanochannel, resulting in a higher potential barrier. Second, the distinct hydration properties of Li + and Na + within the nanochannel cause Li + to preferentially occupy regions near the channel axis, while Na + tends to localize closer to the channel walls. This spatial distribution leads to stronger electrostatic interactions between Na + and the positively charged channel, further impeding Na + entry. As a result of these combined effects, the flow rate of Li + through the nanochannel can exceed that of Na + by more than 20 times—representing the highest Li + /Na + separation factor reported in the field to date. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for the rational design of nanochannels capable of precise ion separation.},

  abstract     = {Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have extensive applications in metal processing, organic reaction and extraction, and other fields due to their advantages of facile preparation, environmental compatibility, and non-toxicity. Matrine (Mat) and fatty acids (FAs) are widely used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics because of their rich biological activities. In this study, Mat–FA DESs (DESs formed by Mat and FAs) are prepared and the corresponding microscopic mechanism for the formation of DESs is elucidated at molecular level systematically by experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results reveal that the Mat–FA interaction is stronger than that between the components themselves, which makes the melting point of the mixture lower than the theoretical eutectic point, and the hydrogen bonding in the system is positively correlated with the deviation of the melting point from the theoretical eutectic point, and the systems with stronger hydrogen bonding are more prone to form DESs with a melting point below 25 °C. Notably, when the interaction of FA–FA is weaker in the system, the DESs also can be observed at higher FA concentrations. In addition, the DES aqueous solutions exhibit different phase behaviors, which can be adjusted on purpose by changing the DES concentration. The phase behavior of DES aqueous solutions is closely related to molecular interactions. The stronger molecular interactions in DES aqueous solutions favor the formation of gels with better mechanical performance. The present work not only provides a theoretical basis for understanding the formation of Mat–FA DESs but also extends the potential applications of DES systems.},

Our field-theoretical framework, rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, incorporates quasi-stationary concentration fluctuations that align with equilibrium liquid theory as described by classical density functional theory. This method serves as a phenomenological extension of the established Dean–Kawasaki stochastic density functional theory, enabling the computation of shear viscosity. We apply our approach to derive a general formula for the shear viscosity in single-solute solutions.

  abstract     = {Thermal fields induce thermal polarization and the buildup of a stationary net electric field in polar liquids. While the thermal polarization effect in water has been studied before, the coupling effects between heat and polarization fluxes remain unexplored in most polar fluids. Here, we investigate thermal transport and thermal polarization in liquid and supercritical ethanol through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using the TraPPE force field. We discuss the thermal conductivity of ethanol under various thermodynamic conditions and its correlation with other thermophysical properties, such as isothermal compressibility and specific heat capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that thermal gradients polarize liquid and supercritical ethanol. We report an inversion in the sign of the polarization field along the liquid branch of the liquid–vapor saturation line and discuss the microscopic origin of this inversion. Near the critical point, the thermal polarization effect increases significantly, as observed in water. Finally, we show a correlation between the sign reversal of the thermal polarization and the minimum in the liquid–vapor surface potential of ethanol.},

  abstract     = {The ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photo absorption spectra of fulvene were reconsidered by a combination of configuration interaction and density functional methods and extended to the newly acquired VUV photo absorption spectrum of the 6,6-dimethylfulvene derivative, where several Rydberg states have been identified. Singlet states of fulvene were studied using multi-root multi-reference configuration interaction with the H 2 C unit either coplanar with, or perpendicular to the ring. In contrast to ethylene, the lowest states are coplanar. The vibrational structure of the lowest ( 1 B 2 ) excited states of fulvene is well reproduced by calculated values. The second singlet state of fulvene, previously assigned as 1 A 1 on the basis of intensity, is incompatible with the calculated planar 1 A 1 state, which itself is a saddle point. This state shows significant quartic character on bending, and the best interpretation of the observed UV band of fulvene is of a bent form. The UV spectral state with low onset intensity is probably a 1 B 1 state of C S symmetry. Theoretical Rydberg states were determined for fulvene; the closest fit to the two known Rydberg states is to the 3p and 4p states ( 1 B 1 ). Comparison of the separation of the 2 A 2 and 2 B 1 states in the photoelectron spectra of the two compounds, with the threshold photoelectron spectrum of fulvene, shows that the 2 B 1 state vibrational structure is largely lost for both molecules. A reconsideration of the interaction between the X 2 A 2 and A 2 B 1 ionic states has led to the identification of the 4 A 2 quartic state of fulvene.},

  abstract     = {Achieving fine control over the thrust and specific impulse from electrospray thrusters requires fundamental understanding of the microscale mechanisms governing the types of ion emissions at the emitter tips. Using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we model the pressurized flow of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM–BF 4 ) ionic liquid out of a nanopore to form a convex meniscus, representative of the liquid surface at the emitter-tip, which in turn is subjected to a uniform electric field. Results show that most emitted species are dimers at low electric fields (∼1 V/nm), transitioning to combined monomer and dimer emissions at intermediate electric fields (∼2–4 V/nm), with predominantly monomer emissions at high electric fields (∼6 V/nm). This dimer-to-monomer transition with electric field strength is correlated with the corresponding increase in per-atom stress fluctuations along single interconnected molecular chains of alternating cations and anions at the tip of the Taylor cone, allowing for scission of shorter chains to emit monomers at higher electric fields and scission of longer chains to emit dimers and trimers at lower electric fields. Our coarse-grain MD simulations reveal qualitatively similar emission mechanisms to the all-atom MD simulations, with comparable instantaneous currents during steady-state ion emissions (∼1–8 nA) under electric field strengths of relevance to experiments.},

  abstract     = {Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light–matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions and, therefore, energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of these modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here, we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator methods to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light–matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling, this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.},

  abstract     = {Jet-cooled 2,7,12,17-tetra- tert -butylporphycene exhibits a very complicated electronic spectrum, previously interpreted in terms of three different conformers and/or tautomers present in the supersonic expansion. Based on experiments employing two different techniques of introducing molecules into the jet—heating and laser desorption—we now correct this assignment. The observed species are attributed to tetra-, tri-, and di- tert -butylporphycenes. These conclusions are supported by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations; the latter, in combination with the experiment, allow elucidation of the most stable tautomeric forms and understanding of vibrational patterns observed in laser-induced fluorescence and dispersed fluorescence spectra. Tetra-substituted porphycene shows tunneling splitting due to coherent delocalization of the two hydrogens in the inner cavity. In the tri- and di-substituted derivatives, tunneling is suppressed because of symmetry lowering. In order to explain the spectral shifts observed upon consecutive H/D substitution of the inner protons, we propose a simple model that allows estimating the tunneling splitting magnitude from experimentally observed transition energies compared to those estimated assuming additivity of the isotope shifts upon successive H/D replacements. The procedure may be useful for analysis of complex spectra.},

While it is recognized that vibronic coupling drives the dynamics through CIs, there is a paucity of experimental information on the effect of vibrations on relaxation in molecular aggregates. Here, we describe experiments on the ultrafast electronic energy relaxation in the isolated anthracene dimer—an archetype of a π-stacked aromatic system relevant to intermolecular photon-driven processes such as those in optoelectronics. The combination of a molecular beam with femtosecond, tunable laser spectroscopy allows for both the necessary spectral and time resolution to investigate the relaxation of different vibrational levels in the excited state of the anthracene dimer. In general, our experimental observations corroborate predictions of the lifetimes of initial excited states in aromatic dimers. More specifically, we evaluate our results using time-dependent density functional theory, which identifies potential electronic relaxation pathways via CIs and supports multiple phenomenological interpretations for the observed lifetimes of different vibrational states in the electronically excited state manifold.},

This rotational fluxionality is driven by the dominant electrostatic interaction between Li and O atoms and the supplemented delocalized covalent bonds in peripheral Li–H atoms.

Kinetic energy release distributions indicate that the deprotonation channel (HCN 2+ → H + + CN + ) stems from low-lying electronic states of the dication, aligning with prior photon double-ionization studies. However, metastable state lifetimes exhibit significant prolongation compared to photon-induced processes.

In extraterrestrial environments, it may plausibly form from the abundant interstellar propenal. The reactivity of crotonaldehyde with H atoms provides insight into the chemical pathways linking key classes of interstellar complex organic molecules, particularly aldehydes and ketenes. This work aims to investigate the astrophysically relevant low-temperature H-atom reactions of crotonaldehyde in a solid medium to explore its potential chemical evolution in the interstellar medium (ISM). Crotonaldehyde was isolated in solid para -H 2 matrices at 3.1 K. The reactions were monitored via infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Quantum-chemical computations were performed to estimate the energetics and barriers of the reactions and verify the spectral assignments. The main product of the reactions of crotonaldehyde with H atoms is the CH 3 CHCH • CO radical, for which seven fundamental modes were assigned in the IR spectra. Absorption features of CH 3 • CHCHCO were also detected. Subsequent H-atom reactions with these radicals were found to yield ethylketene (CH 3 CH 2 CHCO). The H-assisted isomerization to ketenes through the formation of R • CO radicals may be a common feature in the H-atom reactions of α , β -alkenals. Thus, corresponding ketenes may be expected in regions of the ISM where α , β -alkenals have been detected. The alkenal–ketene isomerization reaction may also contribute to the catalytic formation of interstellar H 2 . These findings confirm the H-atom activation of aldehydes in the ISM, revealing the formation of intermediates that are essential to increase the interstellar chemical complexity.},

We focus on the effect of excitation energy on the subsequent dynamics. The absorption spectrum of o -nitrophenol has two peaks, centered at 3.9 eV (∼320 nm) and 5.1 eV (∼240 nm), and we performed dynamics starting from each of these peaks. The results show that even though the relaxation time constants are similar for the two excitation windows, the underlying dynamics are different. When exciting to the low energy peak, the dynamics are dominated by intramolecular proton transfer followed by internal conversion to the ground state, while exciting to the high-energy peak leads to fast internal conversion to the first excited state and slower decay to the ground state. In this case, intramolecular proton transfer does not occur as frequently, and many trajectories decay to the ground state through conical intersections without proton transfer. By calculating spin–orbit coupling values along the trajectories, we also show that intersystem crossing is possible. Based on the Landau–Zener probability formula, we estimate that there is about a 30%–40% probability that intersystem crossing will occur within 1 ps.},

  abstract     = {Clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) doped with guest molecules represent a suitable model system for interstellar dust grains. Here, we investigate the electron-induced chemistry in aggregates of naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene, both when they are pure and when they are doped with O 2 and CO 2 . Clusters are experimentally produced by adiabatic expansion and doped by the molecules in a pickup process, are collided with electrons of controlled energy, and the anionic products are mass analyzed. In pure PAH clusters, a strong influence of the monomer electron affinity is observed. We see a surprising effect in doped clusters: while cluster anions with multiple CO 2 molecules [i.e., (PAH) m ( CO 2 ) n − with n > 1] are detected, only anions with one O 2 molecule [i.e., ( P A H ) m O 2 − ] are formed. In addition, the dissociation of oxygen molecules by dissociative electron attachment at 6.5 eV is quenched on PAH clusters and stable superoxide O 2 − is formed. This may influence the efficiency of the depletion of molecular oxygen in astrochemical environments with a high abundance of free electrons.},

  abstract     = {The Si–O–H containing complexes are key interstellar species, but their structural characterization has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in size selection of neutral clusters in general. Here, two series of products with the chemical formula of SiO n H 2 n and SiO n H 2 n −1 ( n = 2–4) were prepared via the reactions of laser-ablated silicon atoms with the water molecules and characterized by using size-specific infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR–VUV) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The SiO n H 2 n and SiO n H 2 n −1 ( n = 2–4) products were identified to have the hydroxysilylene structures HSiOH(H 2 O) n and the silica hydroxide structures SiOH(H 2 O) n ( n = 1–3), respectively. In particular, the HSiOH(H 2 O) n and SiOH(H 2 O) n ( n = 2 and 3) complexes were found to have cyclic hydrogen-bonded networks. Two possible pathways for the formation of the observed products have been discussed. This work provides new insights into the astrochemically relevant Si–O–H molecular architectures that are helpful for understanding the formation mechanism of cosmic particle.},

  abstract     = {In quantum chemistry, the region associated with atoms in molecules (AIMs) is determined using the basin definition through the action integral of the total Lagrangian density. This can be associated with different Hamiltonians, such as Schrödinger, Dirac, or the modified Dirac Hamiltonian. The latter two differ only in the associated metric matrix: while the Dirac Hamiltonian is the 4 × 4 identity matrix, the modified Dirac Hamiltonian is a diagonal matrix composed by the 2 × 2 identity matrix and a 2 × 2 diagonal matrix with elements T ̂ / 2 m c 2 ⁠ . It was shown by Cioslowski and Karwowski that when the Dirac Hamiltonian is considered, the total Lagrangian density is zero at every point within the molecular volume, making it impossible to partition the molecular electronic structure into basins. Moreover, the nonrelativistic total Lagrangian density derived from the Dirac Hamiltonian is also zero at every point, and a heuristic term must be added to obtain the basin definition in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) developed by Bader. In contrast, the total Lagrangian density associated with the modified Dirac Hamiltonian is nonzero at every point within the molecular volume, and the basin can be defined in a relativistic framework. Taking the nonrelativistic limit of this Lagrangian density, the standard nonrelativistic basin definition within the QTAIM approach is recovered.},

Ion yields were analyzed as a function of projectile energy and compared to existing electron impact data. Overall, the ion yields resulting from proton impact are consistent with those observed under electron impact and photon absorption. The similarity between proton- and photon-induced yields suggests that the underlying physical and chemical processes responsible for fragment generation may share common features. This implies that the interactions of protons and photons with the target molecules proceed through comparable mechanisms. In contrast, differences observed between proton and electron impacts are likely due to interference effects between first- and second-order interactions with the target. Comparisons with previous studies indicate that fragmentation patterns in molecules such as CH 2 Cl 2 and CHClF 2 occur under similar impact parameters, further supporting the notion that the fragmentation mechanisms of these molecules exhibit shared characteristics.},

The optimization of homonuclear exchange symmetry is incorporated in our calculation. The theoretical results clearly reveal the breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, which is similar to that observed in the Cl + H 2 reaction. However, it was found that reducing the coupling terms between electronic states affects the numerical convergence of this reaction. Further calculations for the rotationally excited reagent indicated that rotational excitation enhances the reactivity of Cl ( P 3 / 2 2 ) ⁠ , whereas it appears to be independent of Cl ( P 1 / 2 2 ) ⁠ . This behavior suggests reduced non-BO effects in the rotationally excited state reagent for j = 1.

All theoretical descriptions of atom recombination depend on a two-step assumption, where two colliding atoms first form an unstable complex before a third colliding body either relaxes or reacts with it to yield a diatomic molecule. These mechanisms have served well in describing some of the dynamics of atom recombination but have not yet provided a full theoretical understanding. In this work, we consider the role of the direct three-body recombination mechanism in halogen recombination reactions X + X + M → X 2 + M, where X is a halogen atom and M is a rare gas atom. Our results agree well with experimental bromide and iodine recombination measurements, demonstrating that direct three-body recombination is essential in halogen recombination reactions.},

  abstract     = {Ionization processes, promoted by the collisions of CO molecule with noble gas atoms electronically excited in a metastable state, as Ne*, are known as chemi-ionization (CHEMI) reactions. CHEMI reactions of CO have been experimentally investigated in various laboratories exploiting the molecular beam technique, which allowed the resolution of single collision events. The present study, exploiting a proper formulation of optical potential that drives the collision dynamics, provides an internally consistent rationalization of the experimental findings. Such formulation emphasizes the change of both real and imaginary parts of the optical potential along each permitted reaction channel leading to the formation of CO + in the ground (X 2 Σ) and in the first excited (A 2 Π) electronic state. In particular, some basic details, up to now unknown, on the dynamical evolution of reagents toward products, along the manifold of state-to-state reaction channels, have been properly emphasized. Obtained information appears of general interest for many other reactions, which, respect to CHEMI, are more difficult to characterize in detail.},

  abstract     = {Hemiindigo is a photochromic dye constituted from half of indigo (3-oxindole) and half of stilbene (phenyl). The solvent dependence of the E – Z isomerization dynamics of two types of hemiindigos, 2-(4-dimethylamino)benzylidene)indolin-3-one (DABI) and its derivative with the amino moiety substituted by a 1-propyl group, was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The excited (S 1 ) state lifetimes of the E - and Z - isomers of these compounds were all shorter than 100 ps, and they displayed dependence on polarity and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) ability of the solvent. The S 1 state lifetime of Z -DABI shortened from 76 ps in toluene to 9.3 ps in methanol. It was concluded that strengthening of the H-bond with the solvent molecule in the S 1 state increases the rate of nonradiative decay to the original ground (S 0 ) state and reduces the quantum yield of the photoisomerization. We think a similar deactivation process induced by the intermolecular H-bonding also takes place for photochromic indigo derivatives and, in the case of indigo carmine in aqueous solution, a water molecule trapped between NH and C=O moieties of indigo by H-bonds induces the “solvent mediated” proton transfer in the excited state [Roy et al. , J.

Herein, we characterized the S LP ⋯π interactions in the dimers of benzofuran with diethyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide using high-resolution rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The observation of two isomers for each dimer confirmed the leading role of the S LP ⋯π interactions, along with cooperative effects from C–H⋯π and C–H⋯O weak hydrogen bonds. The molecular structures, electronic properties, and non-covalent interactions were accurately determined using density functional theory [B3LYP-D3(BJ)] and domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster theory [DLPNO-CCSD(T)]. The determined atomic distances between sulfur and the benzofuran ring are within the range of 3.465(4)–3.621(5) Å, resembling bonding patterns commonly observed in proteins. Dispersion energy is found to play a significant role in these sulfur interactions, accounting for 67%–71% of the total attractive interactions in the dimers. This study thus offers insights into the structural and energetic properties of S LP ⋯π interactions that can serve as a benchmark for future theoretical explorations and molecular design based on disulfide patterns.},

Photofragment O 2 + ion was obtained as an image, and its shape had a distribution divided along the polarization direction of the dissociation laser. From the angular distribution, we calculated the anisotropy parameter β , and its value ( β = 1.6) is somewhat less than the axial recoil limit. The radial distribution showed that only a small fraction of the available energy after photoexcitation was partitioned to kinetic energy, and the fragments were highly rotationally excited. We also conducted complete active-space self-consistent field calculations and identified the precursor O 4 + as a doublet rectangular isomer. The calculations also revealed a repulsive potential energy surface (PES) of the excited state, indicating that the dissociation lifetime is relatively fast. To explain the fragment’s rotational excitation during the rapid dissociation process, we considered two of its rotational degrees of freedom: in-plane corotation and out-of-plane counter-rotation. Topology of the excited state potential energy surface shows that wave packet motion on the excited state PES induced the excitation of librational motion of fragments, resulting in the in-plane corotation and out-of-plane counter-rotation.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast spectroscopy is a powerful method to capture excited-state dynamics, as well as a wealth of information about inter- and intra-molecular vibrations on the ground and excited states. In principle, coherent wave packets with energies across the entire bandwidth of the excitation light are accessible, but poor sensitivity, sample photodamage, low dynamic range, and limits of current analysis methods restrict accurate recovery to a limited spectral range. As a result, the information content of ultrafast spectroscopy remains far from reaching its full potential. These shortcomings are especially acute in the low frequency region below a few THz, which covers a diverse range of interactions that mediate interlayer coupling, buried interfaces, polarons, and solvent–solute interactions. Here, we present a method using ultrashort pulses that captures excited-state relaxation and inter- and intra-molecular vibrations over four decades in time and energy (0.1–2000 cm −1 ). We adopt Bayesian inference, demonstrating dramatically improved signal reconstruction in comparison with traditional Fourier analysis. Our approach facilities a comprehensive study of the electronic and vibrational landscapes within a probabilistic framework in multi-layer graphene and WSe 2 . In the latter, we demonstrate that Bayes not only provided accurate parameter estimation but also reduced sampling to less than 3% of the Nyquist–Shannon criteria. Layer-dependent studies on exfoliated flakes of WSe 2 using correlated atomic force microscopy were also carried out. The results underscore the potential of this method in probing the complex dynamics of various chemical, biological, and materials systems, maximizing the information extracted from ultrafast spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Improving the efficiency of photothermal (PT) therapies and photoacoustic (PA) imaging at the microscopic scale hinges on developing multiphoton-absorbing photothermal molecules or contrast agents that operate in the near-infrared (NIR) range. These advanced agents or molecules will enable excitation with NIR lasers, in an improved transparency range for biological tissues, while enabling minute, highly localized spatial control of the excitation volume. However, progress in this field requires innovative experimental techniques to characterize photothermal and photoacoustic effects under multiphoton excitation. In this article, we showcase a study of a model organometallic molecular compound excited via two-photon absorption (2 PA) using femtosecond laser pulses. Based on a time-domain Brillouin scattering technique, well adapted for investigating ultrafast nonlinear optical absorption processes in ultrathin films on substrates, we determine the effective nonlinear absorption coefficients of the compound directly linked to PT/PA. Our findings provide a practical approach for exploring and optimizing nonlinear PT/PA absorbers and contrast agents.},

  abstract     = {High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) has become crucial in attosecond science and time-resolved spectroscopy, providing insights into ultrafast electron dynamics. One approach to calculating HHG spectra for complex systems is to use Gaussian basis sets in conjunction with (correlated) wave function methods. While previous studies have shown that Gaussian functions can be effectively used to describe electron dynamics in the continuum, the treatment of basis set incompleteness is equally critical. Properly addressing this issue is essential to avoid artificial reflections and accurately incorporate ionization, which is key to obtaining realistic results. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of the ab initio lifetime model (AbILM) [Coccia et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 147 , 014106 (2017)] and the heuristic lifetime models (HLMs) [Klinkusch et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 131 , 114304 (2009); Coccia et al. , Int. J. Quant. Chem. 116 , 1120–1131 (2016); and Woźniak et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 204107 (2022)]. Our investigation focuses on hydrogen and helium atoms, as well as the hydrogen molecule, using time-dependent configuration interaction singles (TD-CIS) and doubles (TD-CISD). In addition, we extend our study to the nitrogen molecule, though only within the TD-CIS framework. Our findings assess the impact of these lifetime correction approaches on HHG spectra, highlighting how different treatments of basis set incompleteness influence the accuracy of HHG predictions. This analysis provides valuable insights into the reliability and potential biases of each method.},

  abstract     = {The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the computational cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of Δ-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods, which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity. This work compares the data costs associated with Δ-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML in contrast with a newly introduced MultifidelityΔ-Machine Learning (MFΔML) method for the prediction of ground state energies, vertical excitation energies, and the magnitude of the electronic contribution of molecular dipole moments from the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of the training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard Δ-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. In applications where only a few numbers of predictions/evaluations are to be made using ML models, the herein developed MFΔML method is shown to provide an added advantage over conventional Δ-ML.},

  abstract     = {Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.},

The MSH model provides a general framework for mapping a realistic system onto an effective model Hamiltonian, which is defined in extended spatial dimensions, ensuring consistent reorganization energies between all state pairs. Its analytic structure allows efficient propagation of wavepackets via a rank-adaptive TT-KSL scheme and rigorous finite-temperature dynamics via TT-thermofield dynamics. These exact results are used to benchmark various approximate semiclassical and mixed quantum–classical dynamics, including the linearized semiclassical (LSC), symmetrical quasiclassical, classical mapping models (CMMs), mean-field Ehrenfest, and fewest-switches surface hopping dynamics. We systematically explore the parameter space of the MSH model by changing electronic coupling, reorganization energy, reaction free energy, and the nuclear characteristic frequency. In the adiabatic-inverted regime, strong electronic coupling and low reorganization energy lead all approximate methods to converge with the exact TT results. In contrast, discrepancies emerge in the nonadiabatic or normal regimes, where resolution-of-identity LSC and CMMs provide the reliable predictions. This study establishes the MSH model as a powerful tool for validating nonadiabatic dynamics methods in complex condensed-phase systems.},

The key result of the present study is the established correlation between the sign of the exchange parameter and the sign of the thermal effect. We have demonstrated that in the case of a ferromagnetic exchange, heat absorption (cooling) occurs, while if the exchange is antiferromagnetic, heat release (heating) takes place. This conclusion suggests a possibility to regard Heisenberg type dimers exhibiting ferromagnetic exchange as a class of low-temperature magnetic refrigerants that could be promising for practical applications.},

With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term goal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM) techniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum devices has been a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising approaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a graph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture for practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without the requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of the quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated expectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits adhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network is mapped to a directed graph, which encodes the information of the native gate noise profile to generate the features for the neural network. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in predicted energy over a few molecules, which exhibit various degrees of correlation across their dissociation energy profile.},

This improvement enhances the fidelity of UVCC state preparation, enabling more efficient and earlier implementation of complex quantum vibrational structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. We experimentally demonstrate our method on Quantinuum’s H1-1 quantum hardware, achieving significantly higher fidelities for 6- and 8-qubit systems compared to existing implementations.

The effective “volume” of standard Gaussian products decreases as dimensionality f increases, meaning that rapidly growing basis sets are required to obtain accurate results as f grows. Here, we show that the flexibility inherent in Gaussian-based simulations allows development of new basis sets in which behavior at higher-dimensionality is improved. For the case of PES regression, we first show that recasting Gaussian basis functions in an “additive” form improves fitting convergence in higher-dimensional problems. Taking inspiration from these PES regression studies, we then propose two new Gaussian wavepacket (GWP) basis functions—stretched and tethered GWPs—for quantum dynamics simulations. When combined with careful choice of initial GWP conditions, we find that tethered GWP basis sets, in particular, improve convergence of predicted time-dependent observables compared to standard product GWPs. The new GWP basis sets proposed here are readily compatible with all previous GWP-based quantum dynamics strategies, opening a path toward more accurate predictions with smaller basis sets.},

However, the microscopic control mechanisms are not yet clear. This study combines density functional theory-based electronic structure with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics to systematically analyze the nonradiative electron–hole recombination of CdTe and Se-doped systems. The results show that Se doping reduces the NA couplings and accelerates phonon-induced decoherence, thereby extending the nonradiative recombination lifetime. To accelerate NA coupling calculations, we introduced three types of recurrent neural network models (LSTM, GRU, and ConvLSTM) for extrapolation predictions. Among them, ConvLSTM demonstrated the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy and reproducing nonradiative behavior. Further combined with intrinsic defect calculations, it was shown that Se doping effectively shallows the transition energy levels of V Cd and V Te and suppresses the formation of deep-level traps. This study reveals the multiscale mechanism of Se regulation on the nonradiative recombination pathways of CdTe-doped systems and provides an efficient machine learning framework for accelerating NA simulation of optoelectronic materials.},

In this paper, we present a graph neural network (GNN) that can predict exciton couplings between organic molecules by using atomic transition charges as an intermediary. Our GNN is shown to predict exciton couplings between important fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), as well as many other molecules found in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center crystal database, with good accuracy. We also show that the predicted couplings can be used for accurate simulations of exciton diffusion. This work, therefore, overcomes the key limitation of previous machine-learned models for exciton couplings and thereby brings us closer to the possibility of performing high-throughput virtual screening of organic materials for photovoltaic applications.},

  abstract     = {The interparticle Coulombic decay (ICD) is a nonradiative decay process, in which energy released by an electron’s transition within one species leads to the ionization of a neighboring species. Over the years, research has focused on ICD in quantum dots (QDs), whose size-dependent excitation makes them suitable to tailor ICD properties. This work introduces a more highly excited state in the relaxing QD, aiming to allow for several ICD pathways and to clarify their competition by energy and selection rules. As an unexpected result, it was found that the otherwise directive energetic ICD conditions alone are insufficient to predict behavior in an ICD setting with competing pathways. In general, the pathway with the higher-energy transition is found to be slower and, moreover, allowed due to the breaking of symmetry selection rules in the QD array. It could, hence, be used in time-resolved measurements of the electron dynamics in self-assembled QDs, where the state preparation via charging from a reservoir is straightforward.},

Unless editing is possible, plain writing fixes typed characters along the chain, a stepwise equilibration whose history influences successive characters. Here, we present a writing protocol in nanoscale systems that optimizes the interpretation of already generated error-containing information to adequately influence the next character to type. Near the noise level, as characterized by the thermal energy, and in the presence of positive feedback, this resilient protocol presents higher entropy than that in which errors can be corrected but reduces the entropy of plain writing. For negative feedback, it presents lower entropy than both plain writing and writing with editing. When the noise level is low enough, the entropy becomes negative, which reflects an underlying phase transition at low temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Recently—Lanzi et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 160 , 214107 (2024)—we introduced a time averaged approach to infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The pivotal advance in that paper was represented by the possibility to get accurate semiclassical estimates of the IR absorption intensities and associated transition frequencies from a single calculation. However, the method relies on the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations based on the generation of thousands of pairs of semiclassical trajectories. This makes the approach highly accurate but limited to small, few-atom molecules. Here, we build on the theoretical grounds of that work to extend the application of the method to larger molecules. The goal is achieved by moving to tailored single-pair trajectory calculations and introducing a partially time-independent approximation to the real part of the coherent state overlap. Upon testing the level of accuracy on small molecules such as water, formaldehyde, and methane, we calculate IR spectra for ethanol and glycine. Vibrational intensities and frequencies are found to be fairly accurate, and the method can be straightforwardly applied to larger molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {We propose modifications to the G4 composite method, which allows us to continue using the method as a black box for computing gas-phase formation enthalpies of closed-shell organic molecules, but with the following additional features. (a) The resultant predictions are drastically improved when the molecules contain the nitrophenyl and nitrogen-heterocycle moieties, relative to the original G4 recipe. (b) The proposed modified G4 recipes retain a similar predictive capability for computing formation enthalpies of small closed-shell organic molecules, which were part of the original training set of the G4 recipe. The modifications consist of re-parameterizing two empirical parameters related to the high-level correction term and the frequency scaling factor. The latter is related to both the zero point energy correction as well as to some anharmonic effects that impact the vibrational partition function. We also show that the method used to optimize geometries and to calculate frequencies does not significantly impact the quality of the predictions (after the respective reparameterization). Here, the functionals ω B97XD and M06-2X as well as the MP2 method were tested. In contrast, we show that the chemical information contained in the set used to determine the empirical parameters plays a major role in the overall agreement with experimental formation enthalpies. Molecules that are not closed-shell organic are not studied.},

  abstract     = {We report a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of electron scattering from nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Experimental two-dimensional electron energy loss spectra (EELS) provide information about vibrational states of a molecule and about potential energy surfaces of anionic resonances. This study reports the EELS measured at 2.5–2.6 eV incident energy. The calculations using complex-valued extensions of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory (based on the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics) facilitate the assignment of all major EELS features. Our simulations identified two broad and partially overlapping resonances—one of π * and another of σ * character—located at ∼2.8 and 2.3 eV vertically at the equilibrium geometry of the neutral. Due to the Renner–Teller effect, the π * resonance splits upon bending. The upper state, 2 Π, remains linear. The lower state mixes with the σ * configuration, giving rise to the 2 A′ resonance, which becomes strongly stabilized at bent geometries ( α NNO = 134°), resulting in very low adiabatic electron attachment energy. The calculations estimate the electron affinity of N 2 O to be −0.140 eV. The 2 A′ state is predissociative, with the barrier for the N–O bond dissociation of 0.183 eV. The measured EELS feature sharp vibrational structures at low energy losses, followed by a linear (in logarithmic scale) tail extending to the maximum energy loss. The simulations attribute the sharp features at the low energy loss to the non-resonant excitations and contributions from the cold 2 Π resonance. The tail is attributed to the vibrationally hot 2 A′ state, and its slope is determined by the excess energy available in this state.},

We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even 2D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO 2 configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the α – β inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.},

Only fluid states were considered. Under moderate conditions, the IAPWS water equation of state was used as a reference. The comparison of the force fields yields important differences. All force fields yield the same topology for the characteristic curves, i.e., dome shaped in a double logarithmic pT diagram. Nevertheless, important quantitative differences for the performance of the different force fields are obtained. Overall, the TIP4P/2005 and SPC/E models give (among others) a reasonable description of the reference data. Furthermore, the computer experiments provide new insights into the topology of Brown’s characteristic curves, which were originally postulated for simple fluids. Nevertheless, also for a strongly hydrogen bonding fluid such as water, no significant anomalies compared with simple fluids are observed.},

Our structural analysis reveals that GC-rich binding induces significant DNA bending, narrowing the major groove and enhancing peptide interactions. In contrast, AT-rich minor grooves are more extended and electronegative, allowing better stereochemical fitting with planar and aromatic guanidinium side groups of arginine. However, thymine’s methyl group hinders major groove binding, favoring guanine. Thermodynamic free energy calculations, using molecular mechanics based generalized Born surface area and umbrella sampling, confirm stronger peptide affinity for AT-rich minor grooves and GC-rich major grooves.

We show that the renormalization factor provides a unique measure of the quality of the compression as it directly represents the projection between the approximate stationary state of the many-body Hamiltonian and the full many-body wavefunction. Hence, the renormalization factor is a measure of fidelity between the effective (reduced-rank) description and the full many-body treatment for arbitrary (i.e., ground and excited) states. When the entire problem is mapped on a system of interacting quasiparticles [Romanova et al. , npj Comput. Mater. 9 , 126 (2023)], the effective Hamiltonians can faithfully reproduce the physics only when a clear energy scale separation exists between the subsystems and their environment. We also demonstrate that it is necessary to include quasiparticle renormalization at distinct energy scales, capturing the distinct interaction between subsystems and their surrounding environments. Numerical results from simple, exactly solvable models highlight the limitations and strengths of this approach, particularly for ground and low-lying excited states. This work lays the groundwork for applying dynamical downfolding techniques to problems concerned with (quantum) interfaces.},

We construct the diabatic excited states from fragment particle–hole densities and simulate the dynamics via the stochastic Schrödinger equation. The results show that charge separation involves three hybrid steps: energy/charge transfer, vibronic coherence, and entropy enhancement. In 100 fs, local excitation (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states relax to lower energy states, forming a quasi-stationary distribution. This involves interfacial energy transfer and exciton dissociation. Then, CT states coherently interact with LE states via C–N and C–C bond vibrations for 300 fs, aiding charge separation. Finally, free charges form due to entropy enhancement. This work demonstrates a novel approach to studying photophysics in complex systems. It unifies several charge separation mechanisms and highlights the importance of interfacial energy transfer for enhancing photovoltaic performance.},

  abstract     = {Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) faces significant challenges due to hardware noise and the presence of barren plateaus and local traps in the optimization landscape. To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we introduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and accuracy by projecting VQE optimizations onto a reduced-dimensional subspace, followed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz into a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary subspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the parameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this hierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace only. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space reconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These reconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the cost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC), leading to a “ plummeting effect ” in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minimum without utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical simulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our method can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the minima. In addition, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a novel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for accelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms. Our method shows heuristic evidence of alleviating the effects of local traps, facilitating convergence toward a more optimal minimum.},

We show that by approximating the exact exchange operator with the low-rank ACE operator, substantial computational savings can be achieved with systematically controllable errors in the quasiparticle energies computed with full-frequency G 0 W 0 and the optical absorption spectra and vertical excitation energies computed by solving the BSE within density matrix perturbation theory. Our implementation makes use of the ACE-accelerated electronic Hamiltonian to carry out both G 0 W 0 and BSE without explicitly computing empty states. We show the robustness of the approach and present the computational gains obtained on both the central processing unit and graphics processing unit nodes. Our work will facilitate the exploration and evaluation of fine-tuned hybrid starting points aimed at enhancing the accuracy of MBPT calculations without involving computationally demanding self-consistency in Hedin’s equations.},

  abstract     = {A magnetic compass sense in migratory animals is widely attributed to quantum spin dynamics in radical pairs formed within cryptochrome (Cry) flavoproteins. During Cry photoreduction, electron transfer along a chain of four tryptophan residues creates a sequence of radical pairs. Reversible electron hopping between the third (RPC) and fourth (RPD) radical pairs has been proposed to reconcile two opposing demands: efficient magnetosensitivity via RPC and downstream signaling via RPD. We present an efficient numerical approach for modeling dynamically exchanging radical pairs, employing an iterative linear solver with tailored preconditioners. This enables simulation of radical pair networks in Cry with arbitrary hopping rates, allowing a detailed exploration of their magnetosensitivity. Using this method, we reassess the reversible hopping hypothesis. For the crystal structure of avian Cry, hopping does not enhance sensitivity beyond that of a static RPC pair. However, by systematically optimizing kinetic parameters and the position and orientation of the fourth tryptophan, we identify configurations that enhance magnetic sensitivity by up to a factor of 3.6, while retaining the surface-exposure of this residue, potentially linked to signaling. Our findings suggest that Cry magnetosensitivity may be finely tuned by structural or evolutionary factors. The developed framework offers a broadly applicable tool for simulating complex radical pair dynamics in biology and chemistry, extending beyond magnetoreception.},

  abstract     = {Complex fluids in confined geometries are found in numerous applications, including membranes, lubricants, and microelectronics. However, current computational approaches for studying these systems have a variety of shortcomings. Particle-based simulations are limited in accessible length and time scales, while the interaction parameters in field-theoretic approaches have no direct connections to specific chemistries. Here, we extend a multiscale framework that we earlier developed for bulk systems to address these challenges in confined polymer formulations. The methodology uses atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to parameterize coarse-grained field-theoretic models of confined fluids, which subsequently enable fast equilibration and the ability to surmount length scales inaccessible to particle-based simulation methods. We first use this workflow to study a model system consisting of a confined Gaussian fluid to validate and determine best practices for the coarse-graining methodology. Next, we demonstrate this methodology by applying it to an alkyl acrylic diblock copolymer and dodecane solution confined between α -iron oxide surfaces and examining the effect of diblock concentration and length on the structure of the adsorbed film. This approach has the potential to expedite the study of complex fluids in confined environments, bridging atomistic detail and mesoscale modeling with broad implications for materials design.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates are formed via liquid–liquid phase separation of proteins, often together with nucleic acids, typically driven by interactions between low-affinity binding sites. The computational study of such condensates that accounts for both the droplet-scale fluid behavior and the internal structure of the condensate requires coarse-grained models. Recently, patchy particle models, representing proteins as spheres with a repulsive core and directional attractive patches, have emerged as a powerful tool. However, these simulations typically exhibit slow dynamics and often show glass-like rather than fluid condensates as required for the description of many biomolecular condensates, establishing a need for model variants with accelerated dynamics, both to speed up simulations and to better represent fluid biomolecular condensates. Here, we study several modified patchy particle models suited to simulate the formation and dynamics of biomolecular condensates. These variants incorporate flexible patches and weak isotropic attractions between cores. They significantly accelerate the system dynamics while preserving key equilibrium characteristics of the classical patchy particle model, including the phase behavior and the local structure of the condensate. These modifications thereby enable the simulation of larger, more complex systems previously inaccessible due to prohibitive relaxation times and provide a versatile tool for studying condensate dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The accurate characterization of the potential energy surface (PES) is fundamental to understanding molecular structures and chemical reaction mechanisms. Traditional approaches, such as ab initio calculations and empirical force fields, struggle to balance computational efficiency and accuracy, particularly for high-dimensional systems. Machine learning methods have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in addressing chemical problems, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) Inadequate representation of high-energy structures (e.g., transition states) in training data due to their scarcity and inherent complexity, leading to biased PES predictions; and (2) insufficient adaptability of data-driven models to dynamic chemical scenarios, as they rely on static benchmark datasets and lack explicit integration with mechanistic knowledge. This study proposes a Clustering and Local Regression Network (CLRNet), a chemical-principle-guided hierarchical framework for PES construction, which integrates data-driven modeling with quantum mechanical insights. CLRNet employs graph neural networks to extract molecular features, integrating unsupervised clustering of features with local potential energy surface regression. CLRNet has outstanding advantages in accommodating high-energy structures and has achieved a balance between model capacity and computing power. This work not only offers a new approach to PES analysis but also bridges the gap between data-driven modeling and chemical intuition. It has great application prospects in downstream tasks such as transition state energy calculation and PES fitting of catalysis and chemical kinetics in physical chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate theory is an efficient and accurate method for estimating rate coefficients of chemical reactions affected by nuclear quantum effects. The commonly used RPMD treatment of gas-phase bimolecular reactions adopts two dividing surfaces, one at the transition state and another in the reactant asymptote, where the translational partition function is separable from other partition functions and can be readily obtained. With some exceptions, however, this strategy is difficult to implement for processes on surfaces or in solutions, because reactants are often strongly coupled with the extended medium (surface or solvent) and, thus, non-separable. Under such circumstances, the RPMD rate theory with a single dividing surface (SDS) is better suited. However, most of its implementations adopted Cartesian forms of the reaction coordinate, which may not be ideal for describing complex reactions. Here, we present an SDS-based RPMD implementation, which is able to tackle the aforementioned challenges. This approach is demonstrated in four representative reactions, including the gas-phase H + H 2 exchange reaction, gas-phase CH 3 NC isomerization, H recombinative desorption from Pt(111), and NO desorption from Pd(111). This implementation, which is applicable to both uni- and bi-molecular reactions, offers a unified treatment of gas-phase and surface reaction rate calculations on the same footing.},

The essential four-index electron repulsion integral is contracted with a set of stochastic orbitals on the basis of the RI technique and the orbital energy difference in the denominators is decoupled by the Laplace transform. These lead to a significant scaling reduction from O ( N 5 ) to O ( N 3 ) for oscillator strengths with the number of basis functions, N . The scaling for gradients can also be reduced to O ( N 3 ) but this requires a large number of stochastic orbitals and causes a discernible loss of accuracy. Therefore, we provide an O ( N 4 ) version with better accuracy and smaller prefactor by adopting sRI partially. Such steep computational acceleration of nearly two or one order of magnitude is very attractive for large systems. This work is an extension to our previous implementations of sRI-CC2 ground and excited state energies and shows the feasibility of introducing sRI to CC2 properties beyond energies.},

This requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naïve implementation scales exponentially with system size.

In this study, we investigate the contribution of distal residues to the catalytic activity of human phosphoglucose isomerase (hPGI) using molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic calculations. Six key residues located in the second and third layers around the active site were studied previously through systematic mutagenesis. Variants, including those in the second shell K362A, Q388A, E495Q, and D511N and those in the third shell H100L and H396L, were previously reported to show significant reductions in catalytic turnover and efficiency. Analysis of structural dynamics demonstrates increased flexibility in helices critical for maintaining active site geometry, including helix-17 and helix-18, leading to destabilization of catalytic residues E358, R273, and H389′. In addition, the important interaction between H389′ and E217, essential for the ring-opening step, was disrupted across all variants. Electrostatic perturbations, including altered protonation equilibria and p K a values of catalytic residues, further impede key steps of the catalytic mechanism, such as ligand binding, ring opening, and isomerization. These findings reveal the complex interplay between distal residues, structural dynamics, and electrostatics in regulating hPGI’s catalytic mechanism, providing insights into enzyme function and guiding future enzyme engineering and drug design efforts.},

  abstract     = {Active droplets serve as simple artificial model systems to elucidate the chemical and hydrodynamics-driven interactions between biological organisms. We investigate the pairwise interactions between such micellar solubilization based active droplets, capable of self-generating chemical and hydrodynamic fields. We experimentally demonstrate that the solute Péclet number ( Pe ), characterizing the relative strength of its convective to diffusive transport, plays a crucial role in determining how the chemical and hydrodynamic fields impact their interactions. At low Pe , strong chemo-repulsive interactions dominate, resulting in consistent scattering behavior regardless of the approach symmetry. In contrast, at high Pe , hydrodynamic interactions become dominant, enabling transient contact, synchronized motion, or reduced repulsion. Furthermore, by analyzing droplet–wake interactions across both high and low Pe regimes, we demonstrate that the scattering behavior is invariant to the relative approach orientation and is fundamentally governed by the droplet’s intrinsic chemical polarity, which in turn is set by its Pe number. Our results not only offer robust experimental validation of recent theoretical predictions on the scattering behavior of active droplets but also present a clear rationale for the observed angular deflection and its invariance to the approach angle of droplets. Our findings establish a systematic framework correlating the Pe -dependent intrinsic chemical polarity of droplets to the scattering outcomes in both droplet–droplet and droplet–wake interactions. These mechanistic insights advance our understanding of active droplet interactions and can serve as a basis for modeling and engineering collective behaviors in chemically active systems within the framework of multi-agent interactions, where simple local interaction rules result in emergent collective dynamics.},

  abstract     = {An accurate prediction of dissociative sticking probabilities ( S 0 ) of polyatomic molecules on surfaces has long been a challenging task, because a fully coupled quantum mechanical treatment of numerous degrees of freedom is computationally forbidden. While a quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) approach is much more effective, it often suffers from the leakage of vibrational zero-point energy of the polyatomic molecule, leading to significant and, moreover, initial-state-dependent overestimation of S 0 at low incidence energies. Here, inspired by the most frequently used QCT implementation in gas-phase reactions, we propose applying Gaussian binning (GB) instead of standard histogram binning for both scattered and adsorbed species to calculate S 0 by the weighted population of trajectories. This new recipe, coupled with two different initial sampling conditions, is tested against the fully coupled quantum dynamical method in D 2 O dissociation on a rigid Ni(111) surface. We find direct evidence of zero-point energy leakage, rendering the energy in the O–D vibration of the dissociated OD* adsorbate much smaller than its zero-point energy, while GB largely avoids the influence of this artifact on the reactivity. The corrected QCT reaction probabilities thus yield much better agreement with quantum ones than standard QCT results. Impressively, similar improvements are achieved for D 2 O in both the vibrationally ground state and excited states. This practical QCT method makes it possible to predict reliable quantum-state-resolved S 0 of polyatomic molecules on surfaces well below the barrier height and the associated mode-specificity.},

Achieving this goal is crucial for advancing the practical applications of high-temperature superconducting materials. We discover a family of compounds (hydride double perovskite superconductors with space group Fm 3 ̄ m and chemical formula A 2 MM′H 6 ) to achieves this goal. A machine-learning-accelerated approach is utilized to search for hydride double perovskite superconductors under ambient pressure within an extensive dataset comprising over 106 535 hypothetical compounds. 15 stable hydride double perovskite superconductors are discovered under ambient pressure, with the highest superconducting transition temperature ( T c ) reaching 18.7 K. The structural stability, electronic properties, and superconducting behavior of these materials have been comprehensively analyzed. Phonon dispersion analysis has highlighted the critical role of lattice vibrations in electron–phonon coupling (EPC), where the contribution of H atom vibrations is essential for facilitating electron pairing and the onset of superconductivity. This demonstrates that the machine-learning-accelerated approach is a highly effective method and can be easily extended to other compounds.},

In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall–particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. Our analyses reveal that an enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls can be used as a control parameter for wetting transitions in the dense aggregates of active particles at the wall. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes a uniform, complete wetting state, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting, asymmetric complete wetting, partial wetting with droplet formation, and drying. We compute the contact angle in the PW state as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.},

This study explores shock-induced structural transitions and energy absorption in ZIF-8 and SALEM-2 using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory. Results reveal a phase transition at pressures below 1 GPa, characterized by pore collapse, amorphization, and alterations in electronic and bonding structures. Thermodynamic analyses attribute the transition to enthalpy-driven mechanisms and increased entropy. SALEM-2 exhibits superior shock attenuation, attributed to greater volume reduction and extensive bond breakage, underscoring the role of linker chemistry. The ability of MOFs to absorb shock arises from dramatic volume reductions facilitated by bond bending and the sacrificial breaking of metal-linker coordination bonds, with moderate increases in internal energy compared to dense solids. This work provides molecular-level insights into MOF-based shock attenuation and guides the design of optimized MOFs for enhanced mechanical energy absorption.},

  abstract     = {Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a significant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of chemoresistive sensors—where detection relies on changes in electrical response upon analyte adsorption—the sensor substrate is typically functionalized with chirality-sensitive molecular receptors. In this computational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such as a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between enantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parameterized tight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green’s functions. For a small set of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the nonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the electrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order of tens of nanoamperes. This effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device’s active region are considered (≈1–2 μ A). Moreover, we propose new quantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular sensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property–property correlations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of nonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for future investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.},

It displays metallic behavior, low magnetoresistance, and paramagnetism, as evidenced by electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Hall effect measurements reveal that the carrier type follows a single-band model and is predominantly characterized by hole type. The electronic coefficient, γ e = 3.6 mJ K −2 mol −1 , was derived from low-temperature specific heat. Furthermore, first-principle calculations suggest that the electron states near the Fermi energy are primarily influenced by the Ru and Th states. The electronic band structure exhibits Dirac-like crossings and van Hove singularities at the M and K points, suggestive of potential topological properties.

Available experimental data for the lattice parameters are represented within ±0.05 Å, while molecular simulation predictions show larger deviations. The results allow for the determination of lattice parameters for 10 help gases and 15 large-guest molecule substances (LGMSs), which enables the application to a wide range of hydrate-forming mixtures. In combination with multiparameter EOS for fluid phases, i.e., the IAPWS-95 for water, the proposed vdWP-type model is validated by comparing predicted hydrate formation conditions with experimental data for methylcyclohexane or 2-methylbutane containing mixtures, demonstrating good agreement. The fluid EOS for methylcyclohexane systems with water, carbon dioxide, and methane and 2-methylbutane with water is revised.},

This study investigates the crystal structures and phase behavior of a series of 24 alkylammonium-based PILs (with melting points up to 425 K) using synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction. Of these, 18 were able to be crystallized, and full crystal structures were obtained for 5. Our results reveal that the PILs investigated can be broadly divided into two groups, those with hydrogen-bonded networks dominating and those with a lamellar structure, separated into hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. For both groups, the bonding dominant in the crystalline phase is similar to that of the liquid state. We discuss the challenges in crystallizing PILs and the approaches that can be used, laying the groundwork for further exploration of their structures.},

In this work, we introduce a simplified model of a solvated nanoparticle that consists of localized magnetic domains at its surface to represent groups of paramagnetic ions, forming nanodomains whose effective magnetic dipole moments are at least one order of magnitude greater than the individual ions. We use classical density functional theory to estimate the effective interactions between these localized magnetic nanoparticles (LMNPs) solvated in a diamagnetic solvent. Our findings indicate that, unlike individual ions, magnetic dipole interactions of nanodomains in the LMNP model can indeed compete with the electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydration interactions. Depending on the direction of eMF, the effective interactions between two LMNPs become more attractive or repulsive at relatively short separations on the order of 1 nm or less. This indicates that the interactions driven by an eMF play a critical role in aggregation for nanoparticles with magnetic nanodomains. The effective interactions between LMNPs show oscillatory behaviors that originate from the solvent correlations, which are not affected significantly in the presence of eMFs.},

  abstract     = {The dielectric properties of a series of zwitterionic liquids are thoroughly examined in both the solution and melt states. In dilute solutions, the molar dielectric increment and subsequently derived dipole moment of zwitterionic liquids correlate strongly with the number of linker atoms between the ion pair, following the same trend as previously extensively studied zwitterionic solids. Further analysis indicates that the linker does not adopt a fully extended conformation but is slightly coiled. Despite its high dipole moment, the dielectric relaxation of zwitterionic liquids in the melt state resembles that of ordinary glass-forming dipolar liquids and consists of a primary α -relaxation and a high-frequency “excess wing.” The relaxation strengths of these two processes are proportional to 1/ T and −1/ T , respectively. On the other hand, while the α -peak broadens on the high-frequency side upon a decrease in temperature, no universal trend has been found for the low-frequency dispersion. The unexpectedly high conductivity in zwitterionic liquids appears to stem from the presence of ionic impurities rather than the “polarization current” associated with dipole rotation. Decoupling analysis shows that the dc conduction is not fully slaved to the α -relaxation and exhibits substantially weaker temperature dependence, lending support to the aforementioned argument regarding the origin of dc conductivity. Finally, the glass transition temperature of zwitterionic liquids examined in this work shows a weak negative correlation with their molecular weight, deviating from the general trend observed for ordinary dipolar liquids, whereas the fragility index increases with increasing relative polarization volume.},

  abstract     = {Fullerenes encapsulating nitrogen atoms, also called endohedral fullerenes, are spin active. The magnetic moment is localized on the nitrogen atom, but the spin dynamics is shown to be governed by the coupling to the fullerene orbitals, allowing for an indirect spin manipulation by acting on the fullerene and its environment. Here, for multiple ground-state endohedral fullerenes, the inter-fullerene spin–spin interactions are investigated with a focus on the effects of stable geometric arrangements (linear, triangular, and more complex arrangements). Performing full ab initio simulations, we aim at an understanding of how the interactions between spins depend on both the structural features of the fullerene molecules and their molecular orbitals. Our computational study explores the role of spin exchange interactions, potential spin frustration, and how these phenomena can be manipulated to achieve desired magnetic behaviors; thus, it can guide the design of new materials for spintronic devices, quantum information processing, and other applications that require control over spin–spin interactions is decisive.},

With detailed analysis of the KER-θ correlation maps, momentum correlation maps, Newton diagrams, and kinetic energy release (KER) spectra for each fragmentation channel, the results show that all three channels are primarily generated by sequential fragmentation processes. In the neutral H loss channel, hydrogen emission occurs in the first step of sequential fragmentation. For two deprotonation channels, each channel has two pathways, corresponding to proton emission in the first or second step of sequential fragmentation, respectively. These results reveal the mechanisms and dynamics of hydrogen/proton emission and ring-breaking reactions in the three-body fragmentation processes of heterocyclic molecules.},

The dynamics and kinetics of this reaction are studied using the quasi-classical trajectory method and microcanonical optimized multidimensional tunneling corrected-canonical variational transition state theory on a newly developed potential energy surface (PES). The PES is fitted by the fundamental invariant-neural network approach, giving a total root mean square error of 0.066 kcal mol −1 . Dynamics calculations show that exciting the low-frequency umbrella mode of NH 3 + promotes the reactivity remarkably more than exciting the high-frequency stretching modes over the collision energy studied. This special dynamical behavior can be rationalized by the enlarged attractive interaction between reactants, which increases the chance of H 2 being captured by NH 3 + , along with the enhancement of direct rebound mechanisms at low collision energies and stripping mechanisms at high collision energies. In addition, the calculated rate coefficients of the reaction agree reasonably well with the available experimental results.},

  abstract     = {High entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles (NPs), finite-size nanostructures that combine multiple elements coexistent with a nanoscale surface, have emerged as a new material due to their non-trivial properties. While there exist several studies addressing the behavior of body-centered cubic (BCC) HEAs, there is still missing information devoted to predicting the structural and morphological configurations that HEA NPs can adopt. In this work, using molecular dynamic simulations and Monte Carlo algorithms, HfNbTaZr HEA NPs of 2 and 3 nm were studied. For all simulated scenarios, HEA NPs showed a significant precipitation of elements while maintaining their BCC crystalline structure. The presence of the surface drives the diffusion of some elements, leading to the formation of a core-shell structure with an HfZr rich shell and a near equiatomic HEA core. A topological change in the typical short-range order of HfNbTaZr is induced by the surface, since the formation of HfZr bands is replaced by the formation of an HfZr rich surface. It was observed that BCC HEA NPs have an irregular shear stress, a consequence of the chemical complexity, which at the same time induces surface reconstruction favoring the formation of highly faceted nanoparticles. The {111} planes were identified as the most probable surface facets on the NP, mostly due to the enthalpy of mixing and cohesive energy. Finally, a phase separation of the Hf and Zr surfaces is observed, which is also in accordance with the positive enthalpy of mixing that favors the repulsion between both elements.},

A neural network-derived potential energy surface with a 4.2 meV root-mean-square error was employed to ensure high-fidelity simulations. Density functional theory calculations identified a reduced static dissociation barrier of 1.08 eV for the SAA system, compared to the 1.22 and 1.25 eV values for pristine Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces, respectively. Despite this energetic advantage, the six-dimensional quantum dynamical analysis revealed that the dissociation probabilities for H 2 in the vibrational ground ( v = 0) state exceeded those on Ag(111) only at kinetic energies below 1.33 eV. This reactivity suppression at elevated energies was attributed to the site-specific modulation induced by the Au dopant, which selectively enhanced reactivities at the top-Au, hcp, and fcc sites while inhibiting those at bridge and top-Ag sites. Furthermore, the vibrational excitation, rotational alignment, and rotational excitation effects were found to closely resemble those observed for H 2 dissociation on pristine Ag(111), demonstrating that the fundamental dynamical characteristics of the reaction remain qualitatively preserved despite SAA modification. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between local electronic structure modification and global reaction dynamics in SAA systems.},

Here, we combine computational and experimental techniques to investigate the impact of ion–ion and ion–water interactions in aqueous sodium fluoride solutions and determine whether an ion pairing peak exists in the dielectric spectra. We use our recently developed direct electric field approach to perform frequency-resolved configurational analysis of ion pairing. From this analysis, we identify a Debye peak associated with the reorientation of ion pairs. Our broadband microwave microfluidic spectra of sodium fluoride solutions further support the existence of a low-frequency Debye relaxation due to ion pairs in the solution.},

Transitions to the electronic states with the P 3 / 2 2 asymptote are of only marginal importance. The internal energies of stabilized dimer ions are found around the P 1 / 2 2 dissociation limit, with a non-negligible number of the ions formed in rotationally metastable states. The calculations performed for A r + ( P 1 / 2 2 ) are compared with selected data obtained for A r + ( P 3 / 2 2 ) ⁠ . Qualitatively, the same behavior is seen for both types of ions.

Associated potential energy surfaces of the triply degenerate ground electronic manifold of the adamantane radical cation, subject to T 2 ⊗ ( e + t 2 ) Jahn–Teller (JT) effect, are established via extensive electronic structure calculations. Subsequently, the nuclear motions on these JT coupled electronic sheets are investigated via wave packet propagations. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Larger JT stabilization energy due to T 2 ⊗ t 2 distortions, compared to T 2 ⊗ e distortions, illustrates the dominating role of t 2 modes in the symmetry breaking of the initial T d nuclear configuration of adamantane radical cation. The JT effect is also found to play a central role on the highly diffuse, broad, and complex first photoelectron band of Ada. In particular, t 2 symmetric ν 25 mode (C–C stretching + C–H bending motion) is found to be the origin of the high energy satellite peaks, as well as dominates the vibrational progression underlying the whole band. While the vibrational assignments of some of the major vibronic peaks agree with the available results, renewed assignments are suggested for the remaining peaks.},

OPA optimization and color accuracy are crucial for frequency domain experiments, where OPA color is scanned. Such performance is highly sensitive to environmental fluctuations, so motor positions must be regularly optimized and tuned. Despite the widespread availability of motorized OPAs, this frequent maintenance can make frequency domain spectroscopy a cumbersome and time-consuming process. We have found that fully automated approaches to tuning are invaluable when scanning OPAs. Here, we report four algorithms that accurately and robustly tune a variety of ultrafast laser systems—picosecond and femtosecond, homebuilt and commercial OPAs. Using case studies from previously published work, we illustrate how these four algorithms can be combined to tune all motors of an ultrafast laser system. These algorithms are available through open-source software and can be applied to existing instruments, significantly lowering the threshold for executing frequency domain spectroscopy.},

US results are sensitive to the choice and discretization of the RC along which bias is applied as well as simulation timescales. Here, we address these issues through a redefined US scheme based on recent statistical insights into sampling equilibration and convergence of RCs. This scheme is implemented in an algorithm—AutoSIM—that automates US runs based on a non-equilibrated molecular dynamics trajectory initiated in the native state basin. AutoSIM can generate FES sections associated with functional conformational transitions in biomolecules independent of a priori information on RCs or even the end state. Furthermore, AutoSIM allows for combining statistics from multiple US runs to systematically assess and improve the quality of FES projections along a given RC. We validate AutoSIM by comparing FES projections for alanine dipeptide and ubiquitin along the top principal components with those obtained from simulations without an external bias. Finally, we apply AutoSIM to capture the energetics for large-scale conformational transitions of HIV-1 protease between the open and closed forms of the enzyme.},

  abstract     = {Path integral methods, such as the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI), are widely used in general-purpose and highly accurate numerical benchmark simulations of open quantum systems, particularly in regimes inaccessible to perturbative methods. Nevertheless, the applicability of the QUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the exponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of the quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects. This exponential “wall” becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting fluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical efficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the QUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent non-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing environment. In particular, we consider a sharply defined cutoff of the memory time, path filtering, and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional coefficients as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly applied numerical techniques, such as path filtering, cannot be straightforwardly transferred to the two-bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian limits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cutoff can be accurately handled with the mask assisted coarse graining approach. Our findings demonstrate that if system coupling operators to different baths do not commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments may be misleading. In particular, the quasi-Markovian nature of a pure dephasing bath is lost once there simultaneously exists another non-commuting source of fluctuations.},

When the vibrational sublevels of the CT are in resonance with the zero-phonon line of the excited state, they can borrow a significant part of the dipole strength, thus producing a mixed configuration with splitting and shifting of the excited state transitions. Comparing the ctR lineshapes with explicit exciton–vibrational structure and with nonperturbative absorption spectra, we have found that ctR theory reproduces (at least qualitatively) the main features of the vibronic picture emerging from resonant exciton–vibrational mixing. On the contrary, these resonant phenomena cannot be explained by the modified Redfield theory, where the off-diagonal phonon-induced modulations of the exciton transitions are treated in a simplified way. On the other hand, we reveal shortcomings of the ctR approaches that are working in a pure exciton basis, where the exciton-CT mixing is supposed to be uniform (i.e., not dependent on nuclear coordinates). As a result, the degree of exciton-CT mixing is typically overestimated in the ctR model, thus leading to the appearance of spectral components with the intensities and energies deviating from the exact (nonperturbative) solution.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the interplay between electronic screening inside a metal and screening by a polar molecular solvent, focusing on their impact on the charge induced by an ion and the solvent structure at the interface. To that end, we consider atomistically resolved electrodes within the Thomas–Fermi model of screening and describe the molecular solvent either explicitly via classical molecular dynamics or implicitly using molecular density functional theory (MDFT). In particular, we examine the effect of screening by tuning the Thomas–Fermi screening length l TF , the ion charge by considering Na + and Cl − , and the solvent nature by studying water and acetonitrile. Consistent with our previous findings without solvent, l TF significantly affects the charge distribution inside the metal. However, l TF has no significant impact on the interfacial solvent structure, suggesting that its effect on the charge distribution induced inside the metal by the ion is essentially due to how the metal responds to the (same) external charge distribution, including the solvent, even though the coupling between both sides of the interface may play a secondary role. Furthermore, MDFT accurately reproduces fine details of the interfacial solvent structure around the ion at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. These results highlight the relevance of MDFT as a powerful tool to model electrochemical systems at the molecular level.},

  abstract     = {The development of quantitative methods for characterizing molecular chirality can provide an important tool for studying chirality-induced phenomena in molecular systems. Significant progress has been made in recent years toward understanding the chirality of molecular normal vibrational modes, mostly focusing on vibrations of helical molecular structures. In the present study, we examine the applicability of two methodologies previously used for helical structures for the quantification of the chirality of molecular normal modes across a range of small, not necessarily helical, molecules. The first approach involves the application of the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to each normal mode by associating the mode with a structure formed by imposing the corresponding motion relative to a common origin. The second approach assigns to each normal mode a pseudoscalar defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms. In particular, using the CCM also as a measure of the chirality of the underlying molecular structure, we establish the existence of a correlation between the chirality of molecular normal modes and that of the underlying molecular structure. Furthermore, we find that normal modes associated with different frequency ranges of the molecular vibrational spectrum exhibit distinct handedness behavior.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel application of the Transition Matrix Monte Carlo (TMMC) algorithm to compute the relative free energies of polymers in explicit solvents as a function of a selected order parameter. Our method leverages a pre-generated library of polymer conformations in vacuum, coupled with explicit solvent environments using the Growth Expanded Ensemble (GEE) framework. The integration of TMMC within GEE addresses sampling challenges by introducing bias in Monte Carlo simulations while enabling the computation of unbiased probability distributions and relative free energies. A key advantage of our approach is its flexibility—the polymer conformation library can be generated using any sampling technique, including Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations, in implicit or explicit solvents and at different temperatures. The method is adaptable to any collective variable (CV) and can be extended to compute free energies as a function of multiple CVs. Furthermore, its parallelizable structure makes it highly scalable on multi-core central processing units and graphics processing unit architectures. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to a fully flexible polymer model consisting of Lennard-Jones particles connected via a harmonic potential, immersed in an explicit solvent of Lennard-Jones particles. The relative free energies are computed as a function of the radius of gyration. Results for three different solvents, obtained by varying the polymer–solvent interaction strength, reveal that the polymer preferentially adopts an extended conformation in good solvents and a collapsed conformation in poor solvents, consistent with theoretical expectations. Our method provides a computationally efficient and scalable framework for free energy calculations, with broad applications in polymer physics and macromolecular thermodynamics.},

These occur when the electron occupies the unoccupied π ⋆ and σ ⋆ orbitals of the base. This article focuses on two main aspects. The first involves an alternative approach to implementing complex absorbing potential in the Fock matrix using parametric equations of motion. The second, and most significant aspect, is the accurate identification of the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) and the higher energy resonance states, which is achieved through the charge stabilization method, in conjunction with parametric equations of motion. This approach allows for the identification of multiple resonance states using a much larger basis set, which was not possible previously due to the many states with the same symmetry between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the true LUMO. This method not only overcomes this challenge but also offers significant advantages in computational time. The identified states can be used for post-Hartree–Fock calculations, and in this article, the second-order dilated electron propagator method is applied to account for relaxation and correlation effects.},

  abstract     = {Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, R g , and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B 22 . However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here, we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. While B 22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on R g and B 22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.},

In this way, we have derived the exact equation of state for a small system with a surface. It relates the pressure to the numbers of bulk and surface degrees of freedom, their mean energies, and other parameters. The mean potential energy of the surface was found to be higher than the mean kinetic energy per degree of freedom. The obtained equation of state accounts for the influence of this excessive surface energy. In the thermodynamic limit, it transfers to the usual equation of state for an ideal gas.},

  abstract     = {The diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of fluids serve as the primary metrics for characterizing mass, momentum, and heat transfer. However, these transport properties exhibit significant deviations from those of bulk fluids when confined in nanoscale environments. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the transport properties of nanoconfined fluids (NCFs) with a focus on simple confinement systems and water by integrating findings from previous and recent researches. This discussion begins with an examination of methodologies for assessing transport properties through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, with a focus on the equilibrium MD method. Subsequently, we delineate the unique characteristics of NCFs’ transport properties, which include anisotropy, size dependence, and layered distribution. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough analysis of the fundamental physical mechanisms that dominate these transport properties. We highlight that the diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity are significantly affected by these rationales such as the displacement, friction, and collision frequency of molecular motions within the NCFs. We then identify various factors that may directly or indirectly influence these mechanisms and related transport properties, including surface electrostatic property, surface wettability, surface roughness, surface flexibility, and fluid composition. In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive summary and perspective on the research emphasis and challenges associated with the transport properties of NCFs. This review not only facilitates the comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms governing the transport properties of NCFs but also holds promise for informing a range of industrial applications, including seawater desalination, gas separation, and chip cooling.},

Amplification of the cotunneling assisted current and power occurs over a narrower bias range, reflecting a trade-off where a higher flux is compensated by a reduced work window. We further report that the cotunneling-enhanced thermodynamic variables, particularly within specific bias windows, depend on the interplay between cotunneling amplitudes, electron transition rates, and interaction energy. Both attractive and repulsive electronic interactions can enhance cotunneling, but this effect is sensitive to the energy balance between states and the tunneling strength asymmetries.},

The dynamics of the process can be described by the IFTP theory in very good agreement with the LD simulations for all values of confinement in the channel. The theory reveals that for channels with a size comparable to or less than the end-to-end distance of the unconfined chain, in which the blob theory works, the scaling form of the translocation time depends on both the chain contour length and the channel width. Conversely, for a very narrow channel, the translocation time only depends on the chain contour length and is similar to that of a rod due to the absence of spatial chain fluctuations.},

These mechanisms correspond to effective torques that align or anti-align a particle’s orientation with its velocity, as observed in active granular systems. In the context of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS)—a non-equilibrium coexistence between a dense clustered phase and a dilute homogeneous phase—both self- and anti-self-alignment are found to suppress clustering. In particular, increasing self-alignment strength first leads to flocking within the dense cluster and eventually to the emergence of a homogeneous flocking phase. In contrast, anti-self-alignment induces a freezing phenomenon, progressively reducing particle speed until MIPS is suppressed and a homogeneous phase is recovered. These results are supported by scaling arguments and are amenable to experimental verification in high-density active granular systems exhibiting self- or anti-self-alignment.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a self-repairing material for cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) based on a microcapsule system to solve the problem of insulation degradation caused by water tree aging. The microcapsules are extrinsic self-healing systems, which not only have good stability and high repair rates but also have little impact on the performance of the matrix. Plasma-modified tri-layer shell-nucleated microcapsules/XLPE composites were prepared by room temperature air radio frequency plasma discharge, and their insulation properties were tested to analyze the effect of microcapsule doping content on material properties. The accelerated water tree aging experiment was carried out by water needle electrode method, and the repair capability of microcapsules to water tree damage area before and after plasma modification was analyzed. The results show that compared with pure XLPE samples, when the content of microcapsules is 1.0 wt. %, the AC breakdown field strength and DC conductivity of the composites change little, and the dielectric properties of composites are improved. When the water tree breaks the microcapsule wall, due to the capillary effect, repair solution and catalyst flow into the water tree branch damage channel and react with water to repair the water tree damage. The average water tree length of plasma-modified microcapsules/XLPE specimens after water tree aging was reduced by 24.86% compared to non-plasma-modified microcapsules/XLPE specimens. The outermost layer of plasma modified microcapsules is nano-SiO 2 modified by plasma hydroxylation, which can graft more silane coupling agents, so that the distribution of microcapsules in XLPE matrix is more uniform, the agglomeration of microcapsules is reduced, and the water tree repair ability of composite materials is improved.},

  abstract     = {The connection between molecular vibrations and spin polarization in charge transport through molecular junctions is currently a topic of high interest, with important consequences for a variety of phenomena, such as chirality-induced spin selectivity. In this work, we follow this theme by exploring the relationship between vibronic dynamics and the corresponding spin polarization of the nonequilibrium charge current in a molecular junction. We employ the hierarchical equations of motion approach, which, since it is numerically exact and treats the vibrational degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, extends previous analyses of similar models that relied on approximate transport methods. We find significant spin polarization of the charge current in the off-resonant, low-voltage regime, where the vibrations must be treated quantum mechanically. Furthermore, we are able to connect the spin polarization in the charge transport to a corresponding polarization of the vibrational dynamics, which manifests itself in the vibrational angular momentum and excitation. Our analysis covers multiple molecule–lead couplings, temperatures, orbital energies, and spin–orbit couplings, demonstrating that the vibrationally assisted spin polarization is robust across a broad range of parameters.},

In this work, we employ machine-learned neural network potentials trained on ab initio data to conduct large-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations at the RPBE-D3 level. Our results reveal that NQEs increase the surface tension, albeit marginally, shift the critical point to higher temperatures, and alter the orientational preferences of interfacial water molecules. This study provides the first direct quantification of the effect of NQEs on the surface tension of water. These findings highlight the fundamental role of quantum fluctuations in interfacial physics and underscore the necessity of including NQEs in accurate simulations of aqueous systems.},

  abstract     = {Organic-based magnetic materials have attracted significant attention in recent years, particularly in the domain of spintronics. However, in order to realize viable spintronic-based technologies, high temperature coupling is a necessity. Understanding the physical exchange mechanisms that underpin the observed ordering in magnetic materials provides an effective tool to engage with this issue. In this report, a decomposition methodology is adopted to analyze the coupling in two metal phthalocyanine systems—cobalt (II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) and copper (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc)—and to extract the contributing exchange interactions. A dimeric molecular geometry is used to approximate the periodic chain structure, and the exchange interactions between the two magnetic centers are examined. The results of the study offer a more comprehensive insight into the physical mechanism underlying the observed exchange interactions and reveal the relationship between the electronic configuration and emergent magnetic properties of each respective system. More specifically, the coupling in CoPc is shown to be attributable to a dominant kinetic exchange interaction arising from the single occupation of a d z 2 -derived a 1 g molecular orbital, while in CuPc, an indirect spin polarization mechanism is found to underpin the weak exchange interaction. This study, therefore, demonstrates the validity of applying the decomposition methodology to a dimeric system and highlights its importance as a powerful tool to investigate the physical nature of magnetic interactions in molecular magnets.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for synthesizing ammonia (NH 3 ) is a promising strategy for sustainable NH 3 production. Identifying appropriate NRR electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity. Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to investigate the performance of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) supported on δ 5 -borophene (δ 5 -BP) for NRR. Through four-step screening process and full reaction pathway calculations, we evaluated 23 homonuclear catalysts (MM@δ 5 -BP) and 21 stable heteronuclear candidates (MM∗@δ 5 -BP). The TiTi@δ 5 -BP and ZrZr@δ 5 -BP exhibited superior NRR catalytic activity with a limiting potential (U L ) of −0.60 V among MM@δ 5 -BP, while NbHf@δ 5 -BP showed the lowest U L (−0.48 V) in MM∗@δ 5 -BP. We also investigated the influence of applied potential on the NRR through grand canonical DFT calculations. By constructing feature dataset and applying XGBoost Regressor (XGBR) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) algorithms with SHAP analysis, we achieved good agreement between ML-predicted U L and DFT-calculated U L . Our finding highlights the bonding interaction between two nitrogen atoms during N 2 adsorption as the most critical feature. This work integrates DFT and ML approach to gain deep insights into complex dual-site activation and NRR mechanisms and to pave the way for accelerating the rational design of efficient DACs.},

The escape time required on average to hop to a neighboring chain affects the design of new polymers and determines the relative importance of other system parameters such as polymer rigidity or polymer molecular weight. We provide a general expression for the escape rate, which lends itself to a more simplified and transparent expression in the limit of vanishing reorganization energy. The escape rate appears to be more sensitive to disorder and temperature than the intra-chain transport. We show how the parameters required for the evaluation of this rate can be derived from a combination of classical and quantum chemical models already used to characterize semiconducting polymers, and we provide an illustration based on two realistic polymeric materials.},

Here, we develop machine learning potentials at near density functional theory accuracy based on datasets generated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, enabling us to explore the structure and charge transfer at air–water interfaces. Our simulations reveal a non-uniform charge distribution along the interfacial normal direction: water molecules in the outermost layer in direct contact with the air tend to be positively charged, while those in a thin sub-interface layer are negatively charged. We further demonstrate that this uneven charge distribution arises from the donor–acceptor asymmetry of H-bonds among interfacial water molecules. These findings provide a detailed atomic-level insight into the charge transfer behaviors of water at interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Downscaling of metal interconnects has become a bottleneck in the back-end-of-line processing of CMOS semiconductor devices. The conductivity of the commonly used Cu metal drastically reduces at nanoscale, limiting its use as the devices shrink, as the metal starts forming non-conductive islands. This has led to the requirement for new interconnect metals such as Co and Ru, as they have a much higher tendency to form conductive films with horizontal growth at nanoscale. Understanding how the morphology of interconnects depends on the metals’ atomistic properties and their interactions at diffusion barrier layers is necessary to continue the rapid development of interconnects. In this study, we have used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) relaxations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and neural network machine learning potentials (MLPs) to investigate how the morphology of Cu, Co, and Ru differs on TaN substrates. We investigate the binding of single metal atoms and four atom clusters to obtain the metals’ substrate binding energy and metal–metal interaction energies. The morphology of the metals was then investigated by 15 ps molecular dynamics simulations with DFT and 5 ns with MLPs using larger metal structures that can display 2D and 3D morphologies. Comparing the binding energies with the obtained morphology allows us to demonstrate how the balance of metal–substrate and metal–metal interactions determines the morphology, while the MLP simulations allow longer timescale processes to be included. These insights help in the development of morphology predictors, allowing a rapid method for screening new interconnect materials with targeted horizontal growth on substrates used in semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Despite being of utmost relevance in central fields ranging from biophysics to self-assembly processes in materials science, we still lack a precise comprehensive definition of hydrophobicity to replace the usual, merely qualitative descriptions that rely on water repellency or a lack of affinity. Building on recent findings regarding the structure and interactions of bulk water, we use a recently introduced water structural indicator to reach the following quantitative molecular elucidation: “hydrophobicity is the inability of a system to pay for the lacking hydrogen bonds (HBs) it produces in its hydration layer at least the same cost that this kind of defect imposes on bulk water, a defect interaction threshold whose magnitude is significantly lower than the HB energy.” We will demonstrate that such a defect interaction threshold not only marks the transition to hydrophobicity that occurs at a contact angle of θ = 90° in surfaces with different polarity degrees (allowing for an absolute scale) but also accurately signals the onset of drying regimes in nanoconfined aqueous systems. This is relevant from a practical perspective, as the possibility of being (locally) wet or dry becomes crucial in many fields. Specifically, our approach allows for assessing local hydrophobicity with unprecedented resolution (suitable for regions of different sizes, even at the single-atom level), particularly for self-assembly processes in biology and materials science, which often entail patterned regions combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic sites, thus posing challenges (and opportunities) for rational design efforts.},

Therefore, it is crucial to develop straightforward and low-energy synthesis methods for ruthenium-based alloy catalysts. In this study, we present a microwave synthesis approach for rapidly fabricating RuCo alloy supported on copper foam. Microwave heating, with its unique heating method, enables the efficient and rapid synthesis of alloy particles in a very short period of time. The synthesized RuCo/Cu 2 O/CF demonstrates excellent bifunctional HER and OER activities in alkaline media. Compared to commercial precious metal catalysts, RuCo/Cu 2 O/CF exhibits lower overpotentials and improved electrocatalytic kinetics, with an overpotential of 43 mV (10 mA cm −2 ) for HER and a Tafel slope of 37.6 mV dec −1 , and an overpotential of 253 mV (10 mA cm −2 ) for OER, also with a Tafel slope of 189.1 mV dec −1 . Moreover, the synthesized RuCo/Cu 2 O/CF shows remarkable stability. Theoretical calculations indicate that after alloying with Ru, both the water dissociation energy barrier and hydrogen adsorption energy on the Co surface are optimized. In a symmetric dual-electrode system, the RuCo/Cu 2 O/CF electrolyzer requires only 1.56 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , outperforming commercial precious metal catalysts while exhibiting excellent long-term stability. These findings reveal a simple, low-energy preparation method for alloy catalysts, providing new insights into the development of water-splitting catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Absorption of light by a substance does not change its magnetic properties. However, if redox reactions occur on the surface of a material when irradiated with light and a current loop is formed, it turns into a magnet. This study reports a method for producing a new type of material—photo-magnets, which are capable of changing their magnetic properties when exposed to light. The simplest photo-magnet is a bimetallic plate made of two dissimilar metals, one part of which is coated with a semiconductor material—zinc oxide—and it is immersed in a solution of hydrogen peroxide. When exposed to light, holes and electrons are formed in the semiconductor, which take part in redox reactions during the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Since a current loop is formed in this case, the photo-magnet becomes a source of a magnetic field. In addition, any loop with current in a non-uniform magnetic field is affected by a force whose nature is determined by the action of the Lorentz force on moving charges. Therefore, on the basis of photo-magnets, it is possible to create motors that will move in a non-uniform magnetic field when irradiated with light.},

These different amorphous structures behave similarly with heating but remain spectrally different until crystallization, consistent with previous findings that hyperquenched glassy water and amorphous solid water are structurally different. This work demonstrates the utility of studies with experimental systems capable of directly comparing ice formation methods. To determine the presence of crystalline ice, the shape of the 3- μ m feature is most useful, while the intensity of the 6- μ m feature is a reliable indicator of amorphous ice and liquid-like behavior of the ice with heating.

  abstract     = {Understanding the high-temperature properties of materials with (anti-)fluorite structures is crucial for their application in nuclear reactors. In this study, we employ machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to investigate the high-temperature thermal properties of thorium dioxide, which has a fluorite structure, and lithium oxide, which has an anti-fluorite structure. Our results show that MLMD simulations effectively reproduce the reported thermal properties of these materials. A central focus of this work is the analysis of specific heat anomalies in these materials at high temperatures, commonly referred to as Bredig, pre-melting, or λ -transitions. We demonstrate that a local order parameter, analogous to those used to describe liquid–liquid transitions in supercooled water and liquid silica, can effectively characterize these specific heat anomalies. The local order parameter identifies two distinct types of defective structures: lattice defect-like and liquid-like local structures. Above the transition temperature, liquid-like local structures predominate and the sub-lattice character of mobile atoms disappears.},

  abstract     = {1-propanol/water mixtures are structurally and dynamically heterogeneous over several length and time scales. Their phase diagram comprises liquid droplet phases of 1-propanol or water, as well as crystalline phases (hexagonal ice and different hydrates). We study the effect of hard confinement on the phase state and dynamics of 1-propanol/water mixtures. The mixtures were confined within self-ordered nanoporous alumina templates having long cylindrical nanopores. We show that the remote hard interface influences the phase state and the molecular dynamics. In the propanol-rich regime, where water exists in droplets, water could be supercooled below the homogeneous nucleation temperature and well within “no man’s land” where water crystallizes rapidly. Within the water-rich regime, the remote interface breaks the 1-propanol chain-like hydrogen bonded assemblies as reflected in the suppression of the Debye process. Calculation of the Hamaker constants provided quantitative information on distant intermolecular forces and their role in the structure and dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The principle of critical point universality is thought to govern critical phenomena in systems as disparate as ferromagnets, pure fluids, and binary liquid mixtures exhibiting a miscibility gap ending in a critical point of solution. The goal of any critical point theory is to determine how a given thermophysical property of interest depends upon the reduced temperature, t = ( T − T c ) / T c ⁠ , where T is the thermostat temperature, and T c is the critical temperature. Two theoretical formulations are available. The Landau mean field theory ignores fluctuations in composition in the critical region, while the mathematically more complicated Ising model takes fluctuations into account. The Landau and Ising theories agree, however, that certain of the thermophysical properties, ω , diverge in the critical region according to ω ∝ t − x as t → 0, where the value of x depends upon the property. In the Landau model, x assumes rational values, whereas in the Ising model, x assumes irrational values. In the majority of cases, the Ising model has been in better agreement with the experiment. Binary liquid mixtures with immiscibility gaps ending in a critical point of solution can be used as solvents in order to determine the critical effect in the extent, ξ , of a chemical reaction. With ξ c serving as the critical value of ξ , some consensus exists in support of ξ − ξ c ∝ t x ⁠ , as t → 0. Otherwise, speculation prevails as to the value of x . Consistent with the universality principle, we find that the critical effect in the extent of the reaction, such as the shape of the liquid–liquid coexistence curve in the critical region, has its basis in the failure of phase stability. Pursuing this analogy, we note that the exponent governing the temperature dependence of ξ is x = 1/2 in the Landau model, whereas it is x = 0.3265 in the Ising model. Thermodynamic theory is exploited to distinguish the Landau/Ising limiting law, ξ − ξ c ∝ t x ⁠ , which prevails in the critical region, from the van’t Hoff background, which applies at temperatures removed from critical. The resulting equations are converted to dimensionless form and compared with data from homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical equilibria involving binary liquid mixtures as solvents.},

  abstract     = {The properties of amorphous solid water at and near the calorimetric glass transition temperature, T g , of 136 K have been debated for years. One hypothesis is that water turns into a “true” liquid at T g (i.e., it becomes ergodic) and exhibits all the characteristics of an ergodic liquid, including translational diffusion. A competing hypothesis is that only rotational motion becomes active at T g , while the “real” glass transition in water is at a considerably higher temperature. To address this dispute, we have investigated the diffusive mixing in nanoscale water films, with thicknesses up to ∼100 nm, using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The experiments used films that were composed of at least 90% H 2 O with D 2 O making up the balance and were conducted under conditions where H/D exchange was essentially eliminated. Because the IR spectra of multilayer D 2 O films (e.g., thicknesses of ∼3–6 nm) embedded within thick H 2 O films are distinct from the spectrum of isolated D 2 O molecules within H 2 O, the diffusive mixing of (initially) isotopically layered water films could be followed as a function of annealing time and temperature. The results show that water films with total thicknesses ranging from ∼20 to 100 nm diffusively mixed prior to crystallization for temperatures between 120 and 144 K. The translational diffusion had an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of 40.8 ± 3.5 kJ/mol, which indicates that water at and near T g is a strong liquid. The measured diffusion coefficient at 136 K is 6.25 ± 1.4 × 10 −21 m 2 /s.},

  abstract     = {Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green–Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer–Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition, where the GK method is no longer applicable. In addition, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.},

  abstract     = {The molecular dynamics of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are highly complex, characterized by pronounced spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for tailoring transport properties such as diffusion, viscosity, and ionic conductivity. Molecular diffusion in DESs stems from transient caging and translation jumps, necessitating an understanding of how molecular structure regulates these processes. This study explores the influence of alkyl chain length on the dynamical behavior of alkylamide–lithium perchlorate based DESs using quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics simulations. QENS results show that, despite its shorter chain length and lighter mass, acetamide exhibited the lowest mobility among the alkylamides, including propanamide (PRM) and butyramide (BUT). Detailed analysis of distinct degrees of freedom including the long-range jump diffusion of the alkylamide center of mass and localized diffusion, a clear trend emerges. The jump dynamics typically slowed with increasing chain length, essentially due to their differences in molecular size, mass, and also enhanced complexation in longer alkyl chain molecules. However, localized dynamics, dictated by the interplay between molecular flexibility and caging effects, exhibit an unusual trend, with PRM emerging as the fastest due to its optimal balance of molecular flexibility and reduced caging effects. In contrast, although BUT exhibited greater flexibility due its longer chain, its localized dynamics were slower, owing to stronger caging effects. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between alkyl chain length and the dynamical properties of DESs, demonstrating the relevance of molecular structure in governing the dynamics and transport properties of these systems.},

This mole-fraction dependence was once claimed to be anomalous and attributed to nuclear quantum correlations of protons and deuterons when it was discovered experimentally. The present study demonstrates that the experimental data of the mole-fraction dependence of the cross sections, as well as the Raman scattering activity spectra in the stretch region, are well reproduced by the theoretical calculations according to the quantum/classical mixed approach in which the nuclear quantum correlations are not taken into account. This suggests that the anomalous dependence does not serve as evidence of the nuclear quantum correlations. The present study provides a more plausible interpretation that the OH- and OD-stretch cross sections depend on the mole fraction because of the inter- and intra-molecular vibrational couplings.},

Non-uniformly charged nanochannels have been considered to achieve the desired goal. This choice is expected to facilitate the regulation of the ionic field. The negative–positive–negative (NPN) and positive–negative–positive (PNP) surface-charged nanochannels are considered to be the non-uniform charged configurations. By altering the pH of the right-side reservoir (pH right ) in comparison to the corresponding uniformly charged designs having positively charged walls and negatively charged walls, it was possible to compare the corresponding ionic and fluidic characteristics. By altering the pH right value, it becomes evident that the nanoslit’s unevenly charged surface can substantially affect the potential field and its gradient locally. The competition between cationic and anionic currents enables a highly cationic selective PNP nanoslit for the extremely acidic right reservoir. In contrast, the NPN nanoslit allows for greater anionic selectivity in the highly basic right reservoir. In addition, the PNP case achieves maximum electrical conductance, enabling a larger maximum generated power in the lower pH right range. Whereas, for the highly basic solution, electrical conductance as well as generated power were found to be higher for the NPN configuration. Remarkably, power density in the PNP and NPN configurations exceeds the commercial threshold limit in highly acidic and basic pH right values, respectively. We showed that the non-uniformly charged designs have higher average flow velocity or mass flow rate for almost every pH right (except close to pH right 4 and 10) under the salinity gradient. As such, information from this work can contribute to the development of more efficient nanofluidic devices that control flow and generate greater power density and flow rates.},

In particular, low-dimensional model systems have shed light on the possible formation mechanisms of vibrational polaritons and their dynamics in microcavities subject to the possible influence of external excitations. In the present contribution, the polaritonic states obtained by placing a Hénon–Heiles (HH) 2D model inside a microcavity and their dynamics are theoretically investigated. Oblique coordinates, as introduced by Zuñiga and co-workers [J. Phys. B: At., Mol. Opt. 50 , 025101 (2017)], allow the accurate determination of polaritonic eigenstates, assuming the lowest fundamental mode of the HH model to be in resonance with a single cavity mode. Very different regimes for the polariton dynamics are found depending on whether the two vibrational modes of the model are themselves involved in a Fermi resonance or not. In the former case, the flow between photonic and vibrational modes appears mostly regular under molecular times scales and exhibits maximum efficiency near coupling strengths corresponding to avoided crossings in the polaritonic eigenstates. When the two HH modes are in the 1:2 ratio, the dynamics is much less regular but promotes intramolecular vibrational redistribution, although with a greater sensitivity toward initial conditions.},

They include the (i) alterations of the overall potential, and thus, the force field, (ii) electron transfer from the cluster to the fullerene forming ionic units, and (iii) hybridization from the admixture of free Na 20 occupied levels with experimentally known super-atom molecular orbital (SAMO) type empty levels of C 240 accessible in the jellium-density functional theory model. These modifications influence the photoionization dynamics of the endofullerene. For the high energy ionization of Na 20 -type levels, a significant overall enhancement of the cross section is noted from additional ionizing force that C 240 offers. More remarkably, the photoexcited plasmons, both the giant plasmon and the higher energy plasmon, in C 240 decay in parts through Na 20 ionization continuum via the resonant intercluster Coulombic decay (ICD) process. These lead to dramatic enhancements in the ionization of individual Na 20 -type levels, resulting in enhancements in the cluster’s total ionization yield. Based on hybridization, this enhancement incorporates a coherent mixing of the ICD and SAMO-induced Auger-decay amplitude, in which the ICD contribution is dominant.},

  abstract     = {We experimentally investigate the photodetachment of sulfur hexafluoride anions ( S F 6 − ) in 400 nm 35 fs laser fields using a home-built mass-selective anion source combined with electron velocity map imaging (VMI). The electron kinetic energy and the photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) are obtained from the VMI measurements. In addition to the single-photon detachment, two-photon above-threshold detachment (ATD), which is induced by strong laser fields with peak intensity higher than > 1.0 × 1 0 13 W / c m 2 ⁠ , is clearly identified for the first time. By fitting the measured PADs, the partial-wave distributions of the detached electron are achieved, resulting in the coefficiency of the s-orbital (p-orbital) of ∼ 68.1 % ( ∼ 31.9 % ) in the mixed s–p molecular orbital of S F 6 − ⁠ , which is in good agreement with the ab initio calculations. The ponderomotive shift in the ATD channel is investigated and different behaviors for the strong-field photodetachment comparing with that in weak laser fields are discussed. The present study adds to our knowledge on the photodeachment of the S F 6 − anion and sheds some light on the dynamics of the interaction of polyatomic molecular anions with ultrafast strong laser fields.},

  abstract     = {Cyclo[12]carbon (C 12 ) is the smallest recently synthesized carbon ring molecule that conforms to Hückel anti-aromaticity. Unraveling the electronic structure and aromaticity differences between C 12 and its isoelectronic analogs (B 4 C 4 N 4 , B 6 N 6 ) is essential for elucidating the impact of C-atom bridging and the physicochemical properties of novel ring systems. Herein, robust first-principle computational methods (including static density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations) are employed to investigate the electronic populations, bonding features, and kinetic behavior of different electron types. The molecular aromaticity is also examined by using various analytical indicators, such as anisotropy of induced current density, ZZ component of isochemical shielding surfaces, electron localization function-π, and Fermi holes. It is revealed that C 12 and B 4 C 4 N 4 exhibit pronounced anti-aromatic properties, while B 6 N 6 is non-aromatic. The distinct in-plane and out-of-plane π-orbital features and differences in electronic delocalization capacity are fundamental to their anti-aromatic and non-aromatic nature, contrasting with classical aromatic molecules such as C 18 . This work provides valuable references for understanding the electronic structures of novel carbon ring molecules and their isoelectronic analogs that lack aromaticity, which can aid in comprehending the physicochemical properties of classic main-group elements and advance the design and synthesis of new ring molecules.},

HTI compounds are known for their high quantum yield, thermal bistability, and rapid photoisomerization, making them promising candidates for applications in molecular motors, optical materials, and photocatalysis. Our analysis, supported by first-principles simulations, reveals how the conjugation of heteroatoms within the π -system affects the core-level chemical shifts and ionization intensities in XPS, while NEXAFS probes the influence of substituents on virtual molecular orbitals and energy transitions. In particular, the comparison between different functionalized HTIs allowed us to evaluate the effect of electronic relaxation following core-level photoionization and photo-excitation. These results provide a detailed understanding of the influence of functionalization on the electron distribution of HTI compounds, providing a robust foundation for the study and control of ultrafast charge transfer and photoswitching mechanisms in these molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {The electrical transport characteristics of nano-barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ) were systematically investigated under high pressures up to 35.64 GPa using AC impedance spectroscopy measurements and first-principles calculations. Impedance spectroscopy measurements provide insights into the conduction mechanism involving pressure-induced transformation from mixed ionic–electronic to pure electronic cyclic conduction. Through first-principles calculations, we have elucidated the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the emergence of transformation from mixed ionic–electronic to pure electronic cyclic conduction. This phenomenon arises from variations in C-axis compressibility and phase transition from tetragonal to cubic phase, resulting in abrupt changes in electron density around oxygen atoms. These discontinuous changes are accompanied by alterations in initial resistance ( R ), relaxation frequency ( F ), and dielectric constant. By applying pressure, it becomes possible to effectively control the lattice spacing, thereby manipulating the charge density of O II ions and facilitating a seamless transition between mixed ionic–electronic and pure electronic conduction pathways. Pressure modulation also regulates the migration behavior of O 2− ions, leading to an enhancement in the conductivity of nano-BaTiO 3 materials. This study contributes to advancing our understanding of the transformation from mixed ionic–electronic to pure electronic cyclic conduction occurring within solid electrolytes.},

The relationship was derived by convoluting expressions relating E HB and Δ ω HB to the covalent bond distance of the hydrogen bond donor (Δ r HB ), while ensuring balanced treatment of the exchange repulsion. We relied on reduced parts of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of six hydrogen bonded dimers, namely, NH 3 –NH 3 , H 2 O–H 2 O, HF–HF, H 2 O–NH 3 , HF–H 2 O, and HF–NH 3 derived from ab initio electronic structure calculations to fit the parameters of the model and validated its performance for extended parts of the PESs that include non-linear hydrogen bonds. The developed model suggests a novel relationship of a strength of 4.5 kcal/mol per 100 cm −1 redshift in the covalent donor (D–H) vibrational frequency, while non-linear effects become important for redshifts > 200 cm −1 . The single descriptor (Δ ω HB ), which is measurable either experimentally via gas-phase spectroscopy or theoretically via electronic structure calculations, was able to predict the experimental or calculated hydrogen bond energies of typical hydrogen bonded dimers using the developed relationship.},

We induce strong coupling with confined light modes [optical cavities or localized surface plasmons (LSPs)] to reduce the triplet state population, thereby mitigating photo-oxidation. Utilizing the hierarchical-equations-of-motion approach to capture non-Markovian and non-perturbative effects, we analyze both cavity–chromophore and LSP–chromophore systems. Our analysis reveals that the optimal antioxidation performance depends on the competition between cavity–chromophore coupling and cavity–bath (dissipation) interaction. Importantly, in the strong cavity–chromophore coupling regime, increasing cavity dissipation can enhance antioxidation through quantum coherence-induced population transfer. Conversely, in the weak cavity–chromophore coupling regime, increasing cavity dissipation can counterintuitively reduce the antioxidation capability due to a quantum Zeno-like effect. Furthermore, in the LSP–chromophore system, engineering the LSP structure, particularly the LSP dissipation rate, can similarly be used to optimize the antioxidation effect. These findings, complemented by analytical results for finding optimal system parameters, provide practical guidelines for designing photostable organic materials with enhanced performance in various optoelectronic applications.},

Conversely, the non-resonant contribution primarily influences the real part of the SSP SFVS signal. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of SFVS data interpretation by elucidating the underlying mechanisms governing the bending vibration at liquid interfaces.

In the present study, we examine particle dynamics in biconical cavities, wherein particle motion is influenced by either an entropy potential well, as in a cavity composed of first expanding and then narrowing cones, or an entropy potential barrier, as in a cavity made up of first narrowing and then expanding identical cones. Both types of cavities are relevant to multiple technological and biological problems, where examples of such structures can be found at the micro- and nanoscales. We derive analytical expressions for the Laplace transforms of the distributions for the first-passage, direct-transit, and looping times in such structures. We find that not only the average values but also the distributions of the first-passage times in both cavities are indeed identical. However, the direct-transit and looping time distributions are drastically different. In particular, the mean direct-transit time for the expanding–narrowing cavity (entropy potential well) approaches a constant value with the increasing ratio of the cavity’s largest radius to the radius of its opening. In contrast, it goes to infinity in the case of the narrowing–expanding cavity (entropy potential barrier).},

We consider both quantum and classical limits for the reaction coordinate that modulates the coupling and describe the adiabaticity parameter for charge-transfer induced by coupling fluctuations, analogous to the Landau–Zener parameter used in the case of transfer induced by energy-level fluctuations. Our purpose is to explore the magnitudes of the charge-transfer rate for realistic parameter values, the transition from non-adiabatic to adiabatic transfer, and the behavior of the rate as a function of the donor–acceptor energy gap and temperature. We find that the coupling-fluctuation mechanism can lead to fast rates. Furthermore, the energy-gap and temperature dependencies can differ from Marcus theory describing polaron transfer. Therefore, these dependencies may be used to identify experimentally whether charge transfer is induced by coupling fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through the stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that the eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [Yin et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122 , e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the unitary, hence modifying the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of the resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers and to the restart paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Brownian information engine (BIE) harnesses the energy from a fluctuating environment by utilizing the associated information change in the presence of a single heat bath. The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential and requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. BIE utilizes the overall information (surprise) gained during the feedback cycle for the energy output. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential energy and hence the information that is essential for a non-zero work output. The net (available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback controller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore the effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have multiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the available information and, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback protocol. For monostable trapping, a concave shape in the confining potential results in a higher work output than a convex one. We also find that hills and valleys in the confining potential may lead to multiple good operating conditions. An appropriate shape modulation can create a heater–refrigerator transition and its re-entrance due to non-trivial changes in information loss during the relaxation process.},

  abstract     = {Spectroscopic signatures of exciton transport and vibronic coupling in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) are studied for an oligothiophene chain as a minimal model for intra-chain exciton migration in poly-(3-hexylthiophene). Generalizing our previous approach [Brey et al. , Faraday Discuss. 237 , 148 (2022)], a first-principles parameterized Frenkel Hamiltonian is combined with a collective high-frequency lattice mode and a set of ring-torsional modes whose thermal fluctuations drive exciton migration. A wavefunction-based quantum–classical treatment is employed, where quantum Langevin friction via the Kostin equation acts on the collective lattice mode, while the torsional modes evolve under a classical Langevin equation at finite temperature. Single wavefunction realizations exhibit largely adiabatic, diffusive exciton motion across the 20-site lattice under periodic boundary conditions. 2DES spectra are computed using the equation-of-motion phase matching approach (EOM-PMA) within a wavefunction setting. In line with experimental observations, a pronounced vibronic fine structure is observed, which is modulated by spectral diffusion due to fluctuation-induced changes in the exciton extension and localization.},

  abstract     = {Orbital relaxation of the core region is a primary source of error in the computation of core ionization and core excitation energies. Recently, Transition-Potential Coupled Cluster (TP-CC) methods have been used to explicitly treat orbital relaxation using non-variational molecular orbitals determined by reoccupation of orbitals optimized for a fractional core occupation. The amount of fractional occupation is governed by parameter λ , and recommended values for accurate TP-CCSD and XTP-CCSD computations of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine K edges were previously determined. Herein, we explore the performance of several density functionals for generating the fractionally occupied orbitals used in TP-CCSD. These functionals include HF, BP86, BH&HLYP, B3LYP, M06-2X, and ω B97m-V. The fractionally occupied orbitals computed across the various functionals were subsequently employed as the initial orbitals for our TP-CCSD calculations of organic K-edge x-ray absorption and photoelectron spectra. Regardless of the functional used to generate the fractionally occupied orbitals, the TP-CCSD calculations yield accurate and comparable core ionization energies, core excitation energies, and oscillator strengths.},

We employ the resulting term in a fully self-consistent manner together with self-consistent GW (scGW), resulting in the following vertex-corrected scGW schemes: scGWSOX, scGWSOSEX, scGW2SOSEX, and scG3W2 theories. We show that for the vertex evaluation, the reduction of scaling by tensor hypercontraction has two limiting execution regimes. We used the resulting code to perform the largest (by the number of orbitals) fully self-consistent calculations with the SOX term. We demonstrate that our procedure allows for a reliable evaluation of even small energy differences. Utilizing a broken-symmetry approach, we explore the influence of the SOX term on the effective magnetic exchange couplings. We show that the treatment of SOX has a significant impact on the obtained values of the effective exchange constants, which we explain through a self-energy dependence on an effective dielectric constant. We confirm this explanation by analyzing natural orbitals and local changes in charge transfer, quantifying superexchange. Our analysis explains the structure of weak electron correlation responsible for the modulation of superexchange in both molecules and solids. Finally, for solids, we evaluate Néel temperatures utilizing the high-temperature expansion and compare the results obtained with experimental measurements. In addition, we prove a lack of Φ-derivability of the considered theories.},

This broadens the scope of the information-theoretic approach (ITA) and introduces new types of ITA descriptors, notably the joint, conditional, and mutual ITA quantities. To elucidate the interaction between electron correlation and localization, we compute and analyze a suite of ITA descriptors for one-electron and pair electrons, including the Shannon entropy, Fisher information, and Rényi entropy, for neutral atoms ranging from helium (He) to argon (Ar). The results demonstrate how the pair-density ITA enhances the interpretation of electronic correlations and its connection to spatial localization.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. However, existing methods often struggle to enforce key physical constraints, such as trace conservation, when modeling reduced density matrices (RDMs). While physics-informed neural networks (PINN) aim to address these challenges, they frequently fail to achieve full physical consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the s u ( n ) Lie algebra to represent RDMs as a combination of an identity matrix and n 2 − 1 Hermitian, traceless, and orthogonal basis operators, where n is the system’s dimension. By learning only the coefficients associated with the operators, our framework inherently ensures exact trace conservation, as the traceless nature of the operators restricts the trace contribution solely to the identity matrix. This eliminates the need for explicit trace-preserving penalty terms in the loss function, simplifying optimization and improving learning efficiency. We validate our approach on two benchmark quantum systems: the spin-boson model and the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex. By comparing the performance of four neural network architectures—purely data-driven physics-uninformed neural networks (PUNN), s u ( n ) Lie algebra-based PUNN ( ⁠ s u ( n ) -PUNN), traditional PINN, and s u ( n ) Lie algebra-based PINN ( ⁠ s u ( n ) -PINN)—we highlight the limitations of conventional methods and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in learning quantum dissipative dynamics.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that a molecular dynamics simulation involving a single tryptophan in liquid water displays asymmetric information transfer between specific collective variables, such as solute and solvent coordinates. Analyzing a discrete Markov-state and Langevin dynamics on a 2D free energy surface, we show that the same kind of asymmetries can emerge even in extremely simple systems undergoing equilibrium and time-reversible dynamics. We use these model systems to rationalize the unidirectional information transfer in the molecular system in terms of asymmetries in the underlying free energy landscape and/or relaxation dynamics of the relevant coordinates. Finally, we propose a computational experiment that allows one to decide if an asymmetric information transfer between two variables corresponds to a genuine causal link.},

By providing a more extensive symmetry-adapted encoding (SAE) than previous work, we are able to simulate molecules larger than those previously reported that have been studied using methods developed for quantum annealers and without using an active space. We calculated the potential energy surfaces of H 2 , LiH, He 2 , H 2 O, O 2 , N 2 , Li 2 , F 2 , CO, BH 3 , NH 3 , and CH 4 , with the largest molecule in the STO-6G basis set requiring 16 qubits with our SAE, and compared them with full configuration interaction results. The application of SAE to the XBK method provides an exponential reduction in the size of the Hilbert space and scales well with the size of the problem. It does not introduce significant additional errors for even or large values of a key variational parameter that determines the number of ancilla qubits used in the XBK method’s Hamiltonian embedding, or for certain molecules such as He 2 and H 2 O. We provide an explanation for this behavior and a recommendation on the usage of our method. In addition, we briefly discuss the potential of extracting electronic excited states from our method.},

The performance of the methodology in reproducing the VCD spectral features is tested out on a variety of molecules, viz. sugars, polypeptides, and proteins using different density functionals with large basis sets. Regardless of the spectral regions, the vibrational peak positions and VCD intensities derived from the current methodology agree well with the full calculation results for these systems.

  abstract     = {Photoemission measurements in the gas phase at low pressure have enabled the exploration of the intricate relationship between electronic and structural properties at the single-molecule level. Experimental data collected from isolated molecules, free from interactions with other species, have provided an ideal testing ground for developing ab initio simulations capable of interpreting and predicting photoemission spectra. In particular, accurate computational methods for determining atom- and site-specific core ionization binding energies (BEs) facilitate experimental data interpretation, enabling the assignment of contributions from non-equivalent atoms of the same species, even when spectral features remain unresolved due to molecular structure. In this context, we have developed, extensively tested, and made widely available a computational protocol based on plane wave/pseudopotential density functional theory (PW-DFT) within a ΔSCF framework to predict x-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) of isolated molecules. Moreover, we have preliminarily tested and demonstrated the applicability of the same method to large molecular aggregates and thin molecular films deposited on inorganic substrates. The protocol has been assessed using a representative set of semilocal and hybrid density functionals with increasing fractions of Hartree–Fock exact exchange (EXX), including PBE, B3LYP (20% EXX), HSE (range-separated with 25% EXX at short range), and BH&HLYP (50% EXX). As a benchmark, we have also employed the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method with single and double excitations. Our protocol has been validated across a diverse range of molecular classes—including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic compounds; drugs; and biomolecules—demonstrating high accuracy and robustness, even when using semilocal DFT. In addition, valence photoemission measurements complement core photoemission by providing insights into delocalized and π -conjugated molecular orbitals. These measurements are particularly useful for studying chemical modifications in large molecules mediated by non-covalent interactions.

  abstract     = {The calculations of rate coefficients for the interpretation of molecular spectra are a recognized computationally expensive task. This is particularly true for media like comets, where the dominant species (CO, CO 2 , and H 2 O) have relatively high masses. Currently, no clear methodology exists to treat the collisional excitation of heavy species at low temperatures, thus limiting the number of collisional studies on such species. We present here a promising statistical approach to determine collisional rate coefficients of heavy systems as an alternative to fully quantum calculations when heavy projectiles such as CO are considered. This is illustrated through the determination of the first rate coefficients for the collisional excitation of CS induced by CO of cometary interest. The CS–CO rate coefficients were computed up to 30 K, and the accuracy of the data was assessed by comparison with rate coefficients computed using the fully quantum time-independent close-coupling approach restricted to the minimal partial wave J = 0. The excellent agreement between the two sets of data demonstrates that the proposed method can be both fast and reliable to study the collisional excitation of molecules induced by CO at low temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from, e.g., depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid–colloid interactions and colloid–polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.},

  abstract     = {Branching architecture characterizes numerous systems, ranging from synthetic (hyper)branched polymers and biomolecules such as lignin, amylopectin, and nucleic acids to tracheal and neuronal networks. Its ubiquity reflects the many favorable properties that arise because of it. For instance, branched macromolecules are spatially compact and have a high surface functionality, which impacts their phase characteristics and self-assembly behavior, among others. The relationship between branching and physical properties has been studied by mapping macromolecules to mathematical trees whose architecture can be characterized using topological indices. These indices, however, do not allow for a comparison of macromolecules that map to trees of different sizes, be it due to different mapping procedures or differences in their molecular weight. To alleviate this, we introduce a novel normalization of topological indices using estimates of their probability density functions. We construct a phase space using two normalized topological indices, which enables a robust discrimination between different architectures of branched macromolecules. We demonstrate the necessity of such a phase space on two practical applications, one being ribonucleic acid molecules with various branching topologies and the other different methods of coarse-graining branched macromolecules. Our approach can be applied to any type of branched molecule and extended as needed to other topological indices, making it useful across a wide range of fields where branched molecules play an important role, including polymer physics, green chemistry, bioengineering, biotechnology, and medicine.},

  abstract     = {Twisted multilayer graphene (TMG) capped with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibits distinctive electronic phenomena under a vertical electric field. However, the dielectric constant alone is insufficient to comprehensively characterize the dielectric properties of low-dimensional materials, posing challenges for accurately measuring and controlling their field response. To address this, we develop a site-specific polarizability decomposition approach based on first-principles calculations, enabling the separation of intra- and interlayer polarizabilities in TMG@hBN. This method is applied to 2580 constructed configurations of TMG flakes with and without hBN encapsulation. Our findings reveal that intralayer polarizability dominates the overall magnitude, while the interlayer component governs its variation with twist angle. hBN encapsulation enhances interlayer polarizability while reducing its twist-angle dependence. For both TMG and TMG@hBN, the inner graphene layers exhibit negligible γ , which quantifies the layer-specific interlayer charge transfer response to an external field, while significant γ values emerge in the outermost graphene layers ( γ Gra ) and hBN ( γ BN ). Interestingly, γ Gra and γ BN exhibit opposite signs in non-equivalent layers, and γ Gra reverses between pristine TMG and TMG@hBN. Compared to TMG, γ Gra in TMG@hBN is suppressed, with variations strongly dependent on thickness, twist angle, and stacking patterns, particularly when nitrogen atoms align over phenyl ring centers. In addition to the well-known Bernal-stacked structure, notable changes in interlayer polarizability and γ Gra are also observed in slightly misaligned (AA) N -stacked structures with the exceptional twist angle ( θ p ). This scalable method enables layer-resolved analysis of intra- and interlayer contributions, offering new insights for tuning electric field responses and optimizing graphene-based optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Lithium fluoride is a critical component for stabilizing lithium metal anodes and high-voltage cathodes toward the next-generation high-energy-density lithium batteries. A recent modeling study reported the formation of wurtzite LiF below ∼550 K (Hu et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327–1333), in contrast to the experimental observation of rock salt LiF under ambient conditions. To address this discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics simulations with a refined machine-learned force field (MLFF) and demonstrate the nucleation and crystallization of rock salt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below ∼800 K. The rock salt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles. Complementary density functional theory calculations show that dispersion interactions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability of rock salt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE functional. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of virial stresses, alongside energies and forces, in the training of MLFFs is crucial for capturing phase nucleation and crystallization of rock salt LiF under the isothermal–isobaric ensemble. These findings underscore the critical role of dispersion interactions in atomistic simulations of battery materials, where such effects are often non-negligible, and highlight the necessity of incorporating virial stresses during the training of MLFFs to enable accurate modeling of solid-state systems.},

In this study, the atomic structures of PE and H 2 are modeled using molecular dynamics simulations and grand canonical Monte Carlo methods. This research investigates the free volume distribution in PE and the mechanisms of hydrogen dissolution and diffusion under different temperature and pressure conditions. Solubility and diffusion coefficients were calculated from adsorption isotherms and mean squared displacement curves, respectively. The results show that solubility, diffusion, and permeability coefficients of H 2 in PE increase with temperature but decrease with pressure. Higher temperature increases molecular chain movement, generating more free volume, while higher pressure compresses the molecular chains, reducing free volume. Hydrogen density maps indicate that H 2 dissolves mainly in the free volume of PE. The diffusion mechanism follows an “oscillating + hopping” model, as shown in the H 2 trajectory graphs. This study provides a microscopic understanding of hydrogen permeation in polymers, offering valuable insights for optimizing and ensuring the safe use of liner materials in type IV hydrogen storage tanks.},

  abstract     = {Controlling thermal transport at the nanoscale through phonon engineering remains a significant challenge in thermal management and nanodevice design. Molecular materials present a promising pathway for thermal control owing to their structural flexibility and dynamic behavior encompassing both intra- and intermolecular motions. However, the influence of these dynamics on thermal transport remains poorly understood. This study focuses on intramolecular rotation as a representative motion within molecular materials. These rotations are characterized by low-frequency spectra but fall outside the classification of standard normal modes. Through theoretical calculations, we assessed the thermal conductivity of self-assembled molecular multilayers, investigating the role of hindered and free rotations within these layers in influencing thermal transport. Our findings reveal that intramolecular rotation has minimal impact on thermal transport, even as rotational modes shift from cooperative hindered rotation to nearly free rotation through thermal activation. In contrast, intermolecular dynamics—particularly interlayer motions—play a dominant role in determining thermal conductivity. These motions drive the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport through thermal activation. These findings highlight intermolecular dynamics as the primary modes for thermal control, while interactions between intramolecular dynamics and thermal conduction pathways remain weak.},

In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H 2 O and CO 2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water and predict the CO 2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift in the uptake at low partial pressures. The manifestation of this braided chain in the lattice model points to the potential emergence of a shift from cooperative capture to that of a phase transition.

  abstract     = {Microscopic segregation and molecular heterogeneities in complex liquids are the result of the interplay between different intermolecular forces, all of which contribute to the energy landscape of the system. A consequence of the intricate energy landscape is the nontrivial effect on the solvation dynamics. Here, the impact of molecular heterogeneities on the solvation dynamics is studied using infrared spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, this study focuses on the dynamical effect of nanoscopic heterogeneities present in deep eutectic solvents (DESs) composed of lauric acid (LA) and N-methylacetamide (NMA). To this end, a molecular probe containing a carbon triple bond is used as an infrared reporter. The results show that the vibrational probe is likely to be located in the NMA polar domains. Furthermore, the probe solvation dynamics derived from the 2DIR spectra presents a slowdown of its timescale with increasing LA concentration in the DES. Kubo modeling of the probe solvation dynamics shows a correlation between the amplitude of its long time component and the presence of molecular heterogeneities in the sample. Semiclassical modeling of the vibrational line shape of the triple bond stretch demonstrates that the heterogeneities affect the whole solvation dynamics of the system through the amplitudes of the frequency fluctuations. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the experimental results and their interpretation by showing a slowdown of the solvation dynamics when the LA heterogeneities are present. Overall, the study presents a molecular framework to explain the effect of confinement created by nanoscopic LA heterogeneities on the solvation dynamics of the system.},

  abstract     = {Quasicrystals have been observed in a variety of materials ranging from metal alloys to block copolymers. However, their structural and dynamical properties cannot be readily described in terms of conventional solid-state models of liquids and solids. We may expect the dynamics of this specific class of quasicrystalline materials to be more like glass-forming liquids in the sense of exhibiting large fluctuations in the local mobility (“dynamic heterogeneity”) and non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation and diffusion. In this work, we investigate a model dodecagonal quasicrystal material in two dimensions (2D) using molecular dynamics simulations, with a focus on heterogeneous dynamics and non-Arrhenius relaxation and diffusion. As observed in glass-forming liquids and heated crystals, we observe a two-stage relaxation dynamics in the self-intermediate scattering function F s ( k , t ) of our quasicrystal material. It involves a fast β -relaxation and α -relaxation process having a highly temperature dependent relaxation time whose activation energy varies in concert with the extent of string-like collective motion, a phenomenon recognized to occur in glass-forming liquids at low temperatures and crystalline materials at elevated temperatures. After examining the dynamics of our dodecagonal quasicrystalline material in great detail, we conclude that the dynamics of these materials more closely resembles observations on metallic glass-forming liquids than crystalline materials.},

We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.},

  abstract     = {The compositional atomic ordering in metallic glasses was studied by simulation focusing on the medium-range order (MRO). Many metallic alloy liquids and glasses show MRO characterized by the oscillations in the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) beyond the first peak, which decay exponentially with distance. To study the effects of the local chemical order on MRO, we examine the compositionally resolved PDF and its MRO for models of various binary metallic alloy glasses. We show that compositional ordering is limited mostly to the nearest-neighbor atoms and the MRO is largely independent of the compositional order. For some elements that strongly repel each other in the alloy, a second MRO periodicity is observed owing to the distinct correlations among them. These results are discussed in light of the idea that the MRO oscillations in the PDF describe the correlations in the atomic density fluctuations, rather than the detailed local atomic structure.},

  abstract     = {Three novel ortho -locked ( o -locked) green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophores, which are also doubly locked, with a phenyl group at the C(1) of the imidazolinone ring and substituents with varying electronic effects at the C(9) of the benzylidene moiety, have been synthesized. All the chromophores show relatively weak but much red-shifted emissions compared to their methyl counterparts at C(1), as previously reported by us [D. Paul et al. , J. Phys. Chem. B 129 , 692–711 (2025)]. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that the excited state dynamics of the chromophores possess initial rotation of the phenyl, followed by proton transfer and geometry twisting. Fluorescence decays confirm an early time charge transfer from the benzylidene moiety to the electron-withdrawing substituents at C(9). The relaxation processes occur within a time range of hundreds of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds, subject to respective compounds. This study supports our earlier reported findings [D. Paul et al. , J. Phys. Chem. B 129 , 692–711 (2025)] that the electronic effect at C(9) significantly affects the quantum yields of o -locked GFP chromophore analogs. This study also shows that solvent viscosity and temperature play dominant roles in modulating the fluorescence intensities of o -locked GFP chromophores. Furthermore, these compounds display significantly superior nonlinear optical (NLO) properties than their methyl analogs [D. Paul et al. , J. Phys. Chem. B 129 , 692–711 (2025)]. These findings provide valuable insight regarding the correlation between the molecular structures of o -locked GFP chromophores and their spectroscopic nature and pave the way to structurally engineering improved fluorophores. In a nutshell, these chromophores with a phenyl group at C(1), with poor but highly red-shifted emission in solution, showing viscosity dependency on emission intensity, and high NLO properties, can be very useful in bio-imaging.},

Ammonium sulfate aerosols are impacted by anthropogenic sources such as farming and shipping and are understood to be important seeds of cloud nucleation in the atmosphere, affecting climate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy were used in tandem to probe the surface and bulk properties of aqueous ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ⁠ , respectively. Aerosolized solutions of ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ⁠ , some altered with NaOH to modify pH, were introduced via an aerodynamic lens to a velocity map imaging instrument for detection. The results show that as pH and sodium cation concentration increase, sulfate anion and ammonia become more prevalent at the surface, and the aerosol surface appears to become drier. However, most of the aerosol remains aqueous, with ion concentrations insensitive to the addition of NaOH. Density functional theory calculations were also performed to probe the coordination environment at the aerosol surfaces to understand the underlying phenomena. The changes seen on the surface of the aerosol underscore the importance of pH in regulating the structure and chemical properties of atmospherically relevant aerosols.},

  abstract     = {We systematically investigated the ionization and dissociation of SF 6 in strong laser fields. The dependence of ion yield on laser intensity and the kinetic energy distributions and angular distributions of fragment ions were also measured. The observed sequence of fragment ions is consistent with the predictions of strong-field ionization theory. The kinetic energy distributions of the F q + ( q = 1–3) fragment ions are presented. Using a point charge model, we propose that the structure-symmetric dissociation (SSD) explains the origin of the kinetic energy of F q + ions. Furthermore, we identify the relevant channels and the kinetic energies of the F q + fragment ions produced by these channels. These results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The angular distributions of the F q + and S q + ( q = 3, 5) ions are all anisotropic and isotropic, respectively. This is the result of the SSD process of the parent ion. However, the anisotropic component in the angular distribution of S F n + ( n = 1–4), S F n 2 + ( n = 2, 4), and S q + ( q = 1, 2) suggests that the molecular structure has undergone deformation by the presence of the laser field. A comparison of the time-of-flight (TOF) spectra of fragment ions under linearly polarized and circularly polarized laser fields reveals that the SF 6 molecule exhibits negligible dynamic alignment in the laser field, with geometric alignment being the dominant mechanism. Furthermore, the rescattering process plays a significant role in the production of S F n 2 + ( n = 2, 4) ions. The dynamics of the ionization/dissociation mechanism are discussed in the context of the TOF mass spectra, kinetic energies, and angular distributions recorded for SF 6 .},

A 320 pixel MCT camera allows us to achieve high spectral resolution within a large detection window, which can be matched in excitation by scanning coherence times of up to 250 ps. The dynamics of the IR active modes of IPC in the C≡O stretching range are probed in a series of alkanes of different chain lengths and viscosities. 2D-IR maps at short waiting times reveal the detailed anharmonic structure of the modes at play: we determined the cross-anharmonicity between the A 2 ″ and E ′ modes ( δ = −0.8 ± 0.1 cm −1 ), and we are able to differentiate the diagonal anharmonicity of the doubly degenerate mode (Δ E ≃ 18 cm −1 ) from its non-diagonal anharmonicity (Δ EE ≃ 11 cm −1 ). Our analysis of the polarization dependence of the 2D-IR signals strongly confirms an exchange mechanism between the IR-active modes due to Berry pseudo-rotation, which shows very little dependence on solvent viscosity, in contrast to the anisotropy loss. The implications of our findings for the exchange mechanism are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The volatile anesthetic methoxyflurane was investigated in the 2–8 GHz region by chirp-excitation Fourier-transform broadband microwave spectroscopy. The presence of two conformers— gauche – trans (C 1 ) and trans – trans (C s )—each containing two quadrupolar chlorine nuclei and one methyl internal rotor, results in a very dense spectrum with complex rotational hyperfine effects, where contributions from nuclear quadrupole interactions and internal rotation couple to the overall molecular rotation. For the spectrally more complicated C 1 -conformer, additional impulse-excitation cavity measurements were carried out in the region of 10–21 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published code that can handle two quadrupolar nuclei in a non-coplanar orientation with respect to the internal rotor, so we developed our own codes interfacing with Pickett’s SPFIT rovibrational fitting program to allow for a near-experimental accuracy fit of the relatively abundant isotopologues, comprising all isotopologue combinations of the 35 Cl and 37 Cl nuclei. Furthermore, the Hartwig–Herbers’ XIAM-NQ code was later extended to treat a second quadrupolar nucleus, and global fits with this new code XIAM-2NQ were validated against SPFIT results. The relative transition intensities of the two conformers were used to estimate the relative room-temperature population as N ( C s )/ N ( C 1 ) = 0.88 ± 0.30 corresponding to a difference in the Gibbs free energy of −1.4 ± 1.1 kJ/mol. A computational characterization using density functional theory [CAM-B3LYP-D3 (BJ)] complemented the experimental results. This work completes the rotational investigations on the conformational and structural panorama of the most important halogenated inhalational anesthetics, potentially enabling their monitoring through rotational spectroscopic fingerprints.},

The IL plays a key role in the activation of ethylene oxide, where the cation of the IL provides an efficient hydrogen bond to the epoxide moiety, together with a concerted approach of the Br − counterion. The activation step of the proposed mechanism is rationalized on the basis of a second order Fukui response function within the conceptual density functional theory.

We obtained the effective vibrational interaction potentials by integration over the two intramolecular coordinates, and these potentials are found to exhibit a global T-shaped minimum (the C-bonded isomer) with the C atom in CO pointed toward CO 2 and a local T-shaped minimum (the O-bonded isomer) but with the CO monomer flipped by 180°. The rovibrational energy levels and bound states were computed by employing the radial discrete variable representation/angular finite basis representation approach and the Lanczos algorithm. The band origin shifts of infrared spectra in the stretching range of CO are +5.022 and −3.589 cm −1 for the two isomers, which are in accordance with the measured data of +4.970 and −2.982 cm −1 , respectively, and better than the values of +5.3/+3.6 and −0.6/−0.4 cm −1 obtained from previous theoretical studies. In addition, the wavefunctions of the intermolecular ground and lower excited vibrational states distribute around the T-shaped minima, and the obtained intermolecular vibrational frequencies for both isomers performed on the averaged potential energy surfaces are close to the available observed values. The spectroscopic constants fitted from the rovibrational levels exhibit that the CO–CO 2 dimer is a near antisymmetric prolate top. The obtained pure rotational transition energies and the infrared fundamental and combination bands of the CO–CO 2 dimer and the isotopomer 13 CO–CO 2 dimer well reproduce the experimental spectra.},

The interactions are calculated using ab initio quantum chemistry methods, and the dynamics is treated fully quantal, assuming the monofluoride molecule is a rigid rotor. The resulting thermalization and rotational quenching rates are analyzed in light of the distorted-wave Born approximation, yielding an explanation based on the elemental physical properties of the molecule under consideration.

  abstract     = {Transient absorption (TA) is the most widespread method to follow ultrafast dynamics in molecules and materials. The related method of TA anisotropy (TAA) reports on the ultrafast reorientation dynamics of transition dipole moments, reporting on phenomena ranging from electronic dephasing to orientational diffusion. While these are fundamental aspects complementary to TA, TAA is generally less widely used. The main reason is that TAA signals are usually not measured directly but are retrieved from two consecutive TA measurements with parallel ( R ‖ ) and perpendicular ( R ⊥ ) polarization of pump and probe pulses. This means that even minor systematic errors in these measurements lead to drastic changes in the TAA signal. In this work, the authors demonstrate alternating shot-to-shot detection of R ‖ and R ⊥ ⁠ , minimizing systematic errors due to laser fluctuations. The employed broadband detection lets us discuss effects dependent on detection wavelength in the ultrafast anisotropy decay of 2,3-naphthalocyanine, a system previously scrutinized by David Jonas and co-workers. In particular, we compare timescales of population relaxation and decoherence and support the proposals for isotropic type of relaxation in square symmetric molecules.},

  abstract     = {We present a size-invariant (i.e., N 0 ) scaling algorithm for simulating fluorescence spectroscopy in large molecular aggregates. We combine the dyadic adaptive hierarchy of pure states (DadHOPS) equation-of-motion with an operator decomposition scheme and an efficient Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to enable a formally exact, local description of the fluorescence spectrum in large molecular aggregates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ensemble average inverse participation ratio of DadHOPS wave functions reproduces the delocalization extent extracted from fluorescence spectroscopy of J-aggregates with strong vibronic transitions. This work provides a computationally efficient framework for fluorescence simulations, offering a new tool for understanding the optical properties of mesoscale molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {In general, comprehension of any type of complex system depends on the resolution used to examine the phenomena occurring within it. However, identifying a priori , for example, the best time frequencies/scales to study a certain system over time, or the spatial distances at which correlations, symmetries, and fluctuations are most often non-trivial. Here, we describe an unsupervised approach that, starting solely from the data of a system, allows learning the characteristic length scales of the dominant key events/processes and the optimal spatiotemporal resolutions to characterize them. We tested this approach on time series data obtained from the simulation or experimental trajectories of various example many-body complex systems ranging from the atomic to the macroscopic scale and having diverse internal dynamic complexities. Our method automatically analyzes the system data by analyzing correlations at all relevant inter-particle distances and at all possible inter-frame intervals in which their time series can be subdivided, namely, at all space and time resolutions. The optimal spatiotemporal resolution for studying a certain system thus maximizes information extraction and classification from the system’s data, which we prove to be related to the characteristic spatiotemporal length scales of the local/collective physical events dominating it. This approach is broadly applicable and can be used to optimize the study of different types of data (static distributions, time series, or signals). The concept of “optimal resolution” has a general character and provides a robust basis for characterizing any type of system based on its data, as well as to guide data analysis in general.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of a QAOA sequence to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLSs) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin–lattice relaxation time constant T 1 , LLSs have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of our QAOA sequence over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark our QAOA sequence against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe superior performance, especially under noisy conditions. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the applicability of our QAOA sequence beyond two-qubit registers, specifically for polychromatic excitation of delocalized LLS in a six-proton system.},

  abstract     = {Plasmonic nanoparticle effects on nearby molecules can be treated within the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM-NP). Numerically, PCM-NP relies on the Boundary Element Method (BEM), whereby nanoparticle polarization due to external electric fields is given in terms of point charges located on its meshed surface. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT descriptions for molecules can be performed using a real-space grid. However, combining the standard BEM of PCM-NP with a real-space quantum-mechanical treatment for molecules physisorbed on large nanoparticles (beyond ∼1 nm of radius) quickly faces memory bottlenecks for typical high performance computing architectures. In fact, the 3D spatial grid should be taken large enough to fit the entire NP, in order to interpolate the electrostatic potential at its surface. We propose a new BEM (dubbed dummy-surface BEM or ds-BEM, for short) to handle effectively PCM-NP calculations with a real-space grid and implement it in the widespread Octopus code. Our ds-BEM maps the electrostatic BEM problem from the actual physical interface at the nanoparticle surface to a compact surface around the molecule, which can be embedded in the small-sized real-space grid used in gas-phase calculations. To show the accuracy of ds-BEM results, we benchmark it against standard BEM for real-space and real-time nonequilibrium electronic dynamics of a prototypical system (namely, p -nitroaniline close to a small, gold nanoparticle) computed at the level of time-dependent density functional theory. Absorption and Raman spectra obtained from BEM and ds-BEM show remarkable agreement, opening up the extension of PCM-NP to all property simulations accessible via Octopus.},

For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, in both charge- and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.},

The present work extends beyond the Hubbard model that was used previously in a two-electron Shin–Metiu model with continuous electronic density in one dimension. Using new iteration techniques, we managed to solve coupled Kohn–Sham equations that embody nonadiabatic corrections with a nuclear Schrödinger equation. Our results show that the DFA can successfully capture the nonadiabatic effect caused by electron–nuclear correlation as manifested in the correct shift of the critical nuclear position where the proton-coupled electron transfer takes place. The nonadiabatic correction to the Kohn–Sham potential also leads to a shift of orbital energies, which can potentially be useful to study band renormalization induced by electron–phonon interactions in bulk materials.},

  abstract     = {Constructing a free energy surface based on discrete molecular simulation data is a common practice in computational chemistry and biophysics. As a general strategy, histogram-based methods have substantial limitations in producing smooth free energy surfaces from sparse samples. Most histogram-free methods allow for possible smooth global free energy surface mapping but likely lead to significantly compromised local features. This issue is particularly severe when both the global shape and the local free energy transition need to be quantitatively depicted, as often aimed for in general ensemble simulation studies. In this work, we introduce a Gaussian kernel Monte Carlo (GKMC) resampling method to robustly construct a smooth free energy surface from discrete simulation data. In GKMC resampling, the target free energy surface is mapped as the sum of local Gaussian basis functions; the height of each Gaussian basis function is recursively obtained through MC resampling of the simulation data. In this work, the GKMC resampling method is illustrated based on the data from a generalized orthogonal space tempering simulation study of deca-alanine peptide conformational changes in aqueous solution. As revealed in the case study, smooth free energy surfaces that can accurately represent simulated probability distributions could be robustly generated through the GKMC resampling strategy. Because data noise can be effectively removed, local free energy features could be displayed in an informative way. Notably, without impacting the global free energy shape, local free energy smoothness can be conveniently adjusted via the choice of the Gaussian kernel function width. As demonstrated, GKMC resampling is a robust approach for high-quality free energy surface construction.},

In this Communication, the details of the latter mechanism are investigated both theoretically and experimentally by examining how the two osmolytes influence water diffusion as a function of their concentration up to 8M. Addition of both urea and TMAO slow water diffusion, the latter more strongly. Importantly, the associated activation energies, characterized in detail here for the first time, show dramatically different driving forces underlying these behaviors: urea modestly lowers the water diffusion activation energy while TMAO strongly increases it.},

Dimerization proceeds via a single dominant pathway encountering few minima in dilute solutions. However, in presence of lysozyme crowders, the free energy landscape exhibits multiple minima and multiple barriers, providing alternative pathways for dimerization. The minimum free energy pathway indicates that dimerization starts by destabilizing the N-termini of monomers in both the cases. The population of the on-pathway intermediate states in dilute medium reveals the structural modulations in GB1 conformation that eventually lead to a final dimer-like state. The presence of lysozyme crowders stabilizes new intermediates, although no stable dimer is formed. The study highlights modification of dimerization pathway by attractive protein-crowder interactions.},

  abstract     = {A classical coulombic correlation functional in one-loop (1L) and local-density-approximation (LDA) is derived for electrolyte solutions, starting from a first-principles many-body partition function. The 1L–LDA functional captures correlations between electrolyte ions and solvent dipoles, such as screening and solvation, which are ignored by conventional mean-field theories. This 1L–LDA functional introduces two parameters that can be tuned to the experimental dielectric permittivity and activity coefficients in the bulk electrolyte solution. The capabilities of the 1L–LDA functional for the description of metal–electrolyte interfaces are demonstrated by embedding the functional into a combined quantum–classical model. Here, the 1L–LDA functional leads to a more pronounced double-peak structure of the interfacial capacitance with higher peaks and shorter peak-to-peak distance, significantly improving the agreement with experimental data and showing that electrolyte correlation effects exert a vital impact on the capacitive response.},

  abstract     = {Herein, we investigated the photoinduced dynamics of a zinc phthalocyanine N-pyridyl-substituted Sc 3 N@I h -C 80 (ZnPc-C 80 ) donor–acceptor complex and its sulfonyl-substituted derivative ZnPcS-C 80 with static electronic structure calculations and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. We found that despite the similar geometric structures, the introduction of substituents significantly changes their electronic structures and leads to distinct photoinduced dynamics. In particular, in ZnPc-C 80 , the energy of the charge transfer (CT) state from ZnPc to C 80 is lower than that of the local excitation (LE) state of ZnPc, indicating that electrons tend to transfer from ZnPc to C 80 following the LE of ZnPc. In contrast, in ZnPcS-C 80 , the lowest energy CT state corresponding to CT from C 80 to ZnPcS is lower than that of the LE state of ZnPcS, suggesting that the excitation of ZnPcS preferentially induces hole transfer from ZnPcS to C 80 . Moreover, the inclusion of solvent effects is crucial for reordering the energies of the relevant states, highlighting the significant role of the solvent in the photoinduced dynamics. Nonadiabatic dynamics simulations further corroborate these findings: for ZnPc-C 80 , excitation at 633 nm results in energy transfer from ZnPc to C 80 within the first 750 fs, followed by electron transfer, whereas for ZnPcS-C 80 , excitation at 663 nm leads to a concerted process of energy transfer and hole transfer from ZnPcS to C 80 . This work not only elucidates the mechanisms underlying experimental observations but also demonstrates that chemical modifications can modulate the roles of molecular fragments in organic donor–acceptor (D–A) structures, which could be helpful for the design of high-performance organic D–A structures in the future.},

  abstract     = {A series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was conducted to investigate the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation properties of confined fluids in kerogen nanopores. We examined how the longitudinal ( T 1 ) and transverse ( T 2 ) relaxation times vary as a function of pore size, pore shape, the presence of paramagnetic impurities, and Larmor frequency ( ω ). Given the challenges of nanoscale experiments, this approach offers an in-depth analysis of how these petrophysical factors influence the measurements of T 1 and T 2 relaxation times. Water and oil were included in the simulations to assess how fluid type affects the results. The findings show that the presence of kerogen significantly impacts the diffusion of water and oil in organic nanopores compared to bulk. To quantify the influence of pore structure, we systematically analyzed the diffusion and NMR properties of fluids under nanoconfinement in rectangular nanopores of varying sizes. We observed that smaller pore sizes lead to a reduction in the diffusion coefficients. When considering a more complex pore network (kerogen matrix), the values of T 1 and T 2 relaxation times decreased by three and five orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the values obtained for rectangular pores. At a Larmor frequency of 400 MHz, both n-pentane and water in kerogen exhibited longer relaxation times than at lower frequencies. The presence of paramagnetic impurities in the system allowed us to obtain relaxation times in the order of magnitude of the experimental data reported by other authors for hydrocarbons confined in kerogen matrices. This study provides a detailed guide to using MD simulations to investigate the behavior of nanoconfined fluids in kerogen.},

Analysis of the linear IR spectrum and the vibrational lifetimes of the Fermi doublet modes indicates that isotopic substitution strengthens the Fermi resonance condition while simultaneously suppressing population relaxation pathways involving a manifold of experimental dark states. The effects of this decoupling on the intrasystem relaxation of vibrational coherence states are investigated by Fourier analysis of 2DIR cross peaks and comparisons of the intensity of forbidden cross peaks in pump-selective 2DIR experiments. It is found that isotopic substitution also suppresses coherent relaxation pathways, indicating that coherent relaxation rates are governed by the effective coupling to the dark state manifold in a manner similar to population relaxation.},

In overcrowded alkene-based molecular motors, rotary motion is accomplished through consecutive cis–trans photoisomerization reactions and thermal helix inversion steps. To date, a complete understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene motors has not been achieved yet. In this work, we use quantum chemical calculations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to investigate the photoinduced dynamics of a push–pull alkene-based molecular motor in two different solvents: cyclohexane and methanol. We show that, while in both solvents the main photorelaxation pathway of our investigated push–pull motor involves two different excited-state minima, in polar methanol, the photorelaxation dynamics is much faster than in nonpolar cyclohexane because of two main effects: (i) a lowering of the energy barrier between the excited-state minima and (ii) a reduction in the energy gap with the ground state at the largely twisted dark minimum, where the excited-state decay takes place. Both effects can be attributed to solvent-polarity stabilization of the charge-transfer excited state along the photorelaxation pathway. In line with the experimental findings, our simulations also indicate that, in methanol, the accelerated photoinduced dynamics goes along with a faster fluorescence decay and a large reduction in the forward photoisomerization yield of our investigated motor.},

Y 2 @C 82 exhibits a significantly longer electron decay time compared to Sc 2 @C 82 and La 2 @C 82 .

In addition to the reproduction of previous mid-IR jet assignments of the highly concerted hydrogen-bonded O–H stretching transitions, new distinct far-IR observations have been unambiguously attributed to transitions associated with concerted and highly anharmonic large-amplitude hindered OH (OD) torsional motion of (EG) 2 and (EG- d 2 ) 2 , respectively. These observations confirm the formation of a highly S 4 symmetric global intermolecular potential energy minimum in the cryogenic neon environment associated with a very compact intermolecular hydrogen-bonded cyclic structure. In this conformation of (EG) 2 , the two intramolecular hydrogen bonds are rearranged into four new identical strongly cooperative intermolecular hydrogen bonds upon complexation as previously observed in supersonic jets. By means of selective complexation between EG and isotopically enriched H 2 18 O and D 2 O samples, the IR-active intramolecular hydrogen-bonded O–H stretching transitions furthermore are assigned unambiguously for the EG monohydrate. These spectroscopic observations reveal a cyclic cooperatively hydrogen-bonded structure, where the monomeric intramolecular hydrogen bond of EG is disrupted upon microhydration. In this detected conformation of the EG monohydrate, one hydroxy group acts as an intermolecular hydrogen bond donor to the H 2 O subunit and the vicinal hydroxy group as an intermolecular hydrogen bond acceptor to the H 2 O subunit in the cryogenic neon environment. The experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical analysis of the conformational potential energy landscape at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVQZ-F12 level.},

However, multifunctional ITO-based transistors combining memory, logic gates, and artificial synaptic behaviors are rarely reported. Here, we propose a multifunctional five-terminal ITO-based transistor. By introducing a multi-electrode design, the device shows potential in addressing the limitations of traditional one-dimensional/two-dimensional control modes, effectively integrating logic operations and memory functions while simulating brain-like behaviors of artificial synaptic electronic devices. Experimental results demonstrate that multi-electrode cooperative regulation significantly enhances the programmability and dynamic flexibility of the device. A single transistor can perform the logic gate switching of traditional logic gate circuits (logic AND/OR gates), greatly simplifying the circuit structure. This work not only provides new insights into the efficient and low-power design of neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence hardware but also offers innovative references for the application of multi-dimensional regulation devices in complex brain-like function simulations.},

  abstract     = {Classical valence bond (VB) theory has advanced significantly in recent years, evolving into a quantitative tool comparable to molecular orbital-based methods. A key advantage of VB is its high interpretability through Lewis-like resonance structures. However, traditional VB theory faces challenges with symmetric systems, as it often fails to generate symmetric sets of structures, leading to a loss of wavefunction interpretability. In this work, we extend the chemical insight approach and present a method for constructing symmetric VB sets. Rather than relying on conventional symmetry techniques, our method is predominantly based on topological information. It utilizes molecular geometry and connectivity and integrates scoring criteria for atoms, bonds, and structures. This approach enables the classification of VB structures into symmetry-adapted subsets guided by chemical intuition and topological features. We have successfully applied this method to a variety of molecular systems, demonstrating its ability to generate symmetric VB sets even in cases where traditional Rumer rules fail. These advancements contribute meaningfully to the interpretability of VB wavefunctions, marking a significant step forward in the development of VB theory.},

  abstract     = {We consider the single file dynamics of N identical random walkers moving with diffusivity D in one dimension (walkers bounce off each other when attempting to overtake). In addition, we require that the separation between neighboring walkers does not exceed a threshold value Δ and therefore call them “tethered walkers” (they behave as if bounded by strings that fully tighten when reaching the maximum length Δ). For a finite Δ, we study the diffusional relaxation to the equilibrium state and characterize the latter [the long-time relaxation is exponential with a characteristic time that scales as ( N Δ) 2 / D ]. In particular, our approximate approach for the N -particle probability distribution yields the one-particle distribution function of the central and edge particles (the first two positional moments are given as power expansions in Δ / 4 D t ⁠ ). For N = 2, we find an exact solution (both in the continuum and on-lattice case) and use it to test our approximations for one-particle distributions, positional moments, and correlations. For finite Δ and arbitrary N , edge particles move with an effective long-time diffusivity D / N , in sharp contrast with the 1/ln( N )-behavior observed when Δ = ∞ . Finally, we compute the probability distribution of the equilibrium system length and associated entropy. We find that the force required to change this length by a given amount is linear in this quantity; the (entropic) spring constant is 6 k B T /( N Δ 2 ). In this respect, the system behaves as an ideal polymer. The main analytical results are confirmed using Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks—with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics—behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions and the other accounting for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.},

  abstract     = {Quantum algorithms have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of open quantum systems in chemistry. In this work, we demonstrate that a repeated interaction model, which could serve as the foundation for a digital quantum algorithm, can effectively reproduce non-Markovian electron transfer dynamics under four different donor–acceptor parameter regimes and for a donor–bridge–acceptor system. We systematically explore how the model scales for the regimes. Notably, our approach exhibits favorable scaling in the required repeated interaction duration as the electronic coupling, temperature, damping rate, and system size increase. Furthermore, a single Trotter step per repeated interaction leads to an acceptably small error, and high-fidelity initial states can be prepared with a short time evolution. This efficiency highlights the potential of the model for tackling increasingly complex systems. When fault-tolerant quantum hardware becomes available, algorithms based on this model could be extended to incorporate structured baths, additional energy levels, or more intricate coupling schemes, enabling the simulation of real-world open quantum systems that remain beyond the reach of classical computation.},

  abstract     = {Multi-configurational wave-function theory (MC-WFT) that combines the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approach with subsequent state interaction treatment of spin–orbit coupling, abbreviated as CASSCF-SO, plays important roles in the microscopic understanding of single-ion magnets (SIMs) with different central transition metal or lanthanide ions and various coordination environments, but its application to SIMs with complex structures is severely limited due to its highly demanding computational cost. Density-matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a systematic and mathematically rigorous framework to combine low-level mean-field approaches like Hartree–Fock and high-level MC-WFT methods like CASSCF-SO, which is particularly promising for SIMs. As a continuation of our previous work on DMET + CASSCF for 3d SIMs [Ai et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 13 , 10627 (2022)], we extend the methodology by considering dynamic correlation on top of CASSCF using the second-order n -electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2) in the DMET framework, abbreviated as DMET + NEVPT2, and benchmark the accuracy of this approach to molecular magnetic anisotropy in a set of typical transition metal complexes. We found that DMET + NEVPT2 can give results very close to all-electron treatment, and can be systematically improved for higher accuracy by expanding the region treated as the central cluster, while the computational cost is dramatically reduced due to the reduction of the number of orbitals by DMET construction. Our findings suggest that the dynamic correlation treated at the NEVPT2 level, which is important for magnetic anisotropy in typical SIMs, can be well described in the DMET framework, which can facilitate high-accuracy ab initio spin–phonon relaxation study and high-throughput computations.},

In the present work, SSCCs in peptides, including those involving hydrogen bonds, have been computed and analyzed using the new O ( 1 ) method as well.

  abstract     = {The chemistry of iron in oxygen-containing and wet environments plays a central role in corrosion, (electro)catalytic reactions, and several biological processes. These processes hinge on the molecular-level interactions between iron and various oxygen-containing species such as water, molecular oxygen, oxygen radicals, and functional groups such as alcohols or carboxyls. Although the first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) describes these interactions well, DFT is often too slow to simulate the thermodynamics and kinetics of the above-mentioned processes at the necessary time and length scales. Fortunately, second-principles density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) satisfies these traits once properly parameterized for the target systems. Here, we discuss the problems that current DFTB parameterizations have with Fe–O pairwise repulsion, a central contributor to the DFTB performance. We construct an improved Fe–O repulsion by fitting the repulsion to structures relevant for topical research and benchmark it against structures with free and adsorbed Fe interacting with water and other oxygen-containing species. We explore the improved interaction by simulating the dynamics of atomic Fe and FeN 4 -modified graphene in aqueous environments, demonstrating the applicability of the parameterization to catalytically relevant large-scale simulations.},

Exploiting this structure, the higher-order moments are obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the system and bath operators separately, with bath expectation values derived from the derivatives of a generating function. We further apply MKCT to compute the dipole autocorrelation function for the spin-boson model with both linear and quadratic coupling, achieving agreement with the hierarchical equations of motion approach.

While the mean FPT historically served as a summary metric, a far more comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the network is contained within the complete FPT distribution. The relatively uncommon theoretical treatments of the FPT distribution that have been given in the past have been confined to linear systems with zero- and first-order processes. Recently, we presented mathematically exact solutions for the FPT distribution within nonlinear systems involving two-particle collisions, such as A + B → C . Although this research yielded invaluable results, it was based upon the assumption of initial conditions in the form of a Poisson distribution. This somewhat restricts its relevance to real-world biochemical systems, which frequently display intricate behavior and initial conditions that are non-Poisson in nature. Our current study extends prior analyses to accommodate arbitrary initial conditions , thereby expanding the applicability of our theoretical framework and providing a more adaptable tool for capturing the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks.},

  abstract     = {The first passage time (FPT) is a generic measure that quantifies when a random quantity reaches a specific state. We consider the FTP distribution in nonlinear stochastic biochemical networks, where obtaining exact solutions of the distribution is challenging because it requires time-dependent solutions of the chemical master equation (CME). Even simple two-particle collisions lead to strong nonlinearities that hinder obtaining such solutions and, hence, the full FPT distribution. Previous research has either focused on analyzing the mean FPT, which provides limited information about a system, or has considered time-consuming stochastic simulations that do not clearly expose causal relationships between parameters and dynamics. This paper presents the first exact solution of the full FPT distribution in a broad class of chemical reaction networks involving A + B → C type of second-order reactions. We obtained this distribution by deriving a closed-form, time-dependent solution of the system’s underlying CME. Approximate analytical solutions are unable to match the exact results of our method. Examples indicate that the approximations can deviate from the exact FPT distribution by more than 100% in both the mean and the variance. Furthermore, our exact method outperforms stochastic simulations in terms of computational efficiency. Given the prevalence of bimolecular reactions in biochemical systems, our approach has the potential to enhance the understanding of real-world biochemical processes.},

The resulting extended screening function has a similar spatial extent as the complementary error function, leading to a computational speed comparable with screened hybrid functionals such as HSE06, but with long-range exact exchange contributions included. The approach is tested and demonstrated for prototypical semiconductors and organic crystals using the PBE0 functional.

The simulation box is divided into cells that are grouped with a separate GLST cubature applied to each group, based on their distance from the atom or cell for which the long-range interaction is calculated. Periodic boundary conditions are handled at two levels: first by “wrapping-around” other cells about the cell under consideration, then by repeating the wrapped-around box over a pre-computed number of times to make the relative error of the calculated force meet the target accuracy. With its high granularity, tunable accuracy, and adaptability to different box geometries, the GLST method is suitable for the simulation of large systems on computer hardware where many cores or threads are available.},

The factorization may be made arbitrarily accurate, allowing full control between computational expense and accuracy.

  abstract     = {Computing electrostatic interactions remains the bottleneck of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations despite more than a century of effort in developing methods to accelerate the calculation. Previously, we have developed the spherical grids and treecode and Gauss–Legendre–spherical- t (GLST) algorithms for electrostatic interactions. Here, we explain the computational details and discuss the performance of GLST. The GLST algorithm achieves O ( N ) scaling and should be less demanding in parallel communication compared with the widely used particle mesh Ewald method and likely comparable to the communication costs of the fast multipole method. We find that GLST is suitable for rapid calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions in MD simulations as it has highly tunable accuracy and should scale well on massively parallel computing architectures. The GLST software presented here is available as a standalone library on GitHub.},

We compare the transport kinetics produced by narrowband and wideband infinite reservoir models (described earlier) with a finite narrowband reservoir model. The transport between finite reservoirs is found to depend on both the initial charge distribution and the number of carriers present. Whether or not a steady-state transport regime is accessed prior to reaching the equilibrium charge distribution depends on these initial conditions.},

  abstract     = {The ability of homologous dsDNA to recognize and attract each other is a fundamental feature in DNA recombination and repair. A major unresolved question is how homologous genes initially locate and position themselves in front of each other—whether they do so at a distance without the use of proteins or unzipping their strands. One hypothesis suggests that such recognition is an innate property of DNA’s structure. DNA is not a perfect double-helix and distortions from helical structure are correlated with the sequence of base pairs. These distortions influence the patterns of charge distribution along the molecules. Those with identical sequences exhibit matching patterns of distortion, allowing them to align in a one-to-one register, which facilitates more favorable interactions. Conversely, uncorrelated sequences are unlikely to align perfectly, resulting in weaker attraction or greater repulsion. Consequently, the pairing of homologous sequences (i.e., positioning homologous genes in front of each other at a distance corresponding to free energy minimum) is more favorable than that of heterologous sequences. But how complete and stable would the pairing be? To address this, we present a model mapped on an Ising-like framework, which provides insight into the extent of pairing and its robustness. Our findings suggest that homologous dsDNAs, spanning multiple Kuhn lengths, can pair with some “bubbles”—regions of less tightly coupled sections. We compute the fraction of these unpaired sections and analyze the stability conditions to demonstrate that under physiological salt concentrations, heterologous double-stranded DNA cannot sustain long paired segments beyond the helical coherence length, further supporting the advantage of homologous pairing.},

  abstract     = {Dense suspensions exhibit a significant change in viscosity under external deformation, a phenomenon known as shear thickening. Recent studies have identified a stress-induced transition from lubricated, unconstrained interactions to frictional contacts, which play a crucial role in shear thickening. This work investigates the rheological behavior and frictional contact network evolution during continuous and discontinuous shear thickening (DST) in two-dimensional simulations. We find that at low stress, during weak thickening, the frictional contact network is composed of quasilinear chains along the compression axis. With increasing stress, the unweighted contact network becomes more isotropic and forms loop-like structures. We show that third-order loops within the frictional contact network are key to the DST. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the number of third-order loops and the viscosity of the suspension. Notably, this relationship remains independent of the packing fraction, applied stress, and interparticle friction, highlighting the fundamental role of the mesoscale network topology in governing macroscopic rheology and connecting to the microscopic physics.},

Dissipation plays a crucial role in transport efficiency, structure formation in self-organizing systems, and the thermodynamic properties of active particle suspensions. In this work, we present a thermodynamic analysis that derives the energy dissipation of coupled irreversible processes occurring in particles, substrate, and solvent. Dissipation in chemical reactions is examined under conditions where the reaction flux follows a nonlinear dependence on affinity, as described by the law of mass action. Our approach considers concentration-dependent reaction rates, in contrast to some previous descriptions of active particles, which assume a constant reaction rate and, consequently, a constant active velocity of the particles. We analyze entropy production for both cases, highlighting significant discrepancies and demonstrating that assuming a constant active velocity overlooks key thermodynamic contributions. Our framework provides a more accurate and self-consistent characterization of entropy production, capturing the inherent nonlinearities of active particle dynamics.},

With increasing propanol fraction, the spherical core–shell micelles, with the ionic block in their core, elongate and transition into large “swarms.” Surprisingly, as propanol becomes the major component of the solvent, reentrant spherical assemblies with a smaller polystyrene sulfonate core are formed.

  abstract     = {We investigate the Brownian motion of isolated snowman-shaped particles consisting of pairs of large and small spheres by video microscopy. Our observations reveal that the particle exhibits varying degrees of anisotropic translational diffusion depending on the reference point used for tracking. In particular, when tracking the snowman’s geometrical center, the diffusion coefficient along the particle’s long axis ( D a ) is greater than that along the short axis ( D b ). When tracking the large sphere’s center, D a and D b are identical, while tracking the small sphere’s center results in D a being smaller than D b . Since D a remains constant across these geometrical centers, the higher D b thus leads to the fastest diffusion for the small sphere’s center. These differences in diffusion arise from the varying coupling between translational and rotational motions, determined by the tracking points relative to the center of hydrodynamic stress (CoH). The CoH has been experimentally confirmed to be the geometrical center of the snowman-shaped particle. Our findings are consistent with the Langevin theory for the Brownian motion of anisotropic particles.},

In the latter, the collective segmental relaxation around the structure factor peak S ( Q max ) exhibits pronounced de Gennes narrowing, with a collective relaxation time τ c ( Q ) that increases without plateauing toward lower momentum transfers Q . Apparently, due to the very bulky monomer structure, the correlation length ξ c for the crossover to viscoelastic homogeneity is unusually large. In the highly cross-linked d1,2-PB rubber, the original structure factor peak of the pure d1,2-PB is significantly reduced. Instead, a strong low- Q peak emerges, which we attribute to correlations between the hydrogen-containing cross-linkers. Both the collective d1,2-PB relaxation rates around the former S ( Q max ) and the relaxation around the new crosslink correlation peak are significantly slowed down compared to the neat melt. Finally, the cross-linking strands exhibit their own fast dynamics, which is well described by diffusion within a spherical Gaussian well, with a corresponding radius R ≅ 4 Å.},

Pluronic micelles yielded lower undesired drug leaks into the water phase compared with the cationic G5 dendrimers, which either remained attached to Pluronic moieties or remained between them and the membrane surface. An interesting feature of Pluronic micelles was their tendency to be disrupted and absorbed into the membranes. Hydrophilic micelles showed improved drug stability, avoiding early release of doxorubicin and gemcitabine drugs. When the Pluronic micelles are disrupted and absorbed into the charged membrane, the hydrophilic pluronic segments were depleted toward the membrane surface, retaining the drugs within. Overall, the CG-MD framework yields a detailed molecule-scale picture of the cooperative Coulombic and amphiphilic effects between charged moieties in contact with membrane surfaces.},

By spanning a broad frequency range from 30 kHz using FFC NMR to high-field NMR (500–800 MHz), we reveal distinct relaxation mechanisms governing ion dynamics in ionogels with and without lithium salts. Our results highlight the role of hBN in modulating molecular rotation and translational motion, significantly affecting 1 H and 19 F relaxation profiles. The presence of Li + alters the dynamic behavior in ionogels, enhancing anion mobility at the interface. Notably, 7 Li relaxation reveals strong interactions with the hBN surface that cannot be detected by diffusion NMR. These findings underscore the importance of spanning a broad frequency range in NMR studies of ionogels and provide critical insights into optimizing their design as novel electrolytes.},

Energy is wasted when field-induced motion also drives anions and solvent molecules, decreasing the transference number to near-zero. We present a systematic study of cation transference in a series of electrolytes: tetraglyme (TG), octaglyme (OG), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) mixed with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. In all three electrolytes, starting from the dilute salt concentration limit, the experimentally measured cation transference number decreases with increasing concentration, reaching a minimum between −0.1 and −0.2, before rising back to positive values. Explicit measurements of field-induced species’ velocities by electrophoretic nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that negative cation transference numbers in TG and OG electrolytes are dictated by solvation interactions with minimal contribution from anion-cation interactions. Simulation-based solvation structures indicate that OG serves as a bridge between TG and PEO. Multi-charge positive clusters, which are negligible in TG, become increasingly important at higher chain lengths (OG and PEO). As migrating cations drag their solvation shells, this solvation-induced motion is amplified in glyme electrolytes because of covalent interactions between solvating glyme molecules and free glyme molecules.},

  abstract     = {The wettability of organic ligand-capped metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in determining their behavior in diverse applications, including protein adsorption, protein corona formation, cellular uptake, toxicity, immune system recognition, drug release kinetics, and bioavailability. However, a comprehensive understanding of the size-dependent effects in metal nanoparticles with specific ligand modifications remains elusive. Here, we leverage molecular dynamics simulations to delineate the size-dependent wettability of Au nanocrystals modified with carboxyl-terminated alkyl chains at the same grafting density. Our results reveal a negative correlation between the water contact angle of gold nanoparticles and the radius of the Au-core for a given ligand length. This trend is determined by the spatial arrangement of carboxyl groups, where an increase in the size of Au-core leads to a reduction in the intermolecular spacing between carboxyl groups, promoting the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups and water molecules, thereby conferring a more hydrophilic character to the nanoparticles. Conversely, for a fixed Au-core radius, the water contact angle of nanoparticles increases as the length of alkyl chains increases. This distinct relationship arises from the extended separation between carboxyl groups in longer alkyl ligands, which reduces the hydrogen bond formation with water molecules and renders the nanoparticle more hydrophobic. These findings lay the groundwork for how nanoparticle wettability can be precisely modulated, a critical factor for optimizing their performance in various biomedical and industrial applications.},

In this paper, we directly investigated the photoemission yield and photoemission mechanism from a sub-radiative Fano mode in an asymmetric nanorod dimer, a radiative dipole mode in an isolated nanorod, and a radiative coupled dipole mode in a symmetric nanorod dimer, respectively, using time-of-flight photoemission electron microscopy. We found that the photoemission yield from the sub-radiative Fano mode is almost equal to that of the radiative dipole mode but more than four times higher than that of the radiative coupled dipole mode case. We reproduced the physical process using a two temperature model and Fowler–Dubridge theory and demonstrated that the thermal effects of the electron gas play an influential role in photoemission from LSP. Interestingly, it is found that the sub-radiative nanorod dimer, although exhibiting a much lower electron temperature, maintains a similar photoemission yield to that of the radiative dipole mode, and this feature of the sub-radiative nanorod dimer makes it potentially a high-brightness electron source with strong robustness. The demonstrated results in this work help to understand the LSP-assisted photoemission process in plasmonic nanostructures, which lays the foundation for designing new ultrafast photoelectric cathodes and many other applications.},

For the fractal-like surfaces, when the product q 0 d of the film thickness d and the low cut-off wavenumber q 0 of the surface roughness power spectrum satisfy q 0 d < 0.1, the effective modulus becomes very large. This results in large contact stresses, which can induce plastic deformation or wear, in particular during sliding contact. I also calculate the probability distributions of the normal and tangential stresses at the film–substrate interface. If the tangential (shear) stress is too high, the adhesive bond between the film and the substrate will break.

However, the mechanisms leading from the early emerging (local) defects to the amplification of dislocations (collective plastic events) are not easy to track. Here, using tensile-stress atomistic simulations of a copper lattice as a case study, we revisit this classical problem under a new perspective based on local dynamics rather than on purely structural arguments. We use a data-driven approach that allows tracking how local fluctuations emerge and accumulate in the atomic lattice in space and time, anticipating/determining the emergence of local or collective structural defects during deformation. Building solely on the general concepts of local fluctuations and spatiotemporal fluctuation correlations, this approach allows characterizing in a unique way the evolution through the elastic, plastic, and fracture phases, describing metals as complex systems where collective phenomena originate from local dynamical triggering events.},

  abstract     = {A method for generating significant numbers of network configurations is developed appropriate to bilayers of systems such as SiO 2 , GeO 2 , and aluminosilicates. The presence of a mirror plane allows the bilayer structures to exactly map onto a two-dimensional network of three-coordinate nodes (equivalent to a percolating network of rings). A bond switching algorithm is employed to generate a range of disordered (amorphous) network topologies (characterized by the ring size distribution and the nearest-neighbor connectivities, as measured by the Aboav–Weaire Law and assortativity). Bilayer configurations are generated from these networks, and energy minimizations are performed using a hierarchy of potential models: a purely harmonic potential, a harmonic potential with an inter-tetrahedral repulsive term, a rigid-ion model, and a polarizable-ion model. The harmonic potential shows a flexibility window whose extent depends on the spatial extent of the inter-tetrahedral repulsive term. The window becomes less well-defined for higher level (rigid-ion and polarizable-ion) models. Distortions of the bilayer networks are characterized with reference to both the ideal (hexagonal) crystal and the amorphous networks. In addition, a “pore evaporation” algorithm is developed and used to generate a range of potential zeolitic bilayer networks. These networks, which are ordered but contain significant numbers of non-hexagonal rings, provide a useful contrast to the disordered networks.},

The results are compared to prior and revised experiments on 1–4 to 1–16 concentrations, 13.9–3.5 m. Vibrational population relaxation and anisotropy decays were measured for hydroxyls hydrogen-bonded to chlorides (HBCs). In contrast to higher salt concentrations, at ≤∼1–32 (1.7 m salt), the HBC population relaxation times and anisotropy decays are concentration independent. 1–32 marks a transition from high concentrations of ion pairs, clusters, and ion networks to concentrations of ion pairs low enough not to affect observable molecular level dynamics. At a concentration of approximately 1–32 and lower salt concentrations, chemical exchange is responsible for HBC anisotropy decay and plays a role in population relaxation. Wavelength-dependent population relaxation was used to obtain lifetime amplitude spectra (LAS), which show distinct species that are not observable with FT-IR. At very high salt concentrations, e.g., 1–6, there are no “pure” water regions, and the LAS has two bands: HBCs and hydroxyls of water oxygens solvating Li + . At lower salt concentrations, there is also a “pure” water band in the LAS. The HBC band shape is concentration independent from 1–4 to 1–128.},

The (non-affine) particle displacement fields during these events have complex real space structure with multiple disconnected cores of high displacement appearing at the same applied strain under athermal quasistatic simple shear deformation and identified by using a “cell based cluster analysis” method. By monitoring the stress relaxation during the first plastic event by Langevin dynamics simulation, we directly show the cascade nature of these events. Thus, these first plastic events are reminiscent of avalanches in the post-yielding steady state, but unlike the steady state avalanches, we show that these events are not system spanning. To understand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to affect brittleness of a glass. These are (i) sample preparation history, (ii) inter-particle interactions, and (iii) rigidity of the background matrix applying a “soft matrix” probe recently developed by some of us. In each case, we show that such first plastic events are more probable in more ductile glasses. Our observations are consistent with the picture that more ductile materials are softer, implying that understanding the role of softness may be a promising route to develop microscopic quantifiers of brittleness and thus clarifying the physical origin of brittle-to-ductile transition.},

  abstract     = {Understanding mechanisms involved in particle formation processes is crucial to effectively control crystalline particle characteristics. This study highlights the significant effect of slight changes in molecular size on the crystallization pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed in a binary Lennard-Jones system as a model for systems that undergo two-step nucleation via an intermediate droplet structure. This study analyzed two cases with different solute–solute interaction strengths and found that a larger solute-to-solvent size ratio delayed droplet crystallization in both cases. In systems with strong solute–solute interactions, this delay shifted the pathway from one-step-like to two-step-like nucleation, as droplets with larger solute molecules incorporated more solvent, thereby hindering crystallization. We explained this change in droplet composition by considering the mixing free energy between the solute and solvent. Larger solute molecules form entropically and enthalpically favorable structures by accommodating solvent molecules, which increase the solvent fraction of the droplet. We used a thermodynamic model based on the classical nucleation theory with a core–shell nucleus and revealed that this increased solvent fraction in the droplet lowered the freezing point of the droplet and raised the solid–liquid interfacial tension, ultimately delaying and suppressing crystallization. Based on these findings, we proposed a strategy to control the nucleation pathway using additives. Introducing appropriate additives to modify the stability of intermediates is a promising strategy to control nucleation pathways in various systems.},

In this line, this work aims at the deeper structural comprehension of five model ionic solvents from the recently presented family of biocompatible ILs based on cholinium cation ([Ch] + ) and peptide anions ([Pep] − ). To do this, a molecular dynamics approach was employed. The use of different [Pep] − allowed us to evaluate the influence of (i) incrementing an oligopeptide chain through the glycyl (Gly) unit and (ii) employing a more complex functionalization based on the phenylalanyl (Phe) group. The simulations show that the additional peptide group from [Ch][Pep] adds a new anchoring point for inter-anionic association through H-bonding, and while the peptide hydrogen is interacting with other anions, the peptide oxygen seems to approach cation charged centers. This stronger H-bonding grid may explain the boost in viscosity observed when transitioning from [Ch][AA] to [Ch][Pep]. On the other hand, the nano-segregation of ILs built with Phe is distinguished by two continuous mesophases, polar and apolar. Both these networks have their impact on each other since, when the peptide chain is incremented from 1 to 2 Phe residues, (i) the polar domain is slightly less continuous and (ii) the apolar one presents different phenyl ring (Phe r ) solvation profiles depending on their position in the peptide chain. In addition, the edge-to-face configurations dominate the Phe r –Phe r aggregation, suggesting an electrostatic influence in the internal organization of this domain, and π–cation complexes appear to disturb apolar accumulation.},

Here, the primary and secondary dynamics of neat poly(cyclohexyl methacrylate) (PCHMA) and its blends with hindered phenols were systematically investigated by a combination of dielectric and enthalpy relaxation. Notably, neat PCHMA owns a glass transition temperature T g ∼ 299 K, while the segmental fragility m can be as low as about 42. After introducing hindered phenols capable of forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds, m increases in the same direction as T g . Surprisingly, the observed increase in segmental fragility exhibits a strong correlation with the suppression of the dielectric γ -relaxation process, which has been previously attributed to chair-to-chair transitions of the cyclohexyl side groups. The concomitant decrease in accessible configurational states is further evidenced by enthalpy relaxation. We suppose that the γ -relaxation may involve less degree of intermolecular freedom, which can be speculated from its increased activation energy that is comparable to that of the Johari–Goldstein secondary process, as well as the broadened γ -peak breadth. These results provide solid experimental evidence that a correlation does exist between the conformational change and fragility and therefore pave a new routine to fabricate strong polymeric glass formers by introducing the ring-containing topology structures.},

In this work, we report the pure rotational spectrum of HCl–DCl, which has a preference for deuterium in the hydrogen bond donor position. However, the quadrupole coupling constants indicate a significant amount of geared tunneling, consistent with significant zero-point wavefunction amplitude in the less stable DCl–HCl configuration. A comparison of experimental results with previously published wavefunction calculations based on model and ab initio potentials is consistent with a picture in which about 14% of the probability density distribution is located in the less stable well.},

  abstract     = {This work finds that there are eight distinguished symmetry breaking minimum energy conical intersections (MECIs) between the N/V states of ethylene, in which the first four of them are closer to the reactant configuration than the remaining four. Consequently, the initially excited ethylene has a higher probability to relax to the first four MECIs or their adjacent configurations. Moreover, the ground potential energy surface around the first four MECIs has an asymmetric peaked topology and tilts toward the reactant configuration. Therefore, the cis–trans photoisomerization reaction in ethylene can exhibit the stereoselectivity of returning more back to the reactant rather than forming the product. In addition, the geometry–electronic structure relation and the geometric phase effect associated with a conical intersection were demonstrated by employing the adiabatic-to-diabatic analysis, in which the complete active space self-consistent-field wave function is represented by the equivalent covalent and ionic valence bond functions.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of solar energy catalysts requires a mechanistic understanding of the ultrafast interactions with the solvent environment. We have designed a new Cu(I)–anthraquinone framework (CuEthyneAnQ) to serve as a model for studying hydrogen-bonding effects in charge accumulating photocatalysts. Herein, we report the ground and excited-state characterization of CuEthyneAnQ by electrochemical and ultrafast optical transient absorption (OTA) spectroscopy measurements. Significant stabilization of the AnQ-centered reductions due to hydrogen-bonding was observed by electrochemical measurements in protic solvent mixtures. Analysis of the excited-state photophysics with OTA reveals electron transfer occurring in tens of picoseconds after metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitation, resulting in the charge-separated state of Cu(II)EthyneAnQ ·– . Charge recombination occurs in 4 ns in aprotic solvent and extends to 19 ns in protic solvent. In order to examine the influence of hydrogen-bonding on the electron-transfer dynamics, we performed OTA measurements on CuEthyneAnQ in varying aprotic:protic solvent mixtures. We observe three effects that depend on the concentration of the protic solvent: (1) after charge separation, a diffusion-limited hydrogen-bond forms with the reduced AnQ ·– ; (2) the slowdown in charge recombination with protic solvent addition is due to hydrogen-bond stabilization in accordance with Marcus theory; and (3) a spectral shift occurs in the charge-separated state due to an increasing number of hydrogen-bond interactions. Our results are supported by time-dependent density functional theory calculations with explicit solvent hydrogen-bonding interactions. These insights underscore the potential of Cu-based donor–acceptor complexes and mixed-solvent systems to offer valuable guidelines for the design of more efficient photocatalytic systems.},

However, achieving pure spin current at the single-molecule level remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to generate pure spin current through spin Fano resonance in a p-Ben-CuII molecule. Our results reveal that the spin-down Fano resonance in p-Ben-CuII is associated with the β-HOMO, while the spin-up Fano resonance originates from the α-HOMO. Furthermore, by precisely tuning the chemical potential to align with the resonance peak, a well-defined pure spin current can be achieved under specific chemical potential or temperature conditions. This strategy offers a promising pathway for the precise manipulation of pure spin current in single-molecule junctions, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.},

The electronic spectrum is studied using synchrotron radiation based photoabsorption spectroscopy spanning the spectral region 1150–3000 Å (86 956–33 333 cm −1 ), for which the spectrum in the 1150–1700 Å (86 956–58 823 cm −1 ) region is reported here for the first time. The electronic absorption spectrum is richly structured and comprises valence, Rydberg, and charge transfer excitations, along with distinct vibronic features. Quantum defect analysis is used to assign Rydberg series converging to the first four IPs of 1,3 dibromobenzene, while charge transfer and valence transitions are assigned using theoretical calculations at the TDDFT/CAMB3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level. The extensive vibrational bands accompanying the first valence transition are analyzed and assigned using Franck–Condon factor calculations incorporating the Herzberg–Teller effect. In addition, time dependent DFT studies of excited state potential energy curves yield some new insights into the role of internal conversions and intersystem crossings in the UV photodissociation dynamics of 1,3 dibromobenzene.},

  abstract     = {Protonated formic acid (PFA) is purported to be the active species in the catalytic activation of condensation reactions at the acidic interface of microdroplets. Here, we investigate the fundamental interaction between PFA and water with cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy of the binary PFA–H 2 O complexes generated via electrospray ionization followed by buffer gas cooling to about 20 K. The patterns displayed by the isomer-specific IR spectra of D 2 -tagged PFA–H 2 O indicate that two distinct, non-interconverting rotamers are present at low temperatures based on the cis and trans structures of the HCO 2 H 2 + core ion. Both of these occur with the water molecule attached to the OH that is in a cis -configuration relative to the CH group (denoted E), but differ in the E vs Z ( cis vs trans relative to the CH group) orientation of the spectator OH. This assignment scheme corrects a previous theoretical analysis that invoked a scenario in which structures with E- and Z-bound water molecules interconvert at low (20 K) temperatures. Isomer-specific bands arising from the OH stretches and water bending modes are deconvoluted using isotopomer-specific spectroscopy of the complexes with partial H/D exchange. The dependence of the nominal shared proton OH stretch frequency on the deuteration of the tethered water confirms strong coupling between this mode and the water bending fundamental.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the hydration reaction of a gold(I)–N-heterocyclic carbene [Au(I)–NHC] complex at both the quantum mechanical (QM) level and combined Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) MD simulations. The main goals are to analyze the differences between implicit (PCM) and explicit solvation models and to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. Regarding the QM part, the B97D3 and B3PW91 functionals are combined with double-zeta basis sets and the C-PCM/UFF implicit solvation model and compared with the CCSD(T)/TZP computational level supplemented with the C-PCM (COSMO/Klamt radii) or D-PCM/scaled-UAKS solvation model. In addition, reaction force and reaction electronic flux (REF) analyses are performed along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) determined at the B3PW91/6-31+G(d)/SDD/C-PCM/UFF computational model for deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Despite relatively high endergonicity, the TS structure is quite close to the center of the reaction coordinate, contrary to the Hammond principle. In the QM/MM MD part of the study, the B97D3 computational setting from the previous part is used as a QM core, and several different explicit water solvation models are explored in the MM environment. The TIP3P water model is compared with the OPC, POL3, TIP4P, and SPCE ones. Nevertheless, they all lead to very low activation barriers and mild endergonicity. Both ΔG r and ΔG a energies are visibly reduced compared to QM values when PCM models are applied. Since partial charges of water atoms within the QM calculations are visibly smaller than point charges in all the explored force-field water models, a modified TIP3P (with partial charges close to DFT RESP values and a LJ parameter conserving the correct water density) is used. In this manner, the energy profile is closer to QM results (with ΔG a = 8.2 and ΔG r = 6.4 kcal mol −1 )—especially to the CCSD(T)/TZP/D-PCM/scaled-UAKS model (ΔG a = 14.6 and ΔG r = 9.1). Nevertheless, the hydration process is predicted to be endoergic in all explored models.},

However, determination of these relaxation parameters is often challenging for low- γ nuclides, which exhibit low sensitivity and are typically subject to large anisotropic interactions. Here, we introduce two new pulse sequences, PROSPR-T 1 and PROSPR-T 2 , for measuring longitudinal and transverse relaxation time constants in solids. These sequences are modifications of the PROgressive Saturation of the Proton Reservoir (PROSPR) experiment, developed to facilitate the detection of insensitive nuclides. Following an initial analysis of the adiabatic requirements of the PROSPR experiment, the performance of PROSPR to measure T 1 / T 2 ′ is thoroughly evaluated on a range of spins, including 119 Sn ( I = 1/2), 35 Cl ( I = 3/2), and 14 N ( I = 1). Experimental results demonstrate that optimized versions of PROSPR can be up to an order of magnitude more sensitive than their original implementation. These new methods offer accurate relaxation time constants, even for spectra spanning over 1 MHz, without demanding frequency stepping throughout the powder pattern.},

Phys. 162 , 124201 (2025)] to coherent four-wave-mixing spectroscopy using paraxial Laguerre–Gaussian (LG) beams. Unlike pump–probe or transient absorption techniques, photon echo is highly sensitive to the spatial phase structure of LG beams. This sensitivity arises because coherence evolution in inhomogeneously broadened absorbers depends on the radial and azimuthal indices of the LG modes used in the write-and-read processes within the photon echo configuration. Recent advances in spatial light modulators, metasurfaces, and ultrafast laser techniques have significantly improved spatial and temporal control over quantum materials. These innovations enable new approaches to studying heterogeneous systems, developing multidimensional microspectroscopy, and exploring alternative quantum information storage methods. In this work, we investigate photon echo signals generated by LG beams and derive analytical expressions for rephasing and non-rephasing photon echoes. Our results reveal how beam parameters influence nonlinear spatiotemporal responses, capturing spatial variations in pulse amplitudes, phases, and inhomogeneity-induced dephasing and rephasing. We show that customized ultrafast pulses and structured spatial light fields can enhance the spatial separation of photon echo signals and increase the density of stored quantum information.

We first performed steady-state spectroscopic measurements to characterize the sample and then implemented optical 2D coherent spectroscopy in the non-collinear geometry to probe the ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited carriers. A series of rephasing one-quantum 2D spectra at different waiting times revealed that a transient exciton resonance coexists with the free-carrier resonance for hundreds of femtoseconds before the excitons dissociate into free carriers. The free-carrier resonance persists for a significantly longer time, up to at least 1 ns, and exhibits the signs of spectral diffusion. We then characterized the spectral diffusion by calculating the frequency–frequency correlation function. The acquired 2D spectra revealed unique transient dynamics in MAPI perovskites that might be difficult to probe with one-dimensional techniques.},

Static periodic density-functional theory calculations reveal weakened bonding of hydrogen and higher diffusion barriers in the confinement. Furthermore, local density of hydrogen atoms has a significant influence on their shape and properties. For a hydrogen density of 0.25 ML, the graphene sheet switches to the weaker bound van der Waals configuration, resulting in a broad confinement with similar properties as the clean metal surface. For a hydrogen density of 0.04 ML, the graphene behaves like a carpet and bends up locally around the hydrogen atom. This presses the hydrogen atom to the surface, resulting in lower intercalation energy and a higher diffusion barrier. The RPMD simulations were used to quantify the effect of temperature and nuclear quantum effects on the diffusion. For 0.25 ML hydrogen coverage, the diffusion coefficients are similar to the clean surface, with a crossover temperature to the deep-tunneling regime of ∼100 K, whereas for 0.04 ML, diffusion at low temperatures is significantly decreased. At temperatures above 200 K, on the other hand, diffusion is more similar for both hydrogen coverages due to a more flexible graphene sheet. This study reveals that two-dimensional confinements adapt to their content, and full-dimensional simulations with the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects can greatly enhance our understanding of them, needed for their targeted usage as storage media or catalysts.},

  abstract     = {The wide adoption of transition state theory in resolving the rates of molecular processes relies on the simplification from reducing the formal and numerical expense of dynamics by a geometric constraint. Such a reduction is at odds with the uncertainty in localization that the uncertainty principle requires. While many forms of semiclassical transition state theory (SCTST) have been aimed at addressing this challenge, a popular approach has relied on resolving the underlying phase space structure of the exact rate formula to leverage Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization. The Hernandez–Miller SCTST reframed the thermal rate formula into an integral of the so-called restricted partition function (RPF) over the action associated with the reaction. The density-of-state SCTST has reframed the rate formula in terms of the instanton’s density of states (DoS). Here, we show the relationship between the RPF-SCTST and the DoS-SCTST and derive the latter from the former. In this way, we help unify these branches of SCTST and provide a clearer formalism for future advances.},

  abstract     = {Electrolyte solutions are vital to the development of technologies such as batteries and carbon sequestration methods. Accurate but efficient simulation models are crucial in guiding the development of such technologies. In this work, we investigate how the inclusion of atomic polarizability, by means of Drude oscillators, affects the ability of efficient, classical force fields to model the temperature dependence of the aqueous solubility and activity coefficients of alkali-halide salts. To achieve this, we propose a new method to efficiently and accurately compute derivatives of the salt chemical potential with respect to force field parameters, enabling gradient-based fitting directly to chemical potential data. Using this method, we attempt to refine polarizable models to better predict solid–solution solubility limits as functions of temperature. We find that while solubility predictions can be improved, polarizable models are incapable of reproducing the slope of the solid–solution coexistence line for NaCl. This implies that classical polarizability (with constant atomic charges) alone is an insufficient description of system many-body interactions, and “first-principles” descriptions of the energy landscape are necessary to achieve true predictive power in electrolyte modeling.},

  abstract     = {An efficient implementation of the variational cluster perturbation excitation energy series through fifth order is described. The series has the coupled cluster singles excitation energies as zeroth order and targets the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) excitation energies. The implementation utilizes the resolution of the identity approximation for the two-electron integrals. The perturbation series uses the 2 n + 1/2 n + 2 rules to eliminate all parameters higher than second order. The computational efficiency is illustrated by performing excitation energy calculations on a single node for systems with up to 1000 basis functions and comparing with CCSD calculations. Using the hybrid parallel open multiprocessing/message-passing interface implementation with graphics processing unit offloading, fifth-order cluster perturbation excitation energies for systems with 1750 basis functions can be calculated in 8 h using 20 nodes on the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A benchmark of 131 excitation energies for a diverse set of molecules is presented. For the fourth and fifth order models, a few prominent outliers are present. We demonstrate how these cases may be identified using a simple diagnostic, with the remaining values being indistinguishable from CCSD excitation energies in practice.},

  abstract     = {The accurate and efficient assignment of atomic partial charges is crucial for many applications in theoretical and computational chemistry, including polarizable force fields, dispersion corrections, and charge-dependent basis sets. Classical charge models struggle to distinguish between neutral and zwitterionic fragments because, unlike quantum mechanical methods, there are no discrete electronic states. This limitation can lead to either reduced or additional artificial charge transfer (CT) at different interfragment distances. To address this issue, we propose a new version of a bond capacity electronegativity equilibration (EEQ BC ) model, which limits artificial CT between distant fragments in the simple EEQ framework. EEQ BC offers excellent agreement with DFT-based reference charges for elements up to lawrencium ( Z = 103) with mean absolute errors as low as 0.02 and 0.07 e − for random PubChem molecules and “mindless” molecules (MLMs), respectively. Thanks to its computational efficiency for both atomic charges and their analytical nuclear gradients, EEQ BC is highly suitable as an initial charge guess for next-generation tight-binding methods. For seamless accessibility, EEQ BC is implemented in the upcoming 0.5.0 release of the freely available multicharge program at github.com/grimme-lab/multicharge .},

However, prior experiments have revealed a rapid decay in MQC intensities as the coherence order increases, restricting observable cluster sizes to the square root of the total system size. In this work, we establish fundamental bounds on observable MQC intensities in the thermodynamic limit ( N ≫ 1) outside the weak polarization region. We identify a sharp decay in the observable MQC intensities as the coherence order grows. This transition regime fragments the state space into two components consisting of observable and unobservable multiple-quantum coherences. Notably, we find that the center of the transition region is directly proportional to size N and polarization p of the system, suggesting that the aforementioned square root limitation can be overcome through hyperpolarization techniques. Our results provide important experimental guidelines for the selective observation of large spin cluster phenomena.},

We propose variants of SOAP kernels that leverage the structural architecture of homomolecular systems to minimize irrelevant comparisons of atomic environments. To evaluate its performance, we apply this adapted SOAP-based method to a synthetic dataset consisting of two identical tripeptides deposited on a copper surface, simulating different molecular states. The results demonstrate that the adapted method not only improves computational efficiency but also yields more meaningful clustering outcomes by better capturing the key structural differences between states. These findings suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for the study of homomolecular systems, particularly those involving surface interactions, and has the potential to enhance the use of diverse types of molecular modeling and analysis methods that rely on (dis)similarity measures.},

Selective coordination of hexavalent americium [Am (VI)] with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this issue. In this work, we employed first-principles simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the adsorption stability of COF (PyN-DAB) for the linear americyl ion AmO 2 2 + ⁠ . Our results demonstrate that COFs can effectively and stably coordinate with Am (VI), highlighting their potential for Am separation. Furthermore, we explored the high-oxidation-state model of AmO 2 2 + complexes with the PyN-DAB ligand to elucidate the underlying microscopic interaction mechanisms between AmO 2 2 + and the PyN-DAB monomer. Comprehensive analyses revealed a strong attraction between the PyN-DAB and AmO 2 2 + ⁠ , which is attributed to the synergistic effects of electrostatic interactions, orbital interactions, and π -electron-rich aromatic rings within the PyN-DAB framework. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the Am separation process but also offer a novel perspective on the potential applications of COFs in the efficient extraction of actinides. Thus, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop advanced materials for nuclear fuel reprocessing and waste management.},

We start with a dielectric free energy functional F with a cross term ∝ ∫d rp 1 · p 2 , which was proposed by Felderhof [J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 12 , 2423 (1979)]. With this cross-coupling, our theory can yield the theoretical results by Onsager and Kirkwood. We also present dynamic equations using the functional derivatives δ F / δ p i to calculate the space-time correlations of p i . We then obtain analytic expressions for various frequency-dependent quantities, including the Debye formula. We find that the fluctuations of the total polarization drastically depend on whether we fix the electrode charge or the applied potential difference between parallel metal electrodes. In the latter fixed-potential condition, we obtain a nonlocal (long-range) polarization correlation inversely proportional to the cell volume V , which is crucial to understanding the dielectric response. It is produced by nonlocal charge fluctuations on the electrode surfaces and is sensitive to the potential drops in the Stern layers in small systems. These nonlocal correlations in the bulk and on the surfaces are closely related due to the global constraint of fixed potential difference. We also add some results in other boundary conditions, including the periodic one, where nonlocal correlations also appear.},

As an example, we generalize the weighted spin density approximation functional from its original collinear form to a noncollinear one, introducing the first pure functional that is both nonlocal and noncollinear. Our numerical tests demonstrate that the generalized noncollinear functional satisfies the correct collinear limit, preserves spin rotational invariance, provides nonzero local torque, and maintains numerical stability.

Two models are proposed to calculate the longitudinal ɛ ‖ ( h , ω ) and transverse ɛ ⊥ ( h , ω ) parts of the permittivity tensor in the specified frequency range for gold nanofilms of different thicknesses and surface orientations (001), (110), and (111). These models explain intense peaks in the real and imaginary parts of permittivity at 0–2 eV. The model for calculating the transverse permittivity does not use the Drude model but uses the interband contribution of the bulk material determined through DFT calculations and the contribution of electron motion perpendicular to the nanoslab surface. This contribution takes into account the electron motion inside an infinitely deep one-dimensional potential well with a set of discrete electron levels and makes it possible to calculate the imaginary part of the permittivity using Fermi’s golden rule. The model for calculating the longitudinal permittivity employs an interpolation scheme using the tabulated permittivity of bulk gold and that of several plates with different thicknesses. The difference between experimental permittivity values and those calculated using DFT and the proposed models is discussed. The proposed algorithms enabled a Python program for fast calculation of ɛ ⊥ ( h , ω ) and ɛ ‖ ( h , ω ) of gold nanofilms of any thickness and above-mentioned orientations in the 0–6 eV range without computationally expensive DFT calculations. This program is included in the supplementary material . The proposed approaches can be easily applied to nanofilms made of other metals.},

We then define a temperature-dependent free-energy surface of the corresponding rigid monomer system, F ( R ; T ), by averaging over the intra -molecular degrees of freedom. F ( R ; T ) is here estimated directly using the local harmonic approximation. While conceptually simple and numerically inexpensive, the coarse-grained PES defined in this manner turns out to be surprisingly accurate for the model systems considered, namely water and ammonia clusters. The proposed framework can be used in a more general context for local rigidification of other molecular systems in non-uniform environments.},

Their equilibrium geometries and binding energies are determined with the state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods at three levels of approximation. The equilibrium geometries obtained R eq (Li 3 ) = 3.100 Å, R eq (Na 3 ) = 4.353 Å, R eq (K 3 ) = 4.996 Å, R eq (Rb 3 ) = 5.391 Å, and R eq (Cs 3 ) = 5.730 Å are compared to the other theoretical results and also to the very recent experimental results obtained through the laser-induced Coulomb explosion. Further theoretical studies are proposed, which could help with better interpretation of the experimental results for the sodium and cesium trimers.},

  abstract     = {Quantum beats lasting a few hundred femtoseconds have been regarded as signatures of quantum energy transfer in photosynthetic antennae. The fragile coherence at room temperature casts doubt on its long-lived feature arising from the electronic coherence. Recently, the long-lived exciton–vibrational coherences of several hundred femtoseconds via quantum phase synchronization of the resonant higher frequency collective vibrational modes have been observed in core antenna allophycocyanin from algae. The long-lived coherence has an inherent property of protecting the coherence against the noisy environment. This is achieved by dissipation of the resonant anti-symmetric collective vibrational modes coupled to the excitonic levels, which have fast dephasing, leaving only the non-dissipative correlated symmetric modes [R. Zhu et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 3171 (2024)], which is different from that induced by the environmental low frequency modes. Coherence with a lifetime constant of 200 fs at room temperature has been observed in the cryptophyte phycoerythrin 545 (PE545) antenna before, while its origin, i.e., pure electronic or exciton–vibrational, remains to be explored. Here, we investigated coherent energy transfer dynamics in PE545 via two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. A long-lasting coherence with a lifetime constant of 270 fs in the dynamical Stokes shift dynamics was observed. Especially, the high frequency vibrational mode at 1150 cm −1 is absent in the electronic energy dissipation process reflected in the dynamical Stokes’ shifts spectrum, which is near resonant with the electronic gap of 1080 cm −1 . Therefore, the facts strongly suggest that the long-lived coherence in PE545 is realized by the resonant exciton–vibrational coupling via quantum phase synchronization.},

From the measured steady-state probability density function P ( x ; F 0 ) of the SPPs with different self-propulsion forces F 0 , we find that the escape dynamics of slow-rotating SPPs over the asymmetric ratchet potential can be well described by an activity-dependent potential, U ± ( x ; F 0 ) ≃ U 0 ( x ) ∓ aF 0 x , for the forward (+) and backward (−) moving particles with aF 0 being the amplitude of their self-propulsion force projected along the x axis. By a thorough analysis of a large volume of the SPP trajectories obtained from both the spatially symmetric and asymmetric potentials, we delineate two experimental conditions under which the ratchet effect of SPPs is realized without involving a time-dependent rectification, and directed particle transport with a steady flux is observed. This work thus provides an effective statistical approach to describe the non-equilibrium transport of SPPs across ratchet potentials.},

By examining the changes in the stretching ratio R ( n ) n b ⁠ , the orientational order parameter P 2 ( n ), and the entanglement during stretching, we find that the stress predicted based on the initial average entanglement state of the system has obvious deviation under a large strain. Thus, we propose that both the loss of entanglement and the heterogeneous distribution of entanglement points among different chains are essential to account for the nonlinear rheological behaviors. Incorporating these factors leads to a theoretical prediction that better aligns with the simulated stress observed under large strains and reveals the heterogeneity of stress distribution associated with entanglement heterogeneity.},

The embedded model is an NpO 2 [H 2 O] 5 2+ cluster. Novel methods are used to quantify the role of the hydration both for the molecular orbitals and for the many-body wavefunctions that account for the interaction of the hole in the M 5 shell with the two electrons in the open 5f shell of the excited states. It is found that the hydration has only a very minor effect on the XAS excitation energies and intensities, thus validating the previous work based on the properties of an isolated neptunyl cation.},

  abstract     = {Numerous properties of organic/metal interfaces strongly depend on their polymorphism. To computationally predict the thermodynamically most stable polymorph at finite temperature and pressure, the state-of-the-art method is ab initio thermodynamics. However, several approximations made within ab initio thermodynamics have been developed with small adsorbates in mind, which are comparable in size to a substrate unit cell and have no or only few internal degrees of freedom, and it is unclear how well these approximations translate to larger, more complex organic adsorbates. In this work, we study this question exemplarily for the model system of tetracyanoethylene on Cu(111), which shows a Blyholder-like charge transfer that in amount and shape depends sensitively on the structure of the organic adsorbate. In particular, we investigate how the phase boundaries between different stable polymorphs are affected by the (temperature-dependent) vibrational and entropy terms. Based on these investigations, we find that, while the configurational entropy is de facto negligible for organics, the vibrational free energy can shift phase boundaries by several tens of kelvins. Moreover, we discuss how the vibrational free energy can be approximated and why said approximations work well for organic/metal interfaces.},

In the case of the Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 solar cell featuring a superstrate structure of indium tin oxide/cadmium sulfide (CdS)/Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 /spiro-OMeTAD/Au, the device performance was limited by the poor heterojunction interfaces, especially the poor interface of the P–N heterojunction. In this study, InCl 3 -modified In 2 O 3 was used to tailor the quality of the P–N heterojunction. The quality of the CdS deposited on InCl 3 -modified In 2 O 3 was significantly improved. In addition, the conduction band offset between P–N junctions is tailored, which is helpful for carrier transport. As Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 was deposited on such a modified electron transport layer by InCl 3 -modified In 2 O 3 , the ( hkl , l = 1) preferred orientation of the Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 film increased greatly, and the built-in voltage of the Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 solar cell tailored by InCl 3 -modified In 2 O 3 was enlarged, which is beneficial for carrier transport. Finally, the InCl 3 -modified In 2 O 3 -assisted CdS double electron transport layers achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 7.44% for Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 solar cells via the vapor transport deposition method. This work provides a valuable reference for interface modifications and further boosts the efficiency of Sb 2 (S, Se) 3 solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Molten salts have been recently used as catalysts for methane pyrolysis to generate hydrogen and carbon. It was found that molten alkali chlorides, which are poor catalysts, become rather active upon the addition of a small amount of FeCl 3 . Calculations have shown that this takes place through an unusual mechanism. Due to fluctuations in the position of the ions, the charge on the iron fluctuates between Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ . The electron required for forming Fe 2+ is donated by several chlorine ions, and this causes them to be active in breaking the carbon hydrogen bond in methane. It was suggested that this mechanism is general: it takes place whenever the dopant is such that a lower charge state is possible. We test this hypothesis here by examining KCl doped with MoCl 5 , MoCl 4 , or MoCl 3 . We find that MoCl 5 and MoCl 4 activate KCl by the mechanism described above. MoCl 3 does not because Mo 3+ is not converted by fluctuations to Mo 2+ . We also show that the gas-phase dissociation energy of molybdenum chloride can be used as a descriptor to assess its ability to activate methane. Because it is easy to remove one Cl from MoCl 5 or MoCl 4 , they are effective dopants for methane activation. The energy required for the dissociation of MoCl 3 is very high, and doping with MoCl 3 does not improve catalytic activity.},

Such bottom-up nanofabrication approaches are currently often used to create a range of molecular architectures at surfaces via molecular self-assembly. In this perspective, we present an STM study of the formation of composite layers of organic molecules designed by depositing C 60 fullerene on a previously formed multilayer of perylene on an Ag(110) substrate. We underline the interest in studying mixed layers of these two molecules forming a weakly interacting system. The room temperature STM study at the molecular scale, complemented with modeling of the intermolecular interactions, revealed that adsorption of C 60 does occur on top of the outer perylene compact rows along the [1–10] substrate axis. The fullerenes tend to aggregate within alignments along the axis of the compact rows of the perylene structure; the higher the coverage, the longer the alignments. In the most compact ones, the C 60 s are periodically positioned at a 2b 1 distance, b 1 being the inter-perylene distance within the [1–10] compact rows. Furthermore, the C 60 s adsorb preferably on “Short bridge” sites, meaning above and between the underlying upper perylenes. Modeling of the intermolecular interactions in this system confirms the STM measurements and points to the ability of the underlying perylene multi-layer to drive the fullerene assembly.},

Three-body interactions make important contributions to the pressure–volume–temperature behavior, enthalpy, heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, isochoric pressure coefficient, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient of Ne. In particular, three-body interactions are required to correctly determine the volume and greatly improve the accuracy of enthalpy, isochoric pressure coefficient, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient. QCKE also make an important contribution to the properties of Ne that has not been previously recognized.

  abstract     = {We study Landau–Zener transitions with the spin flipping of electron states in donor–chiral bridge–acceptor structures due to electron spin coupling with the strain tensor induced by the anisotropic phonon field of the chiral bridge molecule, where the transition rates near conical intersections between two potential energy surfaces for the right-handed and left-handed bridge structures are calculated. We find that the flipping rates sensitively depend on the handedness of the bridge molecules and could be significantly enhanced with the increasing of phonon wave vectors, displaying the crucial rules of the electron–phonon coupling for the spin selectivity effect in chiral structures. These results not only shed light on the microscopic mechanisms of chirality–induced spin selectivity but also enlighten the role of spin selectivity in electron transfer in chemical and biological systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a combined photoelectron spectroscopy and multilevel computational study [B3LYP/CCSD(T)] elucidating the geometric/electronic structure and aromatic stabilization of ruthenium-doped silicon clusters. Anion photoelectron spectrum of RuSi 12 − reveals two distinct detachment features at 3.34 eV [vertical detachment energy (VDE)] and 3.8–4.4 eV, with an adiabatic detachment energy (ADE) of 3.17 eV, indicating significant neutral-state structural reorganization. Theoretical analysis identifies the global minimum as a D 2d -symmetric bicapped pentagonal prism, validated by <5.5% deviation between experimental and calculated VDE/ADE. RuSi 12 neutral adopts a D 6h -symmetric hexagonal prism with elongated Ru–Si bonds (2.64 vs 2.57 Å in anion), demonstrating charge-state-dependent geometric flexibility. Natural population analysis reveals strong Ru–Si charge transfer (−3.487 e on Ru in anion), while molecular orbital and AdNDP/NICS analyses uncover unprecedented σ-aromaticity through 30 delocalized electrons (Hückel 4N + 2, N = 7) and diatropic ring currents. Comparative studies with NbSi 12 − highlight transition-metal-driven symmetry modulation: Ru’s 4 d -orbital participation enables adaptable bonding networks (WBI: Ru–Si = 0.44–0.48 vs Si–Si = 0.77–0.86), contrasting with Nb’s rigid σ/π-delocalized framework. This work establishes transition-metal doping as a strategic tool for tailoring silicon cluster properties in catalysis and nanoelectronics.},

This study investigates the reactivity of the T 1 state of 2-nitrofluorene, denoted as 2- 3 NF, toward proton, electron, and hydrogen donors in both polar aprotic and protic solvents, using nanosecond transient absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies. For the first time, we characterize 2- 3 NF in various solvents using these techniques. Our results reveal an acid–base equilibrium constant pK a of 1.8 for 2- 3 NF, indicating much stronger basicity compared to other NPAHs in their T 1 state. Resonance Raman and TA spectroscopic analyses confirm the presence of hydrogen-bond interaction between the 2- 3 NF and alcohol solvent molecules. This interaction significantly enhances the reduction potential of 2- 3 NF and influences its photoreduction reactivity with substrates such as 1,4-cyclohexadiene and 1-naphthol, where the electron transfer coupled with proton transfer is the primary mechanism. These results provide valuable insight into the role hydrogen bonds play in modulating the reduction reactivity and oxidation potential of NPAHs in their excited states. Furthermore, this study highlights the complex influence of solvent interactions on photochemical processes, emphasizing the importance of incorporating these effects in atmospheric chemistry studies.},

Here, we investigate the driving forces behind the reactions of these binary compounds with each other, traditionally described in the language of acid-base interactions. For example, why do Na 2 O and SO 3 (both of which have a closed-shell electronic structure) react with each other forming Na 2 SO 4 ? In addition to Na 2 SO 4 , we also consider the processes of formation of Mg 2 SiO 4 and MgAl 2 O 4 , tracking changes in chemical bonding characteristics and ionic charges of the constituent atoms. We show that in such acid-base reactions, electrons move from the atomic states with higher energies (from the basic oxide-forming element) to atoms with lower-energy states. This happens by changing the degrees of ionicity of bonds, without disrupting the closed-shell electronic structure.},

We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. In addition, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.},

  abstract     = {Friction from solute–solvent interactions governs processes from molecular diffusion to protein folding and is fundamental for understanding molecular dynamics in liquids. While the fluctuation–dissipation relation determines friction and diffusivity via the velocity autocorrelation function, this exact relation is inconvenient for interfacial systems involving extended surfaces. For interfacial systems, alternative approximate friction formulas based on the force autocorrelation function (FACF) have been introduced. However, these approaches face limitations due to the so-called plateau problem, where the FACF integral decays to zero at long times, complicating friction estimation in particular for small systems. We address these challenges by introducing an exact integral method that is based on the FACF and eliminates the plateau problem, ensuring robust convergence even for small systems. Validated through molecular dynamics simulations of molecular diffusion in SPC/E water, our approach accurately yields diffusivity and friction coefficients and enables decomposing diffusivity contributions into electrostatic and Lennard-Jones forces. Our findings provide a framework for estimating friction from molecular simulations and elucidating the dissipative effects of microscopic forces.},

However, this approach involves averaging the particles in a non-physically meaningful way, resulting in inaccurate centers of mass. Instead, the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this is computationally expensive and complex.

Here, we explore the steady-state optical response of molecular emitters within a lossy cavity, with a focus on the combined effects of static and dynamic disorders, as frequently observed in solution-phase experiments. By analyzing the transmission spectra, molecular energy change, and dark state population, we uncover the contrasting effects of static and dynamic disorders on the dark state population and its interplay with polariton states. We find that the Rabi splitting exhibits an inversion with increasing disorder strength, where the maximum splitting is determined by the interplay of static and dynamic disorders. Furthermore, we identify a dark state-induced polariton linewidth narrowing, revealing a mechanism distinct from motional narrowing induced by frequency fluctuations. These mechanistic insights highlight the critical role of dark states, establishing a foundation for future developments in the fields of polariton chemistry and strong coupling spectroscopy.},

The electronic structure of the molecule and of its cation was obtained with a semiempirical multireference configuration interaction approach, the nonadiabatic dynamics was simulated with the surface hopping algorithm, and the TRPES was determined by computing the relevant Dyson orbitals. According to our results, the TRPES obtained with a probe photon energy of 6.0 eV shows two bands, the one at higher energy being due to the S 2 electronic state of the molecule and the other one to the S 1 state. For both bands, the main contribution to the spectrum originates from the D 0 state of the cation. Our simulated TRPES is in very good agreement with the available experimental data, both in terms of the energetic positions of the bands and their lifetimes. Our findings confirm that the wavelength dependence of the photoisomerization quantum yields of trans -azobenzene is not due to a peculiar nonadiabatic decay process, as previously inferred from the experimental TRPES. Rather, the reason for the violation of Kasha’s rule is that different regions of the nuclear phase space are explored in S 1 , whether this state is populated by direct excitation or by the radiationless decay of S 2 .},

  abstract     = {Accurate modeling of the dynamic structures of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules is essential for understanding their biological roles. However, such modeling remains challenging due to limitations in current force fields. This study critically evaluates three RNA force fields, HB-CUFIX, AMBER- χ OL3, and AMBER-ROC, comparing their performance against experimental nuclear magnetic resonance and small-angle x-ray scattering data for single-stranded oligonucleotides. Using enhanced sampling techniques, specifically Unified Free Energy Dynamics, we exhaustively sampled the conformational space of tetramer and hexamer RNA sequences, achieving a detailed and thermodynamically converged view of their structural dynamics. Our findings reveal that HB-CUFIX outperforms AMBER- χ OL3 and AMBER-ROC, providing near-experimental accuracy in capturing sequence-dependent structural preferences. In particular, HB-CUFIX accurately predicts low energy states for the AAAA and CCCC sequences, favoring A-form helical conformations, while the UUUU sequence adopts an extended, heterogeneous structure. The mixed GACC sequence displays a predominantly A-form helix with flexible terminal residues. These results highlight the significant role of sequence in dictating RNA conformational spaces, which are driven by base stacking interactions and covalent geometry. We also emphasize the importance of enhanced sampling, particularly methods that can handle large numbers of collective variables, in evaluating RNA force fields, as traditional brute-force Molecular dynamics fails to capture the conformational diversity of flexible RNAs. Our study provides a reliable tool for RNA structure prediction and dynamic analysis, supporting future advancements in RNA-targeted research and therapeutic design.},

  abstract     = {The electron transfer steps in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, ubiquitous proteins with key roles in processes such as drug metabolism and steroidogenesis, are often rate-limiting. To predict ET rates from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using Marcus theory, values of the reaction free energy Δ G 0 and the reorganization free energy λ are required from either experiments or computations. For the reduction of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) by the secondary redox protein cytochrome b5 (CYb5), a critical step in the regulation of steroidogenesis, experimental measurements of λ are not available. We here describe the computation of λ for this system from a combination of molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics computations. Our results show that a quantum mechanical treatment of the redox-active cofactors is necessary, even though the surrounding protein and solvent, which are modeled classically, contribute most to the reorganization energy. The values of λ computed for structural ensembles corresponding to two predicted binding modes of the proteins are 1.23 and 1.16 eV. We find that the λ values computed for the individual soluble globular domains of the two proteins sum to approximately the λ values computed for the membrane-bound CYP17A1-CYb5 complex, indicating that additivity can be invoked in a computationally efficient approach to estimating λ values for such protein–protein complexes.},

  abstract     = {We combine polymer integral equation theory of structure with microscopic dynamical theories of activated relaxation to formulate a theory of ion hopping in supercooled polymerized ionic liquids (PolyILs) and glasses. Activation barriers and the mean ion relaxation time are analyzed as a function of the ion-to-monomer size ratio, polymer persistence length, intrachain degree of dynamic cooperativity, anion–cation Coulomb attraction strength, and dielectric constant. A general finding is the dominance of Coulomb cage correlations and anion–cation attractions in determining the hopping rate of the small ions studied. A critical finding is that the activation barrier exists only above a threshold value of the system-specific dimensionless Coulomb attraction strength. As a consequence, the barrier grows in a highly nonlinear manner with anion–cation attraction energy. This suggests a route to super-ionic transport via a relatively modest reduction of the Coulombic association energy, an effect that becomes more dramatic the smaller the mobile ion. The temperature-dependent growth of the ion relaxation time is non-Arrhenius in the supercooled liquid, but may, or may not, crossover to an apparent Arrhenius form in the glass depending on how the dielectric constant on the relevant timescale changes with temperature. The magnitude of dynamic decoupling between the ion and polymer alpha relaxation times at the laboratory glass transition, the degree of trajectory level coupling of the ion and monomer motion, and ion jump lengths are also determined. A high level discussion of the connections between theory, experiments, and simulations, and a quantitative application to specific lithium, sodium, and potassium PolyILs, are presented.},

Via simulations incorporating Langevin dynamics, we construct the related steady-state phase diagram. We exploit this knowledge to study structure and growth associated with kinetics following sudden quenches of homogeneous systems into the miscibility gap, for far-from-critical and near-critical densities. An advanced finite-size scaling technique is employed to calculate the growth exponents in the thermodynamically large system size limit, using data from systems of different finite sizes, for each of the cases. The growth data are described well by a recently constructed analytical function, irrespective of system size and particle density. Our results demonstrate enhancement in the growth exponent when the phoretic strength is increased. For the off-critical case, we have discussed the possible mechanism(s) in the background of an appropriate theoretical picture.},

  abstract     = {Multivalent DNA-bridging protein-mediated collapse of chromatin polymers have long been established as one of the driving factors in chromatin organization inside cells. These multivalent proteins can bind to distant binding sites along the chromatin backbone and bring them together in spatial proximity, leading to collapsed conformations. Recently, it has been suggested that these proteins not only drive the collapse of the chromatin polymer but also reswelling at higher concentrations. In this study, we investigate the physical mechanisms underlying this unexpected reswelling behavior. We use the Langevin dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained homopolymer to investigate the effects of the valencies of both the binders and the monomers on the polymer conformations. We find that while the extent of collapse of the polymer is strongly dependent on the binder valency, the extent of reswelling is largely determined by the monomer valency. Furthermore, we also discovered two different physical mechanisms that drive the reswelling of the polymer— excluded volume effects and loss of long-range loops . Finally, we obtain a classification map to determine the regimes in which each of these mechanisms is the dominant factor leading to polymer reswelling.},

  abstract     = {Polymer brushes are extensively used in various applications, such as antifouling coatings and biomedical sensors. Mixed solvents entail versatile regulations on the conformation of polymer brushes. The understanding of the conformation of polymer brushes in mixtures of two solvents, however, is far from mature. In this work, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) theory and an Alexander–de Gennes (A-dG) theory to examine the chain conformation of polymer brushes in mixtures of two miscible solvents. We systematically investigate how the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters among the three components, the composition of the mixed solvent, the grafting density, and the chain length, influence the brush height and the density profiles of various species. Our calculations exhibit many non-trivial phenomena, such as the collapse of brushes in mixtures of two good solvents and the worsening of solvent quality when adding a good solvent to a poor solvent. The physical mechanisms of these intriguing phenomena are rationalized via the interplay among the chain conformation entropy, the mixing entropy of the two solvents, and the competition in the interactions among the three species. Quantitative comparison between the SCF and the A-dG theories demonstrates that the latter theory can qualitatively capture the variation trends of the brush height and the average concentrations of different species, while the former theory can provide more detailed descriptions on the density profiles of various species in the brush. Our results here not only exhibit the richness and complexity of polymer brushes in mixed solvents but also provide valuable principles for the rational design of stimuli-responsive brushes.},

  abstract     = {Novel molecules containing a silane anchor, a hydrocarbon segment, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) head have been developed to functionalize membranes for capture of per and poly-fluoroalkyl species (PFAS). The membranes have been experimentally tested against PFAS-contaminated water. Based on previous experimental testing and molecular modeling, the length of the hydrophobic PEG segment was identified as a potential feature to improve filter performance, particularly against low molecular-weight, short-chain PFAS. In our previous work, silane molecules featured an eight-carbon hydrocarbon segment and a segment with four consecutive PEG monomers. In this work, versions of the silane molecules with both shorter and longer PEG segments were synthesized and tested. We report results from tests measuring the dynamic filtration ability of aluminum-oxide hydroxide membranes functionalized with amphiphilic molecules against PFAS at part-per trillion and part-per billion concentration levels. Filters utilizing silanes with shorter PEG segments outperformed those with longer PEG segments, particularly against short-chain PFAS. Molecular dynamics simulations using metadynamics sampling methods were employed to construct free-energy interaction profiles, and interaction energies between several different contaminant species and a silane brush layer. Decomposition of the interaction free energy into the molecular interaction contributions to the potential energy (enthalpy) highlights the influence of PFAS length, PEG length, and brush geometry on the overall PFAS–brush interaction. Experimental measurements indicate that membrane performance depends on the length of the PEG segment in the silane brush. Combined experimental and simulation results indicate that both the intermolecular interaction strength and the density of the surface coating depend on the length of the PEG segment. The experiment and simulation results also show that both molecular architecture and membrane processing impact the overall filter performance.},

The model is constructed to bridge the short-timescale interfacial dynamics observed in molecular simulations with the longer timescales observed in kinetic experiments. A simple set of governing differential equations is derived, which, when solved numerically or analytically, yield accurate predictions of multiphase kinetics in microdroplets.

  abstract     = {Complex pathways in spontaneous molecular assemblies have been envisaged to be crucial factors in determining diverse outcomes desirable for materials design. Computer simulations can be instrumental in elucidating early stages of the assembly process, where direct experimental observations are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we report a computational study on the pathway complexities in aqueous mixtures of hydrophobic tripeptides that self-assemble into amorphous nanoscale objects. We introduce a new algorithmic approach for “complete accounting” of the simulation data in terms of rearrangements of spatial clusters spanning multiple length and time scales without relying on a priori assumptions. The salient features of an assembly mechanism were analyzed by focusing on four types of “events” encompassing all possible redistribution of molecules among interacting clusters. The event tracking analysis of the dynamics of spontaneous assemblies observed in fully atomistic molecular dynamics trajectories of tri-phenylalanine, tri-leucine, and tri-isoleucine revealed non-classical pathways with a clear trend in terms of spatio-temporal hierarchy. The discernible differences between latter two systems, where the building blocks are constitutional isomers, were particularly striking. Tri-phenylalanine assembled by a strongly hierarchical mechanism involving fusions of clusters of varying sizes. On the other hand, tri-isoleucine mostly followed a ripening type growth process, where isolated molecules or small molecular clusters attached to a single growing cluster. The tri-leucine exhibited an intermediate behavior with subtle differences from other two systems. These results underscored the effectiveness of our new analysis protocol in deciphering pathway complexities in molecular assemblies hitherto unreported in the literature.},

First, we derive analytical expressions for the first- and second-order perturbation terms of the Helmholtz free energy in the 2D system, based on the radial distribution function of a hard-disk system. Next, we develop an adsorption model that accounts for the interactions between the adsorbed and bulk phases, incorporating the Mie pair potential as a function of repulsive and attractive exponents. The theoretical approach is validated against Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations for the adsorption isotherms of associating and non-associating fluids, showing excellent agreement. Finally, the 2D-SAFT-VR Mie approach is applied to describe the adsorption isotherms and isosteric heat of adsorption of methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water on carbonaceous materials, including dry activated carbon, zeolites, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The energy depth of the surface-particle potential ( ɛ w ) and the specific surface area ( a s ) are free molecular parameters determined by fitting to experimental adsorption isotherms. The obtained ɛ w and a s values are consistent with the experimental values of isosteric heat of adsorption at zero coverage and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, respectively. In all cases, the calculated adsorption behavior exhibits excellent agreement with experimental data. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights into the design and optimization of efficient fluid storage, separation, and purification systems in complex materials.},

  abstract     = {The self-limiting surface conversion reactions of alumina and alumina/aluminum metal heterostructures under HF exposure are studied at 1250 and 750 K, respectively, using a newly developed Al/O/H/F ReaxFF force field. Simulations reveal that surface termination and HF concentration significantly influence the fluorination behavior of alumina. The 100% Al-terminated α -Al 2 O 3 (0001) exhibits the highest degree of fluorination at equilibrium, while the O-rich surface shows negligible surface conversion. Increasing HF concentration on the Al-rich surface reveals the maximum surface fluorination, resulting in a 1.38 Å decrease in alumina thickness. During the fluorination of Al-terminated alumina, HF dissociates to form hydroxyl groups and fluorides. Subsequently, absorbed HF leads to H 2 O formation by transferring hydrogen to hydroxyls, removing surface oxygen and leaving surface Al unsaturated for further fluorination. As the solid AlF x layer thickens, conversion of the underlying surface relies on hydrogen diffusion from HF adsorbed on AlF x to the interfacial hydroxyls. This process ceases when the AlF x layer is thick enough to hinder any effective hydrogen diffusion. In heterostructures, Al atoms from the aluminum layer diffuse into the alumina, forming Al-enriched oxide layers that consume hydrogen and form volatile AlH x , along with solid AlF x , which significantly reduces the reliance on hydrogen diffusion for continued reaction. Under rarefied HF exposure, completely different reaction mechanisms emerge for alumina and heterostructures. Alumina quickly reaches equilibrium with minimal –F and –OH formation, while heterostructures predominately form AlH x and AlF x .},

  abstract     = {Negative differential resistance (NDR) phenomena in nanofluidic diodes are characterized by a decrease in the electrical current with the increase in the transmembrane potential beyond a system-dependent threshold voltage. Here, we describe the NDR due to a nanoscale salt precipitation that occurs in a conical nanopore in contact with two highly soluble salts in the external solutions. The new experimental design permits tunable and reproducible NDR effects that can be characterized from the I – V curves for different pairs of soluble salts reacting at the pore tip to form the salt precipitate. The effects of pH and salt concentration on the precipitation, together with the use of electrolytes with different temperature-dependent solubilities, provide a complete description of the chemical NDR mechanism. In addition, the good reproducibility and stability observed over different voltage cycles suggest that the threshold potential needed for precipitation can be used for Ca 2+ sensing in the range 1–1000 mM.},

  abstract     = {The dielectric constant of electrolytes, typically assumed constant at the macroscale, exhibits significant reduction under nanoscale confinement (<10 nm), as observed in confined liquids such as water. For supercapacitors employing MXene electrodes, understanding these variations is crucial for elucidating energy storage mechanisms at the solid–liquid interface. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the reduction of the dielectric constant in organic solvents under confinement. By analyzing ethylene carbonate (EC), we reveal that confinement alters the charge density distribution of the electrolyte, enhancing local polarization correlation and causing an anomalous decrease in the dielectric constant near the surface. To address this issue, we propose a binary mixing strategy on EC-based. By balancing local and global polarization, this approach effectively mitigates the reduction of the dielectric constant. The optimized mixture not only maintains dielectric performance but also increases the diffusion coefficient fourfold compared to pure EC. Our findings provide a novel approach for designing high-performance electrolytes for supercapacitors operating under confined environments.},

  abstract     = {In semiconductor-based microlasers, the lasing performance and device properties are closely related to the behavior of the excited carriers. Comprehending their laser mechanisms and controlling laser behavior on ultrafast timescales is crucial. This paper employs a microscopic optical Kerr-gate method to investigate the lasing dynamic in a composite perovskite micro/nanostructure. The results show that the laser dynamics are influenced by bandgap renormalization and band-filling (BF) effects. At lower levels of pump fluence, the energy transfer process has the potential to impact the refractive index, resulting in a negligible transient mode shift. At higher levels of pump fluence, the observed extension of the stimulated radiation lifetime indicates the involvement of the hot carrier cooling process in laser emission. This mechanism facilitates the modulation of energy level occupancy states, resulting in a stable resonance wavelength during the initial few picoseconds. As the hot carriers cool, the BF effect can induce a notable change in the refractive index, leading to a redshift in the resonant modes. This study can offer insights into the lasing behavior driven by carrier dynamics and provide a promising strategy to regulate lasing performance in microcavity at ultrafast timescale.},

  abstract     = {Atomic deuterium adsorption on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been achieved with a high deuteration level (≃70% of deuterated carbon atoms), and studied using complementary spectroscopic techniques, namely, photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. As a consequence of the deuterium (D) adsorption on the MWCNTs, the sp 2 bonds of the C atoms are distorted toward an sp 3 configuration, and the π plasmon excitation of the metallic MWCNTs is quenched, suggesting the transition to a semiconducting phase. Such a controlled deuteration in ultra-high vacuum conditions induces the opening of an energy gap in the metallic MWCNTs, with the valence band maximum at about ∼3.1 eV below the Fermi level. The bond distortion and the strain induced by the D uptake is evidenced by the modification of the Raman response. This work shows that the molecular cracking of D 2 in ultra-high vacuum is an efficient way to obtain stable, homogeneous, and high uptake of deuterium atoms with minimal presence of defects.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven material designs often encounter challenges from small and imbalanced datasets. The complex structural and physicochemical properties of hybrid halide perovskites, coupled with these limitations, create obstacles for performing feature engineering and extracting key fingerprints. Herein, we employed a physical-informed data-driven modeling approach to identify lattice geometric fingerprints, such as the distortion index (DI) and effective coordination number (ECoN), and to establish a robust structure–property relationship mapping the electronic bandgap, resulting in improved model performance. Lattice compression simulations across multiple phases of MAPbI 3 further confirmed a strong correlation between DI and ECoN with the electronic bandgap, validating the robustness of the selected octahedra geometrical fingerprints. By adjusting the s – p antibonding coupling, the pressure-driven reduction in local octahedral distortion, induced by the anisotropic hydrogen bonding between the inorganic framework and organic cation, narrows the electronic bandgap and facilitates the p – p transitions, thereby boosting the transition dipole moment and band-edge absorption. Combining data mining with physical analysis, we have successfully clarified the significant impact of lattice geometry on the electronic properties and identified key octahedral geometric fingerprints for effectively describing the electronic bandgap, while also revealing the microphysical mechanisms of local octahedral distortion on the optoelectronic properties of hybrid halide perovskites.},

Among them, metal-bearing nitrogen-rich compounds with pentazolate anion (cyclo-N 5 − ) are highly desirable in basic research and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive simulation of the pressurized germanium–nitrogen system based on the strategy of introducing a small amount of metal into nitrogen and designing a previously unknown unconventional stoichiometric material, GeN 20 , being stable at 49 GPa through a first-principles structure search method. Strikingly, the cyclo-N 5 − anionic unit, acting as an energy storage carrier, is revealed in Ge(N 5 ) 4 , the formation mechanism of which is attributed to strong covalent N–N bonds and charge transfer from Ge to N. Furthermore, the robust dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stabilities of Ge(N 5 ) 4 predict its feasibility of synthesis in the future. In addition, Ge(N 5 ) 4 has a relatively high energy density (4.1 kJ g −1 ), which is comparable to the energy density of TNT (4.2 kJ g −1 ). Remarkably, Ge(N 5 ) 4 has a high detonation pressure (619 kbar) and a high explosion velocity (11.42 km s −1 ), which are approximately three times the detonation pressure of TNT (190 kbar) and twice the explosion velocity of TNT (6.9 km s −1 ), respectively, and it produces a more environmentally friendly detonation product composition. Moreover, Ge(N 5 ) 4 hosts an indirect bandgap of 3.0 eV and exhibits optical absorption performance. These findings have valuable implications for the rational design and synthesis of novel multifunctional nitrogen-based materials.},

The most accurate approach employs scanning tunneling microscopy lithography, which may be done with atomic precision. However, the accuracy decreases when phosphorus is incorporated into the surface because P substitutes one of two neighboring Si atoms with equal probability. Here, the P–Si exchange mechanism was studied theoretically on a chlorinated Si(100) surface with an asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies surrounding the P atom. Density functional theory was used to estimate the activation barriers and exchange rates between a P atom and neighboring Si atoms on a Si(100)-2 × 1-Cl surface with three Cl vacancies. The calculation of various P–Si exchange pathways revealed that phosphorus has a higher probability of substituting one Si atom than the others due to the asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies. Based on the theoretical study of the P–Si exchange mechanism and experimental results from previous studies, a scheme for controlled P incorporation into the silicon surface without uncertainty is proposed.},

  abstract     = {Several macroscopic-phenomenological theories exist that account for dissipative effects in the dynamic behavior of glass-forming materials. Thermodynamics with internal state variables, for example, provides a rationale for assessing the multiplicity of relaxation mechanisms observed in the linear dynamic heat capacity, expansivity, and compressibility. However, the convoluted formalism of these theories often obstructs the assessment of microscopic characteristics associated with material behavior that can otherwise be studied within linear response theory. In this work, we address this problem by deriving memory functionals of the entropy and volume from a set of ordinary differential equations posed by the normal-coordinate transform of the internal state variables. A generalized susceptibility matrix that represents the linear dynamic material behavior in the frequency domain is the result. In agreement with microscopic reversibility, the generalized susceptibility matrix and its time-domain transform are symmetric, thus substantiating the hypothesis of equal distribution of relaxation times in pressure-jump entropy relaxation and temperature-jump volume relaxation. The Prigogine–Defay ratio in terms of equilibrium fluctuations is obtained from the imaginary part of the generalized susceptibility matrix via the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. By combining fundamentals from classical irreversible thermodynamics and rational thermodynamics to derive the memory functionals, this work contributes to a theoretical framework for assessing macroscopic-phenomenological and microscopic characteristics of glass-forming materials associated with the linear dynamic heat capacity, expansivity, and compressibility. In addition, a compilation of the generalized susceptibility and its time-domain transform, both evaluated for the relaxation-time distributions that lead to the Debye, Kohlrausch, Cole–Cole, Davidson–Cole, and Havriliak–Negami relaxation functions, is provided.},

In the strongly non-Arrhenius temperature regime below the onset temperature T A , we find that C B ( t ) can be described using the same generic double-stretched-exponential functional form that is often utilized to fit the self-intermediate scattering function S ( q , t ) of glass-forming liquids in this regime. The ratio of the bond lifetime τ bond associated with C B ( t )’s slower decay mode to the α -relaxation time τ α varies appreciably and non-monotonically with T , peaking at τ bond / τ α ≃ 45 at T ≃ T x , where T x is a crossover temperature separating the high- and low-temperature regimes of glass-formation. In contrast, τ bond remains on the order of the overlap time τ ov (the time interval over which a typical particle moves by half its diameter), and the peak time τ χ for the susceptibility χ B ( t ) associated with the spatial heterogeneity of C B ( t ) remains on the order of τ imm (the characteristic lifetime of immobile-particle clusters), even as each of these quantities varies by roughly 5 orders of magnitude over our studied range of T .

In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to compute the growth rates of four ice phases: I h , III, V, and VI. To enable comparisons at the same temperature, different pressures were applied to each phase. Our analysis of pressure effects on the growth rate of ice I h revealed only a minor influence, allowing us to attribute variations in growth rates primarily to structural differences among ice phases. We observed that ices I h and VI exhibit similar growth rates, whereas ices III and V grow significantly faster. Rapidly growing ice phases exhibit a high growth efficiency, meaning that less molecular motion is needed to form the solid. We hypothesize that proton ordering may influence ice growth, as partially ordered ice phases (III and V) exhibit faster growth rates than fully disordered phases (I h and VI). Alternative explanations for ice growth rate trends, such as unit cell complexity or melting entropy, are ruled out. Finally, we assessed the predictive capability of the Wilson–Frenkel theory. While the theory does not inherently account for structural complexity—resulting in similar growth rates across all phases—we found that introducing a phase-specific characteristic length enables it to accurately reproduce our simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Supercritical fluids (SCFs) have attracted significant attention as solvents for chemical reactions due to their unique properties, such as high diffusivity, low viscosity, and tunable solvation properties. These properties profoundly influence reaction kinetics and are often attributed to the formation of molecular clusters within SCFs. To study the effect of supercritical solvent on chemical reactivity and dynamics of reactions, one needs to understand the dynamics of clusters in supercritical fluid. Extensive experiments on the photodissociation and recombination of iodine in supercritical fluids served as a model system for understanding these effects. Experimental studies have been complemented by theoretical and computational investigations, which mostly employ Monte Carlo or empirical molecular dynamics simulations. However, computational studies using non-reactive force fields and ab initio approaches present challenges in capturing reactive processes at larger scales within supercritical fluids. In this work, we developed the ReaxFF parameters by training against quantum mechanics data. ReaxFF reactive force field based molecular dynamics simulations were performed, studying the dynamics of a xenon solvent and cage effect at different thermodynamic conditions for the iodine recombination reaction. We show that the conditions near the critical point are the optimal conditions to study the cage effect. We show that the average lifetime of xenon clusters ranging between 5 and 11 ps is comparable to iodine geminate recombination. Our simulation results of iodine recombination in xenon solvent demonstrate the higher probability of iodine molecule formation in the presence of xenon clusters. Finally, we show that the supercritical condition exhibits the highest recombination rate for iodine atoms.},

  abstract     = {Non-equilibrium spin-chain systems have been attracting increasing interest in energy transport. This work studies a one-dimensional non-equilibrium Ising chain immersed in a tilted magnetic field, where every spin contacts a Boson reservoir with the dissipative system–environment interaction. We analytically investigate the dynamics and the steady-state energy transport taking advantage of the Born–Markov-secular master equation. In the longitudinal field, one can find that the non-dissipative N ′ spins decompose the spin chain into N ′ + 1 independent subchains and block the heat currents from the hot end to the cool end. Moreover, for the non-dissipative μ th spin, its nearest two bulk spins become the nodal spins in the subchains and have the corresponding energy correction of ± J μ −1, μ and ± J μ , μ +1 depending on the excited/ground state of the μ th spin. Therefore, a magnetically controlled heat modulator can be designed by adjusting the direction of the magnetic field in which the non-dissipative spin is located. For the transverse field case, the whole Hilbert space of the chain can always be divided into two independent subspaces regardless of whether the bulk spin is dissipative. This work provides new insight into the dynamics and energy transport of the dissipative Ising model.},

However, the mechanism underlying the formation of HONO remains unclear. To elucidate the mechanism of HONO formation, sequential (stepwise) reactions of H 2 O with NO + were investigated using direct ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. The target reactions were NO + (H 2 O) + H 2 O and NO + (H 2 O) 2 + H 2 O, i.e., NO + (H 2 O) n−1 + H 2 O → HONO–H + (H 2 O) n−1 (HONO product) ( n = 2–5). In the case of n = 2, only the solvation of NO + by H 2 O was found: NO + (H 2 O) + H 2 O → NO + (H 2 O) n (solvation product) ( n = 2). HONO was obtained as the product at n = 3, although the reaction efficiency was low. The HONO product was efficiently formed when n = 4–5. The mechanism of HONO formation and the role of H 2 O in the reactions are discussed based on theoretical analysis.},

These spectra are primarily influenced by two key contributions to the oscillator strength—the electric dipole and quadrupole transition moments—due to the possible mixing of 3 d and 4 p orbitals in transition metal atoms. The EOM-CC singles and doubles method incorporating a recently implemented formalism that includes all the second-order contributions to oscillator strength [i.e., beyond the customary dipole approximation, Park et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 094103 (2021)] provides a powerful tool for computing excitation energies and oscillator strengths. This approach enables accurate interpretation of experimental spectra and facilitates predictions when experimental data are unavailable.

Different local mechanisms form pathways between H-bond configurations—intrabond motion of all protons in an ordered cycle of H-bonds, rotation of a pair of H-bonded water molecules, as well as the classical Grotthuss mechanism in charged clusters—resulting in extended proton rearrangement networks. An outstanding problem is whether these reaction networks are connected or fall apart into disconnected fragments to set barriers to proton dynamics. Here, the topological aspect of this problem is addressed. The network connectivity for individual mechanisms and their combinations is studied analytically using basic tools of graph theory. The connectivity is proven for wide classes of water clusters, manifesting the great power of the simple mechanisms in the interconversion of H-bond configurations. The structural motifs leading to the disintegration of proton rearrangement networks are identified. The analytical conclusions are complemented by a numerical examination of characteristic clusters. The results are relevant to studies of water-based ferroelectrics. They provide a framework for the analysis of proton dynamics in water clusters.},

The spin state (singlet or triplet) of nitrene formed in the first step of the reaction is temperature-dependent. At low temperatures (T ≤ 650 K), both states are formed with almost the same probability; in contrast, at high temperatures (T ≥ 1000 K), singlet nitrene is the majority intermediate. From this singlet nitrene, three stable reaction products were detected in the experiments: an imine derivative, a four-member cyclic derivative, and a sulfenyl derivative.},

High-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) yields an electron affinity of 2.440(1) eV for the 2-AT radical while also resolving several vibrational frequencies for its ground electronic state and complex autodetachment features. Photodetachment spectroscopy further identifies both bound and unbound valence-excited states of the 2-AT − anion with rich vibronic features. Single-color resonant two-photon PES via these bound excited states reveals different photophysical processes, including resonant two-photon detachment via S 1 and autodetaching resonances above the detachment threshold. The current work uncovers the second PAH anion with bound electronic excited states and provides valuable experimental information about the electronic structure and photophysics of the 2-AT − anion and the 2-AT radical.},

  abstract     = {Photochemistry of aromatic compounds has attracted significant interest for their distinctive excited-state behavior and potential applications as energy materials. Isoelectronic atomic substitution, which involves replacing ring atoms while maintaining the same number of electrons in aromatic compounds (e.g., from C–C to B–N), offers a promising strategy for modulating these properties by tuning electronic structures. However, a fundamental understanding of its effect on the excited-state dynamics and reactivity remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the photochemical properties of oxaborine, using benzene and azaborine as references, to elucidate the effects of isoelectronic atomic substitution. Potential energy surface (PES) calculations reveal that oxaborine undergoes barrierless ring distortion toward S 1 /S 0 conical intersection (CI), followed by barrierless Dewar isomerization directly from the S 1 /S 0 CI. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we observe a rapid S 1 decay time (125 fs) and a notably high Dewar isomerization yield (23.3%), consistent with the results of PES calculations, highlighting the unique photochemical properties of oxaborine. Orbital-level analysis reveals that atomic substitution breaks the π orbital degeneracy and destabilizes the S 1 state, explaining the much faster S 1 decay for azaborine and oxaborine. The p orbital energy modulations from O–B or N–B substitution weaken the meta-bridge bond while enhancing para-bridge C–C interactions, favoring Dewar isomerization. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of the effect of isoelectronic atomic substitution in aromatic compounds and demonstrate its potential as a design strategy for controlling photochemical properties.},

Here, we harness the coherence and ultrashort pulse characteristics of an x-ray free electron laser to directly probe atomic-scale ultrafast relaxation dynamics in the model system Ge 15 Te 85 . We demonstrate an analysis strategy for determining the intermediate scattering function by extracting the contrast decay of summed scattering patterns from two rapidly successive, nearly identical femtosecond x-ray pulses generated by a split-delay system. The result indicates a full decorrelation of atomic-scale order on the sub-picosecond timescale, supporting the argument for a high-fluidity fragile state of liquid Ge 15 Te 85 above its dynamic crossover temperature. The demonstrated strategy opens an avenue for experimental studies of relaxation dynamics in liquids, glasses, and other highly disordered systems.},

  abstract     = {We present a generalization of the Linear Response Elimination of the Small Component (LRESC) formalism for the calculation of the nuclear magnetic shielding tensor, extending the method to account for the shielding anisotropic parameters, asymmetry, and anisotropy in molecules of any symmetry. The most significant contributions to the off-diagonal tensor elements come from terms related to the angular momentum and spin in the paramagnetic term. Among these, the σ SOS correction, related to the spin Zeeman and the spin–orbit mechanisms, plays a crucial role. This term was previously computed only for molecules with linear symmetry, and we successfully extend its inclusion to systems of arbitrary symmetry. This is performed through two different approaches, although further development is required to evaluate it directly in the Schrödinger manifold of states. We apply the LRESC model to HX, SnH 3 X, and chiral CHFClX molecular systems (X = Br, I). The resulting anisotropic parameters are in very good agreement with those obtained from four component Dirac–Hartree–Fock calculations. We show that only the ligand-like group of LRESC corrections, to which σ SOS belongs, is enough to describe the anisotropic parameters, instead of using the whole set of LRESC corrections. LRESC is proved to be a powerful tool for elucidating the electronic mechanisms that give rise to relativistic effects also in the anisotropic parameters in systems containing heavy atoms up to the fifth row of the Periodic Table.},

  abstract     = {We present two schemes coupling a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) (devoted to standard and polarizable force fields) and an approach to explicitly account for uniformly distributed background charges to simulate periodically replicated molecular systems with a net charge. These schemes rely on recent analytical relations allowing one to compute the electrostatic potential generated by a uniformly charged cube at any point in space. Whereas the first scheme considers the exact relations, the second one is based on grid interpolation of precomputed data for equal precision. Contrary to available approaches, our coupled schemes prevent the use of Ewald summation techniques as usually proposed in periodic FMM approaches. For a polarizable force field (based on induced dipole moments), we show the ability of our schemes to model molecular neutral and charged systems at the same level of accuracy as the Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald (SPME) approach, to predict usual properties. Moreover, our most efficient scheme, based on interpolating precomputed grid data, is already more efficient than SPME to simulate 3000 atom size periodic systems and one order of magnitude more efficient to compute electrostatic terms of periodic systems at the 100k atom size and above.},

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in resolving the underlying conformational dynamics of molecular systems. However, their capability to correctly reproduce and predict dynamics in agreement with experiments is limited by the accuracy of the force-field model. This capability can be improved by refining the structural ensembles or the force-field parameters. Furthermore, discrepancies with experimental data can be due to imprecise forward models, namely, functions mapping simulated structures to experimental observables. Here, we introduce MDRefine , a Python package aimed at implementing the refinement of the ensemble, the force field, and/or the forward model by comparing MD-generated trajectories with the experimental data. The software consists of several tools that can be employed separately from each other or combined together in different ways, providing a seamless interpolation between these three different types of refinement. We use some benchmark cases to show that the combined approach is superior to separately applied refinements. MDRefine has been released as an open-source package under the LGPLv2+ license.

To investigate this dependency, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the PWWP domain and histone fragments. We found that not only hydrophobic interaction but also electrostatic interaction is important. The binding is not maintained with nonmethylated and monomethylated H3K36 because the tips of these H3K36s form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, while dimethylated and trimethylated H3K36 form no such hydrogen bond, making this binding stable.},

  abstract     = {One of the key structural proteins in the eukaryotic cell nucleus is lamin. Lamins can assemble into a two-dimensional protein meshwork at the nuclear periphery, known as the nuclear lamina, which provides rigidity and shape to the nucleus. Mutations in lamin proteins that alter the structure of the nuclear lamina underlie laminopathic diseases, including Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). Experiments have shown that, compared to healthy cells, lamin supramolecular structures (e.g., protofilaments) assemble into a thicker lamina in HGPS, where they form highly stable nematic microdomains at the nuclear periphery, reminiscent of liquid crystals. This significantly alters the morphological and mechanical properties of the nucleus. In this study, we investigate the aggregation of lamin fibrous structures and their dissociation kinetics from the nuclear periphery by modeling them as coarse-grained, rod-like polymer chains confined within a rigid spherical shell. Our model reproduces the formation of multidirectional nematic domains at the nuclear surface and the reduced lamin dissociation observed in HGPS nuclei by adjusting lamin concentration, lamin–lamin (head–tail), and lamin–shell association strengths. While nematic phase formation requires relatively strong lamin–shell affinity under any non-vanishing inter-lamin attraction, the thickness of the lamina layer is primarily controlled by the head–tail association strength in the model. Furthermore, the unbinding kinetics of lamin chains from the lamina exhibit a concentration-dependent facilitated dissociation, suppressed by strong intra-lamin interactions, reminiscent of diseased nuclei. Overall, our calculations reveal the physical mechanisms by which mutations affecting native lamin interactions and concentration could lead to an abnormal nuclear lamina in laminopathic diseases.},

This property makes pNIPAM microgels highly appealing for diverse applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and sensors, where temperature-triggered changes in size, charge, and mechanical properties are advantageous. However, a plethora of data available in the literature regarding the relationship between the crosslinking density and the above-mentioned properties of pNIPAM microgels necessitates a consolidation and re-examination. This study aims to address two key objectives: (1) elucidate the relationship between the crosslinking density and size/electrophoretic mobility of pNIPAM microgels, building upon existing knowledge, and (2) examine the influence of crosslinking density on transition temperatures, particularly the electrokinetic transition temperature, which is not well explored and understood. To achieve these objectives, we synthesized 20 batches of pNIPAM microgels using two distinct synthesis routes: 18 batches via conventional one-pot synthesis, with triplicate replicates for six crosslinking densities, and two batches of pNIPAM microgels via semi-batch synthesis, with a duplicate replicate for one crosslinking density. These microgels were characterized using a combination of dynamic light scattering to determine the size and thermoresponsive behavior, electrophoretic light scattering to analyze electrophoretic mobility, and atomic force microscopy to evaluate the structural morphology and assess stiffness. The insights from the characterization techniques enhance our understanding of how the crosslinking density influences the physical and electrokinetic properties of pNIPAM microgels, potentially creating a pathway for rational design of microgels tailored for specific applications.},

In the present work, to explore the temperature-dependent local and global dynamic properties of atactic polystyrene (PS) as well as the dynamic consistency of a PS CG model constructed via a structure- and thermodynamics-based CG approach with the united-atom (UA) counterpart, we have investigated and compared the translational and rotational dynamics of the two models in the scale from a single monomer to a global chain in a broad temperature range. The CG model accurately reproduces the time-dependent translational diffusion scaling and the shift from a multistep relaxation to a single-step long-time decay process with increasing span of bond vectors as the UA model. There exists the coupling of the conformational relaxation and diffusion of the PS chains to the local structural α -relaxation. Both diffusion coefficients and relaxation times of the UA and CG models show the same temperature dependence and follow a power-law relationship of mode-coupling theory. These findings advance our understanding of the complex dynamics of atactic PS and give a sounder basis for the further development of CG PS models with the (time-dependent) frictional correction to perform a quantitative study of structural relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity near glass transition temperature.},

Memory effects, the inherent time correlation in random noise, significantly influence molecular diffusive behaviors. However, estimating the intrinsic noise correlation time remains challenging because of difficulties in measuring the memory term. We propose a metric to probe the noise correlation time based on the deviation between characteristic times of configurational diffusion and “diffusion motion” in the kinetic energy space. This approach stems from the observation that memory effects delay relaxation time between displacement and velocity response functions. Our metric relies solely on the velocity autocorrelation function, commonly used in experimental model parameterization. Both analytical and numerical results for various physical models demonstrate its effectiveness in probing noise correlation time. Furthermore, we apply this metric to study complex diffusive phenomena, including non-exponential relaxation in molecular hydrodynamics and anomalous diffusion in crowded environments. By comparing with system’s relaxation time, we reveal that long-range noise correlations play a key role in these non-trivial diffusive phenomena.},

Herein, a facile synthesis strategy was developed by combining gel coating, carbonization, and molten salt-assisted magnesiothermic reduction (MSA-MR), and a unique tremella-like Si/C composite with internal void structure (IV-Si/C) was successfully prepared. The working mechanisms of both sodium alginate (SA) and molten salt (NaCl) on the successful preparation of the target IV-Si/C nanocomposite were also investigated in detail. It was demonstrated that, α-L-guluronic (G) blocks in SA can be cross-linked with cations to promote the interactions with silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) particles, boosting uniform distribution of nanosized Si particles in the SA-derived carbon matrix. Meanwhile, NaCl generated from SA not only effectively boosted the crystallization of SiO 2 during the high-temperature carbonization process but also can effectively inhibit the formation of inert SiC and strengthen reduction of carbon during the MSA-MR treatment, resulting in successful preparation of the tremella-like Si/C composite with abundant internal voids. Benefitting from its unique structure, when used as an alternative anode material for electrochemical lithium storage, the as-obtained IV-Si/C nanocomposite delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 1899.6 mAh g −1 with an initial Coulomb efficiency of 75.96% and superior rate capability and long-term cycling stability. This facile and low-cost synthesis strategy may shed light on the controllable preparation of functional nanomaterials with unique structures, especially high-performance Si/C anode materials for their large-scale application in LIBs.},

In the present work, we demonstrate how such an augmentation can be accomplished via Δ-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The Δ-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model, and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al. , Nat. Mach. Intell. 5 , 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the “8” Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared with that discussed in recent density functional theory-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111), the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based Δ-model formulated on CHGNet’s own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal–sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on, leading to an overreliance on sulfur–sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj, show a similar behavior but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.},

It is shown that a two-dimensional (2D) array of hard disks being confined laterally within a quasi-1D hard wall channel of the width commensurate the bulk 2D triangular lattice at disks close packing, possesses a bimodal probability distribution for the distance between the disk’s left and right nearest neighbors. The observed feature aligns with the concept of locally favored structures intensively exploited in the studies of anomalous thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of hydrogen-bonding fluids, except that the reported case is driven by entropic bonding only. The bimodality is observed in a range of densities associated with the vicinity of freezing transition in bulk 2D hard disks, indicating a crossover from the “gas-like” to “liquid-like” state in confined quasi-1D hard disks. Such a phenomenon was not reported for bulk 2D hard disks and is physically unexpected for confined q1D hard disks.},

  abstract     = {Seeded molecular dynamics represents an increasingly popular approach to investigate crystal nucleation via computer simulations. This method involves the insertion of crystalline seeds into the supercooled liquid phase (often over a range of temperatures or sizes) in order to measure their evolution in time. When dealing with the prototypical scenario of crystal nucleation from Lennard-Jones melts, these seeds are artificially constructed to be approximately spherical fcc nuclei. In addition, the order parameter used to monitor the time evolution of a seed is typically chosen as the number of crystal-like atoms within it—consistent with the tenets of classical nucleation theory. However, evidence suggests that these artificially constructed seeds might be rather different from the crystalline nuclei formed during unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, previous studies of Lennard-Jones crystallization indicate that non-spherical, as well as bcc, nuclei might be involved with the nucleation process. In this work, we assess the impact of the choice of the initial crystalline nuclei in the context of seeded molecular dynamics by directly comparing two different classes of seeds. Specifically, we consider either crystalline nuclei extracted from “brute force” nucleation trajectories (“unbiased seed”) or artificially constructed fcc spherical nuclei (“constructed seeds”). We show that the properties of these two classes of seeds, most notably their committor probability distributions, are markedly different. We also discuss the importance of choosing an appropriate order parameter for seeded molecular dynamics simulations and the implications of our results in the context of estimating crystal nucleation rates via computer simulations.},

Using the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory, we estimate the solute partitioning ratios in solid–liquid phase equilibria. The chemical potential difference between the solvent and solute atoms in both solid and liquid phases is calculated using thermodynamic integration. As an illustration of the techniques, we have applied this method to reproduce the phase diagram of the Al–Mg alloy at zero pressure. We also compute the ab initio solid–liquid coexistence curve of pure Al by applying the phase-coexistence method with the free energy correction technique.

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanisms underlying vapor bubble nucleation on solid surfaces is critical for multiple scientific and engineering applications, such as two-phase thermal management systems and turbomachinery, among others. While classical nucleation theory (CNT) explains how surface wettability influences nucleation by modifying the free energy barrier for smooth surfaces, the interplay between nanoscale surface roughness and wettability for rough surfaces remains less clear. Using molecular dynamics simulations, this study demonstrates that CNT can accurately describe wettability effects on nucleation. In addition, we show how surface cavities can create active nucleation sites without requiring trapped gases. This occurs through spontaneous dewetting of cavities at elevated temperatures, which reduces the nucleation barrier. Our results reveal that cavity-induced nucleation enhancement depends on both wettability and geometry, with dewetting promoting nucleation on lyophobic surfaces and rewetting neutralizing this effect for more lyophilic surfaces. These findings provide insights for designing surfaces to either enhance or suppress bubble nucleation.},

Time-resolved measurements of the kinetic energy released upon hydrogen atom loss from C 9 H 8 + ⁠ , analyzed in view of a model of tunneling through a potential energy barrier, provide the dissociation rate coefficient. Master equation simulations of the dissociation in competition with vibrational and electronic radiative cooling reproduce the measured dissociation rate.

Especially, the dynamic characters of bulky alkyl substitution halides remain unclear due to its complexity. Here, we present direct dynamics simulations of the fluoride anion reaction with isopropyl chloride, uncovering distinct dynamical behaviors compared to its ethyl chloride counterpart. Reaction dynamics simulation capture the key trends observed in differential scattering experiment, demonstrating predominant preference for the direct E2 pathway through stripping mechanisms at 1.9 eV of collision energy. Notably, an enhancement of indirect mechanisms emerges with increasing methyl substitution (from ethyl to isopropyl chloride), even at the high collision energy where such pathways are typically suppressed. This phenomenon arises from the synergistic effects of ion-induced dipole forces and van der Waals interactions between the reactants, coupled with the alkyl substitution-induced stabilization of the entrance-channel complex, which collectively prolong the interaction timescales. This work deepens an atomistic dynamics understanding of sterically hindered systems and highlights the role of the entrance channel on the chemical dynamics.},

The experiment was performed by our novel photoelectron imaging technique using a high-repetition-rate tunable laser [T. Horio et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 026101 (2025)]. The LF-PAD for σ u is found to be highly energy-dependent in a photoelectron kinetic energy (PKE) range from 0 to 1.57 eV; an isotropic LF-PAD with an anisotropy parameter β ∼ 0 is observed at the detachment threshold, exemplifying the Wigner threshold law, whereas the β value decreases down to β = −0.4 at 0.46 eV, followed by an increase up to β = 0.6 at 1.57 eV, as PKE increases. A small dip discernible in the PKE range of 1.2–1.3 eV suggests an influence of the autodetachment process on the β value, which is via bound electronic state(s) embedded in the D 0 ( 2 Σ u + ) + e − continuum. On the other hand, the LF-PAD for σ g exhibits a strong anisotropy parallel to the laser polarization with β of ∼1 in 0–0.39 eV. These contrasted trends are qualitatively reproduced by theoretical modeling of LF-PAD that accounts for photoelectron partial waves allowed for each photodetachment process. Furthermore, two-photon detachment spectra via the excited S 1 ( 1 Σ u + ) state are presented, where the relative band intensities for the two detachment channels, D 0 ( 2 Σ u + ) + e − ← S 1 ( 1 Σ u + ) and D 1 ( 2 Σ g + ) + e − ← S 1 ( 1 Σ u + ), are discussed in terms of their leading electronic configurations.},

Our investigation complements the simulation studies of the same process within this special issue. It provides information about both electronic state population and structural dynamics through well-separable inelastic and elastic electron scattering signatures. We observe the depopulation of the photoexcited S 2 state of cyclobutanone with n3s Rydberg character through its inelastic electron scattering signature with a time constant of (0.29 ± 0.2) ps toward the S 1 state. The S 1 state population undergoes ring-opening via a Norrish Type-I reaction, likely while passing through a conical intersection with S 0 . The corresponding structural changes can be tracked by elastic electron scattering signatures. These changes appear with a delay of (0.14 ± 0.05) ps with respect to the initial photoexcitation, which is less than the S 2 depopulation time constant. This behavior provides evidence for the ballistic nature of the ring-opening once the S 1 state is reached. The resulting biradical species react further within (1.2 ± 0.2) ps via two rival fragmentation channels yielding ketene and ethylene, or propene and carbon monoxide. Our study showcases the value of both gas-phase ultrafast diffraction studies as an experimental benchmark for nonadiabatic dynamics simulation methods and the limits in the interpretation of such experimental data without comparison with such simulations.},

Electronic excitation leads to rapid intramolecular electron transfer, while the decay of the resulting state corresponds to back electron transfer to the electronic ground state. Thus, Betaine-30’s photophysics offers a route to probing the role that vibrational excitation and solvent dynamics play in electron transfer reaction rates. Here, we probe the excited state dynamics of Betaine-30 in two solvents (ethanol and acetonitrile) by means of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. Population dynamics in ethanol are measured at two pump wavelengths, and global analysis reveals a wavelength dependence of the electron transfer rate. This is assigned to excitation of distinct ground state conformers, which is confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. “Beatmaps” of coherently excited vibrations are recovered and analyzed in terms of the contribution of Raman active modes in ground and excited states. The contribution of modes in the excited state is a strong function of the rate of the electron transfer reaction.},

  abstract     = {Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a critical non-selective cation channel involved in various biological and physiological processes, making it a promising drug target for treating multiple diseases. Capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, is widely used to relieve pain by desensitizing the TRPV1 with persistent stimulation. However, the initially intolerable burning sensation due to TRPV1 activation necessitates the use of antagonists to deactivate TRPV1 and mitigate discomfort, which yet causes thermoregulation disorders. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that frequency-specific terahertz (THz) waves can promote capsaicin unbinding from TRPV1, suggesting a spatiotemporally controlled approach for TRPV1 deactivation. The THz wave resonates with the hydroxyl group in the capsaicin head, increasing its rotational kinetic energy and promoting its rotation. This disrupts the key hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and TRPV1 residue E570, significantly reducing capsaicin’s affinity for TRPV1. Our findings suggest that THz waves could mimic TRPV1 antagonists in a more flexible way, offering temporal control over capsaicin recruitment and expulsion (i.e., TRPV1 activation, desensitization, and deactivation) for more comfortable pain relief. In addition, this work enlightens a THz-based, pill-free strategy to control the pain induced by inflammatory ligands activated TRPV1.},

We observe both the elastic scattering signal, which contains information about the structural dynamics, and the inelastic scattering signal, which encodes information about the electronic state. Our results suggest a sub-picosecond timescale for the photodissociation dynamics and an excited state lifetime of about 230 femtoseconds. The dissociation is found to be dominated by the C 3 channel, where cyclopropane and CO are produced. The branching ratio of the C 3 channel to the C 2 channel, where ethene and ketene are produced, is estimated to be ∼5:3. Our data suggest that the C 3 and C 2 channels account for ∼80% of the photoproducts, with the remaining 20% exhibiting ring-opened structures. It is found that the timescale associated with the dissociation process in the C 2 channel is shorter compared to that in the C 3 channel. Leveraging the enhanced temporal resolution of MeV UED, our results provide a real-time mapping of the nuclear wave packet dynamics, capturing the complete photochemical dynamics from S 2 minimum through the S 1 /S 0 conical intersection and finally to the dissociation. Our experimental results provide new insights into the Norrish type I reaction and can be used to benchmark non-adiabatic dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present a semiclassical method for calculating the positions and widths of tunneling resonances in multi-dimensional systems with a potential energy barrier. The treatment is applicable to arbitrary resonance states with no restrictions concerning anharmonicity, integrability, or resonance overlap. At energies below the barrier, the method is based on the choice of a particular surface that divides phase space into two regions, one including a potential energy well and the other including the barrier. Transfer matrices are constructed for each region from short, real-valued, classical trajectories confined to a single zone. Transitions between the regions are described by forming products of such matrices. These matrices are used to form the Green function for the system, and resonance positions and energies can be obtained, in principle, from its poles at complex energies. In practice, these resonance parameters are determined from simple formulas at real energies. The avoidance of general complex-valued trajectories in this approach greatly simplifies calculations. At energies above the barrier, we construct the transfer matrix for the well region from classical trajectories that travel to and from compound dividing surfaces. These combine surfaces at which these trajectories are classically reflected from the barrier with those at which they are classically transmitted across the barrier. Numerical results for model systems are presented.},

  abstract     = {We introduce affordable computational strategies for calculating orbital and pair-orbital energies in atomic and molecular systems. Our methods are based on the pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant. The computed orbital and pair-orbital energies are then subsequently used to approximate ionization potentials (IPs), electron affinities (EAs), the resulting charge gaps, double ionization potentials (DIPs), and double electron affinities (DEAs). Our methodology builds on the standard Koopmans’ theorem and refines it for a pCCD-based wave function. Furthermore, we incorporate pCCD electron correlation effects into the model utilizing canonical Hartree–Fock or natural pCCD-optimized orbitals. The latter represents a diagonal approximation to the (D)IP/D(EA) equation of motion pCCD models. We benchmarked our newly developed models against theoretical and available experimental data for selected atoms in various basis set sizes and a set of 24 organic acceptor molecules. Our numerical results show that the Koopmans’ approach based on pCCD natural orbitals provides a balanced treatment of occupied and virtual orbital energies, resulting in reliable predictions of charge gaps at a low computational cost.},

The formalism incorporates detailed light–matter interactions, yielding unique solutions. The implementation strategy is discussed in depth, emphasizing computational efficiency and flexibility.

  abstract     = {Diffuse atomic orbital basis sets have proven to be essential to obtain accurate interaction energies, especially in regard to non-covalent interactions. However, they also have a detrimental impact on the sparsity of the one-particle density matrix (1-PDM), to a degree stronger than the spatial extent of the basis functions alone could explain. This is despite the fact that the matrix elements of the 1-PDM of insulators (systems with significant highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps) are expected to decay exponentially with increasing real-space distance from the diagonal. The observed low sparsity of the 1-PDM appears to be independent of representation and even persists after projecting the 1-PDM onto a real-space grid, leading to the conclusion that this “curse of sparsity” is solely a basis set artifact, which, counterintuitively, becomes worse for larger basis sets, seemingly contradicting the notion of a well-defined basis set limit. We show that this is a consequence of the low locality of the contra-variant basis functions as quantified by the inverse overlap matrix S −1 being significantly less sparse than its co-variant dual. Introducing the model system of an infinite non-interacting chain of helium atoms, we are able to quantify the exponential decay rate to be proportional to the diffuseness as well as local incompleteness of the basis set, meaning small and diffuse basis sets are affected the most. Finally, we propose one solution to the conundrum in the form of the complementary auxiliary basis set singles correction in combination with compact, low l-quantum-number basis sets, showing promising results for non-covalent interactions.},

First, we provide accurate reference data by coupled-cluster singles, doubles, with perturbative triples calculations with sufficiently large basis sets. The RPA and σ -functional calculations are carried out post-self-consistently using input orbitals and eigenvalues from the hybrid density-functional calculation. The optimal fraction of exact non-local exchange in these calculations is found to be quite high, around 0.5–0.6 in RPA and around 0.8–1.0 in σ -functional methods. σ -functional methods, however, proved to be less sensitive than RPA methods with respect to the amount of exact non-local exchange used in the generation of their input data. σ -functional methods are shown to outperform in accuracy RPA methods and various other considered density-functional theory methods for static optical properties and, thus, are well-suited for the calculation of linear and non-linear optical properties.},

In this work, we develop and implement a non-uniform Brillouin zone sampling approach to efficiently predict the thermal conductivity of layered materials within the Boltzmann transport equation framework. Using single-layer graphene and bulk MoS 2 as case studies, our method optimizes phonon sampling through two key parameters: grid cutoff distance, which defines a dense phonon mesh near the Γ-point, and grid ratio, which sets the resolution of the coarser grid in the remaining regions. This selective sampling reduces the computational cost involved in phonon scattering calculation by a factor of 10 while maintaining thermal conductivity prediction accuracy within 12% compared with the uniform grid approach.},

  abstract     = {Despite the fact that experimental and theoretical work on the spectrum of methoxy has stretched from the microwave to the ultraviolet and proceeded for nearly 50 years, parts of the spectrum have remained a challenge to simulate theoretically and make reliable line-by-line assignments. The spectral complexity arises because the radical has a non-zero electron spin and significant vibronic coupling between the two electronic components of the ground state due to the presence of a conical intersection. This work describes a completely ab initio effort to understand and assign the spin-vibronic levels of the X ̃ 2 E state from 0 to above 3000 cm −1 , a region that includes the fundamental transitions of the C–H symmetric and asymmetric stretches that have not previously been identified uniquely. A potential energy surface for methoxy was calculated at the equation-of-motion (EOM)-coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT)/atomic natural orbital (ANO1) level of theory. Subsequently, this potential energy surface was fit to a quartic power series expansion of all nine vibrational normal coordinates (as determined at the minimum of the conical intersection) by the use of a machine-learning-based algorithm. After the addition of spin–orbit coupling, the spin-vibronic problem was solved using both the Krylov–Schur and Lanczos algorithms with the SOCJT3 software to converge eigenvalues up to 3500 cm −1 and their eigenvectors. The latter were used, in conjunction with the calculated dipole moment and its derivatives (calculated using finite differences at the EOM-CCSDT/ANO1 level), to determine spectral intensities for the spin-vibronic spectra. The calculated transition frequencies and intensities were used to simulate and assign the observed transitions of the spin-vibronic spectra of the radical. The credibility of the assignments and their significance is discussed in detail.},

The distinctive features of apoCHARMM include single-GPU support for multiple Hamiltonians, computation of a full virial tensor for each Hamiltonian, and full support for orthorhombic periodic systems in both P 1 and P 2 1 space groups. Multiple Hamiltonians on a single GPU permit rapid single-GPU multi-dimensional replica exchange methods, multi-state enveloping distribution sampling methods, and several efficient free energy methods where efficiency is gained by eliminating post-processing requirements. The combination of these capabilities enables constant-pH molecular dynamics in explicit solvent with enveloping distribution sampling, where Hamiltonian replica exchange can be performed on a single GPU with minimal host-GPU memory transfers. A full atomic virial tensor allows support for many different pressure, surface tension, and temperature ensembles. Support for orthorhombic P 2 1 systems allows for the simulation of lipid bilayers, where the two leaflets have equalized chemical potentials. apoCHARMM uses CUDA and modern C++ to enable efficient computation of energy, force, restraint, constraint, and integration calculations directly on the GPU. This GPU-exclusive design focus minimizes host-GPU memory transfers, ensuring optimal performance during simulations, with such transfers occurring only during logging or trajectory saving. Benchmark tests demonstrate that apoCHARMM achieves competitive or superior performance when compared to other GPU-based MD engines, positioning it as a versatile and useful tool for the molecular dynamics community.},

Due to their locality, these energies are potentially interesting in fitting atomistic machine learning models as they inform about physically relevant properties. However, computationally, quantum-mechanically accurate local energies are notoriously difficult to obtain for large systems. Here, we show that by employing semiempirical correlations between different components of the total energy, we can obtain well-defined local energies at a moderate cost. We employ this methodology to investigate energetics in noble liquids or argon, krypton, and their mixture. Instead of using these local energies to fit atomistic models, we show how well these local energies are reproduced by machine-learned models trained on the total energies. The results of our investigation suggest that smaller neural networks, trained only on the total energy of an atomistic system, are more likely to reproduce the underlying local energy partitioning faithfully than larger networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that networks more capable of this energy decomposition are, in turn, capable of transferring to previously unseen systems. Our results are a step toward understanding how much physics can be learned by neural networks and where this can be applied, particularly how a better understanding of physics aids in the transferability of these neural networks.},

  abstract     = {This Perspective is focused on permutationally invariant polynomials (PIPs). Since their introduction in 2004 and first use in developing a fully permutationally invariant potential for the highly fluxional cation CH 5 + ⁠ , PIPs have found widespread use in developing machine learned potentials (MLPs) for isolated molecules, chemical reactions, clusters, condensed phase, and materials. More than 100 potentials have been reported using PIPs. The popularity of PIPs for MLPs stems from their fundamental property of being invariant with respect to permutations of like atoms; this is a fundamental property of potential energy surfaces. This is achieved using global descriptors and, thus, without using an atom-centered approach (which is manifestly fully permutationally invariant). PIPs have been used directly for linear regression fitting of electronic energies and gradients for complex energy landscapes to chemical reactions with numerous product channels. PIPs have also been used as inputs to neural network and Gaussian process regression methods and in many-body (atom-centered, water monomer, etc.) applications, notably for gold standard potentials for water. Here, we focus on the progress and usage of PIPs since 2018, when the last review of PIPs was done by our group.},

  abstract     = {Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are cutting-edge materials that enhance polymer matrices with nanoparticles to achieve superior performance. The properties of these composites are significantly influenced by interactions at the nanoparticle–polymer interface. This study explores how inorganic nanorods (NRs) and various organic nanodimers (NDs)—differentiated by their interaction with the polymer and including Janus types—impact the structure, dynamics, and viscosity of PNCs. Through molecular simulations, we reveal how these nanoparticles interact within block copolymer and homopolymer matrices. Our findings show that ND–monomer interactions notably affect ND organization and improve barrier properties, while the structuring of NRs contributes to increased mechanical resistance. Furthermore, different PNCs provide a wide range of thickening behavior depending on the polymer matrix and the embedded nanoparticles. We observe increments of up to six times the melt’s viscosity when both nanoparticles are introduced into copolymers. The viscosity of the systems is evaluated using a non-equilibrium method, the SLLOD algorithm, and the Green–Kubo relation to obtain both the shear-thinning curve and the zero-shear viscosity value. These results underscore the importance of nanoparticle interactions and configurations in determining PNC behavior, providing critical insights for advancing material design and functionality.},

Here, we demonstrate the reaction-controlled terminal relaxation of unentangled CANs by using a mesoscopic coarse-grained single-chain model based on Gaussian strands. The association dynamics is incorporated to reproduce the features of reversible or bond-exchange reactions in CANs. With this model, the dependence of terminal relaxation on cross-ink density [i.e., the number of associated stickers ( N as ) for this model] is comparatively studied for dissociative and associative CANs, in terms of stress-relaxation behavior, plateau modulus, as well as terminal relaxation times. Both dissociative and associative model CANs exhibit plateau moduli and exponential terminal relaxations. Their slow and fast relaxation modes are of different N as dependences, inducing the stress-relaxation curves to undergo a change in shape with N as . The temperature dependence of terminal relaxation is also examined for both model CANs by considering the kinetics of intrinsic reaction and segmental motion. The engagement of segmental motion forces the horizontal shift factor of time–temperature superposition (TTS) to depart from the Arrhenius-like equation. For dissociative model CANs, the shape of stress-relaxation curve changes with temperature, causing the TTS principle not to hold.},

By the combination of activity, chirality, and shear rate, a wealth of different states are found, including the formation of a linear/complex folding and a spiraling state with both head-in and head-out morphologies. As the vorticity of the applied shear competes with the circling sense of the head, the chirality of the whole complex can be tuned by activity.

We quantitatively reveal that this nonmonotonic behavior results from the competition between micellar center-of-mass diffusion and surfactant diffusion within micelles by decomposing the mean-square displacement of surfactants into the corresponding contributions. Furthermore, our detailed analyses demonstrate how the competition between the two diffusion mechanisms is governed by the aggregation number distribution, the dynamics of individual surfactants and micelles, and the kinetics of micellar scission and recombination.},

Using an AC electric field to induce globule formation, we analyzed DNA expansion upon field cessation. Higher molecular weight PEG, particularly PEG 20000, markedly prolonged relaxation times and exhibited broader distributions compared to PEG 4000 and PEG 6000. In PEG 20000, exceeding the overlap concentration stabilized multi-core structures and delayed DNA relaxation. These dynamics diverged from simple exponential relaxation due to persistent entanglements and compressed regions. The findings highlight the significance of crowding effects and viscosity in influencing polymer dynamics, providing insights relevant to biological systems and synthetic applications, such as drug delivery and gene therapy.},

  abstract     = {We discuss the origin of the static or breakloose friction force and describe a kinetic effect that can manifest itself as an (effective) breakloose friction force. The kinetic effect is important if the kinetic friction force F k ( v ) has a maximum at low sliding speed, say for v = v c . If the driving speed v is higher than v c , the friction force at the onset of slip will first increase rapidly to approximately F k ( v c ) and then rapidly decrease to F k ( v ), resulting in an effective breakloose friction force larger than the kinetic friction force. We present experimental results for sliding friction of a racer rubber tread compound and a passenger car tread compound, which exhibit very different breakloose friction as a result of this kinetic effect. We show that pre-slip in the contact makes the breakloose friction be less than the product of the true contact area and static shear stress. For elastically soft materials, in the absence of the kinetic effect described above, this may result in a breakloose friction force equal to the kinetic friction force. We present experimental results for a passenger car tread compound, which illustrate this effect.},

Hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) exhibits an ultra-wide bandgap that can host multiple defect states emitting stable single photons with high brightness at room-temperature. The fabrication and regulation of the defects that determine the spin and optoelectronic physics of h -BN are thus important. Herein, we demonstrate the composite defects modulation in h -BN nanosheets by thermal annealing treatment in air that can generate stable room-temperature SPEs with high photon purity and brightness. Strong and sharp zero-phonon lines appear at ∼386 nm (3.21 eV) and ∼573 nm (2.16 eV) after annealing. The ultraviolet light emission is induced by the formation of a boroxyl ring in h -BN commensurate with the optical transition of nitrogen vacancies, which is characterized by the spectral analysis combined with first-principle calculations. The thermal annealing suppresses the fluorescence background, leading to the population of anti-site nitrogen vacancy complex defects, achieving visible single photon emissions. The results of our work provide a practical post-synthesis process for engineering ensembles of emitters in h -BN for their future integration in quantum photonics.},

Our predictions unveiled several new phases with both conventional and unconventional stoichiometries. Notably, we observed an opposing trend in the stability of alkali metal iodides at high pressures, and we explored this phenomenon from multiple perspectives. Our analysis revealed that the activation of inner-shell d orbitals in heavy alkali metals is a key factor driving the decomposition of these compounds. In particular, in alkali metal iodides, a significant number of electrons transfer from the 5 p orbital of iodine to the d orbitals of the heavy alkali metals, leading to weakening of the ionic bonds and triggering of the decomposition of these compounds. This research not only provides valuable insights into the decomposition mechanisms and high-pressure properties of Me–I compounds but also significantly contributes to our knowledge of chemical reactions in geological systems under extreme conditions.},

Therefore, it is imperative to design a sensor that can conveniently, rapidly, and accurately detect H 2 S in human blood at room temperature. In this work, we developed an Ag/Cu 2 O-based sensor using a two-dimensional electrodeposition in situ assembly method for detecting biological hydrogen sulfide (bio-H 2 S). The morphological and structural properties indicate that a distinct contact interface has been established between Ag and Cu 2 O. The sensor exhibits high selectivity, good stability, and a strong linear response within the range of 50–250 μ M (R 2 = 0.999 58). At room temperature, the sensor displayed a remarkable response of up to 12 704.35% when exposed to 250 μ M bio-H 2 S in blood, with a response time of just 40 s. The great sensing ability of Ag/Cu 2 O nanoarray for bio-H 2 S detection is mainly attributed to Schottky barrier modulation of Ag/Cu 2 O, catalytic sensitization of Ag nanowires, and vulcanization reaction of Cu 2 O. These results provide significant perspectives for the early diagnosis of chronic diseases and the real-time monitoring of blood-related diseases.},

Despite extensive research, the influence of oxides, which frequently occur on metal surfaces, on the adsorption behavior of NHCs has received limited attention at the nanometric scale. In this study, the adsorption configurations and reactions of 2-methylbenzimidazole (MBI) molecules on a CuO/Cu(110) surface were investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM). Following the deposition of MBI molecules, Cu islands were observed, and the molecules predominantly adsorbed in a flat-lying configuration. Comparative experiments conducted on a bare Cu(110) surface indicate that the dehydrogenation of MBI molecules due to the cleavage of N–H bonds leads to CuO reduction and the release of Cu adatoms, which subsequently aggregate into islands. Upon annealing at 378 K, molecules adsorbed at the CuO strips assume a tilted flat-lying configuration, suggesting the formation of coordination bonds between nitrogen and copper atoms. On the copper regions, molecules assemble into double-chains, adopting an upright configuration. High-resolution nc-AFM images reveal a similarity between molecules in the double-chains and those at step edges, implying that Cu atoms are extracted from terraces to form slots where molecules preferentially occupy.},

  abstract     = {Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy represents a crucial technique for probing the structural details of chiral molecules. In recent years, emerging chiral metasurfaces have emerged as a promising platform by generating localized, intense chiral fields. Nevertheless, current metasurfaces predominantly function within the visible and near-infrared spectra with limited response in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum due to materials and fabrication challenges. In this study, we report the attainment of a remarkably high Q factor of 1200, concomitant with a relatively pronounced planar chirality with a CD value of 0.67 under normal incidence in chiral all-dielectric Ta 2 O 5 metasurfaces in the near-UV region. This achievement is realized through the strong coupling between magnetic dipole resonances and Mie surface lattice resonances, which occurs when the two resonance modes are both spatially and spectrally coincident. Our findings not only chart a novel trajectory for the realization of high-performance chiral metasurfaces in the UV region but also hold substantial potential for diverse chiral nanophotonic applications, such as sensing, lasing, and nonlinear optics investigations.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) represents a promising approach to mitigating climate change and addressing energy challenges by converting CO 2 into value-added chemicals. Among various CO 2 RR products, CO is attractive due to its economic viability and industrial relevance. By integrating large-scale data mining (with 939 experimental performance data), we reveal that the catalytic performance of d-block transition metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) for CO 2 RR is influenced not only by the coordination environment but also significantly by pH. However, the unified model that could accurately depict the pH-dependent CO 2 RR to CO activity of d-block SACs is urgently needed. Herein, we conducted pH-dependent microkinetic modeling based upon density functional theory calculations and pH-electric field coupled microkinetic modeling to analyze CO 2 RR performance of 101 SACs. Our data-driven screening identifies 12 high-performance SACs with promising CO selectivity across different pH conditions, primarily based on Fe, Cu, and Ni centers. We establish a scaling relation between key intermediates (*COOH and *CO) and analyze their adsorption behaviors under varying electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, our pH-dependent microkinetic modeling reveals the critical role of electric field effects in determining catalytic performance, aligning well with experimental turnover frequency values. Most importantly, our theoretical model accurately captures the pH-dependent performance of CO 2 RR-to-CO on d-block SACs, which is experimentally validated and serves as a general theoretical framework for the rational design of high-performance CO 2 RR catalysts. Based on this model, we identify a series of promising M–N–C catalysts, providing a universal design principle for optimizing CO 2 -to-CO conversion.},

  abstract     = {Silicon nanopore arrays are widely used in applications such as solution exchange, biomolecule detection, chemical analysis, and plant pathogen detection due to their high stability, long service life, and excellent compatibility with semiconductor and microfluidic technologies. However, existing fabrication methods such as wet etching, ion track etching, and electron beam lithography-assisted reactive ion etching face limitations, including poor size uniformity, uneven pore distribution, and high production costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes an improved metal-assisted chemical etching method for fabricating silicon nanopore arrays. This method combines silver nanoparticle-assisted etching with an anodic aluminum oxide template, promoting the orderly arrangement of silver nanoparticles on the silicon surface. By altering key factors such as nanoparticle size, etching time, temperature, and etchant oxidant concentration, the etching process was significantly optimized, with higher temperatures and oxidant concentrations accelerating nanopore formation. In addition, it is proposed that the anodic reaction likely involves the direct dissolution of silicon in its divalent state, with the gas generated during the etching process being a product of this reaction. Xenon lamp irradiation was used to fine-tune the etching kinetics, further optimizing the morphology of the silicon nanopores. The proposed technique is low-cost, highly adaptable, and reproducible, and has been successfully applied to design and optimize silicon nanopore arrays for various advanced applications. Compared to traditional industrial methods, this fabrication approach is more suitable for large-scale production, offering higher efficiency and better geometric control, making it ideal for applications in catalysis, sensing, and nanoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CO molecules chemisorbed on Cu(110) under femtosecond laser irradiation. We use the two temperature model and a previously developed potential energy surface based on density functional theory total energies (obtained using the nonlocal vdW-DF2 functional) and parameterized using artificial neural networks. We find that laser irradiation induces diffusion parallel to [ 1 ̄ 10] much more efficiently than parallel to [001] due to a significantly smaller energy barrier in the former case (i.e., 0.12 vs 0.49 eV). We also observe photoinduced desorption (an endothermic process characterized by ΔE = 0.6 eV) with a probability that exhibits a power law dependence with laser fluence. At the lowest fluence studied (F = 30 J m −2 ), for which experimental data are available, the theoretical photoinduced diffusion probabilities both parallel and perpendicular to [ 1 ̄ 10] agree with the measured values, whereas our calculations predict desorption probabilities smaller than those obtained in experiments. Our MD simulations show that (i) the energy exchange with the hot electron bath is the main responsible for photoinduced processes and (ii) phonons tend to reduce the kinetic energy of the adsorbate, as keeping fixed the position of the Cu atoms during the simulations (thereby quenching CO–phonon energy exchange) significantly increases CO diffusion and desorption probabilities. Thus, our study advances the understanding of ultrafast surface dynamics on metal surfaces with weak electron–phonon coupling, and we hope that it will motivate further experimental investigations.},

  abstract     = {While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides valuable insights into the local environment of many nuclei, the unambiguous interpretation of the signal in terms of microscopic dynamics is often difficult, particularly when the quadrupolar relaxation mechanism comes into play. Here, we investigate the quadrupolar NMR relaxation of cations and anions in aqueous alkaline and alkaline-earth chloride solutions across a broad range of salt concentrations. Using a combination of density functional theory calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations, we compute the electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations over the relevant time scales. Predicted NMR relaxation rates are in good agreement with experiments from the literature. As previously reported for NaCl, we find that the increase in relaxation rate with salt concentration is primarily driven by the slowing of EFG fluctuations, while changes in the static variance of the EFG play a minor role. We highlight some specific features for smaller and divalent cations compared to the other monovalent ones. In addition, we assess the relevance of the Stokes–Einstein–Debye model, frequently used to analyze NMR relaxation experiments, for these aqueous electrolytes and highlight the link between the collective dynamics of the liquid underlying the EFG fluctuations at the ion positions and the stress fluctuations. Our results generalize observations for Na + in aqueous NaCl solutions, showing that models assuming a viscous model of the solvent dynamics are insufficient to describe EFG fluctuations in these systems and illustrate the relevance of molecular simulations to interpret NMR relaxation experiments in terms of microscopic dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The energetic host–guest approach has been successfully applied to design various novel crystal structures. A neuroevolution potential was proposed to predict the reactive kinetics of CL-20 crystals under high temperature and pressure. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the shock compression and thermal decomposition behaviors. During the shock compression process, temperature monitoring revealed the transition of the crystal from the unreacted Hugoniot state to the reacted Hugoniot state, which occurred after the decomposition of CL-20 molecules. The temperature rise in the reacted state followed the order: N 2 O > CO 2 > H 2 O 2 > NCCH 3 > β > α > γ > ε. These indicate that guest molecules facilitate the reaction under shock conditions. During the thermal decomposition process, monitoring the potential energy evolution showed that the initial decomposition of CL-20 molecules is an endothermic reaction, primarily producing NO 2 . As the temperature increased, NO 2 was further consumed, and CL-20 underwent a ring-opening reaction, primarily generating CO 2 . NCCH 3 and H 2 O 2 molecules were consumed during the endothermic process, showing the largest and smallest potential energy changes, respectively. N 2 O molecules were consumed during the formation of final products, while CO 2 and H 2 O were the final products and were not consumed. The activation energy ranking of the reactions was ε > β > γ > NCCH 3 > N 2 O > CO 2 > α > H 2 O 2 . These results provide an atomic-level perspective for controlling the detonation performance of energetic materials under high temperature and pressure.},

By using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of liquid Ag, we show that a multimode representation also accounts very well for the simulated self-dynamic structure factor S self ( Q , ω ), which provides insight on the single-particle dynamics. In particular, we provide a convincing proof that S self ( Q , ω ) is responsible for the observation of transverse-like contributions in a longitudinal quantity such as S ( Q , ω ). It is particularly significant that an analogous situation was found when considering the transverse current. In fact, its self-part, C T,self ( Q , ω ), was shown to be accountable for the presence of longitudinal-like modes in a transverse quantity, such as C T ( Q , ω ). Due to the single-particle origin of the transverse signal in the dynamic structure factor, we also show that the apparent Q -dependence of transverse-like frequencies, as inferred from S ( Q , ω ), differs from the true dispersion of transverse excitations appropriately derived from C T ( Q , ω ).},

Mol. Liq. 363 , 119836 (2022)] reporting novel phases in cyclohexane at the millisecond time scale. The evolution of Raman bands under dynamic compression reveals crystallization of the sample to the cubic (solid-I) phase around 0.8 GPa followed by solid-I (cubic) → solid-III (orthorhombic) transition in the pressure range of 1.1–1.7 GPa. On further compression, transitions to solid-IV (monoclinic) and solid-V (triclinic) phases are observed in the pressure ranges of 2.7–4.0 GPa and 4.0–5.8 GPa, respectively. Our static compression experiments, performed up to 27 GPa, reveal similar phase transition behavior, contrasting the existing literature. These findings offer new insights into the stability of different high pressure phases of cyclohexane under extreme loading conditions and highlight its potential as a benchmark material for studying phase transition dynamics in molecular systems.},

Similarly, the observation of S a induces chirality flips from S a to R a to S a to R a and so on. The period of stereo-mutation is τ = 2.554 ps. The phenomenon is supported by the low energy barrier 174.6 hc cm −1 between the enantiomers and by the light masses of the hydrogen atoms, which interchange positions during stereo-mutation. Interchanges of heavier atoms and higher energy barriers would prohibit Schrödinger cat ground states.

The first and second bands of the ms-TPES of m/z = 43 are mainly unstructured due to the large molecular configuration changes upon photoionization, and they are attributed to contributions of the singlet ground state of CH 3 CO + and CH 2 CHO + . The ms-TPES of m/z = 15 exhibit a rich structure with two vibrational series superimposed onto a broad envelope. The first vibrational series is attributed to the photoionization of the methyl radical (CH 3 ), generated from secondary reactions in the flow tube reactor, while the second series is attributed to pre-dissociation of the triplet electronic state of CH 2 CHO + , and the statistical dissociation of ground state CH 3 CO + in high vibrational levels contributes to the broad envelope. The dissociation mechanisms for the generation of CH 3 + from CH 3 CO + and CH 2 CHO + are also discussed with the aid of a theoretical energy diagram and a breakdown diagram. In particular, a dissociation mechanism is proposed, in which CH 2 CHO + in a triplet electronic state first undergoes an intersystem crossing into the singlet electronic state, followed by a structural rearrangement and dissociation into CH 3 + along the singlet minimum energy path of CH 3 CO + .},

  abstract     = {The use of electric fields may provide a mechanism to enable fuel-flexible technologies in aviation. The development of such technologies requires methodologies able to accurately quantify electric field effects on chemical reactions at the molecular level. This work provides a comprehensive assessment of methodologies used in the framework of reactive molecular dynamics (MD) with the reactive force field ReaxFF. The focus is on the computation of atomic charges, the method used for equilibration, and the use of global thermostats for hydrocarbon combustion in an external electric field. The charge equilibration method (QEq) and the charge transfer with polarization current equilibration method (QTPIE) were analyzed for the computation of atomic charges. For the fuel–oxygen system investigated, QEq leads to molecules with a sizable spurious net charge. QTPIE leads to more accurate molecular charges but at the cost of underestimating some atomic charges. This leads to faster combustion kinetics with QEq compared with QTPIE. A two-step equilibration procedure provides a more equilibrated system compared to widely used equilibration procedures. Furthermore, using a global thermostat with an external electric field results in an artificial reduction in fuel and oxygen first-order reaction rates. These artificial effects can be avoided by not using a thermostat, but at the expense of electric-field-induced heating. Applying an external electric field without a global thermostat accelerates combustion much more with QEq compared with QTPIE, due to the larger charges predicted by QEq. This study reveals several simulation artifacts that affect reactive MD of fuel combustion and contributes toward the more accurate modeling of fuel combustion in external electric fields.},

Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the geometries of the physisorbed structures closely aligned with experimental data, suggesting that these configurations were the most stable under the experimental conditions. Conversely, while chemisorbed structures exhibit stronger interactions and considerable CO 2 activation, they show less agreement with the observed spectroscopic data. Using the interaction region indicator method, our weak interaction analysis confirmed that van der Waals forces were the dominant interaction in the physisorbed structures. Our experimental results indicate that these physically adsorbed structures are more stable under the conditions of this study. These findings shed light on the interaction mechanisms of Au(CO 2 ) n − ( n = 2, 3) at the molecular level and provide new insights into the potential for transition metals to catalytically activate CO 2 .},

  abstract     = {Recently, it was shown how the primary steps of solvation of a single Na + ion, instantly created at the surface of a nanometer-sized droplet of liquid helium, can be followed at the atomic level [Albrechtsen et al. , Nature 623, 319 (2023)]. This involved measuring, with femtosecond time resolution, the gradual attachment of individual He atoms to the Na + ion as well as the energy dissipated from the local region of the ion. In this current work, we provide a more comprehensive and detailed description of the experimental findings of the solvation dynamics and present an improved Poisson-statistical analysis of the time-resolved yields of the Na + He n ions recorded. For droplets containing an average of 5200 He atoms, this analysis gives a binding rate of 1.84 ± 0.09 atoms/ps for the binding of the first five He atoms to the Na + ion. In addition, thanks to accurate theoretical values for the evaporation energies of the Na + He n ions, obtained by path integral Monte Carlo methods using a new potential energy surface presented here for the first time, we improve the determination of the time-dependent removal of the solvation energy from the region around the sodium ion. We find that it follows Newton’s law of cooling for the first 5 ps. Measurements were carried out for three different average droplet sizes, ⟨ N D ⟩ = 9000, 5200, and 3600 helium atoms, and differences between these results are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The protonated carbon dioxide (HOCO + ) ion has been observed in the interstellar medium and can provide an indirect probe of carbon dioxide, which cannot be detected by millimeter spectroscopic observations. Accurate modeling of HOCO + spectra requires accurate radiative and collisional rates. While radiative rates are available, collisional rate coefficients for rotational transitions involving collisions with the dominant H 2 molecule must be calculated. In this work, the potential energy surface (PES) describing the interaction of the HOCO + with H 2 has been computed through the use of the explicitly correlated coupled cluster method including single, double, and (perturbatively) triple excitations [CCSD(T)-f12a] and a correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis. The molecular geometries are taken as fixed. The computed points were fit to a functional form appropriate for time-independent quantum scattering calculations of rotationally inelastic integral cross sections. The well depth D e of the HOCO + –H 2 complex, computed with an aug-cc-pVQZ-f12 basis set, was found to equal 2423 cm −1 at an equilibrium intermolecular separation of 6.21 a 0 . This PES was used in time-independent close coupling quantum scattering calculations to compute state-to-state cross sections and rate coefficients for transitions between the rotational levels of HOCO + .},

  abstract     = {Thiourea (TU) and its N -methylated derivative, N -methyl thiourea (NMTU), were exposed to H atoms generated in cryogenic para -H 2 matrices. The reactions were followed online by FT-IR spectroscopy. The freshly deposited matrices exclusively contained the more stable thione tautomeric forms. However, upon exposure to H atoms, the peaks belonging to the precursor molecules clearly decreased along with the simultaneous appearance of new signals. These new bands could be attributed to the corresponding higher-energy thiol forms (in the case of TU) and, tentatively, to an intermediate radical (in both the TU and NMTU experiments). The radicals are suggested to be the H-atom-addition products of the TU and NMTU thione precursors, with the addition occurring on the S atom. These intermediates may then react with another free H atom, leading to the formation of the more energetic thiol tautomers, following an H-atom-abstraction process. As such, these radicals act as the centerpiece of the reaction scheme, enabling the thione–thiol tautomerization. This H-atom-assisted process is similar to that observed for the related molecule, thioacetamide. The interpretation of the experimental results was supplemented by quantum-chemical computations, which predicted all the above-mentioned reactions to be barrierless. The presence of H atoms opens a barrierless pathway; thus, the process does not necessarily require activation through irradiation (e.g., broadband UV). These findings point to the ubiquitous nature of the facile hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of the S atom, implying that thione–thiol tautomerization may occur easily.},

  abstract     = {Asparagine (Asn) and aspartic acid (Asp) are not only amino acids found in proteins but also building blocks for synthesis of eco-friendly polymers with techniques such those in which electrons play a role. In this contribution, we present a comparative study of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to Asn and Asp under gas-phase conditions by means of DEA spectroscopy. In contrast to a number of amino acids studied so far, the formation of the dehydrogenated parent anion, (M – H) − , at about 1.2 eV from both investigated compounds is not the most intense dissociation channel. On the other hand, prominent negative ion resonances are observed peaking below 0.5 eV, resulting in the formation of fragment anions generated from a loss of a neutral –COOH group or neutral H 2 O 2 molecule or leading to the production of HCOO − from both asparagine and aspartic acid. It should be stressed here that the surrogation of one hydroxyl group by an amino group in aspartic acid, which results in the formation of asparagine, sensitizes the latter compound for the loss of an entire neutral carboxyl group. Indeed, the formation of the (Asn – COOH) − anion from DEA to asparagine is more efficient by about an order of magnitude than the formation of the (Asp – COOH) − anion from DEA to aspartic acid.},

  abstract     = {We have investigated non-dipole effects in the interaction of a hydrogen atom with elliptically polarized laser pulses of intensity (0.25–100) × 10 14 W/cm 2 with about 8 fs duration. The study was performed within the framework of a hybrid quantum–quasiclassical approach, in which the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for an electron and the classical Hamilton equations for the center-of-mass (CM) of an atom are simultaneously integrated. It is shown that the spatial inhomogeneity k · r of the laser field and the presence of a magnetic component in it lead to the non-separability of the CM and electron variables in a neutral atom and, as a consequence, to its acceleration. We have established a strict correlation between the total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom and the velocity of its CM acquired as a result of interaction with a laser pulse. The acceleration of the atom weakly depends on the polarization of the laser in the considered region (5 eV ≲ ℏω ≲ 27 eV) of its frequencies. However, the transition from linear to elliptical laser polarization leads to the twisting of the atom relative to the axis directed along the propagation of the pulse (coinciding with the direction of the atom acceleration). It is shown that with increasing ellipticity, the twisting effect increases and reaches its maximum value with circular polarization, while the projection of the orbital angular momentum acquired by the electron onto the direction of propagation of the laser pulse reaches its maximum value. A mechanism for n-photon resonant twisting of an atom with the transfer of helicity of photons of a circularly polarized laser field to it has been established, which may be of interest for a number of promising applications.},

The model—which focuses on excited-state absorption (ESA) pathways in two-dimensional electronic spectra—reveals that orientational averaging leads to diagnostic ESA peak locations for H - and J -dimers. We constructed DNA-templated dimers of cyanine molecules as representative systems and used ultrabroadband two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements to support the predicted signatures arising from the theoretical model. Fitting of steady-state spectra supports the assigned packing conformations. The results elucidate how ESA peaks can be diagnostic spectral signatures of packing conformation.

The presence of a solvent-mediated symmetry breaking mechanism leading to a gain in oscillator strength of formally symmetry-forbidden modes was observed in all solvents, although the effect was more marked in polar solvents. Ultrafast vibrational energy dissipation was found to occur via two solvent dependent relaxation pathways, rapid intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR ∼ 0.3–1 ps) and relaxation to the ground vibrational state (T 1 ∼ 80–250 ps). Accelerating factors for vibrational relaxation included hydrogen bonding and the presence of solvent vibrational modes resonant with the carbonyl modes of [Mn 2 (CO) 10 ], while IVR timescales displayed an anticorrelation with vibrational relaxation times. Overall, a simple association of dynamic behavior with solvent properties could not be identified for any of the measured parameters. Rather, specific solvent properties were found to contribute to different extents in each case. Thus, our results highlight the need for careful consideration of solvent factors when attempting a rational selection of catalyst/solvent combinations or the implementation of sustainable replacement solvents.},

  abstract     = {Molecular self-diffusion in the presence of barriers results in time-dependent displacements that are controlled by barrier characteristics, such as thickness, arrangement, and permeability, which manifests itself in the form of the ensemble-average velocity autocorrelation function (VAF). We describe a direct method to measure the VAF based on a combination of diffusion-weighted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in which two time-shifted diffusion encodings are separated by a longitudinal storage period. The VAF estimated from simulated data is shown to agree with the known expression for impermeable parallel planes. Simulations of diffusion in periodically spaced, permeable planes and connected, box-shaped pores are also presented. We find that scaling of the VAF faster than t −1/2 is indicative of barrier permeation or exchange between domains and that this can be captured by the proposed method. As an experimental proof-of-concept, we present data from an ex vivo neonatal mouse spinal cord studied using a permanent magnet NMR MOUSE system. We report a transition from t −1/2 to t −3/2 scaling at t ≈ 10 ms, consistent perhaps with transmembrane water exchange. Compared to other NMR-based approaches, this method can potentially access several orders of magnitude in time (ms – s), revealing a wealth of VAF behaviors with one experimental paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Nonadiabatic phenomena are ubiquitous in polyatomic molecular systems and are responsible for many ultrafast dynamics occurring outside of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. In particular, electronic curve crossings offer ultrafast, sub-100 fs pathways for efficient electronic relaxation between potential energy surfaces, where the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom become strongly coupled. Due to the unique mixture of temporal and spectral resolution required to detect electronic curve crossings, experimental observation has remained a considerable challenge. Here, double-quantum coherence two-dimensional electronic–vibrational (2Q 2D EV) spectroscopy is introduced for the first time and proposed as an experimental approach to monitor vibronic dynamics near and at electronic curve crossings directly through vibronic coherences using a mixture of broadband visible and infrared pulses. A semi-classical vibronic Hamiltonian is used that characterizes the parametrically defined coupling between high-frequency vibrations and low-frequency vibrational modes involved in tuning electronic potential energy surfaces. This work displays how unique multidimensional pulse sequences can uncover dynamics that are hidden in conventional techniques.},

The combined use of an interferometer on the pump side and of CPU on the probe side opens the way to an improved spectral resolution in both pump and probe dimensions, as compared to currently available 100-kHz 2DIR spectrometers based on pulse shapers and mercury–cadmium telluride detector arrays.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become a popular tool in chemistry and materials science as they combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the high computational efficiency of analytic potentials. MLPs are particularly useful for computationally demanding simulations such as the determination of free energy profiles governing chemical reactions in solution, but to date, such applications are still rare. In this work, we show how umbrella sampling simulations can be combined with active learning of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) to construct free energy profiles in a systematic way. For the example of the first step of Strecker synthesis of glycine in aqueous solution, we provide a detailed analysis of the improving quality of HDNNPs for datasets of increasing size. We find that, in addition to the typical quantification of energy and force errors with respect to the underlying density functional theory data, the long-term stability of the simulations and the convergence of physical properties should be rigorously monitored to obtain reliable and converged free energy profiles of chemical reactions in solution.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide. A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model’s accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system’s FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system’s FES.},

In particular, we consider, beyond the homogeneous case, an annular band of lower contact angle compared to the background and a constant radial gradient of contact angle, pointing either inward or outward from the center. We show that by tuning the parameters characterizing the patterns, it is possible to control not only the stability of the rivulet, i.e., its breakup/collapse dynamics and the associated time scales, but also the dewetting morphology, in terms of the number and position of the formed droplets.},

In the energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with G 0 W 0 provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative K -edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N 1 s K -edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 6000 excited states using G 0 W 0 -BSE.

  abstract     = {Electrolyte solutions are central to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, with ions in solution affecting properties as diverse as ion diffusion, solvation structure, and chemical potentials. However, accurately predicting the solubility of salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is challenging. Existing methods, such as the direct coexistence method and the chemical potential route, provide insights but often require extensive computational resources or face limitations in reproducibility. In this study, we present an alternative approach using Kirkwood–Buff (KB) theory combined with MD simulations to estimate the solubility of NaCl. This “KB method” requires the calculation of ion–ion and ion–water Kirkwood–Buff integrals at different electrolyte concentrations based on a reference electrolyte chemical potential, yielding concentration-dependent chemical potentials. We calculated the solubility of five state-of-the-art NaCl models and found a clear link between ion pairing and solubility at low and moderately high electrolyte concentrations. Our results suggest that force fields with a mean number of contact ion pairs per ion between 0.014 and 0.025 in 1.0 molal aqueous electrolyte solution might be a good choice, offering valuable insights for future model refinement. By evaluating the computational efficiency of the KB method, we highlight its potential as a reliable tool to calculate the solubility of the future ion models.},

  abstract     = {A thorough understanding of the nature and pattern of intermolecular interactions in molecular aggregates and crystals is a prerequisite for the design of the next generation of functional materials. In systems with multiple, symmetrically equivalent molecules per unit cell, each excited state of the isolated molecule splits into several Davydov components that appear in the absorption spectra in up to three orthogonally polarized transitions. In this work, a Frenkel–Holstein Hamiltonian is adopted to simulate the vibronic structure of the Davydov components in aggregates and crystals with up to four molecules per unit cell, where electrostatic intermolecular interactions define either 1D or 2D structures. Analysis shows that vibronic signatures report directly on the electronic couplings that contribute to the Davydov splitting and the exciton band shapes. Specifically, the vibronic signature of a given Davydov component is solely determined by its free excitonic shift. For crystals with two molecules per unit cell, the lower and upper Davydov components can each exhibit J-like or H-like behavior, resulting in JJ, JH, and HH components in order of increasing energy, all with unique vibronic signatures. Under certain conditions, null points can exist in either band, leading to a monomer-like absorption spectrum for the corresponding Davydov component. In crystals with four symmetrically equivalent molecules per unit cell, the J- or H-nature of the three orthogonally polarized Davydov components results in four possible combinations, JJJ, JJH, JHH, and HHH in order of increasing energy, all readily identified through vibronic signatures.},

Furthermore, by studying the performance of density functional approximations (DFAs) in the semiclassical limit, we find that mainstream DFAs have erroneous divergent energy behaviors as ℏ → 0, violating the exact constraint of finite energy. Importantly, by making connection of the significantly underestimated DFA energies of many strongly correlated transition-metal diatomic molecules to their rather small estimated ℏ eff , we demonstrate the usefulness of our semiclassical analysis and its promise for inspiring better DFAs.},

Following the general strategy introduced by Höfener and Visscher [ J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12 , 549–557 (2016)], we derive the working equations needed for the evaluation of these properties and describe their implementation into our open-source quantum chemistry program, Serenity . Our implementation comprises both projection-based embedding as well as embedding based on non-additive kinetic-energy functionals and the corresponding potentials. It makes use of the resolution-of-the-identity technique and features—in addition to CC2—the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme of second order, ADC(2), as well as spin-component-scaled and scaled-opposite spin versions of CC2 and ADC(2). We demonstrate the capabilities of this FDEc framework by analyzing excitation energies, singlet and triplet excitation-energy splittings as well as oscillator strengths of excitonically coupled dimers, the excited-state/difference dipole moment of a formaldehyde⋯water system, and the optical rotatory dispersion of a microsolvated organic chromophore. In the latter case, we reconsider the case of ( P )-dimethylallene· (H 2 O) 2 , for which uncoupled CC2-based frozen-density embedding fails, while FDEc-time-dependent density-functional theory showed promising results in earlier work. Here, we can confirm that the inclusion of system–environment response couplings leads to agreement with supermolecular CC2 results, highlighting the importance of inter-subsystem couplings in response-property calculations for molecular aggregates.},

A simple strategy required to switch from the previously used Slater-type orbital (STO) shielding to Gaussians is provided by fitting the Coulomb energy of two Gaussian charge distributions to the repulsion between two STOs. Their widths were optimized for O, Si, and Ti species, obtaining results consistent with previous studies using STOs in the case of SiO 2 polymorphs. In the limit of sufficiently narrow Gaussians, it is shown that the implementation converges to electronegativity equalization method results for the case of Ti/TiO x interfaces.

  abstract     = {The theory of subdiffusion and reactions occurring in confined domains such as comb structures has widespread applications in various fields of science. We study trapping diffusion-controlled reactions taking place in the backbone of a two-dimensional comb-like structure. A brief survey of previously published works on diffusion transport, both without and with inertial effects, is given. To take into account inertial effects, in this paper, we used the known Compte–Metzler analysis to choose an appropriate fractional diffusive Cattaneo system. By means of the chosen suitable fractional diffusive Cattaneo system, we derive the diffusion equation comprising a 1/2-order fractional time derivative as a damping term. With the help of the fractional differentiation method, we analytically evaluate the trapping reaction rate coefficient for short and long time regimes. Numerical calculations performed for the reaction rate coefficient showed a very good agreement with the obtained analytical expressions.},

  abstract     = {A number of benchmarking studies have assessed the accuracy of various electronic structure methods for computing the interaction energies of van der Waals dimers, but fewer have systematically assessed the quality of dimer geometries obtained by these methods. We present optimized geometries of 21 van der Waals dimers using a highly accurate level of theory, namely coupled-cluster through perturbative triples at the complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS], and compare these results with optimizations performed at lower levels of theory. The lower levels of theory include variants of Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2, MP2D, and MP2.5) and coupled-cluster theory [CCSD and CCSD(T)], with basis sets ranging from double- to quadruple-zeta. The accuracy of these methods is assessed by comparing errors in the least-root-mean-squared deviations (LRMSDs) of atomic coordinates, center-of-mass distances (Δ d COM ), interaction energies, and rotational constants. We also investigate the impact of the counterpoise correction and the frozen core approximation on the quality of the optimized geometries. Our findings show that increasing the basis set size beyond double-zeta significantly improves the accuracy of the geometries, while further improvements due to the basis set size depend on the method used. The frozen core approximation induces very small changes in geometries, while the counterpoise correction has a larger effect. For double-zeta basis sets, the counterpoise correction tends to degrade the quality of the optimized geometries, regardless of the method used. Several methods yield geometries with LRMSDs and Δ d COM within 0.1 Å for all 21 dimers, and MP2D with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set emerges as the most computationally efficient among these well-performing approaches with an average LRMSD and an absolute Δ d COM of 0.02 Å.},

  abstract     = {A robust regularization procedure for the radial non-adiabatic coupling (NAC) elements of the diatomic nuclear kinetic energy operator for the N -state diatomic problem is presented. This method ensures NACs are internally consistent with each other and with corresponding adiabatic properties, such as potentials or dipoles. Constructing a diabatic representation—where all components of the (radial) nuclear derivative couplings vanish—that is both physical and exactly equivalent to the adiabatic representation can be impossible due to inconsistencies between NACs and adiabatic properties. Such discrepancies arise from using different theory levels in ab initio molecular property calculations, convergence issues in quantum chemistry calculations, post-processing adjustments to computed property curves, and truncation errors when considering only a finite number of Born–Oppenheimer states. The presented regularization procedure leverages a hybrid asymptotic-property-based diabatization (HyAP), where the asymptotic behavior of diabatic properties is addressed and their smoothness maximized simultaneously. This is achieved through optimization of the trajectory of the adiabatic to diabatic transformation (AtDT) parameterized by the corresponding generator matrices (exponential mapping). The presented methodology is applied to the 3-state system of N 2 [ 1 Σ + 1 ⁠ , 2 Σ + 1 ⁠ , and 3 Σ + 1 ] and the 4-state system of CH [ C Σ + 2 ⁠ , 2 Σ + 2 ⁠ , 3 Σ + 2 ⁠ , and 4 Σ + 2 ] via evolution of the AtDT, where a physical diabatization is achieved. The HyAP regularization, developed and tested for applications in spectroscopy, is guided by underlying electronic structure data to fulfill our pragmatic aim of constructing physical diabatic representations that effectively controls bound rovibronic molecular spectroscopy while remaining exactly equivalent to the adiabatic representation.},

However, challenges arise in utilizing NRPMD associated with zero-point energy leakage between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom and ambiguities in how to apply the method under non-equilibrium conditions. Here, we explore several variants of NRPMD and compare their performance using a set of benchmark systems for excited-state electronic population dynamics. Within this context, we adopt an idea from recent work on the linearized semi-classical initial value representation and derive a new NRPMD correlation function for the population of the electronic states in terms of a trace-less operator and the identity operator. The in-depth analysis of the different choices when utilizing NRPMD provides new insight into the practical implementation of the method and related techniques.},

  abstract     = {This study outlines a conceptually new approach for reconstructing the neutron scattering length density profile, Δ ρ ( r ), directly from small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) intensity profiles, I ( Q ). The method is built upon a universal operator A , fundamental to scattering processes, which relates I ( Q ) to Δ ρ ( r ) through the covariance matrix X ≡ Δ ρ ( r )Δ ρ ( r ) † . In contrast to conventional SANS data analysis techniques, this approach eliminates the need to predefine a model of Δ ρ ( r ) in the regression process. This capability inherently addresses challenges often encountered in existing spectral inversion analysis, such as convergence to local minima due to incomplete analytical models, insufficient orthogonal basis vectors, or non-orthogonality among basis functions in model-free approaches. By extending spectral regression analysis from the vector space of I ( Q ) to the higher-dimensional space of AXA † , the PhaseLift framework imposes convexity on the regression process. This ensures the stable and computationally efficient reconstruction of the universal minimum Δ ρ ( r ) from I ( Q ). Numerical benchmarks and experimental validations confirm the reliability of this approach in tackling neutron scattering inverse problems. The method establishes a robust and flexible framework for advancing neutron scattering data analysis, with the potential to significantly enhance both the precision and efficiency of experiments across various scientific domains. It provides a solid foundation for further research into the interpretation and application of scattering data.},

However, optimizing CVs remains a formidable challenge, particularly when limited prior knowledge about the transition process is available. This study presents an unsupervised approach for optimizing the CVs by iteratively applying the principal component analysis algorithm on the representative feature variables generated with the CUR method (an efficient feature space contraction algorithm that can be employed to seek the representative feature variables). The approach is validated using a hypothetical three-phase model of ultra-high-pressure hydrogen derived at the density functional theory level of theory to characterize transition pathways. CVs are constructed using feature variables extracted from simulated x-ray diffraction intensity spectra. Our fully unsupervised approach demonstrated self-correction capabilities in discovering probable phase-transition pathways. By relying solely on unbiased molecular dynamics simulations of metastable structures to construct the initial dataset, the free energy profile can be properly reproduced for the phase transitions among them, which suggests the potential for developing a highly autonomous approach to exploring complex systems with elusive physical mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {A classical and rigid force field for the oxonium cation, H 3 O + , optimized in solutions of TIP4P/2005 water, is introduced. While the charges of both H 3 O + and the selected counteranions (i.e., Cl − , Br − , I − , and NO 3 − ⁠ ) are scaled by a factor of 0.85, following the philosophy of the so-called Madrid-2019 model for ions, the charge distribution of H 3 O + was derived within the framework of the self-consistent atomic dipole-corrected Hirshfeld approach. Considering the simplicity of the model, the agreement between experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results for the curvature of the solution density as a function of the solute concentration is remarkable. However, limitations persist in capturing ion-pairing behavior and long-range hydrogen-bonding dynamics in polyatomic systems. We found that a scaled charge of 0.85 e provides an accurate description of the local structure of hydrogen halides but is detrimental to predicting the viscosity of the solution. The opposite effect is observed for HNO 3 . Nonetheless, the newly optimized potential parameters for H 3 O + expand the family of ions with scaled charges in the Madrid–2019 force field, providing a computationally efficient and versatile platform to study electrolyte solutions in acidic environments. These findings contribute to the advancement of molecular modeling techniques and to improving our understanding of the interplay between local structure (solvation, ion pairing) and transport properties in complex systems.},

However, recent advancements in computational and experimental techniques, particularly those with artificial intelligence (AI), are providing new avenues for precision and intelligent chemistry. This perspective highlights the synergistic integration of accurate theoretical simulations, advanced experimental characterization, and AI-driven models, creating a closed-loop system to accelerate chemical discovery and material design. At the core of this framework is an iterative process: precise computational and experimental data lead to advanced intelligent models, which guide the design of optimized reaction parameters or chemical components, and direct robotic platforms that perform reproducible, high-throughput experiments. These experimental data, in turn, provide continuous feedback to refine intelligent models, ultimately enabling precise control of reaction conditions and material properties. To fully realize this vision, we advocate the development of key infrastructures: a multidisciplinary, multimodal, and standardized AI-ready chemical database as a data foundation; a knowledge and logic-enhanced large chemical model for intelligent prediction and design; distributed, full-process robotic laboratories for automated experimentation; and a cloud platform for resource sharing and collaboration. Together, these components constitute a vision for robotic chemist cloud facilities, which will empower researchers with unparalleled capabilities to seamlessly integrate precision and intelligence.

While other groups were quick to point out that this alternative proposal gave predictions that were inconsistent with prior experimental observations, subsequent theoretical and experimental work [L. J. Mueller and D. P. Weitekamp, Science 283 , 61–65 (1999)] demonstrated that taking into account nuclear spin energies in exchange dynamics can indeed lead to a detectable contribution to the traditional averaging result. While the intuition that including nuclear spin energies in exchange dynamics could lead to an observable effect was ultimately found to be correct, the reason behind the failure of the earlier alternative averaging proposal was never fully articulated. In this work, it is shown that while both the traditional and alternative averaging proposals involve a thermal average over the system–environment interaction, the alternative averaging proposal also includes an additional thermal average over the Hamiltonian for the environment, which is the source of its error.},

The vibrational spectra of TIP3P molecules and carboxyl and carbonyl groups in the selectivity filter region (13.4, 48.7, and 53.2 THz) were calculated. The change in ion channel pore radius distribution and secondary structures of Ca v 1.1 triggered by external terahertz electromagnetic fields are measured. The umbrella sampling method is carried out to assess the functional changes of Ca v 1.1 via potential of mean force profiles of Ca 2+ permeation.

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet (UV) light is a well-established tool for fragmenting peptides in vacuum. This study investigates the fragmentation of peptides using 193 and 222 nm light in aqueous solution. Changes in the absorption spectra of solutions of the model dipeptide glycylglycine are monitored using a combination of real-time in situ transmission measurements and UV–Vis spectroscopy to report peptide bond scission following UV irradiation. Irradiation by a broadband ultraviolet light source flattens the absorbance peak centered near 193 nm, indicating cleavage of peptide bonds. Irradiation with low-intensity, monochromatic 193 and 222 nm light enabled measurements of the single-photon quantum yield of peptide bond scission, found to be (1.50 ± 0.12)% at 193 nm and (0.16 ± 0.03)% at 222 nm. These findings indicate that peptides may be fragmented in solution prior to emission into a mass spectrometer for new types of single-molecule analyses. The susceptibility of peptide bonds to ultraviolet radiation also suggests limited lifetimes for peptides on the early Earth’s surface, which are relevant to theories of the origins-of-life, and suggests a role for protein damage in explanations of the germicidal effect of 222 nm light exposure.},

  abstract     = {Photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (pcFPs) have enabled exquisite images of cellular structures due to their genetic encodability and red-shifted emission with high brightness, hence receiving increased traction in the field. However, the red form of Kaede-like pcFPs after photoconversion remains underexplored. We implemented ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopies on the red Kaede chromophore in solution vs the protein pocket of the least-evolved ancestor (LEA, a Kaede-like green-to-red pcFP) to gain crucial insights into the photophysical processes of the chromophore. The measured fluorescence quantum yield (FQY) values were correlated with ultrafast dynamics to reveal that hydrogen-bonding interactions with the solvent can quench the excited-state Kaede in solution. A viscosity-dependent sub-ps decay indicates nonradiative relaxation involving swift chromophore conformational motions. Femtosecond transient absorption and stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) reveal an additional ∼1 ps decay of the photoconverted red form of LEA that is absent in green LEA before photoconversion. Transient structural dynamics from FSRS elucidate this decay to involve the phenolate and imidazolinone ring twists that are implicated during cis → trans isomerization and on → off photoswitching in phototransformable fluorescent proteins (FPs). Compared to green-emitting species, the FQY of red LEA (∼0.58) and many other red FPs are often reduced, limiting their applications in modern bioimaging techniques. By shining more light on the often overlooked photoconverted form of pcFPs with ultrafast spectroscopies, we envision such essential mechanistic insights to enable a bottom-up approach for rationally improving the brightness of red-emitting LEA and many other controllable bioprobes, including FPs.},

This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backward. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as ω 3/2 within the long wavelength limit ( ω → 0), which is a more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ( ω 2 ). This scattering results in temperature-independent thermal conductivity, depending on the size as κ ∝ L 1/3 for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, although the temperature dependence seen there is possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, although anharmonic interaction can also be significant.},

Our analysis reaffirms that the thermodynamic drive for complex coacervation is influenced by key factors such as the number of ions bound to the polymer backbone and the entropy associated with free ions. By calculating the free energy of the system while considering position-dependent mutual interactions and chain conformations, we gain valuable insights into the local dielectricity as PEs overlap. Our findings indicate that global thermodynamic behavior is significantly shaped by local factors such as dielectric constant, providing an explanation for the discrepancies observed between experimental and computational studies. In addition, we found that entropy gain is inversely proportional to the local dielectric constant, provided that the electrostatic temperature remains constant. This relationship underscores the importance of polymer-specific parameters when examining the thermodynamic behavior of charged polymer complexation.},

This sol-gel transition driven dynamics was monitored over an incubation period of 30 days, as these systems were found to undergo gelation after a few weeks. The designed PAA-based homo ( P0 ), hydrophobically modified (∼4%) copolymers ( P4 , P6 ), and their coumarin 343 (C343) attached analogous copolymers ( P4′ , P6′ ) were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and characterized by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Dynamic light scattering experiments of aqueous copolymer solutions showed a gradual increment of hydrodynamic diameter (D h ) up to ∼4000 nm, and the onset of sol-gel transition was estimated by locating the intersection of two distinct slopes produced by the plots of average D h as a function of incubation time. The sol-gel transition for these copolymer solutions (aqueous) was clearly demonstrated by the progressive slowing down of DR times and the rotational fluorescence anisotropy times tracked over the entire incubation period. Interestingly, the onset time for the sol-gel transition was found to be insensitive to the chemical binding of the fluorescent probe to these polymers. A comparison between the steady state UV–VIS absorption and fluorescence spectral characteristics of aqueous solutions of these copolymers with chemically bound and externally added C343 suggested that the sol-gel transition involved polymer aggregation. This study may be useful for designing supramolecular polymer gels for biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous long-time diffusion. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of athermal active Brownian particles (ABPs)—a minimal model of active colloids. Building on prior work [Schiltz-Rouse et al. , Phys. Rev. E 108 , 064601 (2023)], where the kinetic temperature, pressure, and compressibility of the single-file ABP system were derived, we develop an accurate analytical expression for the mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle. We find that the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, governed by the reduced kinetic temperature of the system. At long times, the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD, [⟨(Δ x ) 2 ⟩∼ t 1/2 ], is preserved. However, self-propulsion introduces significant changes to the 1D-mobility, which we directly relate to the system’s compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D-mobility, originally proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems [M. Kollmann, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 , 180602 (2003)], can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings provide a framework for understanding particle transport in active systems and for tuning transport properties at the microscale, particularly in geometries where motion is highly restricted.},

While the dynamical aspects of simplified models have been widely studied, their thermodynamic properties are less understood. In this study, we explore the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP)-reduced models, initially developed for dynamical analysis, from a brand-new thermodynamic perspective. Analytical expressions, along with numerical simulations, demonstrate that the discrete MEP-reduced model strictly retains laws of thermodynamics, which holds true even when the aggregate size transits from discrete values to continuous real numbers. Our findings not only clarify the thermodynamic consistency between the MEP-reduced models and the original models of polymeric aggregates for the first time but also suggest avenues for future research into the model-reduction thermodynamics.},

However, the energy level alignment between GDW and semiconductors, which is critical for designing efficient device architectures, remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated the interfacial electronic structures of GDW electrodes with organic semiconductors (C 60 and rubrene) using in situ x-ray/ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We also explored the effect of ultraviolet–ozone (UV–O 3 ) treatment on the charge injection barriers. After 5 min of UV–O 3 treatment, the work function of GDW increased by ∼0.4 eV due to surface oxidation, shifting the electron and hole injection barriers for C 60 from 0.59 and 1.66 eV to 0.84 and 1.41 eV, respectively, and shifting those for rubrene from 1.82 and 0.74 eV to 2.14 and 0.42 eV, respectively. Weak interactions of both organic semiconductors with the GDW were observed, in contrast to metal electrodes.

  abstract     = {All-inorganic halide double perovskites have attracted extensive attention as new luminescent materials owing to their high luminous efficiency and wide emission spectrum. In this work, blue-red bicolor Cs 2 NaGdCl 6 (CNGC) double perovskite nanocrystals doped with Sb 3+ /Ho 3+ were prepared using a hydrothermal method. The incorporation of Sb 3+ significantly enhanced the intrinsic “self-trapped excitons (STEs)” with a wide-band bright blue emission centered at 470 nm. On this basis, different concentrations of Ho 3+ were introduced to achieve color tunable emission from blue to red region, with extremely high quantum efficiencies of 96.53% and 92.17%, respectively. By the use of diverse methods, including spectroscopic analysis and fluorescence lifetime, the mechanism of efficient luminescence related to the different dopant concentrations was comprehensively explored. Results show that Sb 3+ not only can enhance the intrinsic STEs luminescence of the CNGC but also has an efficient activation effect on the rare earth ion Ho 3+ , because it plays the role as a bridge for the two energy transfer channels between the luminescence centers, and the details of the mechanism and energy transfer efficiency were investigated. Thermal stabilities of the double perovskites were studied over the temperature range of 303–473 K and good performances were demonstrated from the fact that the PL intensities of CNGC:1%Sb 3+ and CNGC:1%Sb 3+ /10%Ho 3+ at 423 K were 75.1% and 70.1% compared to those at 303 K, respectively. With the CNGC:1%Sb 3+ and CNGC:1%Sb 3+ /10Ho 3+ used, the UV light-emitting diode activated devices were fabricated and characterized. The bright blue and red emissions suggest the materials’ prominent potential in the application of plant lighting. Finally, to achieve white-light emission in the sole CNGC matrix, a strategy of tri-doping Tb 3+ was proposed based on the principle of the three primary colors. The device fabrication with CNGC:1%Sb 3+ /10%Ho 3+ /2.5%Tb 3+ sample and the characterization processes prove its high feasibility and then provide valuable insights in the design of Sb ion-doped lead-free double perovskites toward easily tunable color in a wide range which can be applied in various fields.},

  abstract     = {Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters, although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange–correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. This is due to the constraint on the form of multiconfigurational state imposed by the BS determinant, a feature common to other single-reference methods too. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.},

  abstract     = {Anomalous intrinsic properties of bulk viscosity at normal states of simple liquids were revealed by molecular dynamics simulations, compared with shear viscosity and thermal conductivity. To this end, we analyzed the partial contributions of the time correlation function in the Green–Kubo formula not only from pair and three-body interactions but also from attractive and repulsive parts. The most distinct feature of bulk viscosity from the other transport properties is sensitivity to the attractive interaction. What is even more interesting is that the effect of attractive interactions is greatly reduced by the introduction of the three-body repulsion, even though the strength of the three-body repulsion itself is very weak and has little effect directly on all the transport coefficients. The mechanism behind this is elucidated in detail through the change in the pair distribution function brought about by the introduction of the three-body interaction. We conclude that the origin of the anomalous properties is that the transport process corresponding to bulk viscosity is a scalar process that does not involve directional flow, unlike other transport processes.},

To study the crystal particle morphology and size control of TKX-55, this study predicted the crystal structure of TKX-55 through quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations as well as simulated and analyzed the crystal morphology changes that occur under the influence of specific solvents and crystal habit modification. Based on the simulation results, this study designed five different recrystallization methods and prepared recrystallized products with different morphologies and particle size distributions. The crystal growth mechanism was analyzed and discussed. The morphology and structure of the recrystallized samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, powder x-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy techniques. The thermal properties of the recrystallized samples were tested using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The impact sensitivity of the recrystallized sample was tested, and it was found that the impact sensitivity of the recrystallized product was significantly lower than that of the TKX-55 raw material. Through the combination of simulation and experiment, this study ultimately obtained three morphology rules, narrow particle size distribution, and effectively improved the safety of heat-resistant energetic material crystal particles.},

  abstract     = {Following the early simulation results for simple liquids, various hard body fluids have been used in molecular-based equations of state as a leading/reference term. This has been justified for normal liquids by the similarity of their structure, but for polar and associating ones, a direct application of hard body models has not been considered so far. Viewing the hard body models, fused-hard-sphere bodies, as simple geometrical objects, their mutual interaction is additive. However, when accounting for the mutual effect of the site–site interactions, the individual hard sphere–hard sphere interactions may become non-additive, and consequently, the resulting interaction between the hard bodies becomes non-additive, which may also affect their structure. The effect of the non-additivity on the structural properties, the site–site and dipole–dipole correlation functions are analyzed in detail by considering three polar fluids, quadrupolar carbon dioxide, dipolar acetonitrile, and acetone, as well as two associating fluids, methanol and water. The modification of the mutual geometry in the non-additive models leads to differences both in their structural and orientation correlations. The comparison of the structure of the non-additive purely repulsive hard-body models with those of the empirical models of the chosen real liquids shows surprising similarities, which extends the possibilities of the direct application of the hard-body fluids as reference systems in perturbation theories.},

  abstract     = {The hard-sphere potential has become a cornerstone in the study of both molecular and complex fluids. Despite its mathematical simplicity, its implementation in fixed time step molecular simulations remains a formidable challenge due to the discontinuity at contact. To avoid the issues associated with the ill-defined force at contact, a continuous potential has recently been proposed—here referred to as the pseudo-hard-sphere potential (pHS) [Báez et al. , J. Chem, Phys. 149 , 164907 (2018)]. This potential is constructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential and is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. However, this hypothesis has only been partially validated within the fluid region of the phase diagram for hard-sphere dispersions in two and three dimensions. In this contribution, we examine the ability of the continuous pHS potential to reproduce the equation of state of a hard-sphere fluid, not only in the fluid phase but also across the fluid–solid coexistence region. Our focus is primarily on the phase diagram of hard-sphere systems in three and four dimensions; however, we also report on the feasibility of the pHS to reproduce the long time dynamics of a three-dimensional colloidal dispersion. We compare the thermodynamic properties obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of the pHS potential with those derived from refined event-driven simulations of the corresponding hard-sphere potential. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis with theoretical equations of state based on both mean-field and integral equation approximations.},

The simulations are performed using non-additive isotropic ab initio two-body, three-body, and four-body potential energy surfaces (PESs). We apply corrections to account for both the finite size simulation errors and the Trotter factorization errors. Simulations that use only the two-body PES during sampling yield an equation of state similar to that of simulations that use both the two-body and three-body PESs during sampling. With the four-body interaction energy, we predict an equilibrium density of 0.026 08 A ̊ − 3 ⁠ , very close to the experimental result of 0.0261 A ̊ − 3 ⁠ . The inclusion of the four-body interaction energy also brings the simulation results in excellent agreement with the experimental pressure–density data until around 0.065 A ̊ − 3 ⁠ , beyond which the simulation results overestimate the pressure. These PESs overestimate the average kinetic energy per molecule at the equilibrium density by about 7% compared to the experimental result. Our findings suggest that, at higher densities, we require five-body and higher-order many-body interactions to quantitatively improve the agreement between the pressure-density curve produced by simulations and that of the experiment. Using the four-body PES during sampling at excessively high densities, where such higher-order many-body interactions are likely to be significant, causes an artificial symmetry breaking in the hcp lattice structure of the solid.},

  abstract     = {Natural ester (NE) insulating oil is increasingly recognized as an ideal insulating medium for power equipment, attributed to its high ignition point and biodegradability. As power systems advance to higher voltage levels, enhancing the dielectric properties of natural ester insulating oil has emerged as a key research focus. While nanoparticles enhance dielectric properties, their limited dispersion stability restricts practical applications. Liquid crystals, a novel functional modification material compatible with insulating oil, provide a new approach for modifying NE due to their unique mobility and anisotropy. Experimental results indicate that incorporating liquid crystal molecules at a 0.3% mass fraction enhances the AC breakdown strength of natural ester insulating oil by 16.7%. By combining molecular dynamics and density functional theory principles, the microscopic mechanism of liquid crystal modification was analyzed by modeling oil molecules before and after modification. The study found that liquid crystal molecules significantly reduce the system’s free volume and hinder water molecule diffusion through hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the high electron affinity of liquid crystal molecules reduces carrier mobility by capturing free electrons, thereby effectively suppressing partial discharges and electrochemical reactions. This study investigates the modification mechanism of a novel functional material on the dielectric properties of natural ester insulating oil from a microscopic perspective.},

We observe a strong temperature and magnetic field dependence of the PL spectra, and the spin–lattice relaxation ( T 1 ) among m s levels within the T 1 state appears to be accelerated due to both ZFS in the T 1 state and the presence of the applied magnetic field, allowing for an assessment of the axial ZFS parameter ( D ) for the chromophoric T 1 state, which is EPR silent at X-band (∼9 GHz). Analysis of the data indicates a zero-field splitting (ZFS) of the T 1 state (−2.9 ± 0.7 cm −1 ) that derives from the presence of spin–orbit coupling related to the heavy Pt(II) ion. The results have been used to provide an estimate of the ZFS in the quartet excited state of related radical-elaborated (radical-dichalcogenolene)Pt(dbbpy) complexes. This information is necessary to understand how transitions between the 2 T 1 and 4 T 1 excited states in these radical-elaborated complexes lead to electron spin polarization within their 2 T 1 state and how this is transferred to the 2 S 0 electronic ground state.},

The two lowest vibronic transitions of a 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene (TIPS-Pn) molecule serve as a model system for the 3LVS considered above. TIPS-Pn’s 2DES spectra were measured and analyzed using the center line slope (CLS) method. The CLSs of both the diagonal and cross-peaks consist of an exponential decay and an underdamped mode oscillating at a frequency of 264 cm −1 , corresponding to the long axis breathing mode of the pentacene moiety of TIPS-Pn. The CLS oscillations’ amplitude and phase of both the diagonal and cross-peaks were measured to have a specific relationship with each other, which is well predicted and simulated by our theory for the 3LVS of TIPS-Pn. We estimate an effective Huang–Rhys factor of ∼0.27, which quantifies the coupling of the two vibronic transitions to the long axis breathing mode of the pentacene moiety of TIPS-Pn. We show that such simultaneous CLS analysis recovering the amplitudes and phase relationships between diagonal peaks and cross-peaks measures the correlated vibrational coherences of different states. This can be used to quantify how different excited states or multi-chromophoric states are coupled to common modes in more complex multistate systems.},

The spectrum exhibits a complex and rich vibronic structure, which was analyzed using advanced first-principles methodologies. The equilibrium geometries and the potential energy surfaces of the neutral and cationic ground state as well as of the lowest cationic excited states were computed using post-Hartree–Fock configuration interaction methods. For the photoionization populating the linear X ̃ + 2 Π state of HNCS + , an adiabatic ionization energy of 9.918 ± 0.008 eV is determined, which agrees well with our calculated value of 9.921 eV. For an accurate calculation of ionization energies of sulfur-containing molecules, previous explicitly correlated computational schemes were revised as tight d functions need to be included. The lowest photoelectron band is subject to Renner–Teller splitting and spin–orbit splitting and was analyzed using a perturbative approach. The bands corresponding to transitions populating the A ̃ + 2 A″ and B ̃ + 2 A′ cationic states show vibrationally resolved progressions that were also assigned, leading to adiabatic ionization energies of 13.361 ± 0.012 and 13.555 ± 0.012 eV.

  abstract     = {The study on the conformational equilibrium of small flexible molecules under different environments is essential to understand the folding motives in complex molecules. Aminoethanol (NH 2 CH 2 CH 2 OH) is a typical flexible molecule with rich conformational isomerism, but its conformational diversity in the gas phase or solutions is not yet fully understood. Owing to well-separated peaks and the absence of intermolecular interactions, gas-phase Raman spectroscopy is a valuable tool for characterizing molecular conformations. Using temperature-dependent photoacoustic Raman spectroscopy (PARS), the gas-phase Raman spectra of aminoethanol were measured in the O–H and C–H stretching regions. The analysis of the observed gas-phase Raman spectra, together with theoretical calculations, allows us to identify one O–H⋯N intramolecular H-bonded conformer (g′Gg′) and four free-OH conformers (gGt and tGt, gGg and tGg). Furthermore, using the assigned gas-phase conformers, the conformational changes of aminoethanol were investigated in the nonpolar CCl 4 and polar water solutions, respectively. It was shown that intramolecular H-bonds are unlikely to be a significant factor in the conformational equilibrium of liquid aminoethanol, whereas the gauche effect is clearly very important. In addition, the concentration-dependent Raman spectra in aqueous solution revealed that aminoethanol molecules prefer the tGt conformation upon dilution with water. This can be ascribed to the fact that polar water molecules push aminoethanol conformers toward a higher dipole moment rather than a lower one, which is in good agreement with recent molecular dynamic simulations. Our findings deepen the understanding of the effect of ruling conformational stability and shed light on molecular switches that are activated in different solvent environments.},

  abstract     = {The lowest-energy structure of Be 8 H 6 adopts a distinctive star-like configuration (Be 2 ©Be 6 H 6 ), consisting of a Be 2 dimer oriented orthogonally to a planar hexagonal Be 6 H 6 ring, with hydrogen atoms bridging the outer edges. This system, characterized by D 6 h symmetry and a triplet ground state ( 3 A 1g ), features an exceptionally short Be–Be bond length of 1.874 Å. Chemical bonding analysis reveals a rare dual aromaticity: six delocalized σ electrons conform to the 4n + 2 Hückel rule, while four delocalized π electrons satisfy the 4n Baird rule. Notably, Be 2 ©Be 6 H 6 represents the first example exhibiting both π-Baird and σ-Hückel dual aromaticity. Covalent dative interactions between the s/p orbitals of the Be 2 dimer and the delocalized Be 6 H 6 framework contribute to the exceptional stability of this system. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating multiple aromaticity frameworks, specifically Hückel and Baird aromaticity, in designing and stabilizing novel inorganic systems.},

Chem. Phys. 157 , 144301 (2022)]. A partial-wave analysis and numerical fitting of the experimental data attributed the measured angular distribution to an l = 2 shape resonance near E c / k B = 1 K (≈0.7 cm −1 ). Here, we report the computation of a new potential energy surface for the Ne–H 2 interaction suitable for the study of collisions between highly vibrationally excited H 2 /D 2 with Ne as well as quantum scattering calculations of stereodynamics of D 2 ( v = 4, j = 2) + Ne collisions probing Δ j = −2 rotational transition in D 2 . Our results show that collisions are dominated by a strong l = 5 resonance near 3 K (≈2.09 cm −1 ) and a weaker l = 6 resonance near 8 K (≈5.56 cm −1 ) and not an l = 2 resonance, as suggested in the analysis of the experimental data. A reasonable agreement between our calculations and the experiments is obtained only when an artificial energy cutoff is applied to the integral over the collision energy to exclude contributions from the l = 5 resonance while retaining contributions from l = 0, 1, and 2. However, our calculations do not support the claim that the measured angular distributions are dominated by a single l = 2 partial-wave resonance characteristic of orbiting collisions.},

The calculations use the time-dependent wave packet method and are based on the recently reported nonadiabatic PESs [Z. Wang, S. Hou, and C. Xie, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 25 , 23808 (2023)]. The results demonstrate that the initial rotational excitation has a minimal effect on the CT process, whereas the reactant alignment significantly affects the rate coefficients and integral cross sections. The highest reaction rates and cross sections occur at the perpendicular alignment, where side-on collisions enhance the CT efficiency, especially at low temperatures. Differential cross sections (DCSs) reveal that parallel alignment promotes forward and backward scattering, while increasing alignment angle β of the molecular bond axes with respect to the collision direction introduces a backward scattering hump at low temperatures. Moreover, constructive quantum interference in the m -dependent DCSs, where m denotes the magnetic projection quantum number, accounts for the enhanced backward scattering at the perpendicular alignment, reflecting the influence of quantum interference on stereodynamical effects during the CT process.},

We have synthesized a new carbazole oligomer (mono, di, tri, tetra) substituted luminescent tris (2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) methyl (TTM) radicals. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed emission stemmed from the excited state charge transfer character. Despite the increase in the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the carbazole oligomer associated with increasing the oligomer length, the PL maxima showed a blue shift from di- to tetra-oligomer substitution. This unexpected behavior was explained by quantum chemical calculations, including electron–electron repulsion. The electron–electron repulsion on the donor orbital decreases when the oligomer length increases and leads to the blue shift of the emission. The blue shift of the emission accompanied by an increase in the photoluminescence quantum yield by substituting a large π-conjugated donor to a TTM radical would be a unique method to control the photophysical property of the luminescent radical.},

The counter-rotating component of the driving field can induce behavior where the heat flows from the cold bath to the hot one and an output work is done. It is, thus, evident that the precise modulation of the synthetic bath whose inverse temperature varies continuously from negative to positive enables all modes of energy transfer in the phase diagram. The non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics for realistic devices is further investigated when the external driving field is switched on and off periodically.},

The dication was formed by ion-impact ionization using energetic Xe 3+ projectiles. Our results show that butadiene dication has a high propensity of neutral particle emission (H/H 2 /C 2 H 2 ) prior to two-body dissociation into two singly charged fragments. The asymmetric two-body breakup, after the emission of neutral fragments from parent butadiene dication, is observed to be twice as probable as the asymmetric two-body breakup of intact butadiene dication. Our experimental results suggest that multiple structures may be formed for several different precursor dications formed after loss of neutral particles, which is indicative of the strong role of hydrogen scrambling. The internal energy dependence and time evolution of the interplay between neutral particle emission, hydrogen scrambling, and hydrogen migration are explored using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to support the experimental observations.},

Herein, we introduce the first binary mono-anionic Li 4 F 4 − cluster containing a ptF center with C 2 v symmetry. At a given level of theory, it is a global minimum (GM) structure with good dynamic stability and significant barriers to interconversion into the lowest energy isomers. It is noteworthy that the GM of the neutral Li 4 F 4 species adopts a cube configuration similar to that of the typical bulk lithium fluoride crystal structure rather than a planar shape. The stability of the ptF is dominated by electrostatic interactions, supplemented by a weak covalent component rather than any aromaticity. The cluster is a highly viable species and a promising candidate for experimental detection and characterization.},

  abstract     = {Photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy through coordinated energy transfer between light-harvesting complexes and reaction centers (RCs). Understanding exciton motion, particularly the exciton diffusion length, is essential for optimizing energy efficiency in photosystems. In this work, we combine intensity-cycling transient absorption spectroscopy with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation to investigate exciton motion in the C 2 S 2 photosystem II supercomplex of spinach. Using exciton–exciton annihilation, revealed in the fifth-order response, we experimentally estimate an exciton diffusion length of 10.9 nm based on a 3D normal diffusion model, suggesting the ability of excitons to traverse the supercomplex. However, kMC simulations reveal that exciton motion is sub-diffusive because of spatial constraints and the strong RC traps. An anomalous diffusion model analysis of the experimental data yields a diffusion length of 9.7 nm, while the simulated diffusion length is 7.4 nm. The variable exciton residence time across subunits, partly influenced by their connectivity to the trap, indicates inhomogeneous annihilation probability and suggests how plants balance efficient light harvesting with photoprotection. We also explore the influence of specific assumptions in the annihilation simulation, which are challenging to access in more complex environments, such as the thylakoid membrane. Our study provides a framework for studying exciton dynamics using exciton–exciton annihilation, which can be extended to understand the light-harvesting efficiencies of larger, more complex photosynthetic assemblies.},

Density fluctuations spread superdiffusively as ∼ t 2/3 at long times, and their spatio-temporal behavior is well described by the KPZ scaling function. In the absence of the cosine potential, the correlation functions in the system of dragged hard spheres show scaling behavior according to the Edwards–Wilkinson universality class.

We use these energy contributions to compute highly reliable and accurate reference values for the energy ratios underlying the Lieb–Oxford bound and the convexity conjecture for the adiabatic connection. Commonly used approximate exchange–correlation functionals that go beyond the local density approximation lead to values for the energy ratios that agree surprisingly well with the calculated reference data. The largest value for the energy ratio corresponding to the Lieb–Oxford bound observed for the considered systems is 1.4024, which is well below the estimate of 1.9554 ≤ λ L O ≤ 2.1346 for the Lieb–Oxford bound. The convexity conjecture for the adiabatic connection is not violated for any of the considered systems. We show that the numerical errors of the employed response function KS inversion method using Gaussian basis sets can be kept almost negligibly small by choosing an appropriate computational setup. The KS inversion method, furthermore, requires only moderate computational effort and, therefore, is well-suited to calculate reference data for various quantities of interest in Kohn–Sham density-functional theory for large numbers of molecules.},

  abstract     = {Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and would distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear; their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next and across the sample. Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimization loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles. The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel many-body approach for determining the amplitudes of generalized operators in a projection-based formalism. To implicitly account for the effects of higher-order excitations, we begin with the well-established double-exponential coupled-cluster (CC) ansatz, parametrized by both one- and two-body excitation operators, complemented by a set of vacuum-annihilating two-body generalized operators with effective excitation rank of one. A systematic formalism is developed that effectively bypasses the constraints due to the vacuum-annihilation property of the generalized operators toward a set of closed-form residual equations for their optimization. Such a strategy requires the removal of the underlying redundancy in high-rank excited determinants, generated due to the presence of the generalized operators in the ansatz, by projecting them onto an internally contracted lower-dimensional manifold. This many-body formalism is integrated with the near-term projective quantum eigensolver (PQE) framework that leverages the conventional CC-like residual minimization to iteratively decouple the excited manifold from the reference. With the application of several molecular systems within PQE architecture, we demonstrate that the developed methodology enables us to achieve similar accuracy to the disentangled unitary coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and triples ansatz while utilizing an order of magnitude fewer quantum resources. Furthermore, when simulated under stochastic Gaussian noise or depolarizing hardware noise, our method shows significantly improved noise resilience compared to the other members of PQE family and the state-of-the-art variational quantum eigensolver.},

  abstract     = {While exploring molecular modifications of the high-performance acceptor Y6 with an A-DA′D-A framework, researchers have discovered that asymmetric modification of terminal groups (TGs) appears to be a promising approach as it frequently enhances the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) effectively. However, the underlying mechanism about how asymmetric TG modifications influence morphology and charge carrier mobility remains unclear. We have conducted a systematic study in this work to investigate the morphology and electron mobility of two asymmetric Y6 derivatives with the A 1 -DA′D-A 2 framework: Y6-asym-IM2O (A 1 = IM-2F and A 2 = IM2O, representing small-scale TG modification) and Y6-asym-BR (A 1 = IM-2F and A 2 = BR, representing large-scale TG modification), along with their symmetric counterparts (A1 = A2 = IM-2F/BR/IM2O). The results demonstrate that small-scale asymmetric TG modifications such as Y6-asym-IM2O fine-tune molecular packing, while large-scale modifications such as Y6-asym-BR drastically alter stacking patterns. In addition, hybridization effects are found in the frontier molecular orbital energy, electrostatic potential, and electron mobility of the asymmetric molecules, which fall between the values of their symmetric counterparts. In particular, the results of small-scale asymmetric modification of Y6 reveal that the introduction of promising TGs in an asymmetric manner can further improve electron mobility by tuning reorganization energy and morphology, and vice versa. While previous studies focused on symmetric modifications, this work systematically investigates asymmetric substitution patterns and further elucidates the impact of these methods on charge transfer for the first time. These discoveries underscore the potential of utilizing asymmetric modification of TGs as a quantitative means to regulate electron mobility in Y6-based OSCs.},

Recently, the coupled-trajectory surface hopping (CTSH) method has been proposed to combine the key advantages of the coupled-trajectory mixed quantum–classical method based on XF and the fewest switches surface hopping. We here present a novel variant of CTSH, namely, sign-consistent CTSH (SC-CTSH), which considers proper trajectory clustering to reconstruct the nuclear density distribution and the consistency between wave function and active states to introduce decoherence. Using the exact quantum solutions as references, the high performance of SC-CTSH is benchmarked in the widely studied scattering models and compared with other related XF-based methods. Due to the incorporation of new trajectory clustering and sign consistency algorithms, SC-CTSH obtains more accurate quantum momentum and decoherence during the nonadiabatic dynamics, which makes the combination of XF and surface hopping more consistent and reliable. This study further highlights the significance of internal consistency between wave function and active states, which is important in the further development of mixed quantum–classical dynamics methods.},

  abstract     = {Ice nucleation plays a pivotal role in many natural and industrial processes, and molecular simulations have proven vital in uncovering its kinetics and mechanisms. A fundamental component of such simulations is the choice of an order parameter (OP) that quantifies the progress of nucleation, with the efficacy of an OP typically measured by its ability to predict the committor probabilities. Here, we leverage a machine learning framework introduced in our earlier work [Domingues et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15 , 1279, (2024)] to systematically investigate how key implementation details influence the efficacy of standard Steinhardt OPs in capturing the progress of both homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation. Our analysis identifies distance and q 6 cutoffs as the primary determinants of OP performance, regardless of the mode of nucleation. We also examine the impact of two popular refinement strategies, namely chain exclusion and hydration shell inclusion, on OP efficacy. We find neither strategy to exhibit a universally consistent impact. Instead, their efficacy depends strongly on the chosen distance and q 6 cutoffs. Chain exclusion enhances OP efficacy when the underlying OP lacks sufficient selectivity, whereas hydration shell inclusion is beneficial for overly selective OPs. Consequently, we demonstrate that selecting optimal combinations of such cutoffs can eliminate the need for these refinement strategies altogether. These findings provide a systematic understanding of how to design and optimize OPs for accurately describing complex nucleation phenomena, offering valuable guidance for improving the predictive power of molecular simulations.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced sampling simulations help overcome free energy barriers and explore molecular conformational space by applying external bias potential along suitable collective variables (CVs). However, identifying optimal CVs that align with the slow modes of complex molecular systems with many coupled degrees of freedom can be a significant challenge. Deep time-lagged independent component analysis (Deep-TICA) addresses this issue by employing an artificial neural network that generates non-linear combinations of molecular descriptors to learn the slowest degrees of freedom. Training Deep-TICA CVs, however, typically requires long equilibrium simulations that can sample multiple recrossing events across various metastable conformations of the molecule. This requirement can often be prohibitively expensive, thereby limiting its widespread application. In this study, we present an algorithm that enables the training of Deep-TICA CVs using a limited amount of trajectory data obtained from short, non-equilibrium metadynamics simulations that only sample one forward transition from the initial to the final state. We achieve this by utilizing the variational Koopman algorithm, which reweights short off-equilibrium trajectories to reflect the equilibrium probability densities. We demonstrate that enhanced sampling simulations conducted along the Koopman reweighted Deep-TICA CV can accurately and efficiently converge the free energy surface for systems such as the Müller–Brown potential, alanine dipeptide, and the chignolin mini-protein. Our approach, therefore, addresses the key challenge of inferring slow modes from limited trajectory data, making it more feasible to use deep learning CVs to study molecular processes of practical relevance.},

Therefore, understanding and controlling the variation in bubble sizes is critical. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework for Ostwald ripening of buoyancy-driven microbubbles by introducing a height-dependent size distribution function. For the first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state can be interpreted within the Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner theory when the distribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the buoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the distribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over time, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal distribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles grows linearly with height.},

The interplay between oddness and inertia induces a non-equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous to a non-homogeneous phase, characterized by the emergence of bubbles due to odd interactions. This phenomenon occurs in the absence of attractions and results from the competition between pressures, arising from particle repulsion, which tends to shrink the bubble, and an effective surface force that promotes its expansion. The latter is an effective centrifugal force associated with the circular motion of particles along the bubble’s surface, driven by transverse interactions. As a signature of the phase transition, the system exhibits vortex structures and oscillating spatial velocity correlations, which emerge near the analytically predicted transition point. Our findings can be tested in granular experiments involving odd interactions, such as spinners and active granular particles, and could be crucial for characterizing the emergent properties of metamaterials.},

The design of wireframe DNA origami structures traditionally follows a top–down approach. This study introduces a complementary bottom–up approach to investigate the nano-components constituting these nanostructures and their impact on structural stability. To this end, modifications to edge staple crossovers, poly-T bulges, and staple sequences were examined through coarse-grained molecular dynamics. The results reveal that reducing the number of edge staple crossovers slightly alters the distance between the two double-stranded DNA helices forming the edges but maintains adequate structural stability. The removal of poly-T bulges, however, leads to edge opening under specific thermal conditions, whereas structures containing poly-T bulges remain intact, highlighting their critical role in edge stability. Furthermore, changes to the staple sequences, achieved by repositioning the scaffold nick, showed negligible effects on the overall stability of the wireframe DNA origami structures. The incorporation of a bottom–up approach in designing wireframe DNA origami structures can enable the creation of nanostructures with tailored properties for specific applications. These modifications can be adapted for a variety of wireframe DNA origami structures, broadening their potential uses in nanotechnology.},

In particular, we focus on the advection-dominated regime typical of aqueous droplets drying at room temperature and systematically investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) during this nonequilibrium process. In general, drying produces transient particle concentration gradients within the droplet in this regime, with a considerable accumulation of particles at the droplet’s liquid–vapor interface. We find that these gradients become significantly larger with pairwise HIs between colloidal particles instead of a free-draining hydrodynamic approximation; however, the solvent’s boundary conditions at the droplet’s interface (unbounded, slip, or no-slip) do not have a significant effect on the particle distribution. DDFT calculations leveraging the radial symmetry of the drying droplet are in excellent agreement with particle-based simulations for free-draining hydrodynamics, but DDFT unexpectedly fails for pairwise HIs after the particle concentration increases during drying, manifesting as an ejection of particles from the droplet. We hypothesize that this unphysical behavior originates from an inaccurate approximation of the two-body density correlations based on the bulk pair correlation function, which we support by measuring the confined equilibrium two-body density correlations using particle-based simulations. We identify some potential strategies for addressing this issue in DDFT.},

  abstract     = {The conformational properties of semiflexible active polar linear and ring phantom polymers are analyzed analytically to shed light on their dependence on activity. Special attention is paid to the influence of the implemented bond force for discrete and continuous polymer models. In detail, the Gaussian semiflexible polymer model and a model with a harmonic bond potential with finite bond length are considered. The studies reveal the immanent effects of the particular bond model on the polymer conformations as well as on the discrete or continuous representation. For continuum models, activity implies polymer end effects only, whereas for discrete models, all bonds can contribute to activity-dependent conformational changes. Ring polymers lack end effects; hence, continuous rings exhibit the same conformations as passive polymers. Similarly, the conformations of inextensible continuous polymers (Kratky–Porod worm-like chain) are activity-independent. These findings are in contrast to passive polymers, where a wide spectrum of bond potentials capture their generic features. Hence, this universality is broken by activity, and a model must be carefully selected to capture the characteristics observed in experiments.},

To this end, the full time evolution of the helix–coil transition is simulated using molecular dynamics simulations. At the start of the transition, short 3 10 -helices form, seemingly leading to the molecule becoming more aspherical midway through the collapse. After the completed collapse, the formation of α -helices becomes the prevalent ordering mechanism leading to helical bundles, a typical structural motif representative of the equilibrium behavior of longer chains. The dynamics of this transition is quantified in terms of the power-law scaling of two associated relaxation times as a function of chain length.},

For the reproduction of phase transitions in liquid crystals, many authors have reparameterized the classical force fields. For the first time, we demonstrate that even a general-purpose force field, for example, General AMBER Force Field (GAFF), without modifications is also capable of reproducing an isotropic–nematic transition at 300 K within microsecond-scale simulations. However, the isotropic–nematic transition enthalpy is overestimated, which leads to higher thermodynamic stability of the nematic phase. For the obtained nematic phase, the calculations of self-diffusion are performed during almost 2 μ s at different temperatures, which are compared against previous experimental and computational studies. The diffusion coefficients are underestimated compared with the experiment because of stronger molecular interactions. The diffusion anisotropy ratio lies within the experimental observations. Our work justifies the key problems of GAFF in reproducing the properties of the 5CB liquid crystal.},

In this work, we propose a charge calibration strategy for electrocatalytic processes. This strategy accounts for charge transfer in systems with explicit solvation and ions during constant-potential free energy modeling. In our strategy, interfacial counter-ions are employed to model the Helmholtz layer and determine the surface charge density, which defines the electrode potential. During the simulation of electrochemical reactions, extra charges are introduced/extracted to/from the system to compensate for electron transfer between the electrode and the reaction species and keep a constant surface charge density along the reaction profile. Our method showcases the impact of potential-dependent solvent reorganization on reaction kinetics and underscores the importance of constant potential kinetics. We anticipate that the strategy presented here will inspire further theoretical and experimental studies for electrochemistry interfaces.},

In this work, by means of an atomistic model, we have studied the formation of cavities in spherical silver nanoparticles embedded in amorphous silica using one or more femtosecond laser pulses. The model allows us to identify the different processes that lead to cavity formation and how they affect the variation of the aspect ratio, i.e., the relationship between the size of the cavity and that of the metallic sphere. The model is used to explain experiments revealing the conditions necessary to produce hollow metal nanoparticles. New information on hollow nanoparticle formation both in single shot and multiple shot regimes is reported. The atomistic model in combination with an optical model constitutes a tool to tune the properties of hollow nanoparticles, as shown in this paper. This way, we can achieve a fine control over the aspect ratio and, thus, about the localized surface plasmon resonance of the hollow nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {We report computational simulation results addressing the ionization response of liquid water upon valence ionization. The simulations cover ionizations in the whole valence-orbital range of liquid water, i.e., vacancies in 1b 1 , 3a 1 , 1b 2 , and 2a 1 orbitals. It is found that ionization in any of these valence orbitals leads to rapid proton-transfer dynamics. The timescale on which the proton transfer occurs depends on which type of orbital is ionized. For ionization in the 2a 1 orbitals, the proton transfer takes place in about 22 fs, competing with the intermolecular Coulombic decay mechanism that takes place on a similar timescale. This result is discussed in the context of earlier experimental results (Richter et al. , Nat. Commun. 9 , 4988) regarding the intermolecular Coulombic decay in water. For ionization in the outer-valence orbitals (1b 1 , 3a 1 , 1b 2 ), we see rapid internal conversion via non-adiabatic transitions to the electronic ground state. The proton transfer occurs 46, 70, and 91 fs after the initial ionization from a 1b 1 , 3a 1 , and 1b 2 orbital, respectively. The initial valence ionization induces strong vibrational excitations in the surrounding water molecules, leading to a considerable increase in the local effective temperature. The created heat diffuses into the liquid environment on a timescale of several hundred femtoseconds. We compare the results using two different embedding schemes, subtractive and electrostatic embedding, and find overall very similar dynamics.},

  abstract     = {A sensitivity increase of two orders of magnitude in proton ( 1 H) and carbon ( 13 C) spins via dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has been accomplished recently using a compact benchtop DNP polarizer operating at 1 T and 77 K. However, the DNP mechanisms at play at such a low magnetic field and high operating temperature are still not fully elucidated. A deeper understanding of the dominant polarization transfer mechanisms between electrons and 1 H and 13 C spins under these benchtop conditions is, therefore, required if one wants to devise strategies to boost sensitivity further. In this study, we found that DNP is generally dominated by solid effect (two-spin and three-spin) for narrow electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line radicals (15 mM trityl OX063) and cross effect for broad EPR line radicals (50 mM TEMPOL). For both radicals, the dominant DNP mechanisms were investigated varying the microwave frequency and measuring the 1 H and 13 C DNP enhancement factors to obtain 1 H and 13 C DNP spectra. The impact of varying the microwave power on the 1 H DNP buildup times and the 1 H nuclear spin relaxation times were important as well to distinguish between solid effect and cross effect DNP. Finally, time-resolved electron saturation simulations under continuous microwave irradiation could replicate the experimental 1 H and 13 C DNP spectra at 1 T and 77 K for both radicals considering their electron relaxation properties. Only for trityl OX063, the 13 C DNP spectra showed additional DNP maxima compared to the simulations. This has been attributed to methyl rotor induced 1 H– 13 C heteronuclear cross relaxation in [1– 13 C] acetate present at 1 T and 77 K.},

  abstract     = {Owing to their unrivaled porosities and high surface areas, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for mitigating the global warming crisis through capturing and storing CO 2 gas. However, the exothermic process of CO 2 uptake can lead to temperature rises that can severely compromise the efficiency of these materials for such purposes. In this work, we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations and anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to investigate the influence of varying levels of CO 2 uptake in dictating the heat transfer mechanisms in MOF-5. Compared to the empty framework, we find that the thermal conductivity of the gas loaded framework is highly dependent on the gas diffusivities and temperatures. At low temperatures, where the gases have low diffusivities and are predominantly adsorbed to the pore walls, vibrational scattering from the solid–gas interactions leads to drastically reduced thermal conductivities. At higher temperatures (above ∼200 K), however, we find that the CO 2 molecules with increased diffusivities can lead to additional channels of heat conduction for high gas densities. Our spectral analyses show that the addition of gas adsorbates has a negligible influence on the heat carrying acoustic modes of the framework at such relatively higher temperatures. Contrastingly, at lower temperatures, gas infiltration leads to considerable scattering and reduced lifetimes of the acoustic vibrational modes of the framework. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanistic processes dictating heat conduction in guest-infiltrated MOFs and offer a pathway to tailor their thermal properties for advanced applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and thermoelectrics.},

A factor that can influence such outcomes is the so-called steric effect . The underpinning idea of this effect is that the mutual orientation of the collision partners at the moment of collision may impact the nature of the products. The steric effect has been studied in a variety of ways, notably using optical methods, as well as making use of both magnetic and electric fields, to orient or align reactants. Here, we present a general framework for interpreting and evaluating steric effects in collisions of open shell linear molecules with an atom in the presence of an electric field. While in previous studies, the theory has been limited to the specific system of interest, such as for the end-on collisions of NO(X), this new formalism provides a fundamental basis for examining any system of this type. Some examples of the utility and power of this formalism are also provided. This theory may then be built on further in the future to provide greater insights into the stereodynamics of collisions and, hence, provide the foundation for deeper study into how the steric effect may be harnessed for control.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates interaction-induced symmetry breaking in circular quantum dots. We start by explaining what is known about symmetry breaking in quantum dots, pointing out that the anisotropic “static Wigner molecule” ground states frequently observed in simulations are created by interference effects that occur even in the non-interacting limit. They have nothing in common with the interaction-driven crystallization of the uniform electron gas described by Wigner. This leads us to define the term Wigner molecule more carefully via a finite analog of the spontaneous symmetry breaking that arises in the homogeneous electron gas when the interactions are strong. According to this definition, the charge density patterns characteristic of true interaction-induced Wigner molecules can only be seen if a small symmetry-breaking perturbation is applied to a strongly interacting quantum dot. A simple argument based on separation of variables into center-of-mass and internal coordinates shows that the strength of the perturbation required to produce a finite effect on the density tends to zero in the limit as the strength of the interaction tends to infinity. We confirm computationally that interaction-induced Wigner molecules satisfying this definition exist. The neural-network variational Monte Carlo method used in our simulations proves more accurate than the coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo methods employed in previous benchmark calculations of quantum dots at small to intermediate interaction strengths. For high interaction strengths, our neural-network variational Monte Carlo energies agree very well with existing fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, proving ∼0.01% better for small values of the total spin projection S z but ∼0.01% worse for fully spin-polarized systems.},

Chem. Phys. 160 , 094114 (2024)] due to their high similarity and inheritance in theoretical frameworks and computational implementation. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that these perturbation methods significantly improved computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy to the CVS-icMRCISD method. Moreover, the core-excited states of the allyl system were used as a pilot application for three CVS-multi-reference methods. The CVS-icMRCISD method produced four excited states at 282.10, 285.11, 286.18, and 288.07 eV, accurately reproducing four distinctive peaks ( A , B , C , and D ) in the experimental x-ray absorption spectra (XAS). Theoretical excitation energies of two core-excited states of the allyl cation (282.64 and 286.88 eV) align with the peaks observed at 282.52 and 286.92 eV in the experimental XAS. However, vibrational analysis of the X–A transition suggests that the α band in the experimental XAS might arise from electronic–vibronic coupling between the antisymmetric stretching of C–H bonds in the -C T H 2 group and the core-excited state, leaving the assignment of the α band ambiguous. Overall, the CVS-icMRCISD method achieved excellent agreement with experimental results, with an average deviation of 0.25 eV. While the errors of CVS-SDSPT2 and CVS-MS-NEVPT2 methods were slightly larger, both methods maintained acceptable accuracy, making them suitable for medium-sized molecules by significantly reducing computational costs.},

In the presence of optimal pulse, methyl photodissociation predominantly occurs via two successive conical intersections. For further justification of the findings of OCT calculations, the field-free quantum dynamics calculations, where the initial wave packet is vertically excited to the ππ * state, are also examined under different initial conditions. A comparative study of these two types of calculations reveals that in the field-free case, photodissociation occurs via the adiabatic path, whereas it follows the nonadiabatic path in the presence of optimal pulse. Therefore, the branching ratio also changes accordingly with the initial conditions for these two types of dynamical events.},

  abstract     = {The binding motifs of clusters of Al + and Al 2 + with ethane, Al x + (C 2 H 6 ) n ( x = 1, 2; n = 1–3), are determined using vibrational photodissociation spectroscopy in the C–H stretching region (2550–3100 cm −1 ) in conjunction with spectra calculated using density functional theory. The relative energies of candidate structures are determined with the B3LYP-D3 and ωB97X-D density functionals and the 6–311++G(d,p) basis set. Local mode Hamiltonian calculations are better able to reproduce the spectra than scaled harmonic calculations, due to contributions from bending overtones and combination bands. Vibrational photodissociation spectra show a red shift in the stretching frequencies of C–H bonds that are proximate to the cation. This red shift decreases as the number of ethanes increases. For Al + (C 2 H 6 ) n ( n = 1–3), side-on (T-shaped) binding of the metal is preferred to end-on binding, and subsequent ligands bind on the same side of the cation. Similarly, for Al 2 + (C 2 H 6 ) n ( n = 1–3), T-shaped configurations in which the C–C and Al–Al bonds are approximately perpendicular and the ethane binds side-on to the Al 2 + are preferred. In Al 2 + (C 2 H 6 ) n ( n = 1–3) complexes, intense bands are observed, which are due to overtones and combinations of symmetric deformations in Fermi resonance with the red-shifted C–H stretches.},

If the atmosphere also contains carbon monoxide (such as Earth and Mars), several collisional processes with nitrogen-, carbon-, and oxygen-bearing species are relevant. Here, we employ a set of three accurate and global potential energy surfaces for the CNO system to study the N( 2 D) + CO → N( 4 S) + CO electronic quenching process, using the quasiclassical trajectories approach coupled with two different surface hopping schemes. Experimental measurements of the quenching rate coefficient are available only at room temperature, and our computational predictions show good agreement. We further provide the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients for the first time, extending to the hyperthermal regime. The effect of the initial rovibrational state of CO on the reactivity, as well as the distribution of energy in the products, is also unveiled.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the nature of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) can guide the design of molecular wires. The ability to steer these processes through a mechanistic understanding of IVR is assessed by utilizing two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. 2D IR spectroscopy allows for the direct investigation of timescales of energy transfer within three aromatic molecular scaffolds: 4′-azido-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (PAB), 2′-azido-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (OAB), and 4′-(azidomethyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (PAMB). Energy transfer pathways between azido (N 3 )- and cyano (CN)-vibrational reporters uncover the importance of Fermi resonances, anharmonic coupling, and specific structural components in directing energy flow. Among these systems, PAB exhibits the fastest energy transfer (22 ps), facilitated by its co-planar biphenyl structure, enabling strong π–π stacking interactions to optimize vibrational coupling. In contrast, OAB demonstrates a moderate IVR timescale (38 ps) due to an orthogonal molecular plane and steric hindrance, which disrupts coupling pathways. PAMB, with a para -methylene group, introduces a structural bottleneck that significantly impedes energy flow, slowing down the energy transfer to 84 ps. The observed IVR rates align with computational predictions, highlighting intermediate ring modes in PAB as efficient energy transfer bridges, a mechanism that is less pronounced in OAB and PAMB. This study demonstrates that IVR is dictated not only by anharmonic coupling strengths but also by the extended alignment of vibrational modes across molecular planes and their delocalization within aromatic scaffolds. By modulating structural features, such as steric constraints and π–π interactions, we provide a framework for tailoring energy flow in conjugated molecular systems. These findings offer new insights into IVR dynamics for applications in molecular electronics.},

Using efficient low-rank tensor train representations, we aim at reducing memory consumption and computational costs. As an example, coupled excitons and phonons modeled in terms of Fröhlich–Holstein type Hamiltonians are studied here. By comparing our tensor-train-based results with semi-analytical results, we demonstrate the key role of the ranks of the quantum state vectors. Typically, an excellent quality of solutions is found only when the maximum number of ranks exceeds a certain value. One class of propagation schemes builds on splitting the Hamiltonian into two groups of interleaved nearest-neighbor interactions commutating within each of the groups. In particular, the fourth-order Yoshida–Neri and the eighth-order Kahan–Li symplectic composition yield results close to machine precision. Similar results are found for fourth and eighth order global Krylov scheme. However, the computational effort currently restricts the use of these four propagators to rather short chains, which also applies to propagators based on the time-dependent variational principle, typically used for matrix product states. Yet, another class of propagators involves explicit, time-symmetrized Euler integrators. Especially, the fourth-order variant is recommended for quantum simulations of longer chains, even though the high precision of the splitting schemes cannot be reached. Moreover, the scaling of the computational effort with the dimensions of the local Hilbert spaces is much more favorable for the differencing than for splitting or variational schemes.},

The use of curvilinear coordinates enables the reduction of couplings between different degrees of freedom, enriching the arsenal of existing vibrational approaches, and can lead to effective, low-dimensional linear-scaling models. The accuracy of the results obtained for some prototypical systems paves the way toward the systematic use of this new implementation in the study of molecules containing a few dozen atoms, as exemplified by the test cases of a molecular motor, a nucleoside, and two hormones.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating, and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes, or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. However, in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which can then be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system’s transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.},

  abstract     = {The accurate computation of excited states remains a challenge in electronic structure theory, especially for systems with a ground state that requires a multireference treatment. In this work, we introduce a novel equation-of-motion (EOM) extension of the internally contracted multireference unitary coupled-cluster framework (ic-MRUCC), termed EOM-ic-MRUCC. EOM-ic-MRUCC follows the transform-then-diagonalize approach, in analogy to its non-unitary counterpart [Datta and Nooijen, J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 204107 (2012)]. By employing a projective approach to optimize the ground state, the method retains additive separability and proper scaling with system size. We show that excitation energies are size-intensive if the EOM operator satisfies the “killer” and the projective conditions. Furthermore, we propose to represent changes in the reference state upon electron excitation via projected many-body operators that span the active orbitals and show that the EOM equations formulated in this way are invariant with respect to active orbital rotations. We test the EOM-ic-MRUCC method truncated to single and double excitations by computing the potential energy curves for several excited states of a BeH 2 model system, the HF molecule, and water undergoing symmetric dissociation. Across these systems, our method delivers accurate excitation energies and potential energy curves within 5 m E h (∼0.14 eV) from full configuration interaction. We find that truncating the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff series to fourfold commutators contributes negligible errors (on the order of 10 −5 E h or less), offering a practical route to highly accurate excited-state calculations with reduced computational overhead.},

Previous structural studies on the CD81 large-extracellular-loop domain (CD81 LEL ) proposed that its conformation (ranging from closed to open) may depend on environmental pH conditions. However, the precise mechanism governing CD81 LEL plasticity has remained unconfirmed until now. Here, by combining molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopic experiments on CD81 LEL , we show that the mechanism underlying the dependence of the changes in pH to the opening of CD81 LEL relates to the modulation of the solvation shell by “antenna” residues. The antenna residues are D139 and E188. Under acidic conditions, such residues generate a signal cascade propagating through the CD81 LEL molecule changing the local solvation that, in turn, acts as an effector of the closed-to-open conformational transition. We further proved the key role of D139 and E188 by introducing mutations that switch off their sensitivity to pH. As expected, the mutations stabilize the closed conformation. This signal transduction mechanism might play a role in other cellular receptors that function along the endosomal pathway.},

Here, it is responsible for screening the Lorentz forces acting on moving nuclear charges. This connection has recently been exploited to derive a new type of population analysis known as Berry charges. In this work, we derive a novel sum rule for the molecular Berry curvature. This pseudomomentum-translational sum rule is then used to reveal the connection between Berry charges and the well-known generalized atomic polar tensor (GAPT) charges. Furthermore, we present an efficient integral-direct implementation of the molecular Berry curvature for molecules in finite magnetic fields into the Turbomole program suite. This is used to further demonstrate the connection between Berry and GAPT charges for a variety of larger molecules, comparing the results to other established types of partial charges.},

Applying this approach to the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer reaction of 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline, we successfully reproduced the experimentally observed NWPs in the reaction product, which were measured by time-resolved fluorescence of the product state with high fidelity. This significant achievement enables the analysis of individual normal mode motions following photoexcitation in chemical and physical processes.

  abstract     = {It is essential that mesoscopic simulations of reactive systems reproduce the correct statistical distributions at thermodynamic equilibrium. By considering a compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) simulation method of ideal gas mixtures undergoing reversible reactions described by the chemical Langevin equations, we show that thermodynamic consistency in reaction rates and the use of instantaneous temperatures for the evaluation of reaction rates is required for fluctuations for the overall system to be correct. We then formulate the required properties of a thermodynamically consistent reaction (TCR) model. As noted in the literature, while reactions are often discussed in terms of forward and reverse rates, these rates should not be modeled independently because they must be compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium for the system. Using a simple TCR model where each chemical species has constant heat capacity, we derive the explicit condition that the forward and reverse reaction rate constants must satisfy in order for the system to be thermodynamically consistent. We perform equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of ideal gas mixtures undergoing a reversible dimerization reaction to measure the fluctuational behavior of the system numerically. We confirm that FHD simulations with the TCR model give the correct static structure factor of equilibrium fluctuations.

  abstract     = {Electronic absorption spectra serve as versatile and powerful tools in experiments. Accurate theoretical simulation of electronic absorption spectra is challenging because multiple factors such as environmental effects and nuclear quantum effects contribute to spectrum lineshapes. This work proposes a protocol to model electronic absorption spectra in the constrained nuclear–electronic orbital framework. Solvent effects, temperature effects, and particularly nuclear quantum effects can be taken into consideration in this unified framework. This protocol is applied to investigate the electronic absorption spectrum of the pyridine molecule in water. Nuclear quantum effects are found to induce a broadening and red shift of the absorption spectrum of pyridine.},

  abstract     = {Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as “cells” that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the basic RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the likelihood ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences, each motivated by methods from previous work related to stochastic reaction networks. We provide several numerical examples comparing the various methods in the new setting. We find that the relative performance of each method is in line with its analog in the “standard” stochastic reaction network setting. We have made all the MATLAB codes used to implement the various methods freely available for download.},

Combining the octet rule, we introduce a statistical model to determine the physical properties by lifting the energy degeneracy in carbon nanostructures. This model offers a direct path to accurately ascertain electron density distributions in quantum systems, akin to how charge density is used in density functional theory to deduce system properties. Our methodology diverges from traditional quantum mechanics, focusing instead on this unique statistical model by maximizing bonding entropy to determine the fundamental properties of materials. Applied to carbon nanoclusters and graphynes, our model not only precisely predicts bonding energies and electron density without relying on external parameters but also enhances the prediction of electronic structures through bond occupancy numbers, which act as effective hopping integrals. This innovation offers insights into the structural properties and quantum behavior of electrons across various dimensions.},

This code explicitly accounts for both collisions and Coulombic interactions when simulating the spatial distributions of low-energy electrons generated via liquid water ionization in two-photon laser excitation experiments. The consideration of the Coulombic field of the parent cation is a critical factor in these calculations. To verify the versatility of dmcc_phys, it is applied to replicate data obtained from contrastive experiments involving the ejection of low-energy electrons through photoinjection into electrodes in water, devoid of parent cations owing to electronic polarization. The calculations successfully reproduce both scenarios, demonstrating that our code, which integrates Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods, provides an advantage in simulating electron delocalization and relocalization into the parent cation compared with conventional Monte Carlo track-structure simulations, such as the particle and heavy ion transport code system and Geant4-DNA. Furthermore, we analyze the simulation results by fitting them against a combination of Gaussian and exponential distributions. Our findings indicate that electrons ejected by radiation depositing an energy of 11.9 eV distribute more extensively, resulting in a spur radius of 4 nm—larger than the 3 nm radius predicted using conventional methods. These capabilities enable precise estimation of the initial spur radius, a crucial parameter for predicting the time-dependent yields of hydrated electrons during the chemical stage.},

  abstract     = {The aqueous solvent profoundly influences protein folding, yet its effects are relatively poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the impact of solvation on the folding of lattice proteins by using Monte Carlo simulations. The proteins are modeled as self-avoiding 27-mer chains on a cubic lattice, with compact native states and structure-based Gō potentials. Each residue that makes no contact with other residues in a given protein conformation is assigned a solvation energy ɛ s , representing its full exposure to the solvent. We find that a negative ɛ s , indicating a favorable solvation, increases the cooperativity of the folding transition by lowering the free energy of the unfolded state, increasing the folding free energy barrier, and narrowing the folding routes. This favorable solvation also significantly improves the correlation between folding rates and the native topology, measured by the relative contact order. Our results suggest that the Gō model may overestimate the importance of native interactions, and a solvation potential countering the native bias can play a significant role. The solvation energy in our model can be related to the polar interaction between water and peptide groups in the protein backbone. It is, therefore, suggested that the solvation of peptide groups may significantly contribute to the exceptional folding cooperativity and the pronounced topology-dependence of folding rates observed in two-state proteins.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few decades, extensive investigations on spatial and dynamic heterogeneity have been performed on carefully reconstituted biological lipid membranes. Characterizing the molecular features in heterogeneous membranes is extremely challenging due to the experimentally inaccessible time- and length-scales of these emergent systems. In this context, simulations can provide important insights into molecular-level interactions leading to membrane heterogeneity and associated functions. To that end, we use the non-affine displacement (NAD) framework (a concept borrowed from the physics of granular materials) to faithfully capture molecular-scale local membrane order in simulated heterogeneous bilayers. In our latest application of NAD, we investigate the temperature-dependent spatial and temporal organization on microsecond trajectories of liquid-ordered bilayer systems at all-atom resolution (DPPC/DOPC/CHOL: 0.55:0.15:0.30; 40 × 40 nm 2 with a total of 5600 lipids and 2 × 10 6 atoms). Lateral organization in these large bilayer patches shows noticeable dynamic heterogeneity despite their liquid-ordered nature. Moreover, our NAD analyses reveal soft fluid channels within the tightly packed membrane reminiscent of the classical two-component Kob–Andersen glass-forming binary mixture. Hence, we characterized these systems using classical glass physics markers for dynamic heterogeneities such as overlap, four-point susceptibility, Van Hove, and intermediate scattering functions to quantify the multiple time scales underlying the lipid dynamics. Our analyses reveal that highly ordered membrane systems can have glass-like dynamics with distinct soft fluid channels inside them. Biologically, these dynamic channels could act as conduits for facilitating molecular encounters for biological functions even in highly ordered phases such as lipid nanodomains and rafts.},

We investigate intraprotein energy relaxation and quantum coherence of constituent chromoproteins of allophycocyanin (APC) and two kinds of C-phycocyanin (CPC) in phycobilisomes using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. These chromoproteins produced by an Escherichia coli expression system have similar adjacent pairs of pigments α84 and β84, which are excited to delocalized exciton states. However, the kinetics and coherence of exciton states are significantly different from each other. Even CPCs with almost the same molecular structure display different 2D spectra when the locations in the phycobilisome are different. The spectra of the inner CPC in the phycobilisome are red-shifted relative to that of the outer one. This may promote the efficient and unidirectional energy transfer to the APC core. We observe low-frequency coherent vibrational motion of ∼200 cm −1 with large amplitude and a decay time of 200 fs. The wave packet motion involving energy relaxation and oscillatory motions on the potential energy surface of the exciton state is clearly visualized using beat-frequency-resolved 2D-ES.},

Here, our extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that the twist–stretch coupling of dsRNAs can be reversed from positive to negative by their binding proteins. Our analyses revealed that such a reversing effect of binding proteins is attributed to the protein anchoring across the major groove of dsRNAs, which alters the dominating deformation pathway from a major-groove-mediated one to a helical-radius-mediated one through two base-pair parameters of slide and inclination. Meanwhile, the anchoring effect from binding proteins on dsRNAs is further ascribed to the strong electrostatic attractions between dsRNAs and the positively charged binding domain of the proteins.},

The microagent’s motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the advantage actor-critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.},

We show that both the fluctuating force in the stationary case and the non-equilibrium response force in the driven cases exhibit spatial structure in their first and second moments. The latter depends sensitively on the employed driving protocols. For sodium chloride, we find that the first moment of the non-equilibrium response force matches the mean force for slow constrained pulling. In contrast, for all tested restrained pulling protocols, significant differences arise between the two properties in both systems.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the squeeze flow of an electrorheological (ER) fluid has been studied under a constant electric field and squeezing speed to understand the link between the extent of structural arrest and the wall slip. The flow behavior during squeezing has been captured in terms of normal force as a function of gap under a parametric variation of electric field intensity for four different compression speeds to understand the impact of both these parameters on wall slip in terms of wall friction coefficient. Based on the growth rate of normal force with respect to inter-plate gap, these squeeze flow curves have been divided into four zones: elastic response, relaxation zone, slip flow, and squeeze-strengthening regime. The first two zones are very short-termed, whereas the major portion of the flow regime is slip flow. The squeeze strengthening effect is only pronounced at very low compression speeds for moderate/higher electric field strengths in the low gap regime. The slip flow regime has been modeled using a squeeze flow model, which renders the wall friction coefficient as a model parameter. The major finding of our analysis is that the friction coefficient is an increasing function of electric field strength at a fixed compression speed, whereas an increase in compression speed leads to a decrease in the extent of wall friction. Based on these observations, it has been established that electric field-induced structural jamming and compression-led breakage of structure in the ER fluids play a crucial role in controlling the wall friction during its squeeze flow. We have also modeled the slow squeezing-led structural strengthening regime by considering a particle-scale model, which accounts for the local electric field contribution. Finally, a broader physical picture has been provided to underline how the degree of the structural arrest/jamming affects wall friction during the squeeze flow of such field-responsive soft materials.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the adsorption behavior of two amino acids (glycine - gly and glutamic acid - glu) as coating molecules for Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles to improve their biocompatibility for medical applications. Amino acid adsorption on the dry and hydrated reconstructed Fe 3 O 4 (001) surface was investigated by means of quantum mechanical methods. According to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations (HSE06), the deprotonated form is favored over the zwitterion for both amino acids on the dry surface (by −0.14 and −0.59 eV for gly and glu, respectively), whereas the order is reversed under hydrated conditions (by +0.07 and +0.35 eV, for gly and glu, respectively). Given the small energy difference in the case of gly, deprotonated and zwitterionic adsorption modes are expected to compete and, probably, to coexist on the magnetite surface both under dry and hydrated conditions. Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) method can only provide a qualitative energy order for amino acids adsorption on the dry magnetite surface due to excessive stabilization of the deprotonated adsorbed form (−0.54 and −1.24 eV for gly and glu, respectively). This overestimation favors the deprotonated form even under hydrated conditions (by −0.41 and −0.18 eV for gly and glu, respectively), which contradicts the more accurate DFT results. The approximate DFTB method presents limitations in correctly capturing the relative stability of different protonation states.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and controlling the direction of singlet exciton diffusion in conjugated polymer films is crucial for organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic photovoltaics. We previously demonstrated that singlet excitons generated in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) predominantly diffuse along the π-stacking direction due to a relatively strong H-aggregate character. In contrast, we also found that thin films of a novel naphthobisoxadiazole-based low-bandgap polymer, PNOz4T, exhibit two-dimensional (2D) exciton diffusion characteristics along both the π-stacking (interchain) and main chain (intrachain) directions. Detailed analysis revealed that 2D exciton diffusion is due to a relatively strong J-aggregate character of PNOz4T. However, it remains unclear whether this behavior is unique to PNOz4T or can be reproduced in other conjugated polymers when J-aggregate character is enhanced. Herein, we investigate how the direction of singlet exciton diffusion is controlled in PDCBT, a polythiophene with greater J-aggregate character compared to P3HT. We demonstrate that the preferential direction of the singlet exciton diffusion shifts from the π-stacking direction to the main chain direction with increasing J-aggregate character. We observe 2D exciton diffusion when these two diffusional components are balanced. This study highlights the importance of side-chain engineering to control the direction of singlet exciton diffusion and provides new insight into understanding the mechanism of exciton diffusion in conjugated polymer films.},

  abstract     = {Anion adsorption is an important phenomenon in surface science, electrochemistry, and catalysis, where it can dictate (electro)catalyst performance and corrosion resistance. In recent work, we found that the adsorption energies of carboxylate anions to a metal electrode were linearly correlated with their acid dissociation constant (pKa) and electron affinity. To determine if these linear trends are general across anions, we have now used density functional theory to compare the thermodynamics of adsorption across a series of thiolates, carboxylates, alkoxides, and small molecular anions (OH*, SH*, SCF 3 *, and SCH 3 *) to a Pt(111) surface. We find that electron affinity is a general predictive descriptor of anion adsorption energy and, in fact, dominates over differences in the radical adsorption energy, representing the covalent contribution to adsorption, even across structurally different anions. In examining descriptors for radical adsorption, we find that the X–H bond dissociation energy (where X is the atom the radical uses to bind to the surface), used as a descriptor in prior work, only strongly correlates with radical adsorption energy for some species. This work highlights the importance of electron affinity in controlling adsorption and that the correlation between radical adsorption energy and (X–H) bond dissociation energy may not be as transferrable of a relationship as previously thought. Both these factors impact how we understand the physics and chemistry of adsorption, as well as the development of predictive descriptors of adsorption strength. A simple model using radical electron affinity and X–H bond dissociation energy to predict anion adsorption energetics is demonstrated.},

Two peaks in the C dl profile have been commonly attributed to the crowding of counterions within the EDL. More recent studies have suggested that the two peaks are primarily caused by orientational polarization of interfacial water molecules. Herein, this recent perspective is extended by considering orientation-dependent adsorption free energy of water and tested at Au(111)–aqueous solution interfaces. Our comparative analysis of the ion dependency of the C dl profile corroborates the view that the capacitance peaks are caused mainly by the saturation of the orientational polarization of interfacial water molecules. In addition, the temperature dependency of the C dl profile is consistently interpreted as a consequence of the temperature effects on the orientational polarization of interfacial water.},

This ionic liquid is known to undergo a low-temperature, liquid–liquid crystal (L–LC) phase transition previously associated with a transition or growth in the extent of mesoscale solvophobic aggregates. We find that the L–LC transition is accompanied by a significant change in both the timescale and the strength of dielectric and mechanical relaxation processes associated with the motions of the mesoscale solvophobic aggregates. However, no change is observed in faster, more-localized ion motions associated with ion diffusion. Due exclusively to the changes in the slow, supramolecular dynamics, the zero-shear viscosity of the ionic liquid is increased fivefold, while the ionic conductivity is unaffected. These results provide unique insight into the role of mesoscale solvophobic structure on the transport properties of ionic liquids, indicating that the supramolecular mesoscale solvophobic aggregates may, at times, have a sizable influence on the zero-shear viscosities while having a negligible influence on ion conduction, which is determined exclusively by the faster diffusive ion motions occurring at shorter length-scales.},

  abstract     = {The isobaric heat capacity ( C p ) is frequently used as a benchmark property whenever a new model is proposed or when comparing different force fields with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, classical MD is not able to capture the quantum effects inherent in fluids and researchers have opted to apply quantum corrections in the post-processing when evaluating this property. Nevertheless, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the magnitude of quantum corrections for water, with reported values differing by up to a factor of 4. This term can account for up to one third of the C p value and its erroneous prediction can lead to misleading conclusions. Therefore, we investigate different approaches to properly address quantum corrections when predicting C p using classical MD. To accomplish this, the quantum correction methods proposed by Horn et al. and Berens et al. are considered, both of which use the single quantum harmonic oscillator approach but employ different strategies to address the frequency space. Two flexible polarizable water models are used in the evaluation, iAMOEBA and AMOEBA14. We show that the method of Berens et al. is a more robust approach to obtain the quantum corrections, as it accounts for all the frequency space by employing the vibrational spectra of the corresponding model under evaluation, making this approach a fully model-based method to determine C p from MD. In addition, its capability of capturing the shift of low-frequency modes with temperature results in improved performance over the method of Horn et al .},

Toward this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients—self-diffusion coefficient D and viscosity η , (ii) relaxation time τ α , and (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times τ α ( q ) over a broad range of temperature T , pressure P , and density ρ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak breakdown in the SE relation involving D and η , and the loci of the breakdown of the SE relation (SEB) are found in the high T liquid phase. The τ α , when used as a proxy to η , shows a distinct breakdown in the SE relation, whose loci are found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram show that the loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behavior. Computation of τ α ( q ) enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behavior using which we show that the breakdown of the SE relation occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Furthermore, we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behavior, including the loci of compressibility maximum, density maximum, and diffusivity maximum.},

  abstract     = {In spite of the tremendous increase in computational power over the last few decades, the problem of simulating atomistic systems containing large amounts of water molecules over longer lengths and time scales still remains. In this respect, the coarse-grained (CG) force field reduces the computational cost and, therefore, allows simulations of larger systems for longer times. However, the specific scope of the different CG water models is more limited compared to their atomistic counterparts. In this context, we conducted a comparative study on the molecular physical structure, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties of bulk water systems using six distinct CG water models and all-atom (AA) simulations. The six CG simulation procedures involved modeling with three variants of the water model coming from the MARTINI force field, one from the SPICA force field, and the two Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) derived potentials from the AA simulations. The AA simulations have been performed using the SPC/E and TIP4P force fields. The IBI models, namely SPC/E-IBI and TIP4P-IBI, depict the structural features in close agreement with the atomistic samples. The explicit number of water molecules in the first coordination shell for the three MARTINI models and the SPICA force field is in excellent agreement with the SPC/E and TIP4P values. The ensuing simulated densities for the various water models align significantly with the literature data, indicating the reliability of our approach. The SPC/E and SPICA models stand out in predicting the enthalpy of vaporization among the all-atom and CG force fields, respectively. The two all-atom models and their IBI equivalents are better at representing the isobaric specific heat capacity compared to the other models. The isothermal compressibility is reproduced comprehensively by the SPC/E force field followed by TIP4P, while SPICA is the better choice within the CG models. With respect to the dynamics of the system, the diffusion coefficient of the SPICA force field is in perfect agreement with the experimental data, even better than the atomistic samples. The overall scores of the different models, indicative of their relative performances compared to the other models, have also been computed.},

  abstract     = {The nitrate anion ( ⁠ NO 3 − ⁠ ) is abundant in environmental aqueous phases, including aerosols, surface waters, and snow, where its photolysis releases nitrogen oxides back into the atmosphere. Nitrate photolysis occurs via two channels: (1) the formation of NO 2 and O − and (2) the formation of NO 2 − and O( 3 P). The occurrence of two reaction channels with very low quantum yield ( ∼ 1 % ) highlights the critical role of the solvation environment and spin-forbidden electronic transitions, which remain unexplained at the molecular level. We investigate the two photolysis channels in water using quantum chemical calculations and first-principles molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid density functional theory and enhanced sampling. We find that spin-forbidden absorption to the triplet state (T 1 ) is possible but occurs at a rate ∼15 times weaker than the spin-allowed transition to the singlet state (S 1 ). A metastable solvation cage complex requires additional thermal energy to dissociate the N–O bond, allowing for recombination or non-radiative deactivation. Our results explain the temperature dependence of photolysis, linked to hydrogen bond rearrangement in the solvation shell.

  abstract     = {The Ziegler–Rauk–Baerends multiplet sum method (MSM) assumes that density functional theory (DFT) provides a good description of states dominated by a single determinant. It then uses symmetry to add static correlation to DFT. In our previous article (Article I ) [ J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 244306 (2023)], we introduced diagrammatic MSM-DFT as a tool to aid in extending MSM-DFT to include the nondynamic correlation needed for making and breaking bonds even in the absence of symmetry . An attractive feature of this approach is that no functional-dependent parameters need to be introduced, although choices are needed in making correspondences between wave function theory and MSM-DFT diagrams. The preliminary examples in Article I used the two-orbital two-electron model (TOTEM) less completely than could have been the case as we wanted to limit calculations to diagonalizing 2 × 2 matrices, which can be done by solving a simple quadratic equation. Diagrammatic MSM-DFT is extended here to treat the full TOTEM, and it is shown that the unsymmetric lithium hydride molecule dissociates into neutral atoms when diagrammatic MSM-DFT techniques are used to introduce a proper description of the avoided crossing between ionic bonding and covalent bonding states. This involves diagonalizing a 3 × 3 matrix, which requires going beyond solving a quadratic equation but is still trivial these days. The method is tested for Hartree–Fock and for three functionals (LDA, PW91, and B3LYP). All the functionals yield similar results as should be expected for a properly formulated parameter-free theory. Agreement with available estimates show that the magnitude of the coupling element introduced here is excellent. However, more work will be needed to obtain quantitative agreement between our diagrammatic MSM-DFT ground-state potential energy curve and that found from high-quality ab initio calculations.},

The potential is based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) formulation and has been parameterized to facilitate high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations of ammonia under extreme conditions, for pressures up to 100 GPa and for temperatures above 500 K and up to 6000 K. A diverse range of configurations was generated through high-quality ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, covering insulating and superionic ice phases, liquid ammonia, molecular nitrogen (N 2 ) and hydrogen (H 2 ), and metastable compounds that form upon dissociation, including NH 4 + ⁠ , H 3 + ⁠ , N 2 H 4 , and N 3 H. We demonstrate that the ammonia ACE potential accurately reproduces experimental and density functional theory predicted isotherms and Hugoniots. Crucially, the potential is able to capture the intricate phase behavior of ammonia, including the transition from insulating molecular fluid to the superionic phase. This work provides a robust interatomic potential that can be used for large-scale, accurate simulations of ammonia under extreme thermodynamic conditions, offering a powerful tool for investigating its behavior in various phases and applications.},

  abstract     = {The vibronic structure and nuclear dynamics underlying the first absorption bands of meta -nitrophenolate ( m -NP) and para -nitrophenolate ( p -NP) in the coupled manifold of S 1 – S 2 – S 3 – S 4 – S 5 electronic states are investigated here. Attempts are specifically made to understand the broadening of the experimentally recorded gas phase electronic absorption spectra of both the molecules. Justification is also provided for the shorter lifetime of the S 1 state of p -NP as compared to m -NP. First principles nuclear dynamics calculations are performed by both time-independent and time-dependent quantum mechanical methods. The model vibronic coupling Hamiltonians developed via extensive ab initio quantum chemical calculations in Paper I [Mondal et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 144314 (2025)] are employed for this purpose. The theoretical results presented in this paper are in good agreement with the available experimental data. While the resolved vibrational peaks are observed in the first absorption band of m -NP, the same for p -NP is highly broad and structureless. Occurrence of S 1 – S 3 low-energy conical intersections relative to S 1 equilibrium minimum energy in p -NP leads to a nonradiative internal conversion of the S 1 state in ∼1.9 ps, whereas the high energy conical intersections of S 1 state with other states in m -NP trapped the wave packet prepared on it and led to a much longer decay rate of ∼30.8 ps of the S 1 state of m -NP.},

  abstract     = {The structure of the first five singlet excited electronic states of meta -nitrophenolate ( m -NP) and para -nitrophenolate ( p -NP) is investigated here in the gas phase, micro-solvent, and bulk solvent environments. The first excited state ( S 1 ) of m -NP was found to be a charge transfer state in the gas phase, whereas that of p -NP is a ππ * state. A stronger coupling between the donor and acceptor molecular orbitals in p -NP leads to a higher excitation energy of the S 1 state as compared to m -NP. An examination of the topography of the potential energy surfaces reveals low energy conical intersections of the S 1 state with the S 2 and S 3 states in p -NP. Such conical intersections in m -NP are located at higher energies relative to the S 1 state minimum. Repulsion between the S 1 ( 1 A ′) and S 2 ( 1 A ″) electronic states via the out-of-plane –NO 2 torsional mode leads to a symmetrical double well topography of the S 1 state of m -NP. Present results establish that while a single solvent molecule like water, methanol, and acetonitrile leads to a blue shift in the first absorption band maxima of m -NP, the electronic localization on the donor molecular orbital due to a single water molecule yields a red shift in the first absorption band of p -NP. However, the attachment of a single water molecule to the nitro site of p -NP facilitates electronic delocalization, leading to a blue shift in the S 1 state excitation energy. As a result, in an aqueous medium, the first absorption band maximum was observed very near to that found in bare p -NP.},

  abstract     = {A simple Confined Rotor Model (CRM) is used to assign the thirty-nine ro-vibrational transitions observed through the HOH bending and OH stretching ranges of the solid H 2 O@C 60 mid-infrared (MIR) spectra reported in the companion paper [Chartrand et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 144312 (2025)]. Assuming that the intramolecular vibrations of the water molecules are separable from their rotational and translational motions, the CRM Hamiltonian describes confinement of H 2 O within C 60 as an eccentric, but otherwise isotropic, 3D harmonic oscillator and as an asymmetric rigid rotor. The topology of the effective confinement potential is constrained using seven transitions observed in the HOH bending range of the MIR spectra of solid H 2 O@C 60 , yielding an effective force constant, k = (11.86 ± 0.03) J m −2 , and an eccentricity, d CI = (7.55 ± 0.07) pm, in good agreement with DF-LMP2/cc-pVDZ results. While twenty-one broad and overlapping spectral features arising from hot band transitions were described and tentatively assigned by Chartrand et al. , some of them appear very strongly perturbed compared to the gas phase. Using the CRM, it is shown that the conspicuous shifts displayed by certain very specific pairs of ro-vibrational transitions provide evidence for confinement-induced rotation–translation coupling between the orientational and positional degrees-of-freedom of endohedral water, resulting in a strong mixing between very specific pairs of ro-translational eigenstates of translational and rotational character. The CRM is shown to provide a satisfactory description of all observed ro-vibrational transitions along with a compelling interpretation for the complex confinement-induced quantum nuclear dynamics of endohedral water as revealed by the rotational and ro-vibrational spectra of solid H 2 O@C 60 .},

  abstract     = {Some spectral features observed in the rovibrational spectra of solid H 2 O@C 60 are shown to provide spectroscopic signatures of confinement-induced perturbations related to the coupling between the orientational and positional degrees-of-freedom of the water molecules. Their attribution to either para -H 2 O@C 60 or ortho -H 2 O@C 60 is established from their behavior during nuclear spin conversion. The frequency of the rovibrational transitions that emanate from their ground ro-translational (RT) states appears conspicuously redshifted from that of the corresponding transitions in the free water molecule in the gas phase. However, a few of the 21 hot band spectral features, and one ground state transition, observed in the infrared spectrum of solid H 2 O@C 60 and reported here for the first time, cannot be straightforwardly assigned based on the softening of its intramolecular HOH bending and OH stretching vibrational modes due to confinement within C 60 . The most strongly perturbed transitions provide insights into the complex confinement-induced quantum nuclear dynamics arising from rotation–translation coupling, allowing the topology of the confinement potential to be revealed using a simple confined rotor model [Putaud et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 144313 (2025)]. While the line profiles exhibited by most of the transitions are consistent with symmetry-breaking interactions arising from merohedral disorder in solid H 2 O@C 60 , evidence for additional perturbations of the 1 01 00 RT state, in the ground and vibrationally excited manifolds, is reported. Moreover, the line profiles displayed by the transitions emanating from the ground RT state of para -H 2 O@C 60 and the observation of nominally forbidden Q-branch transitions, in the intramolecular HOH bending and symmetric OH stretching ranges of solid H 2 O@C 60 samples with a fill ratio of 75%, are shown to provide a spectroscopic signature of intermolecular dipolar interactions between nearest-neighbor H 2 O@C 60 molecules.},

The Schrodinger equation is solved variationally using a product contracted (PC) basis. The contracted basis functions are computed with the symmetry-adapted Lanczos method, and full-dimensional states are obtained from the PC basis by direct diagonalization. We compare the results with those of a previous calculation in which the monomers were constrained to be rigid. Allowing the monomers to be flexible has a significant effect on the low-lying inter-molecular vibrational levels due to coupling with intra-molecular coordinates. The R (1) transition frequencies, computed with flexible monomers, in different inter-molecular vibrational states, agree better with experiment than their rigid monomer counterparts. We calculate, for the first time, monomer excited states, vibrational shifts, and tunneling splittings. Although H 2 O–HCl and H 2 O–HF are similar, the number of contracted basis functions required for accurate predictions of intra- and inter-molecular levels is much larger for the H 2 O–HF dimer. This is the consequence of strong hydrogen bonding and important resonances between vibrational modes.},

Advances in this area, as shown in condensed matter physics, could lead to new insights into molecular physics and offer novel ways to control molecules, driving technological innovations. In this work, we numerically investigate the properties of imidazole and pyrrole under the influence of highly inhomogeneous static and dynamic electric fields, modeled by a new procedure employing charge configurations, using density functional theory calculations with the DALTON software package. We analyze their dipole moments, highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap energies, polarizability, and first and second hyperpolarizabilities across different field orientations. Our results show that inhomogeneous fields acting upon the molecule would induce changes in nonlinear optical properties, with the response depending on the nature of the inhomogeneity. These findings are relevant for fundamental research and practical applications. Tailored electric non-uniform fields can help unveil complex relationships among molecular orbitals that induce specific nonlinear optical phenomena. Moreover, they can enhance or suppress nonlinear responses, opening up new avenues for molecular engineering and device design.},

By varying the relative phase of the two-color laser fields, we achieve directional control over the dissociative triple and quadruple ionization of argon trimers, facilitated by the mechanism of enhanced ionization. The measured relative phase-dependent asymmetry patterns exhibit similarity in both linearly and elliptically polarized two-color laser fields, suggesting a minimal role of electron recollision. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the dissociative quadruple ionization of argon tetramers.

In addition, this was roughly equal between 17 O and 18 O. This effect, called mass-independent fractionation (MIF), remains unexplained despite numerous theoretical and experimental studies. However, it has been shown that the origin of MIF is directly linked to strong isotopic effects found in the recombination reaction O + O 2 + M → O 3 + M, where M is a third body that absorbs excess energy. Here, we are interested in one of the elementary processes involved in this reaction, namely the rapid quasi-equilibrium process O + O 2 ⇌ O 3 * ⁠ , where O 3 * is metastable ozone. A fully quantum approach was used to calculate the quasi-equilibrium constant of this process, giving the most accurate value of this quantity to date for the 49 O 3 isotopic variant of ozone. The present work represents an important step toward a better understanding of ozone formation and may help contribute to unraveling the mystery of MIF.},

The predissocation rates of the n p Rydberg states were determined from the n -dependence of the spectral widths of the transitions to them.

The notation HX⋯HY indicates the direction of the hydrogen bond from the HY donor to the HX acceptor. All stationary points reported for these ten dimer systems are fully optimized utilizing the MP2 and CCSD(T) ab initio methods in conjunction with quadruple- ζ correlation-consistent basis sets augmented with diffuse functions, and their nature is verified by harmonic vibrational frequency computations. The electronic dissociation energies ( D e ) for all ten global minima are evaluated near the CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit via extrapolation schemes. These values are 19.11, 8.32, 7.38, and 6.22 kJ mol −1 for the homogeneous dimers of HF, HCl, HBr, and HI, respectively. For the heterogeneous pairs, the lighter hydrogen halide is consistently the donor in the global minimum configuration, with D e ranging from 12.23 kJ mol −1 for HCl⋯HF to 7.22 kJ mol −1 for HI⋯HBr near the CCSD(T) CBS limit. Interestingly, not all heterodimer donor/acceptor permutations correspond to minima. For example, the HCl⋯HBr configuration is identified as a local minimum at all levels of theory employed in this investigation, whereas the in-plane barrier for donor/acceptor exchange vanishes for HCl⋯HI and HBr⋯HI when larger quadruple- ζ basis sets are utilized. For the seven dimer systems containing Br and/or I, the structures, energetics, and vibrational frequencies computed using conventional valence-only electron correlation procedures are similar to those obtained using an expanded valence treatment that includes the (n − 1) d subvalence electrons associated with Br and I.},

  abstract     = {Molecular quantum cellular automata (QCA) devices are typically based on the square planar two-electron mixed valence (MV) molecules playing the role of QCA cells. The functional properties of such cells are determined by the Coulomb repulsion between the two excess electrons, which stabilize antipodal charge configurations that encoding binary information. The inner sphere electron transfer of the excess electrons transforming different charge configurations into each other, as well as by the vibronic coupling, which tends to localize the mobile charges. Previously, the most topical and theoretically complex case of arbitrary Coulomb repulsion has been considered by implying essential restricting assumptions on the network of the electron transfer pathways. Therefore, the electron transfer occurring along the sides of the molecular square has been taken into account. Meanwhile, the effects of diagonal transfer have been discussed only for the limiting case of strong intracell Coulomb repulsion, which is peculiar to predominantly ionic compounds that are unlikely to be relevant to the MV cells. Here, we go beyond these simplifying assumptions and consider the general situation when all electron transfer pathways are involved, providing arbitrary interrelations between the key electronic and vibronic parameters. By solving the adiabatic and quantum-mechanical three-mode vibronic problems, we reveal the influence of electron transfer network topology on key properties of QCA, such as the stabilization of different spin-states in the free and interacting cells, the extent of localization of the pair of excess electrons, the shape of the cell–cell response functions, and the heat release necessarily occurring in the course of the non-adiabatic switching cycle.},

  abstract     = {Quantum confinement significantly influences the excited states of sub-10 nm single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), crucial for advancements in transistor technology and the development of novel optoelectronic materials, such as fluorescent ultrashort nanotubes (FUNs). However, the length dependence of this effect in ultrashort SWCNTs is not yet fully understood in the context of the SWCNT exciton states. Here, we conduct excited state calculations using time-dependent density functional theory on geometry-optimized models of ultrashort SWCNTs and FUNs, which consist of ultrashort SWCNTs with sp 3 defects. Our results reveal a length-dependent scaling law of the E 11 exciton energy that can be understood through a geometric, dimensional argument, which departs from the length scaling of a 1D particle-in-a-box. We find that this scaling law applies to ultrashort (6,5) and (6,6) SWCNTs, as well as models of (6,5) FUNs. In contrast, the defect-induced E s p 3 transition, which is redshifted from the E 11 optical gap transition, shows little dependence on the nanotube length, even in the shortest possible SWCNTs. We attribute this relative lack of length dependence to orbital localization around the quantum defect that is installed near the SWCNT edge. Our results illustrate the complex interplay of defects and quantum confinement effects in ultrashort SWCNTs and provide a foundation for further explorations of these nanoscale phenomena.},

The aluminum–aluminum interactions are modeled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE suite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements to include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behavior at the phase transition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural stability up to sizes as large as 3 × 10 5 atoms. The developed Al-BFF predicts an icosahedral stability range up to 2000 atoms, ∼2 nm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25 000 atoms. Beyond this size, the expected structure favors face-centered cubic shapes. At a fixed heating/cooling rate of 100 K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis loop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with solidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes icosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a hierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but observe some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid droplet’s surface shows local structural order at all sizes.},

We show that ( i ) quantum–classical dynamics along such a Hamiltonian maintains momentum conservation and that ( ii ) diagonalizing such a Hamiltonian can recover the electronic momentum and electronic current density reasonably well. In conjunction with other reports in the literature that such a phase-space approach can also recover vibrational circular dichroism spectra, we submit that the present phase-space approach offers a testable and powerful approach to post-BO electronic structure theory. Moreover, the approach is inexpensive and can be immediately applied to simulations of chiral induced spin selectivity experiments (where the transfer of angular momentum between nuclei and electrons is considered critical).},

  abstract     = {In multi-reference (MR) methods, addressing systems with large active spaces remains a challenge in the field. In Papers I and II of this series, we demonstrated that full rank N-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory (FR-NEVPT2) is a robust MR perturbation theory capable of computing strongly correlated systems with approximate density matrices. However, the previous FR-NEVPT2 implementation requires the computation and storage of fifth-order reduced density matrices (RDMs), limiting the usage of FR-NEVPT2 for systems with large active spaces. In the present work, as Paper III of the series, we report a new FR-NEVPT2 algorithm to handle systems with large active spaces. In the new algorithm, an approximate complete active space (CAS) self-consistent field (SCF) method, iterative configuration expansion (ICE) SCF, is employed to compute the reference wave functions for FR-NEVPT2. Then, the necessary Koopmans matrices of FR-NEVPT2 involving various RDMs are constructed using the intermediates designed by Kollmar et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 234104 (2021)] to avoid storage bottlenecks. The performance of the new FR-NEVPT2 algorithm for systems with large active spaces is evaluated. Our results show that even with aggressive truncation parameters to truncate the ICE-SCF reference wave function, FR-NEVPT2 effectively recovers the missing static correlations of ICE-SCF. Several interesting systems with active spaces up to CAS(34,34) are studied using FR-NEVPT2 with ICE-SCF reference.},

Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely trusted methods for treating noncovalent interactions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than 7.5 kcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown. Moreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized complexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such disagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to previous CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods. Finally, we have pinpointed model systems: the hydrogen-bonded acetic acid dimer (ID 20) and dispersion-dominated uracil–cyclopentane dimer (ID 42), where these discrepancies are particularly prominent. These systems offer cost-effective benchmarks to guide future developments in DMC, CCSD(T), as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.},

For an efficient description of proton transfer within RT-NEO-Ehrenfest dynamics, the basis function center associated with the quantum proton can be allowed to move classically. This traveling proton basis (TPB) approach effectively captures proton quantum dynamics, although its energy conservation behavior is not yet fully satisfactory. Two recently proposed TPB approaches, in principle, conserve the extended energy, which includes both the system energy and the kinetic energy associated with the proton basis function center. Herein, a thermostatted TPB approach is proposed to improve the conservation of the system energy, excluding the kinetic energy associated with the proton basis function center. In this approach, the quantum proton dynamics are modulated by dynamically rescaling the proton momentum operator to maintain the system energy conservation. With the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer of o -hydroxybenzaldehyde as an example, this approach is shown to significantly improve the system energy conservation while preserving the accuracy of the quantum proton dynamics as achieved in the original TPB approach.},

The FODs are utilized to generate Fermi orbitals, which, in turn, are symmetrically orthogonalized to give the Fermi–Löwdin orbitals employed in FLOSIC calculations. It has been argued, based on empirical evidence, that FODs carry chemical bonding information and that FOD arrangements are reminiscent of electron distributions predicted by Lewis or Linnett theory. Here, we show that there is a formal connection between FODs and critical points of the electron localization function (ELF) and illustrate this fact for several cases where fully relaxed FODs from FLOSIC calculations closely resemble the structure of critical points (CPs). We also propose a new localization function, the SIC-ELF, based on the local mobility of the Fermi orbitals. In certain instances involving double and triple bonds, FLOSIC FODs offer a more precise interpretation of the chemical bonding structure suggested by Lewis theory than ELF or SIC-ELF. We suggest that the connection between FODs and CPs can be exploited to obtain initial FOD configurations for FLOSIC calculations.},

Lett. 14 , 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn–Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. In particular, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting v -representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals—each state possessing a distinct correlation functional—we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a machine learning (ML)-augmented framework for accurately predicting excited-state properties critical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. By integrating the computational efficiency of semi-empirical PPP+CIS theory with a Δ-ML approach, the model overcomes the inherent limitations of PPP+CIS in predicting key properties, including singlet (S 1 ) and triplet (T 1 ) energies, singlet–triplet gaps (Δ E ST ), and oscillator strength ( f ). The model demonstrated exceptional accuracy across datasets of varying sizes and diverse molecular features, notably excelling in predicting oscillator strength and Δ E ST values, including negative regions relevant to TADF molecules with inverted S 1 –T 1 gaps. This work highlights the synergy between physics-inspired models and machine learning in accelerating the design of efficient TADF emitters, providing a foundation for future studies on complex systems and advanced functional materials.},

  abstract     = {We present a fast, asymptotically linear-scaling implementation of the perturbative quadruples energy correction in coupled-cluster theory using local natural orbitals. Our work follows the domain-based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) approach previously applied to lower levels of excitations in coupled-cluster theory. Our DLPNO-CCSDT(Q) algorithm uses converged doubles and triples amplitudes from a preceding DLPNO-CCSDT computation to compute the quadruples amplitude and energy in the quadruples natural orbital (QNO) basis. We demonstrate the compactness of the QNO space, showing that more than 95% of the (Q) correction can be recovered using relatively loose natural orbital cutoffs, compared to the tighter cutoffs used in pair and triples natural orbitals at lower levels of coupled-cluster theory. We also highlight the accuracy of our algorithm in the computation of relative energies, which yields deviations of sub-kJ mol −1 in relative energy compared to the canonical CCSDT(Q). Timings are conducted on a series of growing linear alkanes (up to 10 carbons and 608 basis functions) and water clusters (up to 49 water molecules and 2842 basis functions) to establish the asymptotic linear-scaling of our DLPNO-(Q) algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the locality of magnetic response in polycyclic aromatic molecules using a novel deep-learning approach. Our method employs graph neural networks (GNNs) with a graph-of-rings representation to predict nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) in the space around the molecule. We train a series of models, each time reducing the size of the largest molecules used in training. The accuracy of prediction remains high (MAE < 0.5 ppm), even when training the model only on molecules with up to four rings, thus providing strong evidence for the locality of magnetic response. To overcome the known problem of generalization of GNNs, we implement a k -hop expansion strategy and succeed in achieving accurate predictions for molecules with up to 15 rings (almost 4 times the size of the largest training example). Our findings have implications for understanding the magnetic response in complex molecules and demonstrate a promising approach to overcoming GNN scalability limitations. Furthermore, the trained models enable rapid characterization, without the need for more expensive DFT calculations.},

  abstract     = {Most atomistic machine learning (ML) models rely on a locality ansatz and decompose the energy into a sum of short-ranged, atom-centered contributions. This leads to clear limitations when trying to describe problems that are dominated by long-range physical effects—most notably electrostatics. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts to make them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need to incorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-range interactions. We develop a framework aiming to bring some of the established algorithms to evaluate non-bonded interactions—including Ewald summation, classical particle–mesh Ewald, and particle–particle/particle–mesh Ewald—into atomistic ML. We provide a reference implementation for PyTorch as well as an experimental one for JAX . Beyond Coulomb and more general long-range potentials, we introduce purified descriptors that disregard the immediate neighborhood of each atom and are more suitable for general long-range ML applications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: They provide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be used in the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit the availability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-range models with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexible to implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions as building blocks. We benchmark and demonstrate our torch-pme and jax-pme libraries to perform molecular dynamics simulations, train ML potentials, and evaluate long-range equivariant descriptors of atomic structures.},

  abstract     = {Inferring parameters of biochemical kinetic models from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose a method for the inference of parameters of stochastic reaction networks that works for both steady-state and time-resolved data and is applicable to networks with non-linear and rational propensities. Our approach provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimization over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices by taking observations to form moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem) and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration, and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common non-linear biochemical models including the Schlögl model and the toggle switch, a model of post-transcriptional regulation at steady state, and a birth-death model with time-dependent data.},

  abstract     = {Recent experiments have shown that complexation with a stabilizing compound can preserve enzyme activity in harsh environments. Such complexation is believed to be driven by noncovalent interactions at the enzyme surface, including hydrophobicity and electrostatics. Molecular modeling of these interactions is costly at the all-atom scale due to the long time scales and large particle counts needed to characterize binding. Protein structure at the scale of amino acid residues is parsimoniously represented by a coarse-grained model in which one particle represents several atoms, significantly reducing the cost of simulation. Coarse-grained models may then be used to generate reduced surface descriptions to underlie detailed theories of surface adhesion. In this study, we present two coarse-grained enzyme models—lipase and dehalogenase—that have been prepared using the Martini 3 top-down modeling framework. We simulate each enzyme in aqueous solution and calculate the statistics of protein surface features and shape descriptors. The values from the coarse-grained data are compared with the same calculations performed on all-atom reference systems, revealing key similarities of surface chemistry at the two scales. Structural measures are calculated from the all-atom reference systems and compared with estimates from small-angle x-ray scattering experiments, with good agreement between the two. The described procedures of modeling and analysis comprise a framework for the development of coarse-grained models of protein surfaces with validation to experiment.},

A novel aspect of our study emerged at very high concentrations, where the slow relaxation times exhibit only a mild increase with concentration, resembling the behavior observed in very soft colloids. Upon quenching the temperature to induce very slow dynamics, we observe fluctuating dynamics, suggesting a mild aging regime characterized by micro-rearrangements of BSA proteins. We use protein concentration (mass per volume) as the control parameter due to the precision of Bradford assay measurements, facilitating straightforward comparisons with other studies.

  abstract     = {Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant sphingolipid in mammalian cells. It contains a phosphorylcholine headgroup, which makes SM an analog of the (glycerol-containing) phosphatidylcholines. Palmitoyl (C16:0) SM bilayers in excess water exhibit a thermotropic transition from the ripple to the fluid phase centered at ≈41 °C. In phosphatidylcholines, as in most phospholipids, the ripple-to-fluid transition is fully reversible and virtually free of hysteresis. In this paper, however, the corresponding transition was assessed in aqueous SM by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, a technique detecting molecular vibrations. Vibrational spectra as a function of temperature revealed thermotropic phase transitions. When the samples were successively heated up and cooled down, a clear hysteresis was detected. The cooling transition started at the same temperature as the heating one, but the end-point, in terms of IR band position, was clearly different. Hysteresis was particularly visible in the shift of the IR Amide I band, associated with the lipid polar headgroup, and it was rate-independent, within a wide range of heating/cooling rates (from 5.5 °C/min to less than 0.05 °C/min). Atomistic computer simulations of the molecular dynamics provided information consistent with the IR data. In addition, it showed that the in-plane arrangement of SM bilayers displays a significant amount of hexatic order, and that the hexatic order parameter, reflecting primarily polar headgroup ordering, exhibited the same kind of hysteresis described by IR. Rate-independent hysteresis allows the development of durable memories; therefore, the observations in this paper could lead to novel applications of lipid assemblies.},

  abstract     = {Lamellar or smectic phases often have an intricate intralamellar structure that remains scarcely understood from a microscopic viewpoint. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of volume exclusion on the phase transitions of a flat membrane of soft repulsive spherocylinders. With increasing rod packing, we identify liquid crystal and crystal phases and find that the disorder–order phase transition happens at a universal packing fraction ( η ≈ 0.81), independent of the spherocylinder aspect ratio. We also confirm the existence of a small 2D hexatic region near the phase transition. The packing fraction associated with the phase transition is considerably higher than the well-known freezing transition of a hard disk fluid ( η ≈ 0.7) to which one could naively map a system of near-parallel rods with co-planar mass centers. We attribute this difference to non-vanishing residual orientational entropy per rod. Our findings are corroborated by a simple theory based on a simple microscopic density functional theory of freezing of a two-dimensional rod fluid. The strength of the orientational fluctuations of the individual rods in our membranes exhibits a density scaling that differs from 3D bulk smectics. Our findings contribute to a qualitative understanding of liquid crystal phase stability in strong planar confinement and engage with recent experimental explorations involving nanorods on 2D substrates.},

  abstract     = {Being intrinsically nonequilibrium, active materials can potentially perform functions that would be thermodynamically forbidden in passive materials. However, active systems have diverse local attractors that correspond to distinct dynamical states, many of which exhibit chaotic turbulent-like dynamics and thus cannot perform work or useful functions. Designing such a system to choose a specific dynamical state is a formidable challenge. Motivated by recent advances enabling optogenetic control of experimental active materials, we describe an optimal control theory framework that identifies a spatiotemporal sequence of light-generated activity that drives an active nematic system toward a prescribed dynamical steady state. Active nematics are unstable to spontaneous defect proliferation and chaotic streaming dynamics in the absence of control. We demonstrate that optimal control theory can compute activity fields that redirect the dynamics into a variety of alternative dynamical programs and functions. This includes dynamically reconfiguring between states, selecting and stabilizing emergent behaviors that do not correspond to attractors, and are hence unstable in the uncontrolled system. Our results provide a roadmap to leverage optical control methods to rationally design structure, dynamics, and function in a wide variety of active materials.},

  abstract     = {Two-step crystallization via a metastable intermediate phase is often regarded as a non-classical process that lies beyond the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we investigate two-step crystallization in colloid–polymer mixtures via an intermediate liquid phase. Using CNT-based seeding simulations, we construct a kinetic phase diagram that identifies regions of phase space where the critical nucleus is either liquid or crystalline. These predictions are validated using transition path sampling simulations at nine different relevant state points. When the critical nucleus is liquid, crystallization occurs stochastically during the growth phase, whereas for a crystalline critical nucleus, the crystallization process happens pre-critically at a fixed nucleus size. We conclude that CNT-based kinetic phase diagrams are a powerful tool for understanding and predicting “non-classical” crystal nucleation mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the nucleation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) hydrates from carbon dioxide aqueous solutions by means of molecular dynamics simulations using the TIP4P/Ice and the TraPPE models for water and CO 2 , respectively. We work at 400 bar and different temperatures and CO 2 concentrations. We use brute force molecular dynamics when the supersaturation or the supercooling is so high so that nucleation occurs spontaneously and Seeding otherwise. We use both methods for a particular state and found an excellent agreement when using a linear combination of q ̄ 3 and q ̄ 12 order parameters to identify critical clusters. With such order parameter, we get a rate of 10 25 m −3 s −1 for nucleation in a CO 2 saturated solution at 255 K (35 K of supercooling). By comparison with our previous work on methane hydrates, we conclude that nucleation of CO 2 hydrates is several orders of magnitude faster due to a lower interfacial free energy between the crystal and the solution. By combining our nucleation studies with a recent calculation of the hydrate–solution interfacial free energy at coexistence [Algaba et al. , J. Colloid Interface Sci. 623 , 354–367 (2022)], we obtain a prediction of the nucleation rate temperature dependence for CO 2 -saturated solutions (the experimentally relevant concentration). On the one hand, we open the window for comparison with experiments for supercooling larger than 25 K. On the other hand, we conclude that homogeneous nucleation is impossible for supercooling lower than 20 K. Therefore, nucleation must be heterogeneous in typical experiments where hydrate formation is observed at low supercooling. To assess the hypothesis that nucleation occurs at the solution-CO 2 interface, we run spontaneous nucleation simulations in two-phase systems and find, by comparison with single-phase simulations, that the interface does not affect hydrate nucleation, at least at the deep supercooling at which this study was carried out (40 and 45 K). Overall, our work sheds light on molecular and thermodynamic aspects of hydrate nucleation.},

  abstract     = {The selection of polymers suitable for the formulation of supersaturating drug-delivery systems is imperative to improve the solubility, thermodynamic stability, precipitation inhibition ability, and bioavailability of drugs in vivo . However, a detailed molecular-level understanding of finding the right drug–polymer combination in the aqueous medium is still ambiguous and often selected based on the trial procedure. Here, we have employed sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) to probe the impact of drug–polymer interactions on the interfacial water structure at the model biorelevant medium (BM) interface to extract better insights into the molecular system. We investigated two different polymers, Eudragit EPO (E-EPO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (P-K30), resulting in a considerable difference in the supersaturation limits of the atorvastatin calcium (ATC), the model drug molecule in the BM solution. The solubility study suggests an ∼42 times enhancement in the solubility of ATC drug with the presence of E-EPO polymer and merely an ∼2.6 times enhancement for polymer P-K30. Interestingly, SFG spectroscopic studies showed that E-EPO supports a substantial orientational ordering of the interfacial water molecules with the signature of strongly hydrogen (H)-bonded water molecules. An opposite trend is witnessed for the P-K30 polymer with less preferential ordering and weakly H-bonded water molecules at the air–BM interface. The microscopic insights from the SFG spectroscopy, in correlation with the observations on drug solubility, present a new potential approach for probing drug–polymer interactions. The implementation of SFG vibrational spectroscopy can be beneficial in selecting suitable polymers to adopt better strategies for bioavailability enhancement in drug formulation development.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted significant attention due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and excellent safety. Nevertheless, their practical applications are hindered by challenges such as electrolyte decomposition, Zn corrosion/passivation, and dendrite growth, which become more severe under high-temperature conditions. To address these issues, innovative electrolyte design has become a key strategy. In this study, we propose a simple and effective electrolyte modification strategy by introducing fatty acid methyl ester ethoxylate (FMEE) as an additive. FMEE functions as both a solvation structure regulator and a water cluster stabilizer, effectively suppressing side reactions and promoting the formation of a robust solid electrolyte interphase enriched with ZnS and ZnF 2 . This significantly improves the interfacial chemical stability of the Zn anode. As a result, the Zn anode achieves an extended cycling lifespan of up to 3000 h at 1 mA cm −2 and 1 mAh cm −2 . Furthermore, the Zn–V 2 O 5 full cell using the FMEE-modified electrolyte exhibits an excellent rate performance and long-term cycling stability. Notably, the cell maintains a superior electrochemical performance even at 60 °C, demonstrating remarkable thermal stability. This study offers a new strategy for developing high-performance, temperature-tolerant AZIBs.},

  abstract     = {Metal-based catalysts are widely used in many kinds of reactions, including the hydrogenation of CO 2 to alcohols. Adsorption energies of key intermediates have often been used as descriptors in high-throughput catalyst screening. However, establishing machine learning models to accurately predict adsorption energies of widely spanned species is still challenging. In the present article, we explored the predictive power of sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), multilayer perceptron regression (MLPR), random forest regression (RFR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), support vector regression (SVR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and 20 ensemble machine learning (ML) methods for adsorption energies of 57 species involved in CO 2 hydrogenation to ethanol using surface features, adsorbate features, and adsorption site features. The results show that SISSO and the five base ML methods cannot furnish models with the maximum absolute error (MAX) comparable to DFT errors. On the other hand, the MAX of most two-component and three-component ensemble ML methods is less than 0.3 eV, and the KRR+MLPR+XGBoost ensemble ML model performs the best, with the mean absolute error being 0.03 eV and MAX of only 0.17 eV. Feature importance analysis reveals that the condensed local softness is the most important feature, and there are linear relations between the condensed local softness and adsorption energies of 10 C 1 species on all considered surfaces. The present work shows that ensemble ML methods outperform the base ML methods for predicting adsorption energies of widely ranged species with satisfactory accuracy and deserve further studies.},

However, their applications in photovoltaics remain limited. Here, we first theoretically predict a stable Sn 9 C 15 monolayer (space group P 321). The Sn 9 C 15 monolayer exhibits numerous advantages, which make it an ideal candidate for photovoltaic applications: (1) The Sn 9 C 15 monolayer is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.70 eV, which is closer to the optimal bandgap of 1.50 eV for photovoltaic devices; (2) the Sn 9 C 15 monolayer exhibits electron mobilities in excess of 2 × 10 3 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ; (3) the Sn 9 C 15 monolayer shows a direct bandgap of 1.50 eV under a 3% compressive biaxial strain; (4) the Sn 9 C 15 monolayer shows a benign light absorption in the whole visible region (380–780 nm); (5) the Sn 9 C 15 monolayer possesses an optical bandgap of 0.97 eV and an exciton binding energy of 1.63 eV; and (6) the Sn 9 C 15 /TMD heterostructures are predicted to have a power conversion efficiency of 9%–23%. In terms of its formation energy, we expect that the Sn 9 C 15 monolayer will be fabricated similarly to the synthesized Si 9 C 15 monolayer. Importantly, the target bandgap of the Sn 9 C 15 monolayer is achieved by the synergistic mechanism of the crystal lattice spacing and the atomic contribution of band edges (referred to as lattice-band edge synergistic mechanism). We anticipate that this synergistic mechanism will facilitate the design of a great number of new materials with targeted bandgaps.},

The strain in the surface lattice, resulting from a 12.62% compression of the Au monolayer, induces a significant high barrier height (1.81 eV) and a tight saddle point. These effects lead to a marked suppression of the reactivity of ground-state HCl ( v = 0) on Au/Cu(111), while the dissociation probability of vibrationally excited ( v = 1) HCl increases substantially. As a result, the vibrational efficiency is notably higher compared to those for HCl on pure Au(111) and alloyed Au/Ag(111) surfaces. In addition, the surface strain induces a distinctive rotational alignment effect in the title reaction, where for HCl in the ( v = 0, j ) states, dissociation is most favorable when an HCl molecule collides with its rotation perpendicular to the Au/Cu(111) surface (the cartwheel alignment). In contrast, for HCl in the ( v = 1, j ) states, the opposite (helicopter) alignment is preferred. This leads to a pronounced difference in the effects of rotational excitation, depending on whether HCl is initially in the ground or excited vibrational state.},

The molecular configurations, structures, and orbitals are clearly clarified in the submolecular level. On Ag 2 Sb/Ag(111), the VOPc membrane exhibits the fourfold symmetric unit cell comprising one centered and four cornered O-up molecules with two distinct stacking orientations. On the contrary, on Cu 2 Sb/Cu(111), all VOPc molecules adopt the O-down configuration and uniform orientations. The tunneling conductance spectra unveil a semiconductor signature but with different occupied orbitals for both VOPc membranes. These contrasting features are resulted from the diverse molecule–substrate interaction relating to the different charge transfer of alloy surfaces.

  abstract     = {Under terrestrial conditions, liquids are stirred by Marangoni and gravity-induced flows. A nucleation model that couples the stochastic fluxes of long-range diffusion and interfacial attachment [the Coupled-Flux Model (CFM)] predicts that the nucleation kinetics in metallic liquids should be faster with increased stirring for cases where long-range diffusion is required for nucleation due to an additional mechanism for the transportation of atoms to the nucleating cluster. Unfortunately, few experimental studies of stirring effects exist for metallic liquids. Here, the effect of stirring on hundreds of nucleation cycles is presented for a Zr 80 Pt 20 eutectic liquid using the quiescent environment of ground-based electrostatic levitation and the controlled stirred environment of the electromagnetic levitation facility on the International Space Station. While the Zr 80 Pt 20 liquid should solidify to a eutectic phase mixture, ground-based synchrotron x-ray studies of the crystallizing liquid presented here show that primary nucleation is to an icosahedral phase (i-phase). Approximately 5 s later, the i-phase/liquid transforms into the equilibrium eutectic phase mixture. Since Zr 80 Pt 20 is the eutectic composition, little effect of stirring is expected since diffusion only occurs over short distances during crystallization. Stirring should also have little effect on the nucleation of the i-phase, which has a similar composition to that of the liquid. In contrast, the experimental results show that stirring slows down the nucleation kinetics of the i-phase. However, why the nucleation is heterogeneous, not homogeneous, is yet unknown; a few plausible explanations are suggested for this and the mechanism for the decrease in the nucleation kinetics with stirring.},

  abstract     = {During ion transfer through a water–oil interface, a water finger (WF) is transiently formed and breaks to leave hydrated ions in the oil phase. The present work investigated subsequent microscopic processes following WF by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The nascent ions tend to have excessive hydrating water as a consequence of unstable WF formation, implying subsequent relaxation. Subsequent kinetics of the ions including evaporation/condensation of hydrating water, diffusion, recapture of ions by WF, and ion pair formation were comprehensively examined with calculations of free energy surfaces and diffusion dynamics. The thickness of the interface associated with non-equilibrium hydration is estimated to be the order of ∼nm, and the WF recapture is a rather minor process in the range. The observed ion current through the liquid–liquid interface was shown to be sensitive to the water content in the oil because the concentration of ions including their hydrated clusters in the oil phase is sensitive to the trace amount of water concentration.},

For many cluster sizes, surface melting occurs at much lower temperatures than core melting. Surface and core melting points and energetic melting points (temperatures of maximum heat capacity, C v ) are calculated for all cluster sizes. Melting properties are found to be strong functions of cluster structure. Cluster sizes with closed-shell structures always have first-order-like phase transitions. Almost one-third of cluster sizes in the analyzed range exhibit second-order-like phase transitions due to the presence of multiple structural configurations close in energy. 1-shell clusters with one to a few more atoms than a neighboring closed-shell structure have very low surface melting points and very high energetic melting points compared to their closed-shell counterparts. In clusters above 50 atoms with certain core structures, melting of the surface before the core was observed.},

While the planar framework has been extended to all other first-row elements beyond carbon, stable ptLi (lithium) compounds remain notably missing. Here, we conducted extensive structural searches on the potential energy surfaces of A 5 Ha 4 + (A = alkali metals; Ha = halogens) to explore planar tetracoordinate alkali metals. Our results show that while A 5 Ha 4 + species exhibit grid-like, square-planar A-centered ptA structures (A©A 4 Ha 4 + ) in closed-shell states, most are transition states. Notably, we identified a rare, stable ptLi species, Li©Li 4 F 4 + . In this structure, strong charge transfer from Li to F atoms, forming a Li + ©[Li + ] 4 [F − ] 4 complex, provides strong electrostatic interactions. In addition, donor–acceptor covalent interactions Li 4 F 4 → ptLi offer significant electronic stabilization, contributing to the overall stability of the intriguing ptLi structure.},

In the collisions with N 2 + , the H 2 O + yield is populated in the bending-motion vibrational states of the A 2 A 1 state and its production efficiency is enhanced monotonously with the decrease in collision energy. The H 2 O + velocity images recorded with the three-dimensional ion velocity map imaging technique exhibit two categories of spatial distributions: at relatively high energies, the narrow and forward-scattered distribution corresponds to the resonant or prompt charge transfer in large-impact-parameter collisions; small-impact-parameter or intimate collisions are preferred at the lower energies, leading to the H 2 O + distribution closer to the center of masses. The charge transfers from N + exhibit similar dynamics; by contrast, an intermediate complex (N⋯H 2 O) + is more likely to be experienced in the low-energy intimate collision.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit coupling splits the exciton resonances of two-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D-OIHPs) into an optically active fine structure. Although circularly polarized light can induce macroscopic spin polarizations in ensembles of quantum wells, the orientations of the angular momentum vectors associated with individual excitons generally randomize on sub-picosecond timescales in 2D-OIHPs with single lead-iodide layers. In the present work, we investigate the nonlinear optical signatures of spin depolarization in 2D-OIHP materials with various organic layer thicknesses and polaron binding energies. Transient absorption experiments conducted using circularly polarized laser pulses establish time constants for spin equilibration ranging from 65 to 110 fs in the targeted systems. In addition, with inspiration from time-resolved Faraday rotation spectroscopies, we introduce a transient grating method in which spin relaxation promotes an elliptical-to-linear transformation of the signal field polarization. Spectroscopic signatures for all experiments are simulated with a common third-order perturbative model that incorporates orientationally averaged transition dipoles and the polarizations of the laser pulses. Spectroscopic line broadening parameters obtained for the 2D-OIHP systems are considered in the context of a rate formula for spin relaxation, wherein the spin–orbit coupling is combined with a cumulant expansion for fluctuations of the energy levels. Our analysis suggests that the insensitivity of the measured spin relaxation rates to the polaron binding energies of 2D-OIHPs reflects the suppression of an activation energy barrier due to motional narrowing. Model calculations conducted with empirical parameters indicate that motional narrowing of the spin relaxation processes originates in correlated thermal fluctuations of the energy levels comprising the exciton fine structure.},

Flexocatalysis, which extends flexoelectricity to mechanocatalysis, is a promising mechanism for catalytic processes. Owing to its size-dependent effects, flexoelectricity has become particularly significant and plays a dominant regulatory role in chemical reactions within nanocatalysis. In this study, we integrated flexocatalysis with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for efficient water purification. The simulation results show that flexoelectric polarization can induce a strong flexoelectric field in δ-MnO 2 nanosheets. This built-in electric field subsequently drives the migration of electrons and holes to the reaction interface, thereby activating PMS and promoting rapid generation of reactive species for the degradation of organic pollutants. At low concentrations of flexoelectric catalysts, we achieved excellent degradation efficiency that was 6.6 times greater than that obtained through the thermal activation of PMS. This study demonstrated that flexoelectricity can function as a switch for PMS activation and offers a promising approach for sustainable water remediation.},

With relatively simple single-determinant trial wave functions, we demonstrate the benefits of an all-electron approach in conjunction with a highly accurate grid method for calculating the orbitals that build the determinant. Our DMC ground state energies match with those of more elaborate single-reference quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods based on orbital basis sets. The binning technique is revisited to calculate the electronic density on a spatial grid. We examine the dependence of the resulting mixed estimator and extrapolated density on the trial wave function, specifically on the density functional generating the orbitals, by employing two distinctly different functionals, namely, the local density approximation and the exact-exchange functional. Residual statistical artifacts in the QMC densities are readily corrected by using a regularization method, resulting in smooth densities. As an example for the insight that can be gained from an accurate density, we verify that in the carbon atom, the density along one specific direction can have an asymptotic decay that differs from the decay found in all other directions. We relate this observation to previously published work, which discussed the implications that such a nodal feature may have for the exact Kohn–Sham potential.},

The NH dynamics, known for its deterministic temperature control without stochastic forces, is adapted here to model a monoatomic Lennard-Jones system at different coarse-grained levels. The CG particle’s equation of motion is derived from atomic-level dynamics, linking NH thermostat terms with system properties obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Key parameters, including the thermostat coefficient and thermal inertia, are calibrated using the MD data to assess their impact on the dynamic and structural reproducibility of the CG model. The calibration results suggest the potential application of NH dynamics as a coarse-graining method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is then evaluated through a set of CG simulations. The CG results show stable energy regulation and promising accuracy in reproducing system properties, particularly for mass diffusion, with opportunities for further refinement in representing structural reproducibility and momentum diffusion.},

In this paper, the corresponding states with higher seniorities are identified, and their couplings through the Coulomb Hamiltonian are computed. In every case, the couplings between the states are computed from the cofactors of their effective overlap matrix. Proof-of-principle calculations demonstrate that a single reference configuration interaction is comparable to seniority-based configuration interaction computations at a substantially reduced cost.

The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe–Salpeter equation for the two-body particle–particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ( GW , T -matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron–hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules.

From a theoretical perspective, the success of a given analytic method relies on the operational aspects as well as its exactness in replicating (known) experimental results. While analytic methods built around the Magnus expansion (ME) scheme have been preferred in time-evolution studies, the splitting of the time-propagator into a product of exponential operators in the Fer expansion (FE) scheme has gained wider attention in recent years. To this end, the operational advantages of one scheme over the other have always remained contentious and form the basis for the present report. Employing periodic Hamiltonians as examples, the operational aspects and the relative merits/demerits of the two methods are analyzed, and their long-term/short-term behavior is discussed through analytic expressions in experimentally verifiable systems.},

  abstract     = {Ultrastrong light–matter interaction with molecular vibrations in infrared cavities has emerged as a tool for manipulating and controlling chemical reactivity. By studying the wavepacket dynamics of an individual polar diatomic molecule in a quantized infrared electromagnetic environment, we show that chemical bonds can efficiently dissociate in the absence of additional thermal or coherent energy sources, provided that the coupled system is prepared in a suitable diabatic state. Using hydrogen fluoride as a case study, we predict dissociation probabilities of up to 35% in less than 200 fs for a vibration-cavity system that is rapidly initialized with a low number of bare vibrational and cavity excitations. We develop a simple and general analytical model based on the multipolar formulation of quantum electrodynamics to show that the Bloch–Seigert shift of the bare vibrational ground state is a predictor of a threshold coupling strength below which no spontaneous dissociation is expected. The role of state-dependent permanent dipole moments in the light–matter interaction process is clarified. Our work paves the way toward the development of vacuum-assisted chemical reactors powered by ultrastrong light–matter interaction at the single-molecule level.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge in physical systems is implementing computation at the microscopic scale where thermal fluctuations dominate. While biological systems achieve this through complex molecular networks, the physical principles enabling simpler systems to process temporal information remain unclear. Here we demonstrate how non-equilibrium dynamics can enable single molecules to perform sophisticated computation through thermal-kinetic frustration—a principle that creates a controlled discrepancy between thermodynamic stability and kinetic accessibility. By engineering this frustration in a linear polymer with N binary-state units, we create a physical realization of a deterministic finite automaton capable of accessing 2 N configurations through non-equilibrium driving, far exceeding the N + 1 configurations available at equilibrium. Despite operating in a thermal environment, the molecule’s dominant configuration evolves deterministically, enabling recognition of complex temporal patterns through mechanical control signals. Our framework establishes how stochastic microscopic dynamics can give rise to deterministic computation, providing new insights into non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and information processing in physical systems. The theoretical predictions can be tested using DNA nanotechnology, with potential applications in biosensing and adaptive materials.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the phase behavior and dynamics of multi-component polymeric systems is essential for designing materials used in applications ranging from biopharmaceuticals to consumer products. While computational tools for understanding the equilibrium properties of such systems are relatively mature, simulation platforms for investigating non-equilibrium behavior are comparatively less developed. Dynamic self-consistent field theory (DSCFT) is a method that retains essential microscopic thermodynamics while enabling a continuum-level understanding of multi-component, multi-phase diffusive transport. A challenge with DSCFT is its high computational complexity and cost, along with the difficulty of incorporating thermal fluctuations. External potential dynamics (EPD) offers a more efficient approach to studying inhomogeneous polymers out of equilibrium, providing similar accuracy to DSCFT but with significantly lower computational cost. In this work, we introduce an extension of EPD to enable efficient and stable simulations of multi-species, multi-component polymer systems while embedding thermodynamically consistent noise. We validate this framework through simulations of a triblock copolymer melt and spinodally decomposing binary and ternary polymer blends, demonstrating its capability to capture key features of phase separation and domain growth. Furthermore, we highlight the role of thermal fluctuations in early stage coarsening. This study provides new insights into the interplay between stochastic and deterministic effects in the dynamic evolution of polymeric fluids, with the EPD framework offering a robust and scalable approach for investigating the complex dynamics of multi-component polymeric materials.},

We begin by examining fundamental models, including Tavis–Cummings and Holstein–Tavis–Cummings Hamiltonians, exploring how disorder, non-Hermitian effects, and finite temperature conditions impact their dynamics, setting the stage for studying conical intersections and their crucial role in SF. Using rubrene as an example and applying the numerically accurate Davydov Ansatz methodology, we derive dynamic and spectroscopic responses of the system and demonstrate key mechanisms capable of SF manipulation, viz. cavity-induced enhancement/weakening/suppression of SF, population localization on the singlet state via engineering cavity-mode excitation, polaron/polariton decoupling, and collective enhancement of SF. We outline unsolved problems and challenges in the field and share our views on the development of the future lines of research. We emphasize the significance of careful modeling of cascades of polaritonic conical intersections in high excitation manifolds and envisage that collective geometric phase effects may remarkably affect the SF dynamics and yield. We argue that the microscopic interpretation of the main regulatory mechanisms of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven SF can substantially deepen our understanding of this process, thereby providing novel ideas and solutions for improving conversion efficiency in photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalysis is one of the key technologies for developing sustainable and fossil resource free routes to produce fuels and chemicals. The limiting potential (U L ), defined by the reaction free energy of the most difficult electrochemical step in a given pathway, is an effective descriptor for establishing the activity trend of a set of electrocatalysts, allowing high throughput screening of new catalysts. However, the reaction network of electrocatalytic processes is rather complex, especially for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps, e.g., the synthesis of valuable C–N bond-containing chemicals. Thermochemical steps cannot be significantly enhanced by electrode potentials, where kinetics is a non-negligible issue at even high overpotentials. This makes it challenge by using limiting potential to accurately describe activity trends for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps. To this end, we propose an effective scheme to determine an improved descriptor. We suggest refining the rather complex reaction network at first. In particular, it is suggested to decouple electro- and thermochemical steps and exclude the unfavorable pathways with an excessively high thermochemical barrier. Then, a global comparison among the other pathways can be made, to determine the optimal pathway and the improved descriptor (the reaction free energy of the most difficult step of the optimal pathway, defined as ΔG rRPD -limiting). In addition, the studies on reaction kinetics are also suggested to understand the exception of the best catalysts and provide the direction of experimental optimization. This scheme is of a great compromise between practical efficiency and the accuracy toward the rational design of electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Mnemonic networks are cyclic catalytic networks of monomeric enzymes that exhibit kinetic cooperativity as departures of the mean velocity from the hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-like response. In addition, such networks admit a hysteretic response when conformational fluctuations are slow compared to the catalytic rate. Here, we show how these fluctuation-driven effects emerge from the underlying stochasticity in the network. We use the chemical master equation to study the stochastic kinetics of mnemonic networks, which, in their minimal form, include a pair of conformers and triangular reaction pathways. We introduce statistical measures that are conditional on the turnovers to comprehensively analyze molecular fluctuations in the transient and stationary states of these networks. In the transient state, temporal correlations between enzyme turnovers lead to an inequivalence between number and temporal fluctuations, yielding a hysteretic response of the mean velocity to substrates. The transient relaxes to a stationary state with independent and identically distributed turnovers and equality between number and temporal fluctuations. This state is a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) when the Kolmogorov loop criterion is not satisfied, leading to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The symmetry of the number correlation functions allows us to distinguish between the absence of cooperativity in equilibrium and the accidental vanishing of cooperativity in a NESS. We conclude that memory and hysteresis are transient effects while kinetic cooperativity emerges as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic irreversibility of the NESS in a network with cyclic reaction pathways.},

The results indicate that dsRNA unwinds when stretched, accompanied by a linear increase in helical rise and helical diameter. Then, we utilized the normal modes, which are linear combinations of helical modes, to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dsRNA unwinding from an energetic perspective. On the other hand, we employed a stiffness matrix based on a rigid base pair model to examine the base-pair dependence of twist elasticity for dsRNA, as well as stretch elasticities with respect to the helical rise and helical diameter. The results show that the force induces variations in the local elasticities and their couplings of dsRNA, which are closely related to the distributions of base pairs. The mean stretch and twist elasticities can be considered as constants within the measurement uncertainties; however, their couplings demonstrate a slight linear dependency on applied force.},

  abstract     = {Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed, or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here, we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory, where the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d 0 . Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization, and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d 0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, d c , the polymer collapse precedes dimerization , and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competitions, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration R G ( t ) of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a center-to-center of mass distance parameter R MM , and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q ( t ) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking the contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using the dynamical disorder model.},

  abstract     = {Buoyancy-driven convection currents arise from temperature gradients in thermal frontal polymerization (FP) when the spatially localized polymerization reaction travels perpendicularly to the gravity field. We propose a theoretical study of the system dynamics under adiabatic conditions. The polymer and the reactant mixture are considered to be in the same liquid phase, but the viscosity can increase with the degree of polymerization. We find that the reaction zone propagates as a hot spot-like pattern with a broken symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Furthermore, the system can reach an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a front with a steady shape that propagates at constant speed with a steady vortex surrounding it. As the strength of the vortex is increased, either by decreasing the reactants’ viscosity or by increasing the layer’s thickness, we observe a transition between (i) a passive regime predicted by pure reaction–diffusion and hydrodynamic models and (ii) an active chemo-hydrodynamic regime where such models separately break down. In the active regime (ii), the front speed decreases as convection intensifies. By means of a scaling analysis, we explain how hydrodynamic currents might lower the velocity of a polymerization wave. As the viscosity of the polymer is enlarged, the flow is shifted ahead of the reaction zone and becomes more symmetrical with respect to the middle of the system, as recently observed in solid–liquid FP experiments [Y.

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a new model of the crystalline structure of the poly(butylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PBF). This new structure has been derived using an ab initio density functional theory methodology and focusing on the agreement between the experimental and theoretical x-ray diffraction patterns. An extensive study has been performed to analyze the possible conformations that the polymeric strand can adopt in its crystalline form, leading to 60 initial crystalline structures. Due to thermal motion, which cannot be easily tackled with the ab initio methodology, and small inaccuracies, which are intrinsic to this calculation method, the theoretical unit cell dimensions can slightly differ from those obtained in the crystallization experiments. Thus, a structural refinement method has been employed to overcome these discrepancies and procure a crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern is consistent with the experimental one. For the proposed crystalline structure of PBF, both the powder diffraction pattern and the fiber diffraction diagram show a remarkable agreement with those available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.},

Distinct dry GB and TJ energies and GB widths are considered in contrast to the earlier phase-field studies, which assumed identical properties for the dry GBs and TJs and are far from reality. The strong effects of the intrinsic length scales, including the dry GB widths and grain size, on the temperatures of barrierless transformations between the solid, premelt (an intermediate stationary state between solid and melt with a degree of disorder) and melt, their nucleation induced by the GB network, kinetics, and complex microstructures evolution are explored, which was still missing in the literature. The thermodynamic processes involved in the melting of polycrystalline solids, which include the jump-like (discontinuous) appearance of premelt or melt pockets in the TJ regions, followed by premelting and melting of the connected GBs, curvature-driven shrinking of the grains surrounded by the melt pools and their jump-like melting at critical temperatures, all occurring at temperatures below the bulk melting point, are revealed. The reverse transformation (solidification) of the molten GB network and the bistability regime, where the temperatures for solid → premelt and premelt → solid transformations differ and yield thermal hysteresis, are studied. The role of the disjoining potential on the jump-like GB premelting and stability of the thermodynamic states is explored.},

  abstract     = {Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors have garnered significant attention due to their high power and energy densities, as well as the abundance of sodium reserves. However, the mismatch between anode and cathode dynamics is the biggest barrier to improving their performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for the preparation of porous MXene by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-controlled etching to solve the capacity degradation and ion diffusion limitation, which are caused by van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets. This approach facilitates the realization of three-dimensional ion channels with both vertical and horizontal pathways, significantly enhancing the availability of active sites and improving the ion diffusion rate. By adjusting the amount of oxidant, porous MXene (P-MXene-2) with an optimal pore size range was obtained. The assembled half-cell has a capacity of 180 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.05 A g −1 . Furthermore, by combining a porous carbon cathode with porous MXene and electrolyte screening, a SIHC with a high energy density of 110.6 Wh kg −1 at 1000 W kg −1 and 71.1 Wh kg −1 at 20 kW kg −1 was successfully constructed. This study provides useful insights into the design and preparation of porous MXene electrodes and their energy storage applications.},

Herein, we investigate two types of the heteroatom-decorated C 2 N monolayer, denoted as M@C 2 N (M = Mn and Ni) and B-C 2 N, for their gas-sensing functionality toward seven small gaseous molecules (H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O). The key gas-sensing characteristics concerning chemiresistive (CR) and field-effect transistor (FET) gas sensing have been thoroughly explored. The results show that Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N can work as either CR or FET gas-sensing materials for detecting H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O, whereas B-C 2 N can work as a disposable gas sensor for O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 . Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N are the most selective toward O 2 and NH 3 , followed by CO and H 2 O in an oxygen- and ammonia-free environment, while B-C 2 N is the most selective toward H 2 O and NH 3 . More importantly, the adsorption strength of target molecule plays a critical role in gas-sensing mechanism as well as selectivity, recovery time, and sensitivity. This study offers theoretical perspectives on 2D hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials for efficient gas sensing.},

Highly polarized spin probes were produced in situ by the addition of muonium to the aromatic anions, and the muon and methylene proton hyperfine coupling constants (hfccs) of these radical anions were determined from the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonance fields in the ALC- μ SR spectra. The motionally averaged dipolar muon hfccs, | D μ ‖ | ⁠ , were determined from the width and amplitude of the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonances and used to estimate the extent of reorientational motion. The results are consistent with the counterions being electrostatically trapped near the oil/water interface of the surfactant bilayer and undergoing large amplitude anisotropic motion. This motion is generally more restricted in DODMAC bilayers compared with DHTAC, which is likely related to the relative flexibility of the headgroups to which the counterions are loosely bound. The motion of the ortho isomers is generally more restricted than the para isomers, while there is no obvious trend regarding the ethyl, chloro, and hydroxy substituents.},

Model simulations using the density matrix method were performed to elucidate how the features of the magnetoluminescence effect depend on the triplet pair dynamics. Simulations of the observed field dependence of the magnetoluminescence effect revealed an anisotropy of 1:100 for the two-dimensional hopping of triplet excitons forming a triplet pair in the ab plane, for which the exchange interaction depends on the separation distance between the two triplet excitons. The effective lifetime of the spin-correlated triplet pair responsible for the magnetoluminescence effect is estimated to be 2.2 ns.},

In the presence of a radical scavenger, the DEP decay time depends on both spin-lattice relaxation and the chemical reaction with the scavenger, the latter of which reduces radical concentration. The plots of DEP decay rates against the radical scavenger concentrations gave the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for various radicals. This procedure was applied to determine the radical scavenging reaction rate constants of hydroxycyclohexyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, diphenylphosphinoyl, and α,α-dimethoxybenzyl radicals. The measured rate constants show good agreement with the previously reported values determined by using another method monitoring electron spin echo (ESE) decays of the radicals.

  abstract     = {In the present work, we investigate the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of different core–shell nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation and Green–Kubo (EMD), imposing a temperature gradient (NEMD) and Müller-Plathe (rNEMD) approaches. We show that in GaAs@InAs nanowires, the interface effect becomes more significant than the nanowire cross-sectional geometry. In particular, κ decreases as the interface area increases, reaching a minimum, and then increases when the interface strain relaxes. This is particularly important for thermoelectric applications, where minimization of κ is desired. In particular, the different methods can predict minima at different core diameters without special considerations. In addition, the NEMD approach and, to a lesser extent, rNEMD tend to overestimate the κ values, which cannot be corrected with the methods available in the literature. By analyzing the temperature and length dependence, (I) we show that interfacial scattering primarily involves phonon–phonon interactions, which mainly affect low-energy modes, a mechanism that effectively reduces κ at low temperatures. (II) The Langevin thermostat tends to pump low-energy modes in the NEMD approach, but this effect decreases with longer nanowires. (III) Energy exchanges in rNEMD stimulate high-energy phonons, derived from the saturation of κ at a much shorter nanowire length than NEMD. These findings highlight the challenges of accurately determining κ of ultrathin core–shell nanowires, where only the EMD approach provides precise results. With the recognition of non-equilibrium contributions to the overestimation of κ by NEMD and rNEMD, these methods can still provide valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying thermal transport mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {We investigate fundamental aspects concerning selectivity in hydrogenation reactions for Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer (SCILL)-type systems. Some of us recently reported that the adsorption behavior of 1,3-butadiene and 1-butene on Pt(111) can be tuned with ultrathin layers of the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 1 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]): Increasing the IL coverage leads to increased blocking of olefin adsorption sites. Notably, a smaller IL amount is needed to prevent 1-butene adsorption as compared to 1,3-butadiene adsorption, leading to a selectivity window, in which 1,3-butadiene still can be adsorbed while 1-butene cannot. With the aim to evaluate whether this is a general behavior, we study an IL with a longer alkyl chain at the cation, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]), and an IL with a different anion, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 8 C 1 Im][PF 6 ]). Indeed, we observe a selectivity window for all ILs and thus demonstrate that this concept also applies for other ILs with different chain lengths and anions. Nevertheless, there are pronounced differences for the three ILs in terms of the IL coverages required for full blocking and the width of the selectivity window. Different explanations are discussed, e.g., the structure of the IL layer and the interaction strengths of olefins and ILs with the substrate.},

  abstract     = {Aluminum (Al) is a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low volume expansibility. However, scalable fabrication of nanostructured Al still faces a great challenge. In addition, the lithium storage performance of Al anode materials always encounters a severe strike within a dozen discharge/charge cycles, and such an abnormal behavior of the Al anode material remains enigmatic. Herein, a mechanochemistry method without using any solvent is developed to achieve scalable production of Al nanoparticles and the morphology of the obtained Al nanoparticles could be regulated using Ketjen black (KB). KB with a chain-like structure could regulate the Al crystal growth process and the aggregation of Al nanoparticles during the solid-phase reaction, shortening the electron transfer path among Al crystals, ultimately activating the lithium storage behavior of nanostructured Al. Initial discharge/charge capacities of 630.6 and 402.0 mA h g −1 were achieved at 50 mA g −1 ; unfortunately, the nanostructured Al still suffered from rapid deterioration of lithium storage performance. Comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the raised energy barrier of LiAl formation and the slow lithium diffusion kinetics in the Al matrix may be the main factors destroying the lithium storage performance of the Al anode material. This work provided more evidence for illustrating the lithium storage behavior of the Al anode.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying thermodynamics, structural, and dynamical properties of brine confined in clay pores is critical for a variety of geo-energy applications, including underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are applied here to study aqueous NaCl brines within 10-Å kaolinite slit pores. NaCl concentrations are chosen at 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt. %, all below the solubility limit and high enough to provide statistically relevant information. The distribution of the ions within the nanopores is found not to be homogeneous. Explicitly, Na + cations, preferentially attracted to the siloxane surface, accumulate in regions with low water density, whereas Cl − anions, attracted to the gibbsite surface of kaolinite, are found within the hydration layers. Confinement affects the properties of ions, with ion pairing being more pronounced within the pore than in bulk aqueous solutions at similar temperatures, pressures, and compositions. Conversely, the ions affect the properties of confined water. For example, the lifetime of water–water hydrogen bonds in confinement is shortened within the hydration shells; increasing salinity from 5 to 12.5 wt. % reduces the likelihood of water density fluctuations near the kaolinite surfaces, although when the NaCl concentration rises from 12.5 to 15 wt. %, Cl − anions enhance the likelihood of density fluctuations for the hydration layer near the gibbsite surface. The simulated molecular trajectories are studied further to extract diffusion coefficients. While confinement in the kaolinite nanopore reduces the mobility of all species, non-monotonic trends are observed as a function of salt concentration. The trends seem associated with the likelihood of ion pairing. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for the cations are predicted to be higher than those for the anions, which is contrary to what is typically observed in bulk brines. Because density fluctuations are correlated with properties such as the solubility of gases in confined water, our observations may have important implications for geo-energy applications such as UHS and CCS.},

  abstract     = {The theoretical prediction of thermal conductivity in many layered oxides remains challenging, primarily due to their structural complexity and low symmetry. The traditional Boltzmann transport equation method is highly accurate but limited by the low-order phonon scattering model, which makes it difficult to resolve the high-order scattering effects of low symmetry layered materials. The classical molecular dynamics calculation is efficient but lacks accuracy due to the missing multi-component potential function. In this study, we develop a strategy to predict the thermal conductivity of K 0.8 Li 0.27 Ti 1.73 O 4 (KLTO), a model of layered oxides by machine-learning using a deep neural network model to acquire the interatomic potential of KLTO. The deep learning potential (DLP) is in excellent agreement with density functional theory in predicting atomic force, energy, and elastic properties. In addition, the calculated out-of-plane thermal conductivity values based on the DLP (0.37 W m −1 K −1 ) are close to experimental results (0.28 W m −1 K −1 ). This machine-learning framework for constructing interatomic potentials can be extended to other layered materials, offering a promising approach for advancing the theoretical study of such systems.},

  abstract     = {Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) is a toxic chemical that poses significant risks to human health and the environment; therefore, its level must be accurately monitored. Herein, the adsorption of CNCl by transition metal-doped fluorinated diamanes (F-diamanes) has been extensively studied via first-principles calculations. Key parameters such as adsorption energies, charge transfer amounts, bandgaps, sensitivity, densities of states, projected density of states, charge density differences, and recovery time were systematically analyzed. Results reveal that monometallic doping significantly enhances CNCl adsorption, with increases in adsorption energy by 164%–368% and charge transfer by 1234%–1571%, particularly in the AuFD-CNCl, AgFD-CNCl, and CuFD-CNCl systems, which demonstrated improved sensing performances. Similarly, bimetallic co-doping further strengthened adsorption, with energy enhancements of 277%–309% and charge transfer increases of 1238%–1505%. Au-CuFD-CNCl, Au-AgFD-CNCl, and Cu-AgFD-CNCl systems also showed superior sensing performances. Meanwhile, the recovery time of CNCl molecules on the AuFD, AgFD, Au-CuFD, and Au-AgFD surfaces was drastically reduced to acceptable levels at 279–412 K, leading to their desorption. Therefore, these four systems exhibited excellent reversibility properties, suggesting their applicability in gas-sensing applications. This work can facilitate the applications of doped F-diamanes in environmental conservation, energy storage, and chemical engineering.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a solution system of KCl–NH 4 Cl–NH 3 –H 2 O with different mass fractions was prepared at room temperature using x-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. From x-ray scattering, it was obtained that the peak near Q = 2.50 Å −1 in the F ( Q ) function changed from a flat-topped blunt peak to a bimodal peak as the concentration of ammonia increased. This change indicated that increased ammonia altered the hydrogen bonding network within the mixed solution. In the G ( r ) function, the peak near 3.25 Å enhances with the increase in ammonia concentration, suggesting a higher occurrence of N(NH 4 + )–N(NH 3 ) interactions. Raman spectroscopy findings demonstrated that in the KCl–NH 4 Cl aqueous mixture, the area of DDAA-type hydrogen bonds increased as KCl concentration decreased and NH 4 Cl concentration increased. This suggests that KCl disrupts DDAA-type hydrogen bonds more significantly than NH 4 Cl. The situation was reversed when ammonia was added to the system, implying that KCl damages the DDAA-type hydrogen bonding structure less than NH 4 Cl when NH 3 is present in the solution. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the coordination number of K–Cl increases with ammonia concentration, as ammonia’s lone pair of electrons can bind to NH 4 + to stabilize the [NH 4 (H 2 O) m−n (NH 3 ) n ] + complex. This study elucidates the underlying microscopic mechanisms behind the decrease in KCl solubility and the increase in NH 4 Cl solubility upon increased ammonia.},

  abstract     = {Two main frameworks are commonly used to describe electrolyte solutions: the non-primitive model, which rigorously accounts for all interactions between ions and solvent molecules; and the primitive model, which treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum, only describing ion–ion interactions explicitly. The primitive model offers simple Helmholtz energy expressions, including the Debye–Hückel (DH) equation, the primitive mean spherical approximation (MSA), and the Born theory of solvation. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of primitive model approaches by comparing their Helmholtz energies with data from molecular simulations obtained for non-primitive model electrolyte solutions. We model electrolyte solutions as mixtures of equally sized, charged, and (non-polarizable) dipolar Lennard-Jones particles. Using thermodynamic integration, we isolate the Helmholtz energy contributions related to solvent–solvent, ion–solvent, and ion–ion interactions. Molecular simulations are performed across two temperatures and two densities, a range of charges, dipole moments, and ion mole fractions (0.005 ≤ x ions ≤ 0.05). Our results show that while the primitive model expressions provide a qualitatively reasonable description of electrolyte solutions, they systematically underestimate the Helmholtz energy contributions associated with ion–solvent and ion–ion interactions. Achieving quantitative agreement requires empirical adjustments to the Born radius. Notably, the optimized Born radii are significantly larger than the actual ion sizes used in the molecular simulations, questioning the primitive model’s applicability. This work presents rigorous benchmarks for the use of MSA, DH, and Born theories, along with molecular simulation data for non-primitive model electrolytes. These benchmarks provide insights for refining existing models and advancing the development of new equations of state for electrolyte solutions.},

The combination of a simplified ab initio atomic potential (SAAP) and first order Feynman–Hibbs (FH-1) interactions closely reproduces the VLE phase envelope, providing a good estimate of the critical point. The SAAP + FH-1 combination also improves the prediction of other thermodynamic properties. However, the accurate determination of enthalpy, heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, isochoric pressure coefficient, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient requires the addition of a quantum correction to the kinetic energy (QCKE). The QCKE is a post-simulation contribution to the thermodynamic properties of quantum fluids and, as such, can be used to improve the accuracy of any predictions using an intermolecular potential. The addition of QCKE to the SAAP + FH-1 potential results in values for the thermodynamic properties that are close to reference data for hydrogen at temperatures greater than 40 K and pressures up to 100 MPa.},

To advance the understanding of their melt processing and glass forming ability, we report the atomic structure of molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 over 1770–2630 K, which spans the equilibrium and supercooled liquid regimes. The melt density at T m = 2283 K is 5.50 g cm −3 , measured via silhouette imaging of electrostatically levitated drops over 1010–2420 K. Four separate structure measurements were made with aerodynamically levitated melts using x-ray and neutron diffraction with isotope substitution of Yb ( 172 Yb, 174 Yb, or nat Yb). Empirical potential structure refinement models were developed, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Coordination environments for Al–O are predominantly 4- and 5-coordinate, with a mean coordination of n AlO = 4.43(8), while Yb–O environments mostly range from 5- to 8-coordinate, with n YbO = 6.26(8). The cation–oxygen polyhedra are connected primarily by corner-sharing, with edge-sharing constituting up to ∼1/3 of the connectivity among polyhedra with Yb or higher-coordinated Al–O. Structurally, the –Al–O– network in molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 appears conducive to glass formation: n OAl = 1.85(3), there are 1.86 AlO x –AlO x connections per Al atom (e.g., a mixture of Q 3 and Q 4 units), and the modal ring size is six cations. These characterize a network that is somewhat less constrained compared to SiO 2 glass, yet Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 cannot be quenched into crystal-free glass. Aluminum garnet compositions with larger rare earth cations do form glass, so these characterizations help reveal the structural characteristics corresponding to the limit of glass forming ability in rare earth aluminates.},

To better understand the physics determining the photoswitching performance, a deeper insight into the positions of the relevant potential energy surfaces and the molecular structure of the 5 MC state is needed. We present a structural investigation based on Time Resolved x-ray Solution Scattering (TR-XSS) by which we determine the average d Fe–N bond-length elongation following population of the 5 MC state as well as the lifetime of this state in a series of seven modified [ F e ( t e r p y ) 2 ] 2 + systems in aqueous solution following photo-excitation. The analysis of the TR-XSS data is supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics calculations. The quintet state lifetime is determined to vary by more than a factor of 10 (from 1.5 to 16 ns) based on the electron withdrawing/donating properties of the substituting group.

The kernel structures of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters are constructed by rational spatial packing of Au 3 Ag(2 e ), Au 4 (2 e ), and Au 3 (2 e ) blocks, aligning with the grand unified model of ligand-protected Au nanoclusters.

  abstract     = {The ultrafast excited-state dynamics of the E and Z isomers of a push–pull nitroazobenzene containing an octupolar bis(4′-tert-butylbiphenyl-4-yl)aminophenyl electron donor group were studied with transient absorption (TA) and TA anisotropy. A comprehensive study with two excitation wavelengths and a broadband white-light continuum probe (400–1400 nm) has determined that a torsional isomerization mechanism is the most probable for both isomers. This has shed light on the excited state behavior of the elusive push–pull Z isomer, which has its properties mostly predicted by simulations and systematically lacks experimental observations. Meanwhile, another unproductive relaxation pathway, associated with a symmetric bending motion, was found only for the E isomer. When relaxing through this pathway, the molecule encounters a potential barrier in the ground state, which requires significant structural reorganization before full relaxation. This local minimum can be more general than expected and may be behind unsolved issues in the literature of azobenzenes.},

  abstract     = {An uncertainty-driven active learning strategy was employed to achieve efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. Model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network models, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added to the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. A reference potential energy surface (PES) of the 6-D H 2 O–He system was constructed first by the MLRNet model with a weighted Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.028 cm −1 . The full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method. The current sampling method is reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, where the single precision model achieves a test set RMSE of 0.3253 cm −1 with 472 fitting points and the double precision model is 0.0710 cm −1 with only 613 points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy. However, the MLRNet, with fewer parameters, shows lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles, indicating its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to validate the accuracy of PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES’s results, with only 0.0161 and 0.0044 cm −1 average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the coalescence-induced jumping behavior of moving and stationary droplets at the nanoscale on superhydrophobic surfaces. The results show that the initial velocity of the droplets significantly influences the coalescence time and jumping characteristics. As the initial velocity increases, the coalescence time decreases, and the horizontal velocity increases, suggesting that controlling the initial velocity can adjust droplet motion behavior. In terms of energy conversion, the total energy conversion rate remains relatively constant at lower initial velocities but increases significantly as the velocity rises. This is primarily due to the reduced coalescence time and viscous dissipation caused by the increased initial kinetic energy, allowing more energy to be converted into the kinetic energy of jumping. The energy conversion rate in the horizontal direction increases with initial velocity, while in the vertical direction, it tends to decrease. This study deepens the understanding of coalescence-induced jumping phenomena at the nanoscale and provides a theoretical basis for engineering applications, showing that droplet behavior can be effectively modulated by controlling the initial velocity.},

We compare our theoretical predictions with pump–probe experiments on iodomethane and bromoiodomethane. Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to I ( P 3 / 2 2 ) and I * ( P 1 / 2 2 ) products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump–probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states. By accounting for internal rotation, the kinetic energies of individual fragments in bromoiodomethane align well with experimental results. Furthermore, our theory confirms that two-fragment Coulomb explosion imaging cannot resolve different spin channels in bromoiodomethane photodissociation.},

  abstract     = {Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a stationary background of the so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump–probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton–exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we show both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excited-state dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump–probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and is independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.},

  abstract     = {Area-selective atomic layer deposition (area-selective ALD) has been extensively studied because of its versatility in nanotechnological applications. The priority focus in area-selective ALD is to achieve the desired selectivity; thus, most studies to date have been concentrated on the reaction mechanism of ALD on growth/nongrowth substrates or the development of novel methodologies to resolve the challenges associated with its implementation in high-volume manufacturing. In this study, we performed area-selective ALD of SiO 2 on SiO 2 , where SiO 2 was not grown on SiN x , and suggested area-selective ALD approaches that could simultaneously enhance selectivity and film quality. An NH 3 plasma treatment was applied to functionalize the SiN x surface with more Si–NH bonds, which exhibited low reactivity toward Si precursors. Although the SiO 2 surface was also functionalized with Si–NH bonds, it was not fully converted into Si–NH because of its thermodynamic nature at low temperatures. Consequently, the results showed that NH 3 plasma pretreatment was effective in increasing selectivity. Therefore, we performed a layer-by-layer NH 3 plasma treatment during the ALD of SiO 2 to deposit high-quality films without losing selectivity. The SiO 2 film was densified, as confirmed by x-ray reflection spectra without nitrogen impurity incorporation. Electrical property measurements of metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors confirmed that this approach enabled simultaneous selectivity and SiO 2 film-quality enhancement.},

  abstract     = {Since its introduction almost three decades ago, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has evolved into a mature and powerful technique to reveal the inner workings of quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution. In general, this technique can isolate different contributions to the nonlinear response and provides access to different dynamical quantum pathways of the system evolution. Such isolation of pathways can be achieved in different experimental geometries. In its original, fully noncollinear implementation, directional phase matching allows for such signal isolation, while in the modern commonly employed pump–probe geometry, experimentally challenging phase-cycling schemes are employed. Here, we show how rephasing, non-rephasing, and zero- and double-quantum 2DES signals can be isolated in the pump–probe geometry without a need for phase-cycling. For this, we utilize established causality restrictions of the nonlinear response, allowing us to separate the different contributions in the spectral domain. We demonstrate this using data recorded for a molecular J-aggregate, acting as an effective three-level system. This approach bridges the gap between the capabilities of shaper-based and fully noncollinear 2DES and experimentally simpler implementations, such as those based on birefringent common-path interferometers.},

  abstract     = {It is now well established that the transition state of a chemical reaction is not a single, static structure but rather a distribution of configurations. However, the implications of this distributed nature remain incompletely characterized, particularly for quantum proton and hydride transfer reactions, where variations in donor–acceptor separations at the transition state are key: they can determine whether or not tunneling contributes to the transfer. Consequently, the transition state’s characterization critically depends on the chosen reaction coordinate, and several geometry-based and energy-based coordinates have been proposed for empirical valence bond and hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of such reactions. Here, we systematically evaluate these coordinates, using a general analytic model for proton- and hydride-transfer reactions alongside important aspects of the enzymatic hydride transfer in formate dehydrogenase as a case study. Our analysis reveals significant limitations of common geometry-based and vertical energy gap coordinates, which often fail to isolate environmental effects and can bias the description of transition states. To address these issues, we propose an equilibrium energy difference coordinate that excludes the rapid fluctuations of the transferring quantum proton or hydride, focusing instead on the environment’s polarization. Additionally, we demonstrate that the broad distribution of transition state configurations implies that key reaction properties, such as rate constants and kinetic isotope effects, may not always report on the same subset of transition state configurations. This insight helps resolve some mechanistic ambiguities and highlights the importance of carefully selecting reaction coordinates for simulating reaction dynamics (especially for quantum particle transfers) in enzymatic and condensed-phase chemistry.},

Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighboring spins (the spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique appears ineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights into nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and experimental understanding.},

We find that only one vibrational entropy approximation—the one proposed by Truhlar in 2011—which is used in only ∼2% of cases, is stable in the low-lying frequency region and does not exhibit this problem. Accordingly, this approximation shows the best accuracy and robustness on a diverse set of experimental complexation energies and can be somewhat improved even further.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In Paper I [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in Paper II [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.},

The Holstein–Tavis–Cummings Hamiltonian is used to describe the hybrid light–matter system of N molecules coupled to a single cavity mode. We apply various recently developed trajectory-based methods to simulate the population relaxation dynamics by initially exciting the upper polariton state and benchmark the results against populations computed from exact quantum dynamical propagation using the hierarchical equations of motion approach. In these benchmarks, we have systematically varied the number of molecules N , light–matter detunings, and the light–matter coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that the symmetrical quasi-classical method with γ correction and spin-mapping linearized semi-classical approaches yield more accurate polariton population dynamics than traditional mixed quantum-classical methods, such as the Ehrenfest and surface hopping techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper brings attention back to discussions about the use of equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It argues that, due to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, the justification for using equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium simulations is inherited only by cases in which the perturbation is small enough for the perturbed system to behave like the unperturbed equilibrium system. In the process, this paper categorizes models of external perturbations in molecular dynamics as either responsive—i.e., perturbations that impose a force—or directive—i.e., perturbations that impose a trajectory. Since directive perturbations have not been studied enough in the literature but are becoming more relevant, their effects on simple perturbed thermostatted systems are considered. Finally, using a perturbed two-point harmonic oscillator as well as a driven particle immersed in a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, it gives an approximation for the limit of justified equilibrium thermostat use for perturbed systems. This paper hopes to inspire further research in the fields of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been extensively studied as T 2 contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The theory of nuclear magnetic relaxation induced by superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been validated by numerous experimental studies in the case of spherical particles. Recently, several studies focused on the synthesis of cubic nanoparticles. Some of them reported significantly higher relaxivities compared to their spherical counterpart and attributed this increase to their specific shapes. This work investigates the impact of cube-shaped nanoparticles on nuclear magnetic relaxation through Monte Carlo methods. Transverse relaxation at high static magnetic field is simulated by modeling the proton diffusion in the magnetic field generated by a cubic or a spherical nanoparticle. The results indicate that, in the case of magnetite nanoparticles, there is no significant difference between both shapes for sizes above 30 nm when particles are compared at equal volumes and magnetization. Below this size, a −40%–15% variation of the relaxation rates is predicted for the cubic case compared to the spherical case. These results are explained using general relaxation models that incorporate the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the nanoparticles. The simulation predictions are compared to some experimental results from the literature, revealing that, in some cases, the magnetic field specific to the nanoparticle shape alone cannot explain the observed increase in the relaxation rate of cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {Gas diffusion in graphene nanochannels is pivotal for applications such as gas sensing and membrane separation, where nanoscale confinement introduces unique transport phenomena. Unlike bulk-phases, diffusion in graphene nanochannels is significantly influenced by adsorption, which modifies density distributions and alters diffusivity behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a theoretical framework to comprehensively investigate gas diffusion under varying pressures and channel heights. A modified Chapman–Enskog model, derived from atomistic Lennard-Jones potential parameters, is proposed to account for the effects of confinement. Simulation results reveal that gas diffusivity decreases with increasing gas-phase pressure and decreasing channel height due to enhanced density in the nanochannels. Interestingly, for ultra-narrow channels ( h ≲ 0.7 nm), the diffusivity correction factor exhibits non-monotonic behavior, initially decreasing but subsequently increasing due to overlapping repulsive potential fields. The proposed model integrates adsorption effects through density predictions based on the Boltzmann distribution and effectively predicts gas diffusivities with relative errors of less than 13%, even under strong confinement. These findings highlight the critical interplay between adsorption and confinement in shaping gas transport within graphene nanochannels. The theoretical model provides a predictive tool for designing graphene-based gas separation and sensing devices, offering fundamental insights for optimizing their performance.},

  abstract     = {Energy transfer processes are ubiquitous in nature and intensely investigated. The investigations concentrate on the transfer of small to intermediate sized energies. Here, we pose the question of whether the transfer of large energies, where relativistic effects play a central role, can be efficient. At large energies, the process leads to ionization of the environment, i.e., it is the interatomic (or intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) process. To that end, we derive asymptotic expressions for the ICD amplitude by employing the Dirac–Breit Hamiltonian and expanding the frequency dependent Coulomb–Breit interaction between the electrons of the donor and those of the acceptor in powers of the inverse distance between their centers of mass. Expressions are separately derived for the two popular Feynman and Coulomb gauges. At long range, the two expressions have a different appearance but are proven to be equivalent. The derived energy transfer rate at long range shows that when the donor is embedded in an environment, the transfer can be highly efficient. A key is that the radiative lifetime of the donor is extremely short (it can be in the attosecond, 10 −18 s, regime), and the x-ray emission typically dominates by far Auger decay (also called Auger–Meitner decay), and the ICD can quench this emission. This contrasts with the situation at small to intermediate sized energies, where the radiative lifetime is much smaller and Auger decay (if the channel is open) dominates. In these cases, the major contribution to ICD comes from the neighbors nearby.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl 3 in water.},

Among these, we highlight I ND max ⁠ , which offers an easy interpretation: it captures the largest deviation of a natural orbital occupancy from the boundary values corresponding to a single-reference wave function.

  abstract     = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell–Schrödinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. In addition, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach—an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.},

  abstract     = {Introducing heavy atoms, or replacing atoms with heavier ones, is a routine approach for accelerating spin-flipping photophysical processes. However, predicting its impact on phosphorescence efficiency is not straightforward. Herein, we report an unexpected consequence of bromine-to-iodine substitution in a bromothienyl diketone derivative, TIPS-BrTn , that exhibits outstanding room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in cyclohexane solution. Contrary to our expectation, the iodo-congener TIPS-ITn exhibited feeble photoluminescence, which we confirmed as RTP by ultrafast spectroscopy. Further experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, in the T 1 state, an excited-state symmetry breaking occurred on TIPS-ITn while TIPS-BrTn preserved the centrosymmetric geometry. We identified the driving force for the symmetry breaking as an intramolecular two-center three-electron bonding interaction between iodine and carbonyl oxygen in the (n,π*) excited state. Consequently, while the direct T 1 –S 0 spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in TIPS-BrTn is symmetry-forbidden and zero, that of TIPS-ITn is non-zero due to the loss of centrosymmetry, thereby accelerating nonradiative T 1 –S 0 decay to diminish the RTP. Importantly, the phosphorescence rate constant is not solely dictated by the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC; instead, it can be rationalized by the intensity borrowing from higher singlet states. Thus, our work highlights the importance of controlling molecular symmetry, which could suppress the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC and lead to a preferential acceleration of radiative decay over nonradiative decay for achieving efficient RTP.},

In this perspective article, we discuss common notions, recent results, and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of ν −1/2 appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. In addition, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic ν −1/2 behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape toward higher temperatures.},

The use of two strategies of spin labeling of mRNAs allowed us to study for the first time the effect of the structure and location of spin labels on the measured interspin distances in human ribosome complexes. Experiments using dipolar EPR spectroscopy, supported by molecular dynamics calculations, demonstrated that labels introduced at nucleotide bases provide a higher resolution between mRNA conformations in the ribosome mRNA channel, compared to labels introduced at the ribose-phosphate backbone. Although ribose-phosphate labeling turned out to be less informative on its own for studying mRNA conformations in the ribosome than the previously used base labeling, it can find application in other complex studies of the structure of RNAs and their complexes.},

  abstract     = {The elasticity of phospholipid membranes as a function of hydration was investigated using coarse-grained molecular simulations. Multilamellar membranes consist of two or more lipid bilayers separated by a thin layer of water, a system commonly found in cell membranes that provides surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs and on cartilaginous surfaces of synovial joints. The objective was to quantify the response of such systems to compression in the direction perpendicular to the membranes as a function of the amount of water between the bilayers or hydration of the system. The present study investigated a variety of phospholipids with six levels of hydration found in multilamellar bilayers in biological systems. Our simulations support the existence of a universal behavior of the increase in surface area per lipid as a function of the normal pressure difference, the difference between the pressure applied in the direction normal to the membrane and the pressure applied in the directions parallel to the membrane. Normalizing the surface area per lipid and the pressure difference by their respective values at rupture yields a composite function of two linear regimes for all the hydration levels under investigation. Where possible, a physics-based interpretation of the normalization scales was provided. Although some parameters of the model are determined empirically, the model represents a promising step in continuum modeling of the response of multilamellar lipid membranes as a function of mechanical stress and hydration.},

We use confocal microscopy to measure the contact angles of model condensates formed by intrinsically disordered protein Ddx4 N . We show the importance of taking optical aberrations into account, as these impact apparent contact angle measurements. Ddx4 N condensates are seen to partially dry (contact angles above 90°) a model membrane, with little dependence on the magnitude of charge on, or tyrosine content of, Ddx4 N . Further contact angle measurements on surfaces of varying hydrophilicity reveal a preference of Ddx4 N condensates for hydrophobic surfaces, suggesting an intrinsic repulsion between protein condensates and hydrophilic membrane surfaces. This observation is in line with previous studies relating protein adsorption to surface hydrophilicity. Our work advances the understanding of the molecular details governing the localization of biomolecular condensates.},

A large number of ordered structures, including smectic phases, simple and giant polygons, are obtained as solutions of the SCFT equations. Phase diagrams of XLCMs as a function of the total length and asymmetric ratio of the side chains are constructed. For XLCMs with symmetric side blocks, the theoretically predicted phase transition sequence is in good agreement with experiments. For XLCMs with a fixed total side chain length, transitions between layered structure to polygonal phases, as well as between different polygonal phases, could be induced by varying the asymmetry of the side chains.

A notable variation in the molar ratio of bidentate to bridging binding types of COO − groups that bind to Ca 2+ was first identified between the two crystal forms by linear IR spectroscopy. This variation is accompanied by greater local structural rigidity of the α-crystal compared to that of the ξ-crystal, as evidenced by a greater residual amplitude in the spectral diffusion dynamics extracted from the time-dependent 2D IR spectroscopy. Vibrational energy transfer between the bidentate and tridentate COO − groups in the α-crystal was found to be faster than that in the ξ-crystal, suggesting shorter intermolecular distances between EXP3174 and sacubitril in the former.

We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize the dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.},

To address this problem, this study pioneers the application of deep operator networks to effectively model the time-dependent piezoionic effect. By leveraging a data-driven approach, our model significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional finite element analysis (FEA). In particular, we trained a DeepONet using a comprehensive dataset generated through FEA calibrated to experimental data. Through rigorous testing with step responses, slow-changing forces, and dynamic-changing forces, we show that the model captures the intricate temporal dynamics of the piezoionic effect in both the horizontal and vertical planes. This capability offers a powerful tool for real-time analysis of piezoionic phenomena, contributing to simplifying the design of tactile interfaces and potentially complementing existing tactile imaging technologies.},

  abstract     = {Condensed phase explosives typically contain defects such as voids, bubbles, and pores; this heterogeneity facilitates the formation of hot spots and triggers decomposition reaction at low densities. The study of the thermal decomposition mechanisms of explosives at different densities has thus attracted considerable research interest. Gaining a deeper insight into these mechanisms would be helpful for elucidating the detonation processes of explosives. In this work, we developed an ab initio neural network potential for the FOX-7 system using machine learning method. Extensive large-scale (1008 atoms) and long-duration (nanosecond timescale) deep potential molecular dynamics simulations at different densities were performed to investigate the effect of the density on the thermal decomposition mechanism. The results indicate that the initial reaction pathway of the FOX-7 explosives is the cleavage of the C–NO 2 bond at different densities, while the frequency of C–NO 2 bond cleavage decreases at higher density. Increasing the initial density of FOX-7 significantly increases the reaction rate during the initial decomposition and the formation of final products. However, it leads to a decrease in released heat and has minimal impact on the decomposition temperature. In addition, by analyzing the molecular dynamics trajectories and conducting quantum chemical calculations, we identified two lower-barrier production pathways to produce the CO 2 and N 2 .},

  abstract     = {The most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently developed using antisolvent-based fabrication technology. Despite extensive analysis of various aspects of the antisolvent method—such as the type of antisolvent, dropping time, and precursor compatibility—some antisolvents still produce uneven film surface morphology on centimeter-scale substrates. The decoupling of the relationship between local structural characteristics, such as grain boundaries and defects, and the optoelectronic performance of PSCs is currently one of the most highly regarded research issues in the field. In this study, we utilized high-resolution white light interferometry to characterize the morphological distributions of perovskite films from the center to edge, using anisole as an example of the antisolvent. We observed that macro cracks at the center of the film typically exhibit dense ridge morphology, while cracks toward the edges display a concave morphology. We analyze the stress mechanism by using EDS mapping and AFM in detail, attributing this phenomenon to the competitive attachment of 2D islands and boundaries for adatoms, which are influenced by changes in grain size. The devices at different locations were fabricated and their performance analyzed. Our findings indicate that these protruding cracks do not significantly affect the current and voltage of the photovoltaic device; however, concave cracks lead to a decrease in the device fill factor. We attribute this decrease to enhanced carrier recombination at the interface due to this morphology. This study provides valuable insights into the formation of perovskite film morphology under antisolvent treatment and the relationship between film local morphology and PSCs performance.},

  abstract     = {The traditional Gouy–Chapman–Stern theory has been effective in explaining the behavior of dilute electrolytes in the electrical double layer but falls short when it comes to describing how ions behave at the metal/electrolyte interface. This is because it overlooks key factors such as the molecular structure of water at the interface and the effects of electron screening in the metal. To address these gaps, we revisit ion adsorption at the metal/electrolyte interface. The approach combines the method of images with a field-theoretic framework for dilute electrolytes and metals described by the Thomas–Fermi model. Nonlocal polarization correlations in water are described by a first-order gradient expansion in the Landau free energy functional. Unlike earlier approaches that relied on the “specular reflection approximation,” our method provides a less constrained way to handle the complex electrostatic boundary conditions at the interface. Analyzing the behavior of a test charge near the interface, an electrostatic energy minimum is found. This minimum depends on the metal’s screening properties and the overall potential drop across the double layer. In addition, the alignment of water dipoles at the interface creates an asymmetry in the energy experienced by positively and negatively charged ions. Finally, we derived an expression for the electrosorption isotherm by describing both the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the lateral interactions between charges along the interface. Our findings highlight how the structure of interfacial water can drive processes such as underpotential deposition by creating favorable electrostatic conditions for ion adsorption.},

The solid state route is adopted to prepare these dilute weight% ( x = 1, 3, and 5) ferrite based composites. The incorporation of ferrite phase improves the interfacial tensile strain and grain boundary volume fraction in the said composite. The incommensurate to commensurate magnetic transition (T N2 ) of YBaCuFeO 5 is shifted to a high temperature by 10 K with the lowest concentration and indistinguishable in higher concentrations due to the magnetic dominance of ferrites. The irreversibility of magnetization due to the field history mostly stems from the uncompensated spins and a competitive interaction among the magnetic phases at the interface. The magnetic isotherms show unusual negative exchange bias phenomena in the said system, and a large room temperature spontaneous exchange bias (∼1 kOe) is achieved with a dilute incorporation x = 5. The exchange bias field and coercive fields (H C ) are, however, contrary to each other with temperature (and concentration) explained with a schematic model on the basis of dominating irreversible spins at high temperatures. In a field of ±50 kOe, the exchange bias field is dropped, while H C is increased, which might be due to the dominance of Zeeman energy over the uniaxial anisotropy. The non-collinear magnetic phase transition of YBaCuFeO 5 at T ≤ 175 K plays a pivotal role in reducing the exchange bias compared to its collinear phase (300 K). Moreover, the extent of this bias field (∼1 kOe) can be considered a useful component in efficient device fabrication.},

We find that the hopping-site energy distributions inferred from the amorphous structures deviate from the Gaussian distribution, especially in their low-energy tails. Mostly for this reason, the effect of disorder on charge-carrier mobility is much weaker than predicted by the lattice/Gaussian models and dependent on system density. The lattice models of electron–hole recombination in disordered systems, which assume a Gaussian site energy distribution, are found to be more accurate than those of charge-carrier transport. This is explained by the strong Coulomb trapping of electron–hole pairs before recombination, which makes the role of hopping-site energy disorder less significant.},

Validation of this relation was structured at different levels, taking into account various ingredients as the apolar–polar character, macromolecular structure, the presence of hydrogen bonds, or complex structure and dynamics. The results reclaim the suitability of dielectric spectroscopy to echo the primary structural relaxation of glass-forming systems, demonstrating that the dielectric response effectively captures the structural relaxation by reliably correlating with entropy fluctuations. The correlation with entropy fluctuations holds even when the dielectric strength of the systems is high and the dielectric response is narrow and dominated by cross correlations, proving that dipolar intermolecular interactions are fundamental to the structural relaxation and not a particularity of the dielectric probe. This one-to-one correspondence between structural and dielectric α relaxation does not support the existence of a generic spectral shape for the primary structural relaxation valid for all kinds of susceptibility functions.},

We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant ɛ 0 with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in ɛ 0 is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in ɛ 0 , our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor G K with increasing pressure. This decrease in G K is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.},

The effect of the central ring on the overall network topology is analyzed in terms of both topological and geometric distances. For larger central rings, the first topological shell becomes exclusively populated by four- and five-membered rings, which leads to an effective upper limit on the size of the central ring that can effectively be accommodated. The topological shells are found to show ordering at significant distances away from the central ring. The effective correlation lengths are determined as a function of both central ring size and level of network disorder, which allows for an understanding of the potential density of large rings that may be accommodated.},

The secondary structure of a protein, lysozyme, follows a non-monotonous behavior in aqueous glyceline (choline chloride + glycerol) as the wt. % of water is increased. However, it is unclear how the hydration affects the stability of the protein in a non-linear way. In this work, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamic simulations for 1 μ s with the lysozyme protein in an aqueous glyceline deep eutectic solvent (DES) by varying the wt. % of water. The simulated radius of gyration, R g , values can qualitatively reproduce the protein behavior such that the R g increases initially with an increase in wt. % of water, reaches the peak at 40 wt. %, and then gradually decreases with dilution. Several other properties, including root mean square deviation, root-mean square fluctuation, secondary structure of the protein, and solvent accessible surface area, are examined to explore the NADES effect on the protein structure. Next, we analyze the hydrogen bond profile of intra-protein and among various interspecies, e.g., protein–DES, DES–DES, protein–water, and water–water. The variation in protein–protein hydrogen bonds with concentrations can qualitatively explain the non-linear conformational dependence of the protein. The radial distribution function analyses show various microscopic structures formed due to the DES and water interaction, which play a critical role in protein behavior. This study indicates that at lower wt. % of water, the protein is constrained in a strong hydrogen bond network formed by glycerol and water molecules, resulting in a lower R g . As the wt. % of water increases, the protein–water interaction drives the protein to expand, reflecting an increasing R g . At sufficiently higher wt. % of water, the DES constituent and the water molecules interact strongly with the protein, resulting in a decrease in R g . Overall, the investigation offers a microscopic insight into the protein conformation in DES.},

The model provides unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds that are locally unstable, which give rise to quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations.

  abstract     = {The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach’s inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of “experimental facts” through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N 2 , CS 2 , Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.},

To understand this unusual feature, we have measured the responses to high amplitude ac and dc electric fields at the fundamental frequency. The static limits of these results are entered into a model aimed at reproducing nonlinear dielectric susceptibility spectra using the concept of a fictive electric field. This model reproduces the “hump” in the third-harmonic response and its seeming disappearance. It is revealed that the “hump” is predominantly the result of reduced time constants, a consequence of the energy the sample absorbs from the electric field. At elevated temperatures, the “hump” only appears to vanish because its reduced amplitude submerges below the extraordinarily high level of polarization saturation of this liquid.},

  abstract     = {This study delves into the fragmentation mechanisms of the oxazolone form (OXA) of protonated cyclo-di-glycine using chemical dynamics simulations at multiple internal energies. While we focus our in-depth analyses on a representative total energy of 178 kcal/mol, we also performed simulations over the 127–187 kcal/mol range. This broader energy sampling reveals how the population of states evolves with increasing internal energy, enabling us to compute rate constants and then effective energy thresholds using a previously introduced three-state model [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. By transforming molecular geometries into graph representations, we systematically analyze fragmentation processes and identify key intermediates and ion–molecule complexes (IMCs) that play a crucial role in fragmentation dynamics. The study highlights the distinct isomerization landscapes of OXA, driven by IMC formation, which contrasts with the previously reported behavior of cyclic and linear forms [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. The resulting fragmentation channels are characterized by their unique energetic thresholds and branching ratios and can provide a molecular explanation of what was observed experimentally. Thanks to an accurate analysis of the trajectories using our graph-theory-based tools, it was possible to point out the particular behavior of OXA fragmentation, which is different from other isomers. In particular, the important role of IMCs is shown, which has an impact on populating different isomeric structures.},

Eight rotationally resolved excitation spectra were observed in 17 800–23 650 cm −1 , allowing the determination of the vibrational frequencies and rotational constants for the ground and five highly excited electronic states. Six low-energy Ω states below 3500 cm −1 were identified from the SVL emission spectra and assigned to six spin–orbit components of the X 3 Σ − and A 3 Π electronic states. Furthermore, high-level ab initio calculations were performed on numerous Λ − S and Ω electronic states to support the assignments from the experimental observations. The spectral results elucidate the bonding characteristics of PdO and provide support for verifying the significant relativistic effect on the bonding of PtO.},

The AIMD simulations visually demonstrate that CO 2 3 + undergoes several bending vibrations in ∼50–480 fs, and in the final dissociation stages, the electron density distribution in three-dimensional space migrates from the O ion to the C ion, while the bond strength rapidly decreases to 0, resulting in bond breaking assisted by the asymmetric stretching vibrations. The measured kinetic energy releases are in general agreement with AIMD simulations, and the deduced amount of energy transfer into the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom of CO 2+ is about 3 eV less than that estimated by the Coulomb potential.},

Then, the templating synthon approach is used to improve the accuracy of structures optimized by a hybrid density functional paired with a double zeta basis set, leveraging chemical similarity to cluster different molecular environments and refine bond lengths and valence angles. A set of prototypical biomolecular building blocks is used to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve spectroscopic accuracy for molecular systems too large to be treated by state-of-the-art composite wavefunction methods. In addition, a freely accessible web-based tool has been developed to facilitate the post-processing of geometries optimized using standard electronic structure codes, thereby providing an accurate and efficient tool for the computational study of medium- to large-sized molecules, also accessible to experiment-oriented researchers.},

The barriers between equivalent C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) global minimum structures for C H 4 + are found to be low, and thus C H 4 + undergoes rapid interconversion along cyclic exchange of three hydrogen atoms via C s transition state. The general features of the ground state PESs of SiH 4 + and GeH 4 + are similar.

Such data are important ingredients in the modeling of non-local thermal equilibrium conditions that characterize the atmosphere, media of astronomical interest, and cold and hot plasmas, where O( 1 D), also formed when O 2 molecules break, represents a significant fraction of the gas mixture. To this end, we developed analytical potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the 1 Π and 1 Δ electronic states of the N 2 –O( 1 D) system to accurately describe the interaction in the long, medium, and first repulsive range of intermolecular distances, the most effective regions in inelastic collisions under a variety of conditions of interest. The derived PESs are used to calculate the vibration-to-translation (V–T) and vibration-to-electronic (V–E) energy transfer rates by mixed quantum–classical dynamics and by the Landau–Zener formulation, respectively. In addition, the datasets are extended to cover the entire N 2 vibrational ladder by using the Gaussian process regression. The results show that at low temperatures, where V–E relaxation dominates, N 2 vibrational quenching by O( 1 D) collisions is faster than by O( 3 P) collisions.},

While charged closed-shell transition metal complexes aggregating spontaneously to form oligomers has long been observed experimentally, the interpretation of the nature of so-called metallophilicity is still ongoing. For the dimer [(2,2′-bpy) 2 Ag] 2 2+ , qualitative electrostatic potential, non-covalent interaction, atoms-in-molecules analyses, and quantitative energy decomposition analysis calculations indicate that the electrostatic repulsion between two like formal charges at silver centers can be overcome by long-range dispersion attraction and short-range electronic correlation from ligands. In addition, delocalizing the net charges on silvers over the whole ligands can decrease electrostatic repulsion of metal centers to stabilize oligomers. The vital role of the screening effect of solvent has also been realized in the bound binding of the title system. Overall, this research highlights the importance of ligand stacking to argentophilicity, while d 10 –d 10 attraction of silver centers presents quite little contribution.},

We show that vicinal hyperconjugation between the orbitals in the C–H bonds and in the oxygen atom is responsible for this puzzling conformational preference. The transition state for the rotation yields an ≈ 0.6 kcal/mol rotational barrier, which matches the thermal energy at room conditions and, therefore, renders the O–H bond a free rotor.

The binary cluster features a linear B 3 chain along its C 3 axis, as well as three lateral Zn–Zn dimers, in which a central B atom is sandwiched by two quasi-planar BZn 3 units in an eclipsed form. Chemical bonding analyses show that the B 3 chain motif has Lewis-type B–B σ single bonds and a pair of orthogonal three-center two-electron (3c-2e) π bonds, collectively leading to a B–B bond order of two. Stabilizing a boron single chain is scarce in the literature, as is observing a series of double B=B bonds in a monoatomic chain fashion. The triangular pyramid BZn 3 units are each in a unique triplet σ 2 σ* 1 σ* 1 configuration, thus rendering σ aromaticity to the cluster according to the reversed 4 n Hückel rule. It is proposed that the alloy cluster can be rationalized using the concept of electronic transmutation, wherein a close chemical analogy to the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) molecule is established.},

The experimental investigation is carried out by means of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on MV radical cations. The EPR spectra, recorded in a series of solvents at different temperatures, were adequately simulated using a multiple-site random jump model implemented in a software routine, providing the intramolecular charge transfer rate as the output. The dependence of the free energy of the electron transfer process on the solvent allowed us to identify a correlation between the energetic of the charge transfer and some solvent properties.},

  abstract     = {Metal-doped silicon clusters have been extensively studied due to their promising applications in the semiconductor industry and microelectronics. In this study, indium-doped silicon clusters (InSi n −/0 , n = 3–11) were investigated using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations. It is found that InSi n − anions exhibit geometrical and electronic structures resembling their Si n+1 counterparts, with the substitution of one silicon atom by an indium atom leading to exohedral doping and multiple coordination characteristics. The exohedral configuration is attributed to a weak In–Si bond and the limited atomic valence of indium, while the multiple coordination arises from the joint contributions of three orthogonal 5 p orbitals of indium atom. Electronic structure similarities between InSi n − anions and Si n+1 clusters are confirmed by their identical valence molecular orbitals. The valence p -type orbitals of InSi n − primarily contribute to chemical bonding, whereas the valence s -type orbitals predominantly hold electron lone pairs, as demonstrated by the electron localization function and localized molecular orbital analysis. These results provide insights into the structural and electronic properties of indium-doped silicon clusters.},

  abstract     = {Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flips, and magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange–correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn–Sham (KS) and generalized KS (GKS) orbitals, the KS potentials, and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze seven standard exchange–correlation functionals and find two main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, as well as the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential, when using the optimized effective potential method within the KS scheme. When calculations are performed using the GKS approach, no jumps are observed, as expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that for high-spin systems, a full three-dimensional treatment is crucial; the spherical approximation commonly used in atoms causes a qualitative deviation. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.},

The porphyrins contain central elements from three distinct groups in the Periodic Table with different oxidation states, types, and numbers of axial ligands, as well as different peripheral substituents on the porphyrin ring. Shortly after photoexcitation, in all cases, the primary multiplet polarization of the porphyrin triplet state evolves into long-lived net polarization whose lifetime is determined by the lifetime of the triplet state. The zero-field splitting parameters and sign of the multiplet polarization vary significantly among the porphyrins, but the transient EPR spectra taken at later times are remarkably similar. The development of long-lived net polarization is proposed to involve the dynamic Jahn–Teller effect, in which hopping between the two lowest triplet states occurs.},

Recently, the pursuit of this goal has been aided by machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which provide energies and forces at quantum mechanical accuracy but at a fraction of the cost of the reference quantum mechanical calculations. Assembling the training set of relevant configurations is key to building the MLIP. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to training reactive MLIPs based on reaction pathway information. One approach exploits reaction datasets containing reactant, product, and transition state structures. Using an S N 2 reaction dataset, we accurately locate reaction pathways and transition state geometries of up to 170 unseen reactions. In another approach, which does not depend on data availability, we present an efficient active learning procedure that yields an accurate MLIP and converged minimum energy path given only the reaction end point structures, avoiding quantum mechanics driven reaction pathway search at any stage of training set construction. We demonstrate this procedure on an S N 2 reaction in the gas phase and with a small number of solvating water molecules, predicting reaction barriers within 20 meV of the reference quantum chemistry method. We then apply the active learning procedure on a more complex reaction involving a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and proton transfer, comparing the results against the reactive ReaxFF force field. Our active learning procedure, in addition to rapidly finding reaction paths for individual reactions, provides an approach to building large reaction path databases for training transferable reactive machine learning potentials.},

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: neural spline flows, conditional flow matching, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) neural spline flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) conditional flow matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) denoising diffusion probabilistic models appear the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib 9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.},

Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations, while traditional potentials provide a less precise but computationally much faster representation and, thus, allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential into a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large, complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but, in principle, a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces with a precision of 10 me V/Å and the ACE-energy exactly for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 × 10 6 atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.},

While significant effort has been made in this field over the last decade, data-driven approaches generally rely on the paradigm of imposing a fixed base of library functions. In order to promote sparsity, finding the optimal set of basis functions is a necessary condition but a challenging task to guess in advance. Here, we propose an alternative approach that consists of optimizing the very library of functions while imposing sparsity. The robustness of our results is not only evaluated by the quality of the fit of the discovered model but also by the statistical distribution of the residuals with respect to the original noise in the data. In order to avoid choosing one metric over the other, we would rather rely on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for systematically generating a subset of optimal models sorted in a Pareto front.

  abstract     = {Quantum computing is finding increasingly more applications in quantum chemistry, particularly to simulate electronic structure and molecular properties of simple systems. The transformation of a molecular Hamiltonian from the fermionic space to the qubit space results in a series of Pauli strings. Calculating the energy then involves evaluating the expectation values of each of these strings, which presents a significant bottleneck for applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) in quantum chemistry. Unlike fermionic Hamiltonians, the terms in a qubit Hamiltonian are additive. This work leverages this property to introduce a novel method for extracting information from the partial qubit Hamiltonian, thereby enhancing the efficiency of VQEs. This work introduces the SHARC-VQE (Simplified Hamiltonian Approximation, Refinement, and Correction-VQE) method, where the full molecular Hamiltonian is partitioned into two parts based on the ease of quantum execution. The easy-to-execute part constitutes the partial Hamiltonian, and the remaining part, while more complex to execute, is generally less significant. The latter is approximated by a refined operator and added up as a correction into the partial Hamiltonian. SHARC-VQE significantly reduces computational costs for molecular simulations. The cost of a single energy measurement can be reduced from O ( N 4 ϵ 2 ) to O ( 1 ϵ 2 ) for a system of N qubits and accuracy ϵ , while the overall cost of VQE can be reduced from O ( N 7 ϵ 2 ) to O ( N 3 ϵ 2 ) ⁠ . Furthermore, measurement outcomes using SHARC-VQE are less prone to errors induced by noise from quantum circuits, reducing the errors from 20%–40% to 5%–10% without any additional error correction or mitigation technique. In addition, the SHARC-VQE is demonstrated as an initialization technique, where the simplified partial Hamiltonian is used to identify an optimal starting point for a complex problem. Overall, this method improves the efficiency of VQEs and enhances the accuracy and reliability of quantum simulations by mitigating noise and overcoming computational challenges.},

From the theoretical perspective, the energy landscape theory from protein folding inspired the development of the minimal chromatin model (MiChroM). In this work, two biologically relevant MiChroM energy terms were minimized under different conditions, revealing a competition between loci compartmentalization and motor-driven activity mechanisms in chromatin folding. Enhancing the motor activity energy baseline increased the lengthwise compaction and reduced the polymer entanglement. Concomitantly, decreasing compartmentalization-related interactions reduced the overall polymer collapse, although compartmentalization given by the microphase separation remained almost intact. For multiple chromosome simulations, increased motorization intensified the territory formation of the different chains and reduced compartmentalization strength lowered the probability of contact formation of different loci between multiple chains, approximating to the experimental inter-contacts of the human chromosomes. These findings have direct implications for experimental data-driven chromosome modeling, specially those involving multiple chromosomes. The interplay between phase-separation and territory formation mechanisms should be properly implemented in order to recover the genome architecture and dynamics, features that might play critical roles in regulating nuclear functions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of complex biomolecules requires simplified models that not only make computations feasible but also reveal fundamental mechanisms. Coarse-graining (CG) achieves this by grouping atoms into beads, whose stochastic dynamics can be derived using the Mori–Zwanzig formalism, capturing both reversible and irreversible interactions. In liquid, the dissipative bead–bead interactions have so far been restricted to hydrodynamic couplings. However, friction does not only arise from the solvent but, notably, from the internal degrees of freedom missing in the CG beads. This leads to an additional “internal friction” whose relevance is studied in this contribution. By comparing with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), we neatly show that in order to accurately reproduce the dynamics of a globular protein in water using a CG model, not only a precise determination of elastic couplings and the Stokesian self-friction of each bead is required. Critically, the inclusion of internal friction between beads is also necessary for a faithful representation of protein dynamics. We propose to optimize the parameters of the CG model through a self-averaging method that integrates the CG dynamics with an evolution equation for the CG parameters. This approach ensures that selected quantities, such as the radial distribution function and the time correlation of bead velocities, match the corresponding MD values.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have examined photoprotective mechanisms in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, showing that exciton transfer pathways change significantly depending on the environmental redox conditions. Higgins et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 118 (11), e2018240118 (2021)] have theoretically linked these observations to changes in a quantum vibronic coupling, whereby onsite energies are altered under oxidizing conditions such that exciton energy gaps are detuned from a specific vibrational motion of the bacteriochlorophyll a . These arguments rely on an analysis of exciton transfer rates within Redfield theory, which is known to provide an inaccurate description of the influence of the vibrational environment on the exciton dynamics in the FMO complex. Here, we use a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion to obtain non-perturbative estimations of exciton transfer rates, which yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone do not reproduce the reported rate changes in the oxidative environment. We systematically examine a model that includes combined changes in both site energies and the frequency of a local vibration in the oxidized complex while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra and achieving qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the measured changes in transfer rates. Our analysis points to potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to perturbative theories. Overall, our work suggests that further experimental and theoretical analyses may be needed to understand the variations of exciton dynamics under different redox conditions.},

  abstract     = {This work presents local hybrid alternatives to the orbital density approximation employed in self-interaction corrected density functional theory (SIC-DFT) and extended for use in DFT-corrected correlated wavefunction approaches (CAS-DFT). When combined with standard approximate density functionals, the orbital density approximation leaves SIC-DFT energies strongly dependent on unitary transforms among occupied orbitals and leaves CAS-DFT energies overbound. The alternatives presented here reduce both errors. The orbital density approximation and the local hybrid alternatives are shown to approximate an underlying nondiagonal exchange–correlation hole. A preliminary extension is presented to active–virtual correlation. These results motivate exploration of local hybrid concepts in SIC-DFT and CAS-DFT.},

  abstract     = {In light of the recent discrepancies reported between fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo and local natural orbital coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large molecular systems [Al-Hamdani et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 , 3927 (2021)], the applicability of CCSD(T) is assessed using a model framework. The use of the semi-empirical π -space only Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) model for studying large molecules is critically examined and is shown to recover both bandgap closure as system size increases and long range dispersive behavior of r −6 with increasing separation between monomers. Since bandgap closure in systems with long-range Coulomb interactions is problematic for perturbative methods, such as CCSD(T), this model, therefore, serves as a testing ground for such methods, enabling them to be benchmarked with high-order CC methods, which are not possible with ab initio Hamiltonians. Using the PPP model, coupled cluster methodologies, CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q), are then used to benchmark CCSDT and CCSD(T) methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large one- and two-dimensional molecular systems up to the dibenzocoronene dimer. We show that CCSD(T) demonstrates no signs of overestimating the interaction energy for these systems. Furthermore, by examining the Hartree–Fock HOMO–LUMO gap of these large molecules, the perturbative treatment of the triples contribution in CCSD(T) is not expected to cause problems for accurately capturing the interaction energy for system sizes up to at least circumcoronene.},

Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a δ -function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for the exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. In addition, we present simulation results that replicate previously reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signals, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneities.},

Unlike diffusion-driven approaches, our method directly enforces mass removal at the fluid interface in a reaction-limited manner while maintaining numerical stability. Using the inherent color-gradient magnitude and a single adjustable parameter, evaporation sites are chosen in a computationally efficient way with seamless mass exchange between the components, with no change to the core algorithm. Extensive validation across diverse interface geometries and evaporation flux magnitudes demonstrates high accuracy, with errors below 5% for unit density ratios. For density contrasts, the method remains robust in the limit of smaller evaporation flux magnitudes and density ratios. Our approach extends the applicability of the color-gradient LB model to scenarios involving reaction-limited evaporation, such as droplet evaporation on heated substrates, vacuum evaporation of molten metals, and drying processes in porous media.},

The structure of the state space could be quite complicated for quantum many-body systems, and the systematic decomposition of the state space is normally involved. Recently, a modular tensor diagram approach was proposed to reorganize the state space hierarchically based on a modular basis. Here, we review the construction of spin eigenfunctions for multiple exciton systems and further develop modular tensor diagrams to exemplify the hierarchical symmetry of the state space. The newly constructed spin eigenfunctions for quadruple excitons, along with the results for triple excitons, are used to demonstrate the effective decomposition of the state space into hierarchical tensorial structures. A universal recursive relation is derived to determine the coefficients of spin eigenfunctions exhibiting transformation symmetry between different classes of elementary modules for an arbitrary number of exciton units. Interestingly, different coupling schemes mapped to quantum many-body interactions lead to different spin adapted basis states, which may correspond to different realistic systems upon the breakdown of spin degeneracy. This work highlights the hierarchical symmetry of the tensorial structure of quantum many-body systems, which may facilitate a better understanding of the structure property relationship toward the object-oriented materials design.},

Femtosecond time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy was employed to study the molecular dynamics of N 2 and O 2 in air at room temperature. To reveal hidden spectral features, we have for the first time applied an analytical method that balances time resolution and frequency resolution, namely, the superlet transform (SLT), to perform time-frequency resolved spectral analysis of the complex molecular dynamics of N 2 and O 2 in air. A distinct evolution of the partial rotational modes of N 2 and O 2 outside the selective excitation region was observed, which is related to energy transfer collisions between N 2 and O 2 molecules during the rotational energy relaxation process in air. The SLT results accord well with the S-branch rotational spectra of N 2 and O 2 obtained from theoretical calculations, confirming the validity of SLT analysis. This method provides a valuable experimental analysis technique to deepen the understanding of the microscopic dynamic processes in molecular dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high-ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for the path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used for simulation of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium correlation functions and is demonstrated here using examples from both. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators, which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.},

Currently, the implicit solvent model is widely used to calculate solvation energies of biomolecules such as proteins. However, for proteins, the implicit solvent calculation does not provide much detailed information since a protein is highly inhomogeneous on its surface. In this study, we develop an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which allows us to investigate detailed site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, including the role of counter ions and intra-protein interactions. This approach facilitates the analysis of specific residue interactions with solvent molecules, extending the understanding of protein solubility to the energetic impacts of site-specific residue–solvent interactions. Our study showed that specific residue–solvent interactions are strongly influenced by the electrostatic environment created by its nearby residues, especially charged residues. In particular, charged residues on the protein surface are mainly responsible for the heterogeneity of the electrostatic environment of the protein surface, and they significantly affect the local distribution of water. In addition, counter ions change the local electrostatic environment and alter specific residue–water interactions. Neutral residues also interact with water, with polar residues being more prominent than nonpolar ones but contributing less to solvation energy than charged residues. This study illustrates an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which gives residue-specific contributions to protein solvation and provides detailed information on site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.},

These modifications give a continuous “modified” action over the whole energy range. The multidimensional versions of the mVPT2 and mYF theories have been applied to the collinear H + H 2 and D + H 2 reactions to calculate thermal reaction rates. The results show that the rates computed using the mVPT2 theory are marginally better than those computed by the mYF theory. The corresponding kinetic isotopic effects have also been computed. Both the theories account for the correct ℏ 2 limit at high temperature and not the parabolic barrier limit as in various other theories. The mVPT2 and mYF theories also improve upon the thermal rates in the low temperature limit due to the shifting of the action by the zero point energy shift E 0 . The resulting theory is more accurate than the ring polymer molecular dynamics based approximation over the whole temperature range probed.

  abstract     = {Mixed halide inorganic perovskites exhibit exceptional stability and photovoltaic performance and are considered to be promising photovoltaic materials. However, the chemical diversity of these materials presents a vast screening space, making it challenging to efficiently identify high-performance materials solely through theoretical calculations or experiments. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a multidimensional high-throughput screening strategy that combines machine learning with first-principles calculations, specifically designed to identify MHIPs with optimal bandgap and light absorption properties. The bandgap and light absorption models have achieved determination coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.9896 and 0.9833, with root mean square errors of 0.1890 eV and 0.2190 10 5 eV · cm −1 , respectively, demonstrating the high precision and reliability of the models. In the present work, the generation of 306 521 candidate materials through mixed B-site elements is reported, leading to the successful identification of 295 materials with ideal characteristics for MHIPs via screening. Subsequently, an in-depth density functional theory validation is conducted on 20 of these materials. The research results demonstrate that Cs 2 AgBi 0.5 Sb 0.25 Ir 0.25 I 6 and CsSn 0.75 Ge 0.25 I 3 exhibit outstanding performance, making them the most promising candidate materials for practical applications.

  abstract     = {Hydrated electrons are anionic species that are formed when an excess electron is introduced into liquid water. Building an understanding of how hydrated electrons behave in solution has been a long-standing effort of simulation methods, of which density functional theory (DFT) has come to the fore in recent years. The ability of DFT to model the reactive chemistry of hydrated electrons is an attractive advantage over semi-classical methodologies; however, relatively few density functional approximations (DFAs) have been used for the hydrated electron simulations presented in the literature. Here, we simulate hydrated electron systems using a series of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals spanning Jacob’s ladder. We calculate a variety of experimental and other observables of the hydrated electron and compare the XC functional dependence for each quantity. We find that the formation of a stable localized hydrated electron is not necessarily limited to hybrid XC functionals and that some hybrid functionals produce delocalized hydrated electrons or electrons that react with the surrounding water at an unphysically fast rate. We further characterize how different DFAs impact the solvent structure and predicted spectroscopy of the hydrated electron, considering several methods for calculating the hydrated electron’s absorption spectrum for the best comparison between structures generated using different density functionals. None of the dozen or so DFAs that we investigated are able to correctly predict the hydrated electron’s spectroscopy, vertical detachment energy, or molar solvation volume.},

  abstract     = {The nucleosome serves as the fundamental unit of chromatin organization, with electrostatic interactions acting as the driving forces in the folding of nucleosomes into chromatin. Perturbations around physiological pH conditions can lead to changes in the protonation states of titratable histone residues, impacting nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and interactions. However, the effects of proton uptake or release of histone ionizable groups on nucleosome–partner protein interactions and higher-order chromatin structures remain largely unexplored. Here, we conducted comprehensive analyses of histone titratable residue pKa values in various nucleosome contexts, utilizing 96 experimentally determined complex structures. We revealed that pH-induced changes in histone residue protonation states modulated nucleosome surface electrostatic potentials and significantly influenced nucleosome–partner protein interactions. Furthermore, we observed that proton uptake or release often accompanied nucleosome–partner protein interactions, facilitating their binding processes. In addition, our findings suggest that alterations in histone protonation can also regulate nucleosome self-association, thereby modulating the organization and dynamics of higher-order chromatin structure. This study advances our understanding of nucleosome–chromatin factor interactions and how chromatin organization is regulated at the molecular level.},

Here, we consider the effect of surface polarization on electrolytes in a slab geometry by combining the MR approach to polarization with Poisson–Boltzmann theory. Due to the coupling of bulk and surface fields, not only is the electrostatics modified by polarization, but maybe even more importantly, vice versa: a finite polarization at the wall is sufficient to generate a finite electrostatic potential even in the absence of net charges on the wall. We determine the polarization and electrostatic potential profiles and the free energy of the system. Our results show that the presence of surface polarization alone suffices to imprint the bulk structural properties on the electrostatic field in an electrolyte.},

Although the FSC observations have provided new information on the crystallization kinetics and evolution of the crystals, the molecular details on the chain exchange events between the ordered and disordered domains of crystals have remained elusive. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the detailed chain dynamics and thermodynamics of polyamide 6 (PA6) system under two heating treatments: (i) quenching PA6 melt deeply below the melting temperature T m and (ii) annealing the resulting quenched system to a temperature close to T m . We categorized the chains into mobile amorphous fraction (MAF) and rigid amorphous fraction (RAF), based on the length of consecutive chain’s bond angles in the trans state. In the deep quenched system close to the glass transition temperature T g , the mobility of the MAF chains is strongly suppressed and they remain in the glassy state. However, upon rising the temperature close to melting temperature, the system undergoes recrystallization, leading to the coexistence of RAF and supercooled liquid MAF chains. The highly mobile unentangled MAF chains explore the interphase domains, and during the late-stage of crystallization, they are thermally translocated into the lamella by reducing the fold number of RAF chains. The chain mobility in the annealed system could potentially lead to improved biodegradation in semi-crystalline chains.},

  abstract     = {We present a mechanistic study of hole spin dynamics in colloidal cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanosheets, aiming to gain insights into the elusive interplay between two counteracting surface effects, i.e., hole-trapping interaction [between the valence-band heavy-hole (HH) state and its nearby localized surface trap (LST) state] vs spin-exchange interaction [between the HH spin state and the surface dangling-bond spin (DBS) state]. Differently from our previous work adopting a strategy of ligand engineering [see Wu et al. , Adv. Opt. Mater. 12 , 2400583 (2024)], we here implement an alternative strategy of element doping to regulate the LST and DBS states in the Ag + -doped CdSe nanosystem. It is observed that the hole spin-flip lifetime is shortened when the Ag + -doping level is elevated, demonstrating that the hole–DBS exchange interaction can effectively compete against the coexisting hole–LST trapping interaction, mainly due to the doping-induced increase in the density of the DBS state. Markedly, this observation is contrary to that in the ligand-engineering case, where the hole-trapping interaction plays a predominant role due to the strong ligand/CdSe orbital hybridization. This work elucidates the interplay between the two surface effects and enriches the understanding about the subtle DBS-related effect, providing valuable mechanistic information for rational design and optimization of spintronic applications based on colloidal nanostructures.},

  abstract     = {The release of Ag + ions into the environment through silica layers is a promising strategy for the development of anti-microbial surface coating devices. The aim of the present study is to provide some insight into the elementary mechanisms of diffusion of Ag + ions through silica with the objective of proposing control strategies. Thanks to the development of interaction potentials based on neural networks, the diffusion processes were studied via molecular dynamics simulations. Silver diffusion was found to be anomalous and sub-diffusive, the origin of which could be attributed to deceleration and temporal anti-correlations. This sub-diffusion has been attributed primarily to the disordered nature of the silica matrix. Furthermore, it is magnified by the presence of coordination defects within the silica matrix. These defects, in particular the under-coordinated oxygen atoms, act as traps for Ag + by forming O–Ag bonds, thereby limiting the jump length and retaining the ion for long duration. By comparison with existing diffusion models, the diffusion mechanism in the absence of defects appears to be of the fractional Brownian motion type, substantially modified by the presence of defects. Two possible approaches have emerged to tune the release of Ag + ions through the silica layer: the monitoring of the number of defects and the opening/closing of diffusion paths via, e.g., a modification of the silica density.},

  abstract     = {Calcium, one of the most abundant elements in the Earth’s mantle, does not react easily with noble gases (e.g., He and Xe) under ambient conditions. However, high pressure can alter electron configurations in atoms, leading to the formation of unconventional compounds. In this study, we systematically investigate Ca–Xe compounds across pressures of 0–150 GPa using calypso structure prediction methods combined with first-principles calculations. We identify four novel Ca–Xe compounds P m 3 ̄ m -CaXe, P 4/ mmm -CaXe 2 , I 4/ m -Ca 3 Xe, and P 4/ mmm -Ca 2 Xe 3 that demonstrate stability over a wide pressure range from 37.5 to 150 GPa. All these compounds exhibit metallic properties and are dynamically stable, as indicated by the absence of imaginary frequencies in their phonon dispersion spectra. Ionic bonding between Ca and Xe is observed due to electron transfer from Ca to Xe. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that P m 3 ̄ m -CaXe, P 4/ mmm -CaXe 2 , and P 4/ mmm -Ca 2 Xe 3 remain solid up to pressures of 135 GPa and temperatures of 4000 K. In contrast, I 4/ m -Ca 3 Xe undergoes a transition from solid to liquid at temperatures above 3500 K due to weakened Ca–Xe bonds. The findings suggest that these Ca–Xe compounds could potentially be synthesized experimentally under high-pressure conditions. The results offer theoretical guidance for discovering new high-pressure Xe compounds and provide valuable insights into Xe chemistry.},

Upon non-hydrostatic pressurization, CuInP 2 Se 6 experienced two successive phase transitions at 5.4 and 14.1 GPa originating from the rapid compression of van der Waals gaps and the local structure variation of Se–P–Se bonds, followed by a metallization at 25.1 GPa. Furthermore, a ∼2.0 GPa pressure hysteresis was detected for the emergence of electronic transformation in CuInP 2 Se 6 under hydrostatic conditions owing to the influence of hydrostaticity. Upon decompression, the phase transition of CuInP 2 Se 6 was demonstrated to be reversible with considerable pressure hysteresis under different hydrostatic environments. In addition, the positive sinusoidal voltage-dependent electrical current relations with the nonlinearity factors of ∼1.0 manifested the Ohmic response of CuInP 2 Se 6 under high pressure conditions. Meantime, the disappearance of the P 1 Raman peak and the discontinuities in Raman shifts and full width at half-maximums offered robust evidence on the occurrence of ferroelectric crossover in CuInP 2 Se 6 . It is the first time that the phase boundary from the mixed antiferroelectric and ferroelectric (FE) orderings into the FE state of CuInP 2 Se 6 is well established [i.e., T C (K) = 165.5 P (GPa) + 292.1] under the conditions of 298–873 K and 0.4–40.3 GPa.

  abstract     = {The ladder-type population transfer of the HF molecule steered by four-color harmonic laser pulses (HLPs) is investigated using the time-dependent quantum wave packet method. It is found that although there exist large background excitations and many (resonant) transition pathways during the driving, nearly 100% of the population could be transferred to the target state. In particular, such a process could be coherently controlled by changing the phases of the four HLPs, especially the phases of the fundamental and second HLPs, which can be accounted for in large part by the combined effects of the corresponding transition pathways and the maximal amplitude of the total electric field. However, for manipulating the phases of the third and fourth HLPs, both the changes in the maximal electric field amplitude and the asymmetry size fail to guide the variation of the target-state population because of the correlated effects of all these transition pathways, particularly the ones that do not contain the third and fourth HLP excitations. Importantly, our results also denote that the variation of the maximal electric field amplitude may give a well qualitative prediction about the phase-controlled population when the manipulated phase is directly related to all the transition pathways, which is the general case in the widely used two-color scheme. In addition, the maximal amplitude of the total electric field tends to play a more important role than its asymmetry size in the phase-controlled population transfer process.},

In order to shed some light on the complex behavior, the manganese dimer has been the focus of extensive interest in theoretical research. Various quantum techniques have been utilized to comprehend the characteristics of the Mn dimer. Several approaches and functionals have been employed that suggest that the ferromagnetic (FM) state is its lowest energy configuration. Nevertheless, these findings are inconsistent with the experimental results showing that Mn 2 has an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Σ g + 1 configuration at an interatomic Mn–Mn distance of d Mn–Mn = 3.40 Å. This work presents a comparative assessment of outcomes obtained through several levels of the exchange–correlation functional: generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, GGA+ U , and the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06), the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 0, and the Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr. The results of our investigation are discussed based on previous theoretical and experimental reports. We found that the best description is obtained with the hybrid HSE06 functional. The Mn 2 has a FM coupling at short distances and the characteristic AFM Σ g + 1 state at d Mn–Mn = 3.27 Å. Furthermore, we obtained a magnetic moment ( μ ) per Mn atom of μ = 4.527 μ B , a stretching frequency of ω = 80 cm −1 , and a binding energy of E b = −195 meV, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.},

By means of dedicated annealing procedures, relative concentration dependencies, and a specialized dual inlet deposition procedure enabling complexation between specific isotopically substituted subunits, the present work identifies the intramolecular vibrational transitions experimentally for these three isotopologues of the binary complex and the most stable cyclic conformations of selectively deuterated mixed (HCl) m (H 2 O) n ( m + n ≤ 4) cluster molecules embedded in inert neon “quantum matrices” at 4 K. The vibrational assignments up to mixed ternary cluster molecules are supported by harmonic CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12 frequency predictions in conjunction with anharmonic corrections employing second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. While the assigned O–H and O–D stretching transitions in neon are systematically spectrally redshifted by 0.2%–0.5% relative to previously reported observations in supersonic jets, the assigned H–Cl and D–Cl stretching transitions all reveal anomalous excessive spectral redshifts in neon increasing with the size of the cluster molecules. These cluster-size dependent excessive H–Cl/D–Cl spectral redshifts in neon indicate that the extent of charge transfer is enhanced strongly with the complexation of an increasing number of H 2 O molecules as predicted by quantum chemical models for more than a decade.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging are well-established techniques to acquire diverse molecular information, while their potential applications remain limited due to low sensitivity. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) is one of the promising methods to solve this issue, and numerous studies have been conducted to understand its physical mechanism using a particular combination of a dye and a quencher of interest. However, the research across multiple dye–quencher combinations remains largely unexplored. Here, we explore plenty of dye–quencher combinations and reveal that not only the electron transfer process but also the optimal value of the g -value difference (Δ g ), considerably affected by the escape process of a radical pair, plays a key role in maximizing the enhancement of the NMR signal by photo-CIDNP. The combinations of 115 quenchers with several dyes were experimentally investigated, and 36 photo-CIDNP active quenchers were revealed. Exploration of many different dye–quencher combinations with four dyes revealed that molecular diffusion significantly affects the Δ g dependence of photo-CIDNP enhancement of each dye. These findings provide important insights into pioneering new dye–quencher combinations suitable for biological and medical applications.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, an analytical full-dimensional potential energy surface, PES-2024, was developed for the first time, describing the polyatomic OH + CH 3 SH gas-phase reaction. This reaction presents some intrinsic difficulties, such as 18 degrees of freedom; two possible reactive channels; methyl- and thiol-H abstraction reactions, (R1) and (R2), respectively; and the presence of intermediate complexes in the entrance and exit channels. In the valence bond-molecular mechanics, VB-MM, framework, we have developed this potential based on a reduced number of high-level ab initio calculations, the input data. The new PES has been subjected to a series of stringent tests. PES-2024 simultaneously describes both (R1) and (R2) reaction paths, forming the water molecule and describing reasonably the topology of the reaction: high exothermicities, low barriers, and the presence of intermediate complexes. Based on this surface, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were performed at room temperature for both paths, with special emphasis on the H 2 O(v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ) product stretching (v 1 and v 3 modes) and bending (v 2 mode) vibrational excitations, comparing the results with the recent experimental evidence. The available energy was mostly deposited as water vibrational energy, 44% and 47%, respectively, simulating the experimental evidence. These detailed state-to-state results lend confidence to the new surface.},

Chem. Lett. 13 , 10912 (2022)] using Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) techniques. Our calculations utilize a highly accurate full-dimensional H 2 + He interaction potential with diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction appropriate for HD and D 2 isotopomers. The results show that rotational quenching of HD from j = 2 → j ′ = 0 in v = 2, j = 2 → j ′ = 1 in v = 2 and v = 4, and j = 4 → j ′ = 3 in v = 4 is dominated by an l = 1 shape resonance located between 0.1 and 1.0 cm −1 . For collision energies less than 0.1 cm −1 , isotropic scattering prevails. An l = 1 resonance centered around 0.02 cm −1 is also found to dominate the j = 2 → j ′ = 0 and j = 4 → j ′ = 2 transitions in v = 4 for He–D 2 collisions consistent with our prior studies of Δ j = −2 transition in He + D 2 ( v = 2, j = 2) collisions. Our analysis does not support the hypothesis of Perreault et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 13 , 10912 (2022)] that a strong l = 2 resonance controls the angular distribution for Δ j = −2 transition for both systems. Despite improvements in the development of the potential energy surface, a good agreement with SARP experiments for v = 2 is achieved only when contributions from collision energies less than 1.0 cm −1 were excluded in the computation of velocity averaged differential rate coefficients for both systems. This could be due to some uncertainties in the velocity spread in the experiment that employs co-propagation of the collision partners and possibly, the neglect of transverse velocities in the simulation of the experiment.},

Our analysis includes not only electronic populations but also additional electronic and nuclear properties in position and momentum space. For both DMABN and fulvene, the recently developed CCTTSH algorithm successfully resolves the internal inconsistencies of coupled-trajectory Tully surface hopping. Instead, we find that DMABN highlights a significant weakness of CTMQC, which arises when the trajectories remain for a long time in the vicinity of a region of strong nonadiabaticity.},

The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long-times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. We identify an exceptional point that indicates the onset of broken symmetry between an unsynchronized and synchronized dynamical phase of the system as correlations within the environment are increased. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.},

We present here a numerically stable formulation of the Resonating Hartree–Fock (ResHF) method that uses the matrix adjugate to remove numerical instabilities arising from nearly orthogonal orbitals, and as a result, we demonstrate improvements to ResHF wavefunction optimization. We then benchmark the performance of ResHF against complete active space self-consistent field in the avoided crossing of LiF, the torsional rotation of ethene, and the singlet–triplet energy gaps of a selection of small molecules. ResHF is a promising excited state method because it incorporates the orbital relaxation of state-specific methods, while retaining the correct state crossings of state-averaged approaches. Our open-source ResHF implementation, yucca, is available on GitLab.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of polymer properties using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires a properly relaxed starting structure. Polymer models built from scratch by specialized algorithms (self-avoiding random walk, Monte Carlo, etc.) are far from relaxed and, moreover, often possess a large number of structural defects: close contacts between atoms, wrong bond distances, voids, unfavorable molecular conformations or packing, etc. This is especially problematic for ring-containing polymers whose initial structures also include ring spearing (bonds passing through cycles, including benzene rings). All these defects must be eliminated before running an MD simulation to correctly predict polymer properties. Short MD simulations can be enough to remove close contacts; however, ring spearing elimination and general structure relaxation cannot be achieved this way. In this work, we propose α-Replica Exchange MD (α-REMD)–a Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD protocol that reliably eliminates ring spearing defects and performs a general relaxation of the system. Its efficiency is demonstrated on five polyethersulfones whose initial geometries contained numerous ring intersections that were completely removed by α-REMD.},

In this work, we establish the existence of the universal matrix functional for many states as a proper generalization of the Lieb universal functional for the ground state. Consequently, the variation principle of MSDFT can be rigorously defined within an appropriate domain of matrix densities, thereby providing a solid framework for DFT of both the ground state and excited states. We further show that the analytical structure of the Hamiltonian matrix functional is considerably constrained by the subspace symmetry and invariance properties, requiring and ensuring that all elements of the Hamiltonian matrix functional are variationally optimized in a coherent manner until the Hamiltonian matrix within the subspace spanned by the lowest eigenstates is obtained.

The effects are shown for propane and diethyl ether as representative examples of potential hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, but the findings of this work are equally applicable to other multispin systems in the liquid or gas phase. These results are relevant to both adiabatic longitudinal transport after dissociation engenders net alignment (ALTADENA) experiments (where 1 H nuclei are polarized) and MFC protocols used to transfer parahydrogen spin order to a heteronucleus such as 13 C. The investigated effects should be incorporated for a correct evaluation of both the maximum possible NMR signal enhancement and the pairwise selectivity, which are useful in the context of mechanistic studies in the field of catalytic hydrogenation. Among signal enhancement damping factors in ALTADENA, such as T 1 relaxation and insufficient adiabaticity of a field sweep, the inherent loss of net magnetization in spin systems containing magnetically equivalent protons (especially in PHIP systems commonly used for mechanistic studies such as propene or propane) has not been thoroughly considered and needs to be clarified. The maximum possible net magnetization in ALTADENA for diethyl ether and propane was shown to be ∑|⟨I iz ⟩| ≈ 0.56 for diethyl ether and ∑|⟨I iz ⟩| ≈ 0.45 for propane, respectively.

  abstract     = {Membrane protein folding in the viscous microenvironment of a lipid bilayer is an inherently slow process that challenges experiments and computational efforts alike. The folding kinetics is moreover associated with topological modulations of the biological milieu. Studying such structural changes in membrane-embedded proteins and understanding the associated topological signatures in membrane leaflets, therefore, remain relatively unexplored. Herein, we first aim to estimate the free energy barrier and the minimum free energy path (MFEP) connecting the membrane-embedded fully and partially inserted states of the bacteriorhodopsin fragment. To achieve this, we have considered independent sets of simulations from membrane-mimicking and membrane-embedded environments, respectively. An autoencoder model is used to elicit state-distinguishable collective variables for the system utilizing membrane-mimicking simulations. Our in-house Expectation Maximized Molecular Dynamics algorithm is initially used to deduce the barrier height between the two membrane-embedded states. Next, we develop the Geometry Optimized Local Direction search as a post-processing algorithm to identify the MFEP and the corresponding peptide conformations from the autoencoder-projected trajectories. Finally, we apply a graph attention neural network (GAT) model to learn the membrane surface topology as a function of the associated peptide structure, supervised by the membrane-embedded simulations. The resultant GAT model is then utilized to predict the membrane leaflet topology for the peptide structures along MFEP, obtained from membrane-mimicking simulations. The combined framework is expected to be useful in capturing key phenomena accompanying folding transitions in membranes. We discuss opportunities and avenues for further development.},

  abstract     = {Intermolecular charge-transfer (xCT) excited states important for various practical applications are challenging for many standard computational methods. It is highly desirable to have an affordable method that can treat xCT states accurately. In the present work, we extend our self-consistent perturbation methods, named one-body second-order Møller–Plesset and its spin-opposite scaling variant (O2BMP2), for excited states without additional costs to the ground state. We then assessed their performance for the prediction of xCT excitation energies. Thanks to self-consistency, our methods yield small errors relative to high-level coupled cluster methods and outperform other same scaling ( N 5 ) methods, such as CC2 and ADC(2). In particular, O2BMP2, whose scaling can be reduced to N 4 , can even reach the accuracy of CC3 ( N 7 ) with errors less than 0.1 eV. This method is thus highly promising for treating xCT states in large compounds vital for applications.},

This method improves the quality of configuration space than other Langevin dynamics methods. However, it encounters issues in pressure evaluation due to inaccuracies in momentum space. In particular, the conventional approach for calculating kinetic temperature using the full-time step momentum introduces errors proportional to the square of the time step (Δ t 2 ), leading to unreliable results when employing a large time step under isothermal–isobaric conditions. By calculating kinetic energy using the half-time step momentum in pressure evaluation, we can reduce the numerical errors. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using our refined pressure evaluation and improved accuracy and stability in the isothermal–isobaric MD simulations even with a long time step (Δ t = 5 fs).},

  abstract     = {The presence of spin and spatial symmetry breaking upon variational optimization of mean-field wavefunctions is known to be an indicator of nondynamical electron correlation. However, a single mean-field wavefunction may not have sufficient flexibility to flag the correlated orbital space where there are multiple correlation mechanisms present. In such situations, there are multiple nearly degenerate self-consistent field solutions that describe different correlation mechanisms, but it is often not possible to know a priori when such situations will occur or if sufficient solutions have been obtained. In this work, we examine the role of spin and spatial symmetries of nonorthogonal multiconfigurational self-consistent field (NOMCSCF) calculations in revealing correlation mechanisms. We provide details of the theory for optimization of NOMCSCF wavefunctions with desired symmetries, establish which types of symmetries recover the most correlation energy when the symmetry constraints are relaxed, and discuss how the different-orbitals for different-configuration wavefunctions reveal the different correlation mechanisms present.},

The results show good agreement with the available experimental data. The Hermitian nature of the 4c-ADC(3) Hamiltonian, combined with the perturbative truncation of the wave function, offers significant computational advantages over the standard equation-of-motion coupled-cluster approach, particularly for property calculations. The method’s suitability for property calculations is further demonstrated by computing oscillator strengths and excited-state dipole moments for heavy elements.},

  abstract     = {Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is a powerful polymer field-theoretic simulation tool that plays a crucial role in the study of block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly. However, the computational cost of implementing SCFT simulations is comparatively high, particularly in computationally demanding applications where repeated forward simulations are needed. Herein, we propose a deep learning-based method to accelerate the SCFT simulations. By directly mapping early SCFT results to equilibrium structures using a deep neural network (DNN), this method bypasses most of the time-consuming SCFT iterations, significantly reducing the simulation time. We first applied this method to two- and three-dimensional large-cell bulk system simulations. Both results demonstrate that a DNN can be trained to predict equilibrium states based on early iteration outputs accurately. The number of early SCFT iterations can be tailored to optimize the trade-off between computational speed and predictive accuracy. The effect of training set size on DNN performance was also examined, offering guidance on minimizing dataset generation costs. Furthermore, we applied this method to the more computationally demanding inverse directed self-assembly-lithography problem. A covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy-based inverse design method was proposed. By replacing the forward simulation model in this method with a trained DNN, we were able to determine the guiding template shapes that direct the BCP to self-assemble into the target structure with certain constraints, eliminating the need for any SCFT simulations. This improved the inverse design efficiency by a factor of 100, and the computational cost for training the network can be easily averaged out over repeated tasks.},

By applying the present theory to the C–N stretching vibrations of several nitrile compounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by changing solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Furthermore, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. In addition, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the nonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {We consider an open one-dimensional spin-crossover chain, in which each site can be in either a low spin (LS) or a high spin (HS) state. The sites interact elastically through nearest neighbor (nn) and next-nearest neighbor (nnn) springs with local equilibrium distances depending on the spin states. The system’s Hamiltonian is solved numerically using the Monte Carlo method, applied on both spin states and atomic displacements. This study focuses on the investigations of the isothermal relaxation of a photoinduced HS metastable chain, by analyzing the interplay between the electronic and structural properties along this process. The obtained results indicate that the nucleation and growth mechanisms of LS domains during relaxation are significantly influenced by the amplitude of the intermolecular interactions. Thus, increasing the latter reduces the number of HS/LS clusters due to the high cost of stored elastic energy at HS/LS interfaces. In the second part, we inject an elastic frustration between the equilibrium nn and nnn bond lengths, resulting in the emergence of two distinct relaxation regimes, which depend on the frustration rate, ξ . A detailed analysis of the effect of ξ on the isothermal HS to LS relaxation reveals the stabilization of rich intermediate self-organized electronic structures with long lifetime along this process. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate that the shape of the relaxation curves transforms from a continuous to a two-step behavior, which is reminiscent of the thermal dependence of the order parameters of such models in equilibrium thermodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls—mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material—that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. In addition, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.},

  abstract     = {Semi-flexible polymers, such as actin filaments, can deform the shape of membrane when confined in a membrane vesicle, playing an important role in biological processes. Here, we use dynamic Monte Carlo simulations to study an active polymer chain confined in a membrane vesicle. For flexible polymer chains, the membrane shape is governed by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and polymer activity. Stiff membrane is unaffected by small active forces, but moderate forces cause the polymer to alternate between stretched and disordered configurations, increasing the asphericity of both the polymer and the vesicle. For semi-flexible polymer chains, their stiffness can significantly impact both the vesicle and polymer shapes. We identify distinct classes of configurations that emerge as a function of polymer stiffness, membrane bending rigidity, and polymer activity. A weak polymer activity can cause the polymer to align along its contour, effectively increasing its stiffness. However, a moderate polymer activity softens the polymer chain. For membranes with low bending rigidities κ , large-scale deformations, such as wormlike or tadpole-shaped vesicles, appear at a weak polymer activity and high polymer stiffness. In the wormlike configuration, the polymer chain adopts a hairpin configuration to minimize the polymer bending energy. As the polymer stiffness increases, a tadpole-like vesicle forms, with part of the polymer deforming the membrane into a protrusion while the rest remaining confined in a bud-like structure. For stiffer membranes, we observe oblate vesicles containing toroidal polymer chains, resulting from the high cost of membrane bending energy. A moderate polymer activity causes the softening of the polymer chain, leading to a nearly spherical vesicle with slight shape fluctuation. We further characterize the order parameter of toroidal polymer chains in oblate vesicles and reveal that a slight increase in polymer activity leads to a more ordered helical structure of polymer chains.},

  abstract     = {The water/electrode interface under an applied bias potential is a challenging out-of-equilibrium phenomenon, which is difficult to accurately model at the atomic scale. In this study, we employ a combined approach of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green’s function methods to analyze the influence of an external bias on the properties of water adsorbed on Au(111) and Pd(111) metallic electrodes. Our results demonstrate that while both Au and Pd-electrodes induce qualitatively similar structural responses in adsorbed water molecules, the quantitative differences are substantial, driven by the distinct nature of water–metal bonding. Our findings underscore the necessity of quantum-mechanical modeling for accurately describing electrochemical interfaces.},

  abstract     = {2D porous material supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) have demonstrated great potential for CO 2 separation and purification, outperforming the original porous material. However, the working mechanism behind their enhanced CO 2 selectivity remains unclear. In this study, we have conducted molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the CO 2 /N 2 separation performance and the underlying mechanism of SILMs taking 2D rhombic N-graphdiyne (r-N-GDY) with intrinsic high thermal stability and porous structure covered with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the representative SILM model. We found that the increase in the SILM thickness can decrease the permeance of CO 2 and N 2 but can effectively increase the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity. The optimal SILM thickness is found to be 0.6 nm with the permeance reaching 5.7 × 10 5 GPU for CO 2 and the selectivity being up to 25.8, which is 15 times higher than the 1.7 of bare r-N-GDY. This is because CO 2 encounters a much lower transmembrane energy barrier than N 2 . At the molecular level, it is fascinating to observe a cation-gating mechanism, where IL cations play a determinative role in CO 2 selectivity. More specifically, the IL cations normally bind at the pore site, like a closed gate for gas. When a CO 2 molecule approaches the pore, the IL cation moves away; thus, the gate is opened for CO 2 translocation. In contrast, N 2 molecules are incapable of opening the cation gate. Such a cation-gating process guarantees the high selectivity of SILMs. This study offers insight into enhanced CO 2 selectivity and provides theoretical guidance for designing nanocomposite membranes for gas or water treatment.},

  abstract     = {Random ternary polymerization is a strategy for tuning the energy levels and improving the batch-to-batch reproducibility of polymer semiconductors for the application in polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, the influence of third component incorporation on exciton properties and charge photogeneration processes in terpolymer-based solar cells is still unclear. In this work, time-resolved spectroscopies were employed to study exciton properties and charge photogeneration processes in PSCs based on a series of terpolymers, PM1 and PM2, which have 20% and 50% of thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) building blocks on the PM6 backbone, respectively. For neat terpolymer films, we found that the small amount (20%) of TTz incorporation in PM6 slightly reduces the exciton diffusion coefficient, but the exciton lifetime is significantly increased, resulting in a significant increase in exciton diffusion length. However, further increasing the TTz component (50%) in the PM6 backbone decreases exciton lifetime, the diffusion coefficient, and consequently exciton diffusion length. We found that a small amount of acceptor (Y6) addition can efficiently dissociate terpolymer excitons due to the weak molecular stacking of terpolymers in the blend films. For terpolymer:Y6-based blend films, we find that the small amount of TTz incorporation (PM1) could reduce the phase size of the donor and suppress bimolecular carrier recombination in blend films. Furthermore, we find that the energy level offset plays a critical role in charge photogeneration processes, and a HOMO energy level offset of 0.06 eV can dissociate acceptor excitons in terpolymer-based organic solar cells effectively.},

Here, we focused on the cases with micropores of moderate length–diameter ratios. Through experimental research and systematic simulations, the EOF-induced ICR was found to exhibit voltage-dependent ratios. In the considered cases with a weak EOF or strong ionic diffusion, a large deviation appears between the ion concentration inside the micropore and the bulk value, which fails the prediction by solution conductivity gradients. Based on our simulation results, effective equations were developed for the theoretical description of ion concentration distributions along the micropore axis under a coupled concentration gradient and electric field. With the predicted ion distributions inside micropores, the ICR ratio can be conveniently calculated using the derived electrical resistance of the microfluidic system, which applies to micropores of 200–1000 nm in diameter. Because the surface charge density is the only unknown input parameter, our developed equations can be used to evaluate the surface charge density of micropores using the measured EOF-induced ICR ratio under concentration gradients.},

In inverted p–i–n PSCs, commonly utilized electron transport layers (ETL), such as C 60 and PCBM, are associated with notable stability challenges and high production costs. This study reports on a novel and highly stable perovskite solar cell that employs iron-doped zinc oxide (FZO) nanoparticles as the ETL and nickel oxide (NiO x ) as the hole transport layer, demonstrating a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼12%. In comparison with PSCs that utilize zinc oxide (ZnO) as the ETL, those incorporating FZO demonstrated a maximum PCE enhancement of 18.3%. The incorporation of iron doping mitigates the basicity of the ZnO ETL, thereby reducing the deprotonation at the FZO/perovskite interface and enhancing the stability of the PSCs. The unpackaged FZO device maintained an initial PCE of 90% after 400 h at a relative humidity of 45% ± 5%. (2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid and 2-phenylethylamine hydroiodide were used to passivate the NiO x /perovskite and perovskite/ZnO(FZO) interfaces, respectively, which further improved the PSC performance. Ultimately, FZO-based PSCs with a PCE of 13.65%, an open-circuit voltage (V oc ) of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current density (J sc ) of 20.79, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.1% were obtained, and the PCE demonstrated a notable increase of over 35% compared to pristine ZnO-based devices. Results indicate that high device performance, low fabrication costs, and excellent stability can be attained through the use of simple chemically synthesized oxides as inorganic selective charge transport layers in PSCs.},

The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined from the static spectra [CsAlH 4 ( o ): C Q = (1.42 ± 0.01) MHz, η = (0.62 ± 0.01) and CsAlH 4 ( t ): C Q = (1.43 ± 0.02) MHz, η < 0.03] seems to be slightly higher than via the MAS approach. The experimentally determined parameters ( δ iso , C Q , and η ) are compared with those obtained from DFT-GIPAW (density functional theory—gauge-including projected augmented wave) calculations. When using DFT-optimized structures, the magnitude of the quadrupole coupling constant is overestimated by about 45% for both polymorphs. Further calculations in which the geometry of the AlH 4 tetrahedra is varied show a high sensitivity of C Q to the H–Al–H angles. Modest changes in the angles on the order of one to three degrees are sufficient to achieve a near-perfect agreement between GIPAW calculations and experiments. The deviations found for the DFT-optimized structures are explained with the neglect of thermal motion, which typically leads to a reduction in the distortion of the AlH 4 tetrahedra. From a broader perspective, the uncertainty in the positions of the hydrogen atoms renders the accurate reproduction or prediction of quadrupole coupling constants for aluminum hydrides challenging.},

The group-modified PSD is validated against adsorption data for seven fluids on various activated carbons. In this analysis, the adsorption isotherms calculated using the two-distribution model with PSD, homogeneous group-modified PSD, and inhomogeneous group-modified PSD are compared and evaluated.

While experimental or model values for shear viscosity are widely available and represent an excellent benchmark, bulk viscosity is more challenging to measure, and experimental values are available for only a handful of liquids. Here, we present an analysis of both shear and bulk viscosity, calculated from molecular dynamics simulations via the Green–Kubo relations, for over 140 small molecular Newtonian liquids from the Virtual Chemistry database. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive reference for these transport properties for the popular optimized potential for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field and the generalized Amber force field (GAFF).},

The microscopic origin of the effect has recently been elucidated in the framework of linear response theory. Here, by use of conservation laws, we provide an explicit solution of the equations governing the fluid flow at stationarity in slab geometry, expressing the thermo-osmotic coefficient as the integrated mass current–heat current correlation function (which vanishes in the bulk). A very simple expression for the pressure gradient in terms of equilibrium properties is also derived. To test the theoretical predictions in a controlled setting, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. Few simple models of wall–particle interactions are examined, and the resulting pressure drop and velocity profile are compared with the theoretical predictions both in the liquid regime and in the gas regime.},

Hybrid cavities, which support both photonic and plasmonic modes, offer unique opportunities that arise from the interplay between these two distinct types of modes. In particular, we demonstrate that interference in the spectral density due to a narrow photonic mode and a broad plasmonic mode that are coupled to each other enables hybrid cavities to provide an energy-selective Purcell effect. This effect enhances electronic relaxation only to the desired molecular geometry, providing the ability to increase the yield of photoisomerization reactions. As a test case, we study the asymmetric proton transfer reaction in the electronically excited state of 3-aminoacrolein. Our results, which are robust for a range of realistic cavity parameters, highlight the advantages of hybrid cavities in cavity-induced photochemical processes.},

At the same time, in the medium of aliphatic diamine, the reduction of silver ions is absent, indicating the formation of a complex compound. XANES and EXAFS confirmed the formation of such a complex, established the probable coordination number of silver equal to three, and characterized the nearest atomic environment of silver.

This study is focused on two recently synthesized compounds, a bis-thiocarbohydrazone ( bis-TCH ) and a bis-carbohydrazone ( bis-CH ) isolated as sodium salts, that have shown chelating properties toward copper(II) and zinc(II) metal ions along with promising cytotoxic activity. In this work, an integrated theoretical–computational, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and vibrational characterization of both bis-TCH and bis-CH anions in a non-protic solvent (dimethylsulfoxide) is presented to better elucidate their properties. Their protonic NMR spectra underline the presence of cis – trans , EE isomers, characterized by a significant conformational freedom at room temperature. The presence of oxygen or sulfur heteroatoms can tune the molecular conformational dynamics driving a different interaction with the solvent, as highlighted by density functional theory calculations and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that a quantitative agreement with the NMR and Raman signals is achieved only when an explicit solvent description is included. The insights achieved by this study can contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of bis-carbohydrazones and bis-thiocarbohydrazones in solution, a crucial and mandatory step to improve the design of novel, more potent analogs.},

  abstract     = {Close coupling calculations of line shape parameters have been performed for the first pure rotational R 0 ( j = 0–4) lines of CO in helium baths at various temperatures. Besides the usual Lorentzian widths and shifts, we provide the complex Dicke parameters as well as the double power law temperature representation of all four parameters. In addition, we study the speed dependence of these parameters. The R 0 (0) and R 0 (1) theoretical thermally averaged collisional widths and shifts between 500 and about 15 K are in excellent agreement with the values reported in the literature. Below this temperature range, we confirm the persistent substantial disagreement that exists since 1985 between experimental and theoretical values. We thus focus on this regime, which is important for astrophysical applications, and we discuss various beyond-Voigt effects at low temperatures to try to understand this mismatch. We show that such mechanisms do not allow experimental widths and shifts to be reconciled with those from theory.},

  abstract     = {Free-jet atomic, cluster, and molecular sources are typically used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. We present a simple analytical theory that is applicable to many of these sources, when (i) the nozzle-skimmer distance is such that free molecular flow is achieved and (ii) there is negligible interference within the skimmer itself. The utility of the model is demonstrated by comparing experimental data with calculations performed using the theory. In particular, we show that skimmer interference is negligible compared to attenuation by “background” gas for room-temperature beams. Our treatment does not depend on any free parameters and obviates the complexity of previous theories. As a result, we are able to devise a number of design recommendations to minimize interference in sources operating with cryogenic-temperature beams.},

The geometry mutual-matching between TP-[11]CPP and C 82 Gd is perfect, and the two main configurations of TP-[11]CPP@C 82 Gd host–guest complexes could be formed spontaneously with high binding energies. Interestingly, the position of the Gd atom in the C 82 cage can be adjusted by its external host molecule. The binding strength depends on the structure of the host, but the binding thermodynamics is decided by the structure of the fullerene cage. The selective binding of empty cage C 82 from its mixture with EMF C 82 Gd is discussed by using a standard Boltzmann expression of statistical thermodynamics. In addition, the FT-IR and UV–visible spectra are simulated, host–guest noncovalent interaction regions are investigated based on the electron density and reduced density gradient, and magnetic susceptibility is preliminarily investigated, which may be helpful for a deep understanding of the present host–guest systems in the future. It is anticipated that such a theoretical calculation regarding to carbonaceous nanosize host–guest structures would be a driven force for the developments of novel nanohoop@EMF systems in functional materials, nonchromatographic separation and even nano single molecular electret devices.},

In the monolayer regime, the VOPc molecules form a self-assembled layer consisting of periodic chiral voids. Further deposition of VOPc leads to the bilayer formation with an O-up top layer and an O-down bottom layer. High-resolution STM images demonstrate that not only single-molecule chirality but also organizational chirality is transferred from the underlying chiral voids to the top layer. The organizational chirality of the top layer manifests as chiral windmill protrusions, distinct from the chiral voids of the bottom layer. After annealing the bilayer to 310 K, strain is relaxed in the form of a mass density wave (MDW). In particular, the organizational chirality inside MDW domains is opposite to that outside the domains, indicating a chiral switch takes place after the strain relaxation.},

Recent studies have extensively investigated triplet states to circumvent limitations imposed by spin statistics in organic light-emitting diodes. Room-temperature electrophosphorescence and electrofluorescence have previously been observed in thienyl-substituted phenazines without heavy metals; however, phosphorescence was absent when spin density was localized on the thiophene units, despite the expected heavy-atom effect from the sulfur atom. In this study, we investigate the spin dynamics of thiophene-fused π-systems lacking phenazine units to enable the effective utilization of triplet states in thiophene-containing π-systems. This investigation reveals delayed emission in the excited dimers of fused thiophenes, likely associated with triplet–triplet annihilation. Optical and EPR measurements, together with quantum chemical calculations, indicate that the fused thiophenes form head-to-tail dimers in both the ground and excited states.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel signal enhancement technique, termed steadyDFS, for quadrupolar solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It can substantially increase the performance of double frequency sweeps (DFSs) for all half-integer quadrupolar spins ( I = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, and 9/2). In steadyDFS, the DFS and readout pulse are repeated multiple times with a repetition time of T R,DFS to generate a steady state that provides substantial sensitivity enhancement. Using a series of simulations, we show that steadyDFS can outperform conventional DFS methods, and enhancements per unit time of ∼5 to 21 can be achieved depending on the value of I . The sensitivity of steadyDFS is robust toward changes in repetition times and quadrupolar relaxation rates of the system. Moreover, steadyDFS is highly modular and can be combined with quadrupolar Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (QCPMG) detection. Using 39 K ( I = 3/2), 17 O ( I = 5/2), and 49 Ti ( I = 7/2) as representative challenging nuclei, we show that enhancements up to 46× can be realized experimentally via steadyDFS-QCPMG, translating to a 20× enhancement per unit time. We applied steadyDFS-QCPMG to protonated and deprotonated samples, as well as to samples with a diverse range of transverse relaxation times (i.e., T 2 / T 2 *), where steadyDFS-QCPMG can provide an enhancement per unit time of at least 7. For samples that are not amendable to QCPMG, we explored the use of steady-state free precession (SSFP). Although SSFP is fundamentally incompatible with steadyDFS, we show that beneficial results can be obtained when DFSs are combined with SSFP in an interruptive manner.},

A pulsed helium Laval nozzle with a Mach number of 6 was employed, achieving a temperature of 23 ± 3 K and a density of (2.0 ± 0.4) × 10 16 molecule cm −3 . The second-order rate coefficient for the reaction between the methylidyne radical (CH) and propene (C 3 H 6 ) at 23(3) K was determined to be (3.4 ± 0.6) × 10 −10 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 using LIF kinetics measurements. VUV (118.27 nm) photoionization ReTOFMS detected a dominant product channel, CH + C 3 H 6 → C 4 H 6 + H, without isomer identification. Another less intense mass peak at m/z 53 was also observed, which could either result from the dissociative ionization of the energized C 4 H 6 primary products or indicate another product channel, C 4 H 5 + H 2 . Given the presence of CH and C 3 H 6 in cold molecular clouds (e.g., TMC-1, Lupus-1a, L1495B, L1521F, and Serpens South 1a), it is predicted that these products can exist in low-temperature interstellar environments.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an approach to describe fractional charging of molecules interacting non-covalently with their environment. The formalism is based on dividing the full orbital space into orbitals localized to the molecule and orbitals localized to the environment. This enables a separation of the full electronic Hamiltonian into terms referencing only molecule, environment, or interaction terms. The interaction terms are divided into particle-conserving interactions and particle-non-conserving (particle-breaking) interactions. The particle-conserving interactions are dominant and may be included using standard embedding schemes. The particle-breaking terms are responsible for inducing fractional charging, and we show that the local orbital space approach provides a convenient framework for different types of perturbative treatments. In the local orbital basis, we generate a basis of many-electron states for the composite system, in which a specific molecular charge may label each state. This basis is used to construct a projection operator acting on the Liouville–von Neumann equation for the composite system to yield an equation for the reduced density matrix for the molecule. The diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix represent populations of different molecular charge states and determine the fractional charging. The projected Liouville–von Neumann equation is the starting point for two perturbative treatments: damped response theory and Redfield theory. The damped response framework introduces energy broadening of electronic states. Phenomenological broadening is also introduced into the Redfield equation. We illustrate the presented formalism by considering benzene physisorbed on a finite graphene sheet as a toy model.},

We apply three types of energy terms for this purpose: short-range potentials are derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of wildtype and methylated chromatosomes, which revealed subtle local changes; medium-range potentials are derived by incorporating contacts between HP1 and nucleosomes modified by H3K9me3, to incorporate experimental results of enhanced contacts for short chromatin fibers (12 nucleosomes); for long-range interactions we identify H3K9me3- and H3K27me3-associated contacts based on Hi-C maps with a machine learning approach. These combined multiscale effects can model methylation as a first approximation in our mesoscale chromatin model, and applications to gene systems offer new insights into the epigenetic regulation of genomes mediated by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.},

This leads to analytical path integral expressions for the Dicke model, as well as its extensions that incorporate effects of static disorder and coupling to intramolecular vibrational degrees of freedom. The hierarchical equations of motion are then derived to simulate polariton dynamics and absorption spectra. By further taking advantage of the harmonic nature of both the system and the effective bath, an efficient exact diagonalization method is also obtained. Similar results are also obtained for the Tavis–Cummings model, the rotating-wave approximation of the Dicke model. Utilizing these theoretical findings, we simulate the polariton dynamics and absorption spectra and analyze the critical coupling strength for the superradiant transition in the presence of static disorder and coupling to intramolecular vibrational motion.},

Electronic structure calculations are done using correlation consistent basis sets with multi-reference configuration interaction to map all the molecular electronic states below the ion-dissociation limit as a function of the distance between the reacting species. Our electronic structure calculations have been significantly improved from our previous work [Liu et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 159 , 114111 (2023)] through improved selection of molecular electronic configurations maintaining a fine grid of 1 a 0 over a wide range of bond lengths and accurate treatment of spin–orbit couplings. Non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements are calculated with the three-point central difference method near each avoided crossing to estimate the exact crossing point R x and coupling parameter H if , which are inputs to the multi-channel Landau–Zener theory to calculate the electron transition probability. Our approach is applied to estimate the mutual neutralization rate constants for the following ion pairs: Ar + –Cl − , Ar + –Br − , Ar + –I − at ∼133 Pa. Our predictions are compared against the experimental data reported by Shuman et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 044304 (2014)]. It is seen that the improvement in the electronic structure calculation results in excellent agreement between the simulation results and the available experimental data to within a factor of ∼2 or ∼±50%.},

  abstract     = {Accurate charge densities are essential for reliable electronic structure calculations because they significantly impact predictions of various chemical properties and, in particular, according to the Hellmann–Feynman theorem, atomic forces. This study examines the accuracy of charge densities obtained from different density functional theory (DFT) exchange–correlation functionals in comparison with coupled cluster calculations with single and double excitations. We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-generalized gradient approximations and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densities that are nearly free of basis set errors. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are, for instance, needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.},

  abstract     = {The non-radiative decay of photoexcited norbornadiene, which together with its isomer quadricyclane forms a molecular photoswitch, is investigated using surface-hopping non-adiabatic dynamics. The simulations are performed using four levels of electronic structure theory: CASSCF(2,2), CASSCF(4,4), XMS-CASPT2(2,2), and XMS-CASPT2(4,4). These electronic structure models yield two distinct classes of excited-state reaction pathways, with different quantum yields for the isomerization. This illustrates the significance of the potential energy surfaces when simulating photoexcited dynamics. The nature of the two reaction pathways is related to topographical features on the surfaces, suggesting potential “design rules” for chemical modification via substituent groups. How the molecule approaches the conical intersection is also shown to play a decisive role in the reaction outcome.},

  abstract     = {Double excitations are crucial to understanding numerous chemical, physical, and biological processes, but accurately predicting them remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the particle–particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) as an efficient and accurate approach for computing double excitation energies. We benchmark ppRPA using various exchange-correlation functionals for 21 molecular systems and two point defect systems. Our results show that ppRPA with functionals containing appropriate amounts of exact exchange provides accuracy comparable to high-level wave function methods such as CCSDT and CASPT2, with significantly reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of ppRPA starting from an excited ( N − 2)-electron state calculated by ΔSCF for the first time, as well as its application to double excitations in bulk periodic systems. These findings suggest that ppRPA is a promising tool for the efficient calculation of double and partial double excitation energies in both molecular and bulk systems.},

However, effectively training new software users presents several challenges. Common methods like direct knowledge transfer and in-person workshops are limited in reach and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, while the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the benefits of online training, traditional online tutorials can quickly become outdated and may not cover all the software’s functionalities. To address these issues, here we introduce “PLUMED Tutorials,” a collaborative model for developing, sharing, and updating online tutorials. This initiative utilizes repository management and continuous integration to ensure compatibility with software updates. Moreover, the tutorials are interconnected to form a structured learning path and are enriched with automatic annotations to provide broader context. This paper illustrates the development, features, and advantages of PLUMED Tutorials, aiming to foster an open community for creating and sharing educational resources.},

Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact KS potential without resorting to the KS orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.},

  abstract     = {The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in both time and space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices to nonperturbatively and exactly simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, thereby reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiments.},

This conjecture is based on the weak interaction between the magnesium atoms themselves and with the helium atoms and was used to explain observations in femtosecond two-photon ionization experiments by different groups. However, this theory is incongruent with previous infrared spectroscopic observations, indicating the formation of tightly bound clusters when different atoms and molecules combine inside liquid helium. In this paper, we report the spectra (from 210 to 2210 nm) of magnesium-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets at different averaged droplet sizes and number of dopants. The measured spectra in this study are consistent with the formation of compact magnesium clusters rather than the metastable foam structure.},

However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become “lumped” onto the same observable “state” or when introducing “reaction coordinates” to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this Perspective, we highlight why, in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.},

This structure enhanced the dielectric performance (ε r /tan δ) by 239.44% over pure PVDF at 10 3 Hz, increased thermal conductivity by 60.45%, and improved breakdown field strength.

  abstract     = {2 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) field-cycling relaxometry and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) studies show that water dynamics in silica pores with similar diameters (∼6 nm) strongly depend on the functionalization of the inner surfaces. In all studied confinements, we observe two prominent changes in the temperature dependence of water reorientation. Specifically, the activation energy of E a ∼ 0.3 eV in the fully liquid state more than triples to E a ∼ 1.0 eV upon partial crystallization at T m ∼ 258 K. Furthermore, in the partially crystallized state, the liquid fraction shows a dynamical crossover at ∼185 K, where the common low-temperature behavior of confined water with E a = 0.4–0.5 eV is established. However, the correlation times of water reorientation are up to two orders of magnitude longer in amino-acid functionalized silica pores than in pristine ones. Comparing the results for different functional groups, NMR and BDS consistently show that the slowdown is strongest for basic lysine followed by neutral alanine and, finally, acidic glutamic acid. Based on this order, one may speculate that the changed dynamics are a consequence of different pH values of water in confinements with different functional groups. Although pH measurements confirm that the pH value strongly depends on the amino-acid functionalization, this speculation must be rejected due to the observation that water with very different pH values does not show diverse reorientation dynamics when enclosed in identical pores.},

Here, we examine structural changes and energetic barriers associated with such a non-classical mechanism, by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using pure Al, Al-0.5 at. %Cu, and Al-0.5 at. %Ni (all FCC-formers) and phenomenologically coupling MD results with phase-field (PF) modeling. Such a coupling involved initializing PF simulation domains and constructing Landau polynomials—consistent with MD observations. Unsupervised machine learning was utilized to capture nuclei structures from MD simulations, while neural networks helped in extracting equilibrium interfacial energies from PF modeling. Atomistic simulations showed that precursory nuclei are comprised of collection of metastable-HCP states with medium ranged ordering. The pockets of HCP states later transform to critical nuclei—containing an FCC core and an outer layer of HCP. PF modeling qualitatively replicated the precursory-to-critical nuclei transformation and showed that the energetic barriers between the precursory and critical nuclei are substantially smaller than predictions obtained from classical nucleation theory. Together, these observations permitted us to propose a holistic non-classical mechanism that links triangular motifs within Al-based supercooled liquids to the critical nuclei via in-liquid structural transformations.},

We clarified that for rigid molecules aligned by dipole transitions, the positions of any two atoms depend on the molecular chirality, owing to the parity-odd second-rank tensors. This type of asymmetry, hidden in the so-called one-dimensional alignment, such as cos 2 θ , can be understood on the basis of the equivalence of inversion and rotation for any two points in space. Perfect chiral sensitivity is achieved when the transition dipole moment is 45° to an axis perpendicular to both position vectors of the two atoms. The positions of two specific atoms are calculated for a chiral isotopomer and methyloxirane using the spherical harmonic addition theorem. We discuss the absolute configuration and the orientation of chiral molecules.},

The solvated electrons were generated by the propagation of a femtosecond laser pump pulse. In the area with a pump laser intensity over 2 × 10 13 W/cm 2 , where a high density of free electrons was produced, solvated electrons exhibited an additional rapid increase in optical density (OD) at 800 nm, 7–9 ps after the pump pulse excitation. In contrast, no two-step increase in OD was observed when probed at 400 nm, suggesting that the absorption coefficient of the solvated electrons rapidly changed around 800 nm after femtosecond laser excitation for a few picoseconds. This observation might indicate the structural and electronic modulation of solvated electrons owing to the high density of free electrons in water, accompanied by femtosecond-laser-induced plasma generation.},

  abstract     = {Benzophenone serves as a prototype chromophore for studying the photochemistry of aromatic ketones, with applications ranging from biochemistry to organic light-emitting diodes. In particular, its intersystem crossing from the first singlet excited state to triplet states has been extensively studied, but experimental or theoretical studies on the preceding internal conversion within the singlet manifold are very rare. This relaxation mechanism is particularly important because direct population transfer of the first singlet excited state from the ground state is inefficient due to its low oscillator strength. In this work, our aim is to fill this gap by employing mixed quantum-classical and full quantum dynamics simulations and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy for gas-phase benzophenone and meta -methyl benzophenone. Our results show that nonadiabatic relaxation via conical intersections leads to an increase in the population of the first singlet excited state, which appears linear within the simulation time of 500 fs. This population transfer due to conical intersections can be directly detected by a bifurcation of the photoelectron signal. In addition, we discuss to clarify the role of the third singlet excited state degenerate to the second excited state—a topic that remains largely unexplored in the existing literature on benzophenone.},

Atomic oxygen was detected using the Raman transitions between the spin–orbit coupled triplet ground states. Atomic oxygen was generated in an H 2 /O 2 /Ar diffusion flame and an O 2 /Ar pulsed plasma discharge. Single exponential decays were observed for the O( 3 P 2 )–O( 3 P 1 ) Raman transition at 158.3 cm −1 and the O( 3 P 2 )–O( 3 P 0 ) Raman transition at 227 cm −1 . From the decay measurements, the atomic O Raman linewidths were obtained from 25 to 150 Torr in non-equilibrium plasma and at 760 Torr in a flame. Enhanced signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of atomic oxygen and atomic to molecular oxygen signal contrasts were obtained by taking advantage of electronic triplet coherence beating. Enhancement of up to seven times in the atomic O SNR was observed. We also found that the dephasing rates of O 2 (v = 0–3, N = 37) were similar, which provides evidence for the assumption that vibrational excitation does not influence the dephasing of diatomic molecular rotational CARS transitions.},

In this work, we employ the highly accurate hierarchical equations of motion method to characterize the spin states and track the real-time coherent flip-flop spin dynamics in a surface-adsorbed hydrogenated Ti dimer. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental observations and reveal the influences of substrate and pulse duration on the spin decoherence process of the dimer.

While the original q-space PFG NMR relies on strong magnetic field gradients in order to achieve high spatial resolution, our current approach reaches comparable or higher resolution using much weaker gradients. As a model system, we simulated gas diffusion for xenon confined within carbon nanotubes over a range of temperatures and nanotube diameters in order to unveil manifestations of confinement in the diffusion behavior. We report a multiscale scheme that couples the above-mentioned MD simulations with the generalized Langevin equation to estimate the transport properties of interest for this problem, such as diffusivity coefficients and NMR line shapes, using the Green–Kubo correlation function to correctly evaluate time-dependent diffusion. Our results highlight how NMR methodologies can be adapted as effective means toward structural investigation at very small scales when dealing with complicated geometries.

As shown here, such representations are particularly well suited for learning free energies using artificial neural networks. As a system evolves through phase space, the proposed methods gradually build a model for the free energy as a function of one or more collective variables, from both the frequency of visits to distinct states and generalized force estimates corresponding to such states. Implementation of the methods is relatively simple and, more importantly, for the representative examples considered in this work, they provide computational efficiency gains of up to several orders of magnitude over other widely used simulation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Delta-T shot noise is activated in temperature-biased electronic junctions, down to the atomic scale. It is characterized by a quadratic dependence on the temperature difference and a nonlinear relationship with the transmission coefficients of partially opened conduction channels. In this work, we demonstrate that delta-T noise, measured across an ensemble of atomic-scale junctions, can be utilized to estimate the temperature bias in these systems. Our approach employs a supervised machine learning algorithm to train a neural network, with input features being the scaled electrical conductance, the delta-T noise, and the mean temperature. Due to limited experimental data, we generate synthetic datasets, designed to mimic experiments. The neural network, trained on these synthetic data, was subsequently applied to predict temperature biases from experimental datasets. Using performance metrics, we demonstrate that the mean bias—the deviation of predicted temperature differences from their true value—is less than 1 K for junctions with conductance up to 4 G 0 . Our study highlights that, while a single delta-T noise measurement is insufficient for accurately estimating the applied temperature bias due to noise contributions from other sources, averaging over an ensemble of junctions enables predictions within experimental uncertainties. This suggests that machine learning approaches can be utilized for estimation of temperature biases and similarly other stimuli in electronic junctions.},

  abstract     = {Peptide classification using nanopore-based devices promises to be a breakthrough method in basic research, diagnostics, and analytics. However, the measured blockage currents suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and a high information density that has hitherto not been fully deciphered. Some simple machine learning approaches using average current blockade depths and dwell-times have been investigated to improve this situation. In this work, a comprehensive statistical analysis of nanopore current signals is performed and demonstrated to be sufficient for classifying up to 42 peptides with over 70% accuracy. Two sets of features, the statistical moments and the catch22 set, are compared both in their representations and after training small classifier neural networks. We demonstrate that complex features of the events, captured in both the catch22 set and the central moments, are key to classifying peptides with otherwise similar mean currents. These results highlight the efficacy of purely statistical analysis of nanopore data and suggest a path forward for more sophisticated classification techniques.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous phase heterogeneous catalysis is important to various industrial processes, including biomass conversion, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and electrocatalysis. Accurate calculation of solvation thermodynamic properties is essential for modeling the performance of catalysts for these processes. Explicit solvation methods employing multiscale modeling, e.g., involving density functional theory and molecular dynamics have emerged for this purpose. Although accurate, these methods are computationally intensive. This study introduces machine learning (ML) models to predict solvation thermodynamics for adsorbates on a Pt(111) surface, aiming to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In particular, ML models are developed using a combination of molecular descriptors and fingerprints and trained on previously published water–adsorbate interaction energies, energies of solvation, and free energies of solvation of adsorbates bound to Pt(111). These models achieve root mean square error values of 0.09 eV for interaction energies, 0.04 eV for energies of solvation, and 0.06 eV for free energies of solvation, demonstrating accuracy within the standard error of multiscale modeling. Feature importance analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and solvent density, together with the properties of the adsorbate, are critical factors influencing solvation thermodynamics. These findings suggest that ML models can provide rapid and reliable predictions of solvation properties. This approach not only reduces computational costs but also offers insights into the solvation characteristics of adsorbates at Pt(111)–water interfaces.},

We have performed dynamics simulations in four ab initio molecular models for which benchmark ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) data have been published. We find that the spin-LSC and the previously reported symmetric quasi-classical (SQC) approaches provide nearly equivalent population dynamics. While we expected the more involved spin-PLDM method to provide superior accuracy compared to the other mapping-based approaches, SQC and spin-LSC, we found that it performed with equivalent accuracy compared to the AIMS benchmark results. We further explore the underpinnings of the spin-PLDM correlation function by decomposing its N 2 density matrix-focused initial conditions, where N is the number of states in the quantum subsystem. Finally, we found an approximate form of the spin-PLDM correlation function, which simplifies the simulation and reduces the computational costs from N 2 to N .},

This allows us to fully include the impact of spin–orbit coupling in relativistic calculations and for applications to finite magnetic fields. For the latter, we use London atomic orbitals to ensure gauge origin invariance. It is shown that this formalism is superior to the more common canonical noncollinear approach in relativistic calculations, as it naturally includes all three spin current densities in the closed-shell limit and avoids the projection onto the spin magnetization vector. This is important to easily restore rotational invariance in this limit. In addition, the Scalmani–Frisch approach can be made numerically stable and may lead to a nonvanishing local magnetic torque. However, both formalisms are rotationally invariant for open-shell systems and in finite magnetic fields.},

Here, we propose a unified integration scheme for solving the common sets of equations of motion in MD. To achieve this, we adapted the traditional SHAKE method for treating rigid bonds to a predictor–corrector integration scheme and combined it with the existing time-reversible velocity predictor and box predictor. This new approach enables using both the time-honored Verlet method and the recently improved Gear methods. The resulting unified integration scheme was tested on two simple models and two MD systems: SPC/E water and ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoridoborate). Trajectories in microcanonical, Nosé–Hoover canonical, and MTK isobaric ensembles were generated. The results for Verlet-based methods were in excellent agreement with those obtained using conventional integration methods. For particular tasks, the use of higher-order methods can be beneficial. Overall, in comparison with standard approaches, our universal scheme provides a significantly simpler route to devising new integrators and maintaining existing simulation software. Furthermore, our family of new integrators can be efficiently deployed in massively parallel MD software.},

  abstract     = {We report two analytical quantum mechanics (QM) models for approximating appropriately scaled harmonic zero-point energies (ZPEs) without Hessian calculations. Following our earlier bond energies from bond orders and populations model that takes a similar form as an extended Hückel model but uses well-conditioned orbital populations, this work demonstrates a proof of concept for approximating ZPEs, an important component in thermochemistry calculations, while eschewing unfavorably scaling algorithms involving Hessian matrices. The ZPE-BOP1 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from hybrid Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations within an extended Hückel-type model that defines vibrational bond energy terms using two atom-pairwise parameters that are fit to reproduce ZPEs from B3LYP calculations. The more accurate ZPE-BOP2 model uses Mulliken orbital populations from Hartree–Fock calculations within a different extended Hückel-type model that includes a short-range anharmonic energy term and a coupled three-body oscillator energy term with seven atom-pairwise parameters. Both models predict ZPEs in molecules involving first row elements, but ZPE-BOP2 outperforms ZPE-BOP1 in strained and long-chain molecules and provides ZPEs more competitive with those from semi-empirical QM methods (e.g., AM1, PM6, PM7, and XTB-2) that compute ZPEs with Hessian calculations. This work shows progress and an outlook toward computational models that use well-conditioned orbital populations to efficiently predict useful physicochemical properties. It also shows opportunities for approximate QM models that would shift traditional computational bottlenecks away from costly algorithms such as Hessian calculations to others that focus on reliable orbital populations.},

Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum–classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction–diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.},

Accelerated tasks include matrix multiplication, diagonalization, and inversion, as well as Cholesky decomposition. The scaling of the implemented strategy over multiple accelerating devices is assessed in the range of 1–8 GPUs per node and found to be remarkably regular. Tests are performed on three systems: α -quartz, a microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), and a giant mesoporous metal–organic framework (bio-MOF). Scaling with system size is investigated via supercells of increasing size of both α -quartz and ZIF-8 (up to 648 and 2208 atoms per cell, respectively). The bio-MOF model structure has 2808 atoms per cell, with 33 672 basis functions. We test the performance of the accelerated code with both generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and hybrid GGA exchange–correlation functionals. The efficiency of the new accelerated code is compared to the previous central processing unit (CPU)-only parallelization strategies based on MPI or MPI/OpenMP within either replicated or distributed memory (i.e., massively parallel) approaches. Such a comparison highlights how the new GPU-accelerated code enables calculations on large systems at a significantly reduced computational cost relative to CPU-only strategies. For instance, we find that for the bio-MOF system, the computing time of the linear algebra tasks from a single GPU is comparable to that from the reference approach in the range of 512–1024 CPU cores and 4–8 nodes.},

In this context, computer simulation setups with well-defined open-boundary equilibrium starting states are essential in understanding and assisting experimental studies. However, open-boundary computational methods are scarce and do not typically satisfy all the equilibrium conditions imposed by reality. Namely, in the absence of external gradients, (1) the system of interest (SoI) must be at thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium with an infinite reservoir of particles; (2) the fluctuations of the SoI in equilibrium should sample the grand canonical ensemble; (3) the local solvation thermodynamics, which is extremely sensitive to finite-size effects due to solvent depletion, should be correctly described. This point is particularly relevant for out-of-equilibrium systems; and (4) finally, the method should be robust enough to deal with phase transitions and coexistence conditions in the SoI. In this study, we demonstrate with prototypical liquid systems embedded into a reservoir of ideal gas particles that the adaptive resolution simulation (AdResS) method, coupled with particle insertion/deletion steps (AdResS+PI), satisfies all these requirements. Therefore, the AdResS+PI setup is suitable for performing grand canonical and stationary non-equilibrium simulations of open systems.},

Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase, whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure.

  abstract     = {Cross-linked networks of semiflexible biopolymers are one of the essential building blocks of life as they are the scaffolds providing mechanical strength to biological cells to handle external stress and regulate shape. These protein structures experience strain at different rates often under confinement such as a membrane. Here, we compute the steady-state dynamics of stress and stress fluctuations in a wall-confined, continuously sheared, reversibly cross-linked, sticker–spacer model of a semiflexible biopolymer network. We find that the averages and fluctuations of shear stress and pressure increase by orders of magnitude when the strain rate is increased above a certain regime. The shear viscosity decreases with increasing strain rate except near the critical strain rate regime where it exhibits an inflection. Upon increasing the strain rate, we note a shift from a long time autocorrelation to an oscillatory and then to a sharply dropping autocorrelation function, endorsed by corresponding changes in the power spectrum of the stress. These outcomes indicate a transition from stick to stick - slip ( stress buildup and relaxation ) and then to slip upon increasing the strain rate, and we posit that this has to be a hallmark intermittent response of a dynamically cross-linked network under continuous shear deformations. We suggest that a fluctuation–dissipation type framework, where the stress is a stochastic process and “resistance to stress” is a function of strain rate, can help us understand the stress dynamics in biopolymer networks.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel methodology for the separation of quartz and feldspar under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions. Ethyl-bis(dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide) (Gemini) is introduced as a new collector in the flotation process, combined with sodium oleate (NaOL) to enhance separation efficiency. The investigation focuses on the adsorption mechanism of these combined collectors on mineral surfaces. While the individual collectors, Gemini and NaOL, were ineffective in differentiating between quartz and feldspar, their combination resulted in significantly improved separation outcomes. Flotation tests indicated that at a pulp pH of 7, with Gemini and NaOL at concentrations of 12 × 10 −5 mol l −1 and molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, the flotation recovery of quartz was 46.51% and 40.57% higher than that of potassium feldspar, respectively. Zeta potential measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the Gemini collector predominantly influences the flotation performance of quartz and feldspar. NaOL molecules do not directly adsorb onto the quartz surface; instead, they co-adsorb via electrostatic interactions with Gemini, which minimally affects the interaction dynamics. In contrast, NaOL preferentially adsorbs onto the aluminum, silicon, and other reactive sites on the feldspar surface through its –COO functional group, leading to competitive adsorption with Gemini and consequently diminishing Gemini’s effectiveness on feldspar. This study elucidates the selective separation mechanism of quartz and feldspar using Gemini and NaOL and aims to provide insights into employing combined collectors in diverse separation scenarios to enhance quartz quality.},

  abstract     = {Carbonaceous materials have demonstrated extensive potential as anodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, large-scale commercial use is severely hampered by the slow reaction kinetics and rapid capacity fading. Heteroatom doping can create abundant active sites to improve the ion adsorption properties of carbon materials. Here, we report a novel nitrogen/boron co-doped carbon nanosheet (NB-CN) with abundant N–B bonds for efficient Na + storage. B-doped MIL-68 as a carbon precursor can not only achieve uniform B doping but also serve as the nitrogen doping site to form N–B bonds. N, B co-doping could promote ion adsorption with improved hydrophilicity, while the 2D porous structure can accelerate the Na + transfer kinetics. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of dual-doping and hierarchical porosity, NB-CN shows improved Na + storage performance, NB-CN displays a high capacity of 307.1 mA h g −1 in SIBs at 0.1 A g −1 , and still has a reversible capacity of 157 mA h g −1 for SIBs at 4 A g −1 after 8000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled NB-CNs//Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /C full cell also exhibits the potential application prospect.

  abstract     = {Modeling the evolution of the melt front under gravity in the presence of a horizontal thermal gradient is a challenging issue, hitherto tackled exclusively with the concepts and tools of computational continuum thermomechanics, too phenomenologically driven to have satisfactory predictive capabilities. Here, we show that this complex phenomenon is amenable to treatment by the methods and tools of Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD). To do so, we addressed all the difficulties caused by the necessity of applying suitable boundary conditions and minimizing surface effects so that the bulk behavior of the system in non-equilibrium conditions can be detected. Sufficient adiabatic separation of the time scales permits us to use macroscopically relatively short—but microscopically long enough—time averages to get the macroscopic bulk behavior of the system accurately. To get an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, we had to use an unphysically large value of the gravity. However, we know from NEMD simulations in transport studies that the phenomena produced are stable over many orders of magnitude. In conclusion, our work proves that molecular simulation can be a good tool to study this family of non-equilibrium phenomena, although further work is needed to achieve quantitative predictive capabilities.},

The selection of the accurate TIP4P/2005 potential for water and the adoption of scaled charges for ions, ±0.85 e for monovalent ions and ±1.70 e for divalent ions, are the key features of the model. The use of scaled charges enhances the description of several properties, including solubility, transport properties, the density maximum, and the water activity in ionic solutions. In this study, we will investigate the performance of scaled charges in describing the properties of inorganic salts containing Cl − , Li + , Na + , and Ca +2 in another polar solvent, methanol. The ion charges and ion–ion interactions were taken from the Madrid-2019 potential, while the accurate OPLS/2016 model was selected for methanol. The protocol used in the development of the Madrid-2019 model, particularly regarding the selection of target properties in the fitting procedure, was applied to create this potential using LiCl, NaCl, and CaCl 2 as inorganic salts. Its predictive ability was evaluated by calculating the density, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficients of methanol and ions, and viscosity for methanolic solutions of these three salts. As will be shown, the experimentally observed effects of salt addition are reproduced by the new model, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Furthermore, since the interaction potential is compatible with the Madrid-2019 model, we also demonstrated its accurate predictive ability in the ternary system methanol + water + NaCl.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports two bimodal first-order transformations in the disordered form III of linezolid. The most notable result was the identification of a transient apparently amorphous state, different from the glass, during slow heating from the glass. This transient state was interpreted as resulting from the competition between two organizations, i.e., a locally preferred structure reminiscent of the ordered form and the long-range order of the disordered form, energetically closer to the undercooled liquid than the ordered form. The first-order transformation of the undercooled liquid in this short lifetime amorphous state reflects a polyamorphism in a pharmaceutical active ingredient, which is a very unusual feature in the domain of solid-state transformations in molecular materials. Meanwhile, the bimodal polymorphic transformation of the stable crystalline form II into form III via a transient liquid state during rapid heating can also be considered as an uncommon feature for a polymorphic transition. It was found that both atypical transformations assisted by thermally activated conformational motions into the disordered crystalline form III could be kinetically hindered by the high energy barrier between conformational polymorphs. As a consequence, the polyamorphic transformation can only be detected using the rapid acquisition capability of a low-frequency Raman spectrometer, probing the molecular organization from short- to long-range order.},

  abstract     = {Quantum batteries (QBs) have garnered attention as candidates for energy storage devices due to their inherent quantum advantages over classical electrochemical batteries. However, owing to the vulnerability of quantum resources to disorder, the ability of a charged QB to effectively store and discharge energy may be adversely affected by mechanical motions, thermal fluctuations, impurities, and defects in the QB. In this connection, we study the effects of (i) Gaussian static disorder, Gaussian white noise, and Gaussian colored noise in the onsite energies and electronic couplings and (ii) periodic oscillations in the electronic couplings on the exciton storage efficiency and exciton discharge rate of an open excitonic QB model—an open quantum system that stores and discharges excitons. To efficiently average over the many possible noise realizations, we employ an accurate mixed quantum–classical dynamics method that treats the QB quantum mechanically and the thermal baths in a classical-like way. The results reveal that the exciton storage efficiency decreases as the disorder strength increases, with static disorder causing the largest reductions followed by colored noise and white noise. In contrast, the exciton discharge rate remains mainly unaffected by the different types of disorder, even under very strong disorders. Moreover, depending on the model parameters, the incorporation of periodic oscillations into the electronic couplings could either enhance, have no significant effect on, or decrease the exciton discharge rate. Overall, our study elucidates the effects of different types of disorder and inter-site vibrations on the exciton dynamics in a charged QB, thereby shedding light on the importance of environmental noise engineering and mitigation in open QBs.},

The PES was constructed based on more than 51 000 ab initio points, which were calculated at the multi-reference configuration interaction level with Davidson correction using the augmented correlation consistent polarized valence triple zeta basis set. Based on the newly constructed PES, quasi-classical trajectory calculations were carried out to study the photodissociation dynamics of HPCO at the total energy ranging from 4.0 to 5.6 eV. At low total energies, the HP + CO product is dominant, while the product H + PCO becomes increasingly favored at higher energies. Furthermore, the translational energy distributions of two products are found to be energy-dependent. Owing to the strongly repulsive PES along the HP + CO dissociation pathway, the translational energy distributions of HP + CO are dominated by relatively higher energies in contrast to H + PCO. The diatomic products HP and CO are found to possess the vibrational distributions decaying monotonically with the vibrational quantum number and relatively cold rotational state distributions, consistent with the strongly repulsive potentials toward the HP + CO channel. In addition, the vibrational distributions of HP and CO are found to be quite similar due to their close frequencies, while the rotational distributions of CO have a much more highly excited rotational degree of freedom owing to its rotational constant approximately four times smaller than that of HP.},

Compared to experiments that focus solely on CD 3 ( v 2 = 0), our theoretical calculations give a more global picture. It is found that the vibrational enhancement factors of the total ICS are less than 1 only in the very low collision energy region (<0.55 kcal/mol); moreover, the CH stretch-excited reaction also produces vibrationally cold HCl. These two findings indicate that Polanyi’s rules apply to this late-barrier polyatomic reaction, not only in terms of the energy requirement in the breaking bond but also in the energy disposal in the newly formed bond.

  abstract     = {The mechanism of the chemical transformations of isolated small organic molecules induced by high-energy radiation is of basic interest for astrophysics and astrochemistry. In this work, we first applied a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the products of the radiation-induced transformations of isolated CH 3 COOH and CD 3 COOH molecules. As revealed by EPR, · CH 3 (or · CD 3 ) is the principal primary radical generated from acetic acid in solid argon and xenon, while the FTIR results suggest that this radical is trapped mainly in the form of the · CH 3 ⋯CO 2 radical–molecule complex. The assignment of this previously unknown complex was based on the complexation-induced shifts of the absorption bands corresponding to CH 3OPLA and CO 2bend vibration modes, confirmed by analysis of the kinetic curves, photochemical behavior, and comparison with the results of ab initio computations at the spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level of theory. Most likely, the complex in matrices adopts the geometry close to the theoretically predicted structure with C s symmetry stabilized by the C⋯C and O⋯H interactions. It was suggested that the complex could be produced via the intermediate formation of a CH 3 COOH +· radical cation deprotonating to the CH 3 COO · radical, which promptly decomposed to · CH 3 + CO 2 fragments. We believe that the results obtained in this study may contribute to a better understanding of the processing of acetic acid molecules in astrophysically relevant ices under high-energy irradiation and give a valuable insight into the understanding of weak intermolecular interactions involving radicals relevant to atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and carbon dioxide conversion.},

In this work, the adsorption of methanol on Co n + ( n = 1–60) clusters is investigated using low-pressure collision cell experiments in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Experiments are conducted using both methanol and deuterated methanol in order to examine potential isotope effects and to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. Kinetic data and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus calculations indicate the absence of methanol desorption for n < 10 cluster sizes, suggesting dissociative chemisorption of methanol for those sizes. For larger clusters, the reaction involves a combination of association and desorption, with a pronounced size dependence of the corresponding reaction rates. This size dependence is anti-correlated with the promotion energy of an electron from an occupied frontier orbital to the lowest unoccupied d-state.},

In particular, for this purpose, an original interpretation of the Gibbs equimolecular surface concept has been employed. To perform all the above-mentioned evaluations, the extended Gibbs method was combined with the nearest neighbor interaction model. The results of our evaluations of the specific surface energy agree with the experimental values of the specific surface energy for corresponding solid bulk fcc metals. Then, we have found that the values of the specific excess line energy of the Ih nanocluster edges are positive and fall in order of magnitude within the range of 10 −10 to 10 −9 J/m, which agrees with the available evaluations for other types of linear boundaries. The vertex point energy was found to be on the order of 10 −20 J and positive as well. A hypothesis is put forward that the positivity of the excess energies of the edges and vertices results in their instability, i.e., in a trend for the formation of a more rounded shape of polyhedral nanoparticles, especially in the vicinity of their melting temperatures. In addition, some molecular dynamics results on Ih metal nanoclusters are discussed. For Au and Pt Ih nanoclusters, the theoretically calculated values of the specific surface energy are compared with those obtained by combining the Gibbs method with our molecular dynamics results on the size dependence of the potential term into the specific (per atom) internal energy of Ih nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {An elusive short-lived mixed dihalide radical anion (BrCl ·− ), produced in water by radiation-induced reactions, has been observed and analyzed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy (TRRR) and density functional theory. The Raman spectrum of the radical consists of a prominently enhanced stretching vibration, represented by a band at 212 cm −1 and its overtones. Calculations by range-separated hybrid density functionals (ωB97x and LC-ωPBE) reproduce the experimental vibrational frequency well, with a corresponding bond length of 2.713 (±0.028) Å. A first order anharmonicity of ∼1.42 cm −1 determined for the Br–Cl stretching mode in the radical suggests a convergence of vibrational states at an energy of ∼1.01 eV, using the Birge–Sponer extrapolation. This value, estimated for the radical confined in the solvent cage, compares fairly well with the calculated gas-phase energy, 1.06 eV, required for the radical to dissociate into Br · and Cl − fragments. The Raman detection of a closely related radical, ICl ·− , in water was unsuccessful. The reaction pathways and equilibria have been analyzed to discuss the observability of mixed dihalide and analogous radical species.},

Neutral clusters of up to six 1-hexene molecules produced by supersonic expansion of a gas mixture were ionized, mass selected, and spectroscopically characterized using synchrotron-based VUV photoelectron photoion coincidence technique. Ionization energies inferred from these measurements show decreasing trends as the cluster size increases, by about 0.5 eV over the range of 1–6 molecules. Dedicated theoretical DFT-based calculations were performed to unravel the possible structures of these clusters and determine their vertical and adiabatic ionization energies. Our computational search for stable structures considered the possible chirality effects associated with most conformers of the monomer having enantiomers, in an approach with a broad structural sampling employing classical force fields followed by systematic re-optimization using an efficient quantum chemical method. Vertical and adiabatic ionization energies obtained using wavefunction-based methods exhibit significant dispersion due to conformational flexibility already in the monomer, but these effects are magnified in clusters due to their fluxionality at the experimental temperature of about 130 K. Overall, the trends obtained for the calculated vertical ionization energies agree well with the measured data and suggest that possible chiral recognition effects that could stabilize specific structures are likely to be hampered under the present experimental conditions.},

Both adiabatic and nonadiabatic results show many resonance peaks dominated by single partial waves. The inclusion of GP is found to have a large impact on the scattering resonances and more generally on both the integral cross section (ICS) and differential cross section (DCS). In addition, our investigations show that both ICS and DCS could be controlled by the initial alignment of O 2 , and the effect of the GP also manifest in the stereodynamics of the H + O 2 collisions.},

  abstract     = {Coexistence of excitons and free charge carriers can complicate conventional spectroscopic studies of transport mechanisms in layered perovskite solar cells. Because of their large concentrations and absorbance cross sections, excitons tend to dominate spectroscopic signals and obscure observations of free charges in this class of systems. To investigate the effects of interstitial organic molecules on charge transport in photovoltaic devices, we apply a newly developed four-pulse transient grating method with photocurrent detection to layered perovskites possessing a range of quantum well thicknesses. In this method, a phase-stabilized “pump” pulse-pair photoexcites a carrier density grating in the active layer of a photovoltaic cell, whereas transport is time-resolved using the carrier density grating generated by a subsequent “probe” pulse-pair. Carrier diffusion mechanisms are revealed by measuring the recombination-induced nonlinear response of the device while varying the delay between pulse-pairs and phase difference between density gratings. Like drift velocity dispersion, our data suggest that encounters with inorganic–organic interfaces broaden the range of diffusivities in addition to skewing the distributions toward slower transit times. Rather than tunneling through the potential energy barriers associated with the organic material, the experimental measurements support a physical picture in which the photoexcited carriers traverse circuitous paths through the active layer while occupying the phases of the thickest quantum wells.},

One such approach is the optimization of parameterized circuits, but this becomes increasingly challenging with circuit size. As a consequence, the utility of large-scale circuit optimization is relatively unknown. In this work we demonstrate that purely classical resources can be used to optimize quantum circuits in an approximate but robust manner such that we can bridge the resources that we have from high performance computing and see a direct transition to quantum advantage. We show this through the sparse wave function circuit solvers, which we detail here, and demonstrate a region of efficient classic simulation. With such tools, we can avoid the many problems that plague circuit optimization for circuits with hundreds of qubits using only practical and reasonable classical computing resources. These tools allow us to probe the true benefit of variational optimization approaches on quantum computers, thus opening the window to what can be expected with near term hardware for physical systems. We demonstrate this with a unitary coupled cluster ansatz on various molecules up to 64 qubits with tens of thousands of variational parameters.},

The key advantage of this measure, which I will denote as the Manhattan exciton size, is that it directly connects with the oscillator strength of the excitons. It provides a strict upper bound on the oscillator strength of any given exciton for linear aggregates. Finally, I demonstrate that this exciton delocalization measure is more sensible for analyzing super-radiant states compared to, for example, the most commonly applied measure, i.e., the (inverse) participation ratio. However, these two measures together provide insight into the degree of exciton confinement.},

  abstract     = {Solvation plays a pivotal role in chemistry to effectively steer chemical reactions. While liquid water has been extensively studied, our molecular-level knowledge of other associated liquids capable of forming H-bond networks, such as liquid methanol, remains surprisingly scarce. We use large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to comprehensively study the structural, dynamical, and electronic properties of bulk methanol under ambient conditions. Methanol is an interesting species in the liquid state since it can only donate one H-bond while a significant fraction accepts two H-bonds, which imprints one-dimensional linear and cyclic H-bonding patterns subject to significant bifurcations. After validation of radial distribution functions and the self-diffusion coefficient with respect to experimental data, we carried out detailed analyses of the H-bond network topology in terms of chain-like, ring-like, and branched H-bonded aggregates, including lifetime assessment. The analysis revealed that nearly all methanol molecules are actively engaged in filamentary H-bonding, predominantly forming branched linear chains with a significant contribution arising from tetrameric to hexameric rings—in stark contrast to the compact three-dimensional H-bond network of water. Five-membered rings turned out to be the most long-lived cyclic structures with an intermittent lifetime of 4 ps, while rings consisting of only three methanol molecules as well as very large cyclic structures are merely transient motifs. Detailed analyses of the effective electric molecular dipoles disclose a pronounced sensitivity of non-additive polarization and charge transfer effects of the individual methanol molecules to the particular H-bond network structure they are a member of, including its topology, be it linear or cyclic.},

Therefore, this work explores whether atom-pairwise and many-body dispersion treatments represent viable alternatives to using the vdW-DF2 functional with BEEF-vdW. To this end, we investigate the performance of commonly used atom-pairwise corrections [i.e., the Tkatchenko–Scheffler (TS) and the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) approaches] and many-body dispersion (MBD) treatments for molecular, surface, and solid-state systems. The results indicate that atom-pairwise methods such as TS and particularly XDM provide a good balance of cost and accuracy across all systems.},

In particular, we apply the efficient quantum dynamics propagation scheme developed in Paper I to both the forward and the backward propagations in the PLDM and develop an efficient importance sampling scheme and graphics processing unit vectorization scheme that allow us to reduce the computational costs from O ( K 2 ) O ( T 3 ) to O ( K ) O ( T 0 ) for the 2DES simulation, where K is the number of states and T is the number of time steps of propagation. We further simulated the 2DES for an HTC Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime and analyzed the signal from both rephasing and non-rephasing contributions of the ground state bleaching, excited state emission, and stimulated emission pathways.},

  abstract     = {Light-induced spin polarization can be produced in chromophore-radical conjugates by reversible transitions between the excited trip-doublet and trip-quartet states. The precise origin of this polarization is often difficult to elucidate because different transition pathways, promoted by different interactions, can occur depending on the nature of the conjugate. Moreover, the complexity of the expressions describing the evolution of the spin state populations and polarization generated by these transitions makes it difficult to estimate the dependence of the polarization on factors such as the exchange interaction and spin–orbit coupling. Here, we present a theoretical analysis and show that by making assumptions for specific cases, simplified expressions can be obtained that provide better insight into the physical origins of the polarization.},

  abstract     = {Reaction coordinates are a useful tool that allows the complex dynamics of a protein in high-dimensional phase space to be projected onto a much simpler model with only a few degrees of freedom, while preserving the essential aspects of that dynamics. In this way, reaction coordinates could provide an intuitive, albeit simplified, understanding of the complex dynamics of proteins. Together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reaction coordinates can also be used to sample the phase space very efficiently and to calculate transition rates and paths between different metastable states. Unfortunately, ideal reaction coordinates for a system capable of these performances are not known a priori , and an efficient calculation in the course of an MD simulation is currently an active field of research. An alternative is to use geometric reaction coordinates, which, although generally unable to provide quantitative accuracy, are useful for simplified mechanistic models of protein dynamics and can thus help gain insights into the fundamental aspects of these dynamics. In this study, five such geometric reaction coordinates, such as the end-to-end distance, the radius of gyration, the solvent accessible surface area, the root-mean-square distance (RMSD), and the mean native hydrogen bond length, are compared. For this purpose, extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for two peptides and a small protein in order to calculate and compare free energy profiles with the aid of the reaction coordinates mentioned. While none of the investigated geometrical reaction coordinates could be demonstrated to be an optimal reaction coordinate, the RMSD and the mean native hydrogen bond length appeared to perform more effectively than the other three reaction coordinates.},

However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions—two representative soft matter systems—we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.},

  abstract     = {Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate these issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in the presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.},

  abstract     = {We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely, iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks–Chandler–Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation. Our results may serve as a guide when a numerical method is needed for application to experimental data and as a reference for further development of the methodology itself.},

  abstract     = {FFLUX is a polarizable machine-learning force field that deploys pre-trained kernel-based models of quantum topological properties in molecular dynamics simulations. Despite a track record of successful applications, this unconventional force field still uses Lennard-Jones parameters to account for dispersion effects when performing in-bulk simulations. However, optimal Lennard-Jones parameters are system-dependent and not easy to calibrate. Fortunately, physics-informed dispersion energies can be obtained from the two-particle density matrix (2PDM) of any system using correlated wavefunctions. The only challenge is that the 2PDM is a humongous object whose calculation is very time-consuming and memory-greedy. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize the Δ-learning method to address both problems using a small set of water trimers. More specifically, we obtain pure two-electron correlation energies with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set at the cost of Müller-approximated 2PDM calculated at a very small basis set, 6-31+G(d). We also benchmark different Δ-learning tasks designed by changing the baseline and target method and/or the basis set. Our experiments suggest that two-electron correlation energies of weakly relaxed water trimers can be accurately predicted via Δ-learning with a maximum absolute error of 1.30 ± 0.32 kJ/mol traded against a colossal computational speed-up of roughly 40 times.},

In a subsequent systematic numerical study, we evaluate their performance on 48 organic and inorganic, neutral and charged molecules and also compare LISA to two other well-known ISA variants: the Gaussian iterative stockholder analysis and Minimum Basis Iterative Stockholder analysis (MBIS). The study reveals that LISA-family methods can offer a numerically more efficient approach with better accuracy compared to the two comparative methods. Moreover, the well-known issue with the MBIS method, where atomic charges obtained for negatively charged molecules are anomalously negative, is not observed in LISA-family methods. Despite the fact that LISA occasionally exhibits elevated entropy as a consequence of the absence of more diffuse basis functions, this issue can be readily mitigated by incorporating additional or integrating supplementary basis functions within the LISA framework. This research provides the foundation for future studies on the efficiency and chemical accuracy of molecular density partitioning schemes.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have, however, failed to provide strong scaling for MD, as scale-out central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras wafer scale engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144 M steps/s for 200 000 atoms whose interactions are described by an embedded atom method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out. In this paper, we provide an overview of advances in MD over the last 60 years and present our recent result in the context of historical MD performance trends.},

  abstract     = {The genome in the cell nucleus is organized by a dynamic process influenced by structural memory from mitosis. In this study, we develop a model of human genome dynamics through cell cycles by extending the previously developed whole-genome model to cover the mitotic phase. With this extension, we focus on the role of mitotic and cell cycle memory in genome organization. The simulation progresses from mitosis to interphase and the subsequent mitosis, leading to successive cell cycles. During mitosis, our model describes microtubule dynamics, showing how forces orchestrate the assembly of chromosomes into a rosette ring structure at metaphase. The model explains how the positioning of chromosomes depends on their size in metaphase. The memory of the metaphase configuration persists through mitosis and into interphase in dimensions perpendicular to the cell division axis, effectively guiding the distribution of chromosome territories over multiple cell cycles. At the onset of each G1 phase, phase separation of active and inactive chromatin domains occurs, leading to A/B compartmentalization. Our cycling simulations show that the compartments are unaffected by structural memory from previous cycles and are consistently established in each cell cycle. The genome model developed in this study highlights the interplay between chromosome dynamics and structural memory across cell cycles, providing insights for the analyses of cellular processes.},

In this work, we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics systems to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analyzing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer, we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine–dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.},

This study investigates nucleosome dynamics using both all-atom and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on the SIRAH force field. Simulations are performed for two nucleosomal DNA sequences—alpha satellite palindromic and Widom-601—over 6 μ s at physiological salt concentrations. A comparative analysis of structural parameters, such as groove widths and base pair geometries, reveals good agreement between atomistic and CG models, although CG simulations exhibit broader conformational sampling and greater breathing motion of DNA ends. Principal component analysis is applied to DNA structural parameters, revealing multiple free energy minima, especially in CG simulations. These findings highlight the potential of the SIRAH CG force field for studying large-scale nucleosome dynamics, offering insights into DNA repositioning and sequence-dependent behavior.},

This work investigates the thermo-orientation and rotational diffusion of non-spherical particles, with special focus on shape asymmetry, through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that the degree of thermo-orientation of asymmetric particles (cone-shaped) is positively correlated with both the aspect ratio ( R/H ) and the temperature gradient; however, the Soret coefficient exhibits a negative correlation with thermo-orientation. To explore the underlying mechanisms further, we analyzed the variation in the torque experienced by the particles. We propose that the thermo-orientation of particles originates from the combined effects of thermophoretic torque and random torque, which in turn lead to anomalous rotational diffusion behavior. Consequently, we investigated the rotational diffusion characteristics of the particles, observing that the probability density functions of angular displacement transition from Gaussian to thin-tailed distributions, with the degree of non-Gaussianity increasing as the R/H values rise. These results could provide a new perspective based on rotational diffusion dynamics for studying the thermo-orientation of asymmetric particles.},

  abstract     = {The activity of particles can be modulated by external conditions such as light irradiation. Research on active particles with spatially varying activity has demonstrated that active particles tend to accumulate in low-activity regions and form a polarity layer at the interface, directed from the high-activity to the low-activity region. Here, we investigate the distribution and dynamics of individual or an ideal gas of inertial particles in a space with alternating active and passive regions. Our findings reveal that high inertia leads to a pronounced depletion layer in the passive region. At the interface between the active and passive regions, in addition to the usual polarity layer, an adjacent anti-polarity layer forms on the active-region side. In extreme situations (narrow region width and long persistence times), the interfacial polarity layer can even reverse orientation. Dynamically, we observe long-time peaks in the velocity autocorrelation function of particles within the active region. For particles with high inertia, the peak can even exceed 1. Correspondingly, the mean squared displacement of high-inertia particles in the active region exhibits an unusual superdiffusive behavior (∼ t 3 ). In addition, kinetic temperature and pressure differences arise between the active and passive regions. The effective temperature of particles with high inertia exhibits a gradual gradient across the active region. Our study provides new insights into the behavior of inertial active particles under spatially modulated activity and lays the groundwork for further exploration of their collective behaviors when interactions are included.},

The results suggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing the texture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modeling complexity in phase inversion processes, from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter, was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach, the coupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of procedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), such as whipping, coalescence, and flocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables, surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and different phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping temperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes are at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. We characterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as the viscosity dominance at high whipping temperatures and as the overrun dominance at low whipping temperatures on the viscosity–overrun plane, which is one of the state diagrams.},

In a local medium, described by a constant dielectric permittivity, the sign of the far-field electrostatic potential distribution around an object is governed by its electrical charge. We demonstrate significant departures from this expectation in a nonlocal medium characterized by a wave vector-dependent dielectric function. Here, surface polarization due to the solvent, or indeed non-solvent dipoles, may wield significant influence at large distances. The polarization correlation length may not only significantly augment the effective screening length but we also show that the electrical contribution from polarization can compete with and even invert the sign of the electrical potential and the field arising from charge alone. These results hold ramifications for a range of apparently anomalous electrically governed observations, such as underscreening, electrophoretic mobilities of charge-neutral objects, and long-ranged attraction between like-charged entities in water and other solvents.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium silicate (MS) cement, which uses magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) as its primary binding phase, is a promising low-carbon alternative to Portland cement. However, the slow dissolution of MgO limits the release of Mg ions, which is critical for the formation of M-S-H. To address this issue, solubilizers that complex Mg 2+ and promote MgO dissolution have been proposed, provided that they do not significantly hinder M-S-H formation. This study systematically examined the effects of four anionic additives—acetate, citrate, orthophosphate, and carbonate—on M-S-H nucleation and early growth, developing a highly reproducible crystallization scenario. The observed reduction in supersaturation at the nucleation point for specific additive concentrations suggests that Mg-anion complexes may play an active role in M-S-H nucleation, potentially allowing M-S-H to form at lower supersaturation levels, which could be beneficial for MS cement applications. However, as shown here, additives such as citrate, while not inhibiting nucleation, can significantly slow the growth of M-S-H, potentially compromising the strength development of MS cement. Among the additives studied, moderate concentrations of phosphate and carbonate show the most promise, as they have minimal effects on the formation process while potentially reducing the supersaturation for M-S-H nucleation. Although further research is necessary to fully understand the effects of these anions, this study provides valuable insights into their impact on M-S-H nucleation and early growth.},

Two-dimensional nanochannels—in which a single molecular layer of electrolyte is confined between solid walls—constitute a unique platform to investigate fluid and ion transport in extreme confinement, highlighting unconventional transport properties. In this work, we study ionic association in 2D nanochannels, and its consequences on non-linear ionic transport, using both molecular dynamics simulations and analytical theory. We show that under sufficient confinement, ions assemble into pairs or larger clusters in a process analogous to a Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, here modified by the dielectric confinement. We further show that the breaking of pairs results in an electric-field dependent conduction, a mechanism usually known as the second Wien effect. However the 2D nature of the system results in non-universal, temperature-dependent, scaling of the conductivity with electric field, leading to ionic coulomb blockade in some regimes. A 2D generalization of the Onsager theory fully accounts for the non-linear transport. These results suggest ways to exploit electrostatic interactions between ions to build new nanofluidic devices.},

To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach—the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity–molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.},

  abstract     = {The rapid translocation speed of peptides through graphene nanopores poses a challenge, hindering the accurate sensing of the biomarkers. Employing the functionalized graphene nanopores is at the forefront of reducing the translocation speed. The current work details the translocation of a negatively charged peptide endothelin-1 through a bare multilayer graphene nanopore, a hydrogen-functionalized graphene nanopore, and a hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore by applying electric fields. The hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore significantly reduces the peptide’s translocation speed. The time required for the peptide to translocate through the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore is 2.25 times longer than in the non-functionalized graphene nanopore and 1.25 times longer than in the hydrogen-functionalized graphene nanopore. We critically analyze the factors influencing the reduced translocation speed, including the interactions between the pore and the peptide, the conformational changes of the peptide within the pore, the solvent velocity inside the pore, and the solvent’s viscosity near the peptide. The altered solvent velocities within functionalized pores have a minimal role in the speed reduction of peptides. When a constant force is applied to the peptide without any electric field, the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore delivers the lowest diffusion rate. The persistence time, which serves as a measure of the solvent viscosity near the peptide, is the highest within the hydroxyl-functionalized pore. Finally, we conclude that the Coulombic interactions between the peptide and the pore play a major role in its speed reduction inside the hydroxyl-functionalized graphene nanopore.},

  abstract     = {Despite water intrusion in microporous materials being extensively investigated, obtaining a detailed overview of the intrusion mechanism in materials with more complex morphology, topology, and physical–chemical characteristics, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), is far from trivial. In this work, we present a qualitative study on the mechanism of water intrusion in a crystallite of hydrophobic Cu 2 (tebpz) (tebpz = 3,3′,5,5′-tetraethyl-4,4′-bipyrazolate) MOF. This MOF is characterized by a complex morphology; it consists of primary (main channels) and secondary (lateral apertures) porosities. This is similar to some zeolites, such as the so-called ITT-type zeolite framework, but it presents the additional characteristics of high flexibility of the material and non-uniform hydrophobicity. Interestingly, in Cu 2 (tebpz), water intrusion occurs first for some of the channels lying tangent to the surface of the MOF’s crystallite. This is due to hydrogen bonding bridging with bulk water across the (thin) lateral apertures of these channels. In macroscopic terms, this can be understood as a local reduction of hydrophobicity favoring intrusion. Temperature and pressure influence the average number of hydrogen bonds and the number of intruded water molecules, explaining the effect of these thermodynamic parameters on the intrusion/extrusion characteristics of this porous material. Molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to glimpse liquid intrusion in this complex hydrophobic material, highlighting how the classical models valid for mesoporous systems, namely, Young–Laplace’s law, are not quite appropriate to describe intrusion in such materials.},

  abstract     = {We calculate pairing free energies for a series of model monovalent ion pairs with equal sizes spanning a large radius range in the aqueous solution. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the ion pairing strength displays an initial decrease in a nearly linear fashion followed by a significant enhancement at a relatively slower rate as the ion size gradually increases, resulting in the weakest pairing preference for ions with intermediate size. The free energy decomposition illustrates that the ion pairing is jointly governed by a delicate balance of the favorable ion–ion interaction term and the repulsive solvent-induced contribution, with their compensation leading to a small pairing free energy. The dependence of this substantial compensation on the ion size actually dominates the ion pairing strength and the magnitude of the free energy, which accounts for the occurrence of the less association between the intermediate-size ions. Estimation of van der Waals and electrostatic free energies highlights the importance of attractive dispersion forces in determining the shape of the potential of mean force, specifically for large ions with less favorable interaction with water molecules than the water–water interactions. In addition, the effect of varying the cation size on the decreased pairing preference surpasses that of altering the anion size. Our study significantly enhances our understanding of the empirical rule of matching ion size for predicting ion pairing preferences in aqueous solutions.},

The resulting ionic products, formyl and hydroxyl radicals, are measured in coincidence. By analyzing the kinetic energy release spectra of these ionic radicals as a function of the time delay between the pump and probe laser pulses, we identify two distinct formation pathways. Furthermore, we show the manipulation of the spatial emission characteristics of these ionic radicals by adjusting the relative phase of spatiotemporally shaped two-color femtosecond laser fields. These findings offer valuable insights into the fragmentation dynamics of formic acid molecules in femtosecond laser pulses.},

  abstract     = {The primary photodissociation events of acetylacetone and its fluorinated analogs reveal that the translational energy distribution profiles of the CH 3 and CF 3 radicals follow a barrier-impulsive model for the C–C bond cleavage. Analysis based on the one-dimensional potential energy surfaces in the T 1 state, as well as dynamics simulations using on-the-fly semi-empirical potentials, suggest that the C–C bond cleavage proximal to the OH group, in general, is accompanied by proton migration. Interestingly, the near identical fragment translational energy distribution profiles of CH 3 radical release from acetylacetone and trifluoroacetylacetone, as well as CF 3 radical release from trifluoroacetylacetone and hexafluoroacetylacetone, suggest that the dynamics of formation of CH 3 /CF 3 radicals in acetylacetones appears to be independent of the nature of the substituent on the other end of the molecule. In the case of acetylacetones, the C–C bond cleavage is governed by the local intramolecular vibrational redistribution along the complex reaction coordinate, which appears to be statistical for CF 3 release and non-statistical for CH 3 release; however, it remains non-statistical over the entire molecular framework.},

  abstract     = {Low-kinetic energy photoelectron detachment experiments have revealed the unexpected dependence of transition intensities on photon energy, which is hypothesized to result from time-dependent coupling between low-kinetic energy photoelectrons and the remnant molecule. This study explores how the kinetic energy and detachment axis of the photoelectron influence the interaction and modify the final remnant electronic structure. Using real-time simulations on several model systems (H 2 , NO, N 2 , and C2 hydrocarbons), this study demonstrates that electron–remnant interactions are strongly dependent on the detachment orientation, electron kinetic energy, and remnant electronic structure. The results reveal that higher kinetic energies lead to significant nonadiabatic transitions, while lower kinetic energies yield more adiabatic behavior. While generally lower kinetic energies show prolonged electron–remnant interactions, the extent of temporal and spatial interactions does not necessarily vary linearly with the kinetic energy, and the final remnant electronic structure is found to be very sensitive to the exact nature of the photoelectron–remnant interactions. In addition, the point charge model employed for the photoelectron provides a useful approach for the deconvolution of more complete simulations to provide deeper insights into the specific photoelectron–remnant interactions that determine the eventual remnant wavefunction. The findings underscore the importance of considering both temporal and spatial electron dynamics in understanding low-kinetic energy photodetachment processes and provide a foundation for a further exploration of electron–molecule interactions in the low-energy regime.},

Quantum beats of superpositions exhibit temporal oscillations with a frequency of 78 cm −1 . Combining the structure computations, oscillations derive from the structure change from planar to nonplanar geometry, which correspond the coherence wavepackets moving from the Franck–Condon region toward the minimum point of the potential energy surface, elucidating the energy flows following the excitation of 2,4-difluoroanisole in the S 1 state.

The mixtures of multiple solvents are often used in electrolytes to achieve the desired properties, such as viscosity, dielectric constant, boiling point, and melting point. Conventionally, multi-component electrolyte properties are approximated with linear mixing, but in practice, significant deviations are observed. Excess quantities can provide insights into the molecular behavior of the mixture and could form the basis for designing high-performance electrolytes. Here, we investigate the excess density of commonly used Li-ion battery solvents, such as cyclic carbonates, linear carbonates, ethers, and nitriles with molecular dynamics simulations. We additionally investigate electrolytes consisting of these solvents and a salt. The results smoothly vary with mole percent and are fit to permutation-invariant Redlich–Kister polynomials. The mixtures of similar solvents, such as cyclic–cyclic carbonate mixtures, tend to have excess properties that are lower in magnitude compared to the mixtures of dissimilar substances, such as carbonate–nitrile mixtures. We perform experimental testing using our automated test stand, Clio, to provide validation to the observed simulation trends. We quantify the structure similarity using smooth overlap of atomic position fingerprints to create a descriptor for excess density, enabling the design of electrolyte properties. To a first approximation, this will allow us to estimate the deviation of a mixture from ideal behavior based solely upon the structural dissimilarity of the components.},

  abstract     = {Resonant vibrational–electronic (vibronic) couplings in donor–acceptor systems may play a crucial role in driving non-adiabatic internal conversion reported in natural photosynthesis, organic photovoltaic polymers, and singlet exciton fission. Quantum beats arising from impulsive excitation are often employed as spectroscopic reporters of the specific vibrational modes driving this process. However, distinguishing these promoter modes from spectator modes, which do not participate in vibronic mixing and simply accompany ultrafast internal conversion, remains a challenge. This is so because vibrational quantum beats arising from uncoupled monomers can modulate pump–probe transients by themselves. In this paper, we show that vibronic mixing induces quantum beats whose amplitude is anisotropic with respect to the polarization of the light. We propose a readily implementable polarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy experiment to uniquely identify signatures of excited state vibronic resonance using ground state quantum beats by discriminating against vibrational motions (and corresponding quantum beats) that are simply spectators. Through analytical expressions and simulation of two-dimensional electronic spectra, we show that the resulting 2D spectra are expected to exhibit distinct spectral lineshapes with a strong temperature dependence that arises solely due to the excited state vibronic mixing. Our findings suggest an interesting experiment to decipher the presence of excited state vibronic resonances.},

The RKS method utilizes the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices to alleviate any numerical artifacts stemming from a finite basis (e.g., Gaussian- or Slater-type orbitals). The KZG approach relies solely on the density to find the XC potential by combining a systematically convergent finite-element basis with appropriate asymptotic correction on the target density. The RKS method, being designed for a finite basis, offers computational efficiency. The KZG method, using a complete basis, provides higher accuracy. In this work, we combine both methods to simultaneously afford accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we use the RKS solution as an initial guess for the KZG method to attain a significant 3–11× speedup. This work also presents a direct comparison of the XC potentials from the RKS and the KZG method and their relative accuracy on various weakly and strongly correlated molecules, using their ground state solutions from accurate configuration interaction calculations solved in a Slater orbital basis.},

This approach, based on the knowledge of the statistical distribution of the Onsager-matrix samples in the frequency domain, unifies the evaluation of diagonal (conductivities and viscosities) and off-diagonal (e.g., thermoelectric) transport coefficients within a comprehensive framework, significantly improving the reliability of transport coefficient estimation for materials ranging from molten salts to solid-state electrolytes. We validate the accuracy of this method against existing approaches using benchmark data on molten cesium fluoride and liquid water and conclude our presentation with the computation of various transport coefficients of the Li 3 PS 4 solid-state electrolyte.},

  abstract     = {Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity often makes it challenging to address potential finite-size effects. Here, we present a specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) implementation of PIMD methods, including ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics (GPUMD) package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects, effectively overcoming finite-size limitations at a relatively affordable computational cost. We validate and demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), liquid water, and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For water, our PIMD simulations capture the significant impact of nuclear quantum effects on its microscopic structure. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient GPU-accelerated NEP-PIMD implementation in the GPUMD package provides an alternative, accessible, accurate, and scalable tool for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.},

While highly intuitive, the physical details of such orbital entanglement effects on the excitation energies of chromophores have yet to be fully explored. Here, using two well-known biochromophores (oxyluciferin and p -hydroxybenzyledene imidazolinone) as examples, we show that the chromophore–solvent orbital entanglements can be elucidated using two quantum mechanical embedding schemes: density matrix embedding theory and absolutely localized molecular orbitals.

  abstract     = {In this work, we examine how the structure of system–bath interactions can determine commonly encountered temporal decoherence patterns, such as Gaussian and exponential decay, in molecular and other qubits coupled to a thermal bosonic bath. The analysis, based on a pure dephasing picture that admits analytical treatment, shows that decoherence, in general, is neither purely Gaussian nor exponential but rather the exponential of oscillatory functions, with periods determined by the bath’s frequencies. For initially unentangled qubit-bath states, Gaussian decay is always present at early times. It becomes increasingly dominant with increasing temperature, qubit–bath interaction strength, and bath correlation time. Initial system–bath entanglement that arises due to displacement in the position of the bath states preserves the Gaussian decay. By contrast, strict exponential decay arises only in very specific models that we isolate. However, it becomes dominant for times longer than the bath correlation time or for early times when there is initial entanglement due to momentum displacement of the bath states. For molecular electronic decoherence, the long-time exponential regime plays a limited role as it emerges after most coherence is lost. Thus, the Gaussian decay provides a more suitable (albeit imperfect) model of such decoherence. Furthermore, we discuss the connection between electronic decoherence dynamics and electronic spectroscopic line shape theory, where Gaussian spectral peaks correspond to Gaussian coherence decay and Lorentzian peaks correspond to exponential coherence decay. We find that Gaussian spectral peaks, usually associated with inhomogeneous broadening, can emerge from the entangling unitary system–bath dynamics even when there is no inhomogeneity in the initial conditions.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of electronic couplings between diabatic states is crucial for the comprehension of electron transfer phenomena between molecular systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approximations that enable a very fast, yet accurate, estimation of electronic couplings is an important research goal in the context of organic semiconductors. The most popular methods (diabatization schemes, projection approximations, or methods using fragment molecular orbitals) usually involve the use of electronic structure calculations and can be computationally prohibitive if a large number of electronic coupling estimations is required. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy (CubeMap) to evaluate electronic couplings between molecular pairs in an extremely efficient manner. CubeMap employs the well-established linear relationship between the electronic coupling and the overlap integral between the corresponding molecular orbitals localized on the interacting molecules. In particular, CubeMap is based on the efficient calculation of the overlap integral in real space using molecular orbital grids of moderate size. The CubeMap efficiency partly comes from the fact that only a single electronic structure calculation of an individual molecule (reference geometry) is enough for the subsequent evaluation of overlap integrals and electronic couplings in multiple dimer dispositions. We show that CubeMap is particularly appealing to rapidly estimate the electronic coupling distributions in molecular crystals due to thermal fluctuations (dynamic disorder), which is an important effect for the accurate description of charge transport in organic semiconductors. Compared with the methods usually employed to evaluate electronic couplings, the CubeMap approach drastically reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.},

An incorrect energy spectrum obtained from the DFT calculation can result in an inaccurate quasiparticle G 0 W 0 bandgap. This study explicitly investigates the bandgaps of chalcopyrite semiconductors within G 0 W 0 , considering various DFT approximations, including semilocal, hybrid, and nonempirical screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) as the starting point for G 0 W 0 calculation. The superiority of G 0 W 0 on top of screened DDH is evident in achieving highly accurate bandgaps for chalcopyrite semiconductors. In addition, when the Bethe–Salpeter equation is solved, the optical absorption spectra derived from these calculations are remarkably precise. This study demonstrates that nonempirical G 0 W 0 @DDH serves as a cost-effective and precise tool for various applications related to chalcopyrite semiconductors, particularly in cases where a self-consistent GW ( scGW ) calculation is challenging.},

Several EP methods consistently attain higher accuracy than alternatives with equal arithmetic bottlenecks expressed in terms of occupied (O) and virtual (V) orbital dimensions. The cubically scaling methods realize a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.2 eV and are feasible whenever conventional self-consistent-field calculations are performed. O 2 V 3 -scaling EP self-energies achieve an MAE slightly above 0.1 eV and are as feasible as conventional second-order perturbative calculations of total energies. OV 4 methods are more accurate (MAEs ∼0.075 eV) than ΔCCSD(T) and are more efficient than third-order total-energy calculations. An equally accurate generalization with full self-energy matrices and non-iterative O 2 V 4 contractions produces Dyson orbitals in their most general form. Composite EP models that accurately estimate the effects of basis-set saturation drastically improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. No adjustable parameters are employed in the self-energy formulas or in the generation of reference-state orbitals. When Dyson-orbital probability factors indicate that Koopmans’s theorem is qualitatively valid, simple perturbative corrections suffice to approach chemical accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Molecular polaritons arise when the collective coupling between an ensemble of N molecules and an optical mode exceeds individual photon and molecular linewidths. The complexity of their description stems from their multiscale nature, where the local dynamics of each molecule can, in principle, be influenced by the collective behavior of the entire ensemble. To address this, we previously introduced a formalism called collective dynamics using truncated equations (CUT-E). CUT-E approaches the problem in two stages. First, it exploits permutational symmetries to obtain a substantial simplification of the problem. However, this is often insufficient for parameter regimes relevant to most experiments. Second, it takes the exact solution of the problem in the N → ∞ limit as a reference and derives systematic finite- N corrections. Here, we provide a novel derivation of CUT-E based on recently developed bosonization techniques. We lay down its connections with 1/ N expansions that are ubiquitous in other fields of physics and present previously unexplored key aspects of this formalism, including various types of approximations and extensions to high-excitation manifolds.},

Our starting point is a precise operational definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of inflections in time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature–composition phase diagram of the mixture, we find a disconnect between the onset of glassiness and freezing. Surprisingly, however, the onset temperature closely tracks the melting line, along which the excess entropy is approximately constant. At fixed composition, all characteristic temperatures display nonetheless similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a reassessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.},

At the same time, progress in the DFT-based description of the electron–phonon scattering has also allowed to describe the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of hot or photo-excited electrons in several materials, in very good agreement with time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. In the latter case, as the time-resolved spectroscopy techniques provide the possibility to monitor transient material characteristics evolving on the femtosecond and attosecond time scales, the time evolution of photo-excited, nonthermal carrier distributions has to be described. Similarly, reliable theoretical approaches are needed to describe the transient transport properties of devices involving high energy carriers. In this review, we aim to discuss recent progress in coupling the ab initio description of materials, especially that of the electron–phonon scattering, with the time-dependent approaches describing the time evolution of the out-of-equilibrium carrier distributions, in the context of time-resolved spectroscopy experiments as well as in the context of transport simulations. We point out the computational limitations common to all numerical approaches, which describe time propagation of strongly out-of-equilibrium carrier distributions in 3D materials, and discuss the methods used to overcome them.},

  abstract     = {Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment and the consequences of heterogeneity for polymerization speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeneity remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerization to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behavior observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.},

  abstract     = {Single molecule experiments monitor the structural transitions of biomolecules under a constant mechanical force to study their fold–unfold transitions. The activation barrier for such transitions is obtained by inverting the observed committor, which is the probability that the molecule starting from a given extension reaches the folded state before the unfolded state. This work proposes an analytical model for committor analysis of the multi-state conformational dynamics of a DNA hairpin in a complex cellular environment, within the framework of the generalized Langevin equation using a general asymmetric bistable potential with a power-law frictional memory kernel. We obtained exact analytical expressions for the probability density function, first passage time distribution, and the committor. The results are compared with those obtained from steered molecular dynamics simulation of a three-state DNA hairpin, and earlier experimental data. We investigated the dependence of the committor and the corresponding committor-inverted profiles on the linker stiffness, barrier height, and degree of asymmetry in the bistable potential. This model successfully captures the fold–unfold dynamics, reproducing the multi-state free energy profile with asymmetric energy barriers.},

  abstract     = {The effects of damping time of electronic-vibrational resonance modes on energy transfer in photosynthetic light-harvesting systems are examined. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we simulate the linear absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectra (2DES) for a dimer model based on bottleneck sites in the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II. A site-dependent spectral density is incorporated, with only the low-energy site being coupled to the resonance mode. Similar patterns are observed in linear absorption spectra and early time 2DES for various damping times, owing to the weak coupling strength. However, notable differences emerge in the dynamics of the high-energy diagonal and cross-peaks in the 2DES. It is found that the coupling of electronic-vibrational resonance modes accelerates the energy transfer process, with rates being increased as the damping time is extended, but the impact becomes negligible when the damping time exceeds a certain threshold. To evaluate the reliability of the perturbation method, the modified Redfield (MR) method is employed to simulate 2DES under the same conditions. The results from the MR method are aligned with those obtained from the HEOM method, but the MR method predicts faster dynamics.},

One concept of active solids addresses them as active, self-propelled units that are elastically linked to each other. The emergence of orientationally ordered, collectively moving states in such systems has been demonstrated. We here analyze the excitability of such collectively moving elastic states. To this end, we determine corresponding fluctuation spectra. They indicate that collectively excitable modes exist in the migrating solid. Differences arise when compared to those of corresponding passive solids. We provide evidence that the modes of excitation associated with the intrinsic fluctuations are related to corresponding modes of entropy production. Overall, by our investigation, we hope to stimulate future experimental studies that focus on excitations in active solids.},

Sampling near the phase transition temperature in systems undergoing first-order phase transitions, such as the NI phase transition, is demanding due to the substantial energy gap between the two phases. To address this, gREM, specifically designed for first-order phase transitions, was utilized to enhance sampling near the NI phase transition temperature. Free-energy calculations based on the energy representation (ER) theory were employed to characterize the NI phase transition. ER evaluates the insertion free energy of the n CB molecule for both nematic and isotropic phases, revealing a change in the temperature dependence across the NI phase transition. Further decomposition into energetic and entropic terms quantitatively shows the balance between these contributions at the NI phase transition temperature.},

  abstract     = {The walking of a nanorobot with DNA legs requires a preset track to serve as footholds for the DNA legs and a track-matched driving mechanism to propel the nanorobot. Recently, a newly suggested track formed by multiple nanopores has garnered attraction due to its chemical stability. The nanorobot can be powered by biased leg-nanopore interactions along the walking direction. Here, we propose utilizing a salt concentration gradient along the nanopore track to induce an interaction bias based on different local ion screening effects on the nanopore charges. The nanorobot walking behaviors under different salt concentration gradients are studied through a combination of computational simulations and theoretical analyses. We find that the walking properties (such as velocity and directionality) highly depend on the local interactions experienced by the lagging leg. Under strong leg-nanopore attraction, the lagging leg needs a drag force provided by the leading leg to leave from the nanopore, while under weak attraction, the lagging leg can leave the nanopore without the assistance of the leading leg. Therefore, different walking modes can be observed under various ion conditions, leading to the complicated walking dynamics of the nanorobot driven by the salt concentration gradients.},

Coacervation is crucial for many biological processes and novel synthetic materials, where the environment is often filled with other neutral molecules (crowders). Yet, the complex role of crowders in complex coacervation has not been studied systematically under controlled conditions. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of coacervation in the presence of polymeric crowders of varying concentrations and chain lengths. While short crowders do not have any significant effect on coacervation, larger crowders stabilize the coacervate against added salt, increasing its critical salt concentration. The change in critical salt concentration saturates for long crowders at a value determined by the crowder concentration. Rescaling all phase diagrams by their critical salt concentration leads to a collapse of the data, which demonstrates a universal phase behavior. Our simulation indicates that the inability of crowder chains to mix with the polyelectrolytes is the driving force behind crowding effects. These testable predictions provide a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of crowding effects in complex coacervation.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are employed to explore the conformational behavior of globally neutral polyampholytes under good solvent conditions. The interplay between non-Coulomb repulsions and sequence-dependent Coulomb attractions of monomers results in qualitatively different types of electrostatically driven chain contraction for diblock, random, and alternating statistics. At increasing the solution Bjerrum length l b , diblock and random polyampholytes exhibit a smooth coil-globule crossover, with the globule size continuously decreasing with l b according to the theoretical power laws. This confirms the scaling picture of the globule interior consisting of oppositely charged blobs attracting each other via long-range electrostatic forces and repelling via short-range two-body interactions. In contrast, alternating polyampholytes collapse completely analogously to neutral chains because Coulomb interactions in them are effectively dipole–dipole short-range. The transition region shrinks with increasing chain length, implying phase transition behavior in the limit of infinitely long chains. These collapse curves fall on the universal master curve, which is well-fitted by the theory of coil-globule transitions and demonstrates that Coulomb interactions in alternating polyampholytes renormalize (reduce) the dimensionless second virial coefficient by δ B ∝ − l b 2 ⁠ . This study highlights the profound impact of primary sequence on the conformational behavior of charge-balanced polyampholytes in good solvents, particularly the nature of the electrostatically driven coil-globule transition they undergo.},

  abstract     = {Charge conductivity in conducting polymers is typically improved by increasing carrier density via chemical oxidation. However, the resulting electrostatic stabilization of the carriers by the dopant ions, combined with their nanostructural environment, are both known to crucially affect charge trapping. Although the effects of charge–ion electrostatic interactions on carrier trapping have been well-characterized using conventional infrared (IR) spectroscopy, the impacts of the polymer chain ordering and energetic environment are difficult to disentangle. In this study, we examine the limitations of conventional IR absorption spectroscopy and introduce a complementary spectroscopic approach capable of discerning polaron trapping more generally. To do so, we investigated films of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) chemically doped using four different oxidants, of which each preferentially dopes the amorphous and crystalline (lamellar) phases to varying extents. Using this model system, we observed counterintuitive shifts in the polaron IR absorption band, indicating that IR spectroscopy is a clear reporter of trapping only when the carriers exclusively reside in the lamellar phase and in the absence of bipolarons or coupled polarons. Alternatively, we found that polaron excited state dynamics, probed using ultrafast near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy, more clearly report on charge trapping. This study demonstrates near-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy as a complementary tool for probing charge trapping in conducting polymers when doping induces carriers in different nanostructural environments.},

This study explores amorphous InSnZnO thin films deposited via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) and the development of high-performance PEALD ITZO thin-film transistors (TFTs) with different active layer thicknesses, fabricated under a low thermal budget of 200 °C. By optimizing the deposition process of binary oxides InO x , SnO x , and ZnO x , a shared temperature window of 170–180 °C was identified for ITZO thin-film deposition. The deposited ITZO films, irrespective of thickness, exhibit an amorphous phase. Moreover, a reduction in ITZO film thickness from 24 to 4.8 nm leads to an increase in the optical bandgap from 3.35 to 3.65 eV. The channel thickness significantly impacts the threshold voltage and carrier density of ITZO TFTs. Optimized ITZO TFTs with a 16 nm channel thickness demonstrate excellent electrical performance, including a threshold voltage of −0.58 V, a field-effect mobility of 29 cm 2 /V s, an on/off ratio exceeding 10 8 , and a subthreshold swing of 74 mV/dec. Furthermore, the optimized ITZO TFT exhibits excellent stability under positive bias stress at 2 MV/cm, with a threshold voltage shift of 0.15 V after 3600 s. Consequently, ALD-based ITZO emerges as a promising channel material for future applications in transparent electronics and flat-panel displays.},

  abstract     = {Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and coupled cluster theory restricted to paired double excitations (pCCD) are emerging as efficient methodologies for accounting for the so-called non-dynamic electronic correlation effects. Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions.

  abstract     = {Singlet fission (SF) in molecular semiconductors is a photophysical process of spontaneous splitting of the excited singlet state into a pair of triplet excitons (TT-pair). This process is usually strongly influenced by spin-selective back geminate TT-annihilation (TTA). Spin selectivity manifests itself in magnetic field effects (MFEs) on both TTA and SF kinetics, the study of which allows us to reveal some specific features of this kinetics. In our work, we analyze the mechanism of MFE generation in TTA and SF processes in amorphous molecular semiconductors. In this mechanism, the MFEs are assumed to be determined by magnetic field dependent spin–lattice relaxation (SLR) in TT-pairs, generated by the zero-field splitting interaction (in T-excitons), fluctuating due to T-exciton hopping over arbitrarily oriented molecules in amorphous semiconductors. The SLR-transitions are described with a semiempirical model, which makes it possible to obtain the SF-kinetic functions in analytical form. The mechanism of SLR-assisted MFEs is found to be very efficient in TTA and SF processes. The obtained results are analyzed in detail and applied to interpret experimentally observed SF-kinetic dependences in various magnetic fields. In particular, it is shown that the proposed model of SLR-generated MFEs enables one to describe the effect of crossing of SF-kinetic functions, corresponding to different magnetic fields.},

However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.},

Using dibutyl phosphate (DBP) as a representative for partially aqueous soluble surfactants, the specific ion effect (SIE) of the Hofmeister series cations Cs + , Na + , Li + , and Mg 2+ on the partition and interaction between surfactant molecules and water molecules in the air–aqueous interface are investigated using vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy and surface tension measurements. In the presence of 1 mM and 1M bulk aqueous phase ionic strength salt concentrations, fundamental qualitative relationships are observed for the salting out of DBP relative to bulk aqueous phase nitrate salt concentrations and the specific cations species. At 1 mM ionic strength, the interfacial charge and hence the interfacial potential modulates the electrostatic interactions; in particular, the counter cations partially screen the negatively charged interface induced by the DBP in a direct Hofmeister order. At 1M ionic strength, the electric field at the interface or interfacial potential is effectively neutralized, and the counter cations promote the partitioning of DBP to the interface depending on their specific interaction with the DBP head group and metal ion hydration properties. The present results lay a foundation to study SIEs of heavier metals on hydrophobic-aqueous DBP interfaces.},

The electron energy level in Y6 becomes lower with increasing distance from the interface with PM6 at which the crystallinity is lower than in the bulk region. Electrostatic interactions from the multipoles of Y6 stabilize the electron in the crystalline region. The PM6-ITIC donor–acceptor interface also exhibits a similar potential cascade owing to the quadruple of ITIC. The potential cascade destabilizes charge transfer states at the PM6-Y6 interface, thereby decreasing the potential barrier for charge separation.

  abstract     = {Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for studying molecules, liquids and solids. While Raman spectra can be obtained theoretically from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this requires the calculation of electronic polarizability along the simulation trajectory. First-principles calculations of electronic polarizability are computationally expensive, motivating the development of atomistic models for the evaluation of the changes in the electronic polarizability with the changes in the atomic coordinates of the system. The bond polarizability model (BPM) is one of the oldest and simplest such atomistic models but cannot reproduce the effects of angular vibrations, leading to inaccurate modeling of Raman spectra. Here, we demonstrate that the generalization of BPM through the inclusion of terms for atom pairs that are traditionally considered to be not involved in bonding dramatically improves the accuracy of polarizability modeling and Raman spectra calculations. The generalized BPM (GBPM) reproduces the ab initio polarizability and Raman spectra for a range of tested molecules (SO 2 , H 2 S, H 2 O, NH 3 , CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and CH 3 CH 2 OH) with high accuracy and also shows significantly improved agreement with ab initio results for the more complex ferroelectric BaTiO 3 systems. For liquid water, the anisotropic Raman spectrum derived from atomistic MD simulations using the GBPM evaluation of polarizability shows significantly improved agreement with the experimental spectrum compared to the spectrum derived using the BPM. Thus, the GBPM can be used for the modeling of Raman spectra using large-scale molecular dynamics and provides a good basis for the further development of atomistic polarizability models.},

  abstract     = {Understanding charge photogeneration processes in polymer solar cells utilizing polymerized Y-molecule acceptors (PYMAs) is of great importance for design and optimization of high-performance solar cells. In this work, excited state dynamics in PYMAs (PYT, PY-DT) and corresponding solar cells were comparably studied with those of Y small molecules (Y5, Y6) by using the steady state and time-resolved spectroscopies as well as time-dependent density functional theory calculation. We find that PYMA (PYT, PY-DT) films exhibit smaller Stokes shifts than that of Y small molecules, indicating a more rigid backbone of PYMAs. Temperature-dependent steady-state PL measurement reveals that compared to small molecule films, the energy barrier from radiative to non-radiative states is smaller in PYMA films. In addition, transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the exciton diffusion process in PYT and PY-DT are mainly intra-chain exciton diffusion mechanism with exciton diffusion coefficients of 1.7 × 10 −2 and 2.7 × 10 −2 cm 2 s −1 , respectively, in contrast with the inter-molecular exciton diffusion in Y5 and Y6 films. For the blend films, the phase sizes of acceptors in PM6:PYT and PM6:PY-DT are determined as 2.3 and 3.3 nm, respectively, smaller than that of Y6 (4.7 nm) in the PM6:Y6 film. In addition, unlike bimolecular recombination in classical system PM6:Y6, the PYMA-based all-polymer solar cells exhibit geminate type recombination in ultrafast timescale. We find that carrier lifetime plays a critical role in the performance of PYMA-based polymer solar cells. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the photophysical properties of PYMAs, which is pivotal for designing highly efficient all-polymer solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enabled by computationally efficient semiempirical potentials are an invaluable tool for materials modeling. In the case of metallic alloys, embedded atom method (EAM) and Finnis–Sinclair (FS) potentials are a reasonable choice based on their good balance of quality and computational cost. However, these semiempirical potentials are not suitable for simulating ionic systems, which prevents their use in studying many technologically relevant metal–oxide systems. The charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP), which can utilize EAM/FS potentials available in the literature together with a variable charge representation of electrostatic interactions, should be a reasonable choice for performing reliable and computationally efficient MD simulations of such systems. However, only a few such potentials are available in the literature, and their computational cost is much higher compared to EAM/FS potentials. In the present work, we have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by combining several modifications to the CTIP model proposed in the literature and efficiently implementing them into the widely used Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator MD code. Using these modifications, we have developed a new Ni–O CTIP parameterization, which has been tested in several different scenarios of interest. First, the early stages of Ni surface oxidation were simulated, demonstrating the nucleation and growth of a crystalline NiO film across the surface. Second, solidification and vitrification in the Ni–O system were investigated, demonstrating that the new CTIP parameterization provides reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined equilibrium phase diagram. Finally, we studied the interaction of dislocations in a Ni matrix with a NiO inclusion using a simulation cell with an unprecedented number of atoms for a variable charge MD simulation. Thus, the approach utilized in the present study is an efficient method to simulate large scale atomic mechanisms in metal–oxide systems.},

In this study, the phase formation behavior and thermoelectric transport properties of a CoTe 2 –CoSe 2 solid solution alloy were investigated by synthesizing a series of Co(Te 1− x Se x ) 2 compositions, where x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0. For x = 0, 0.25, and 0.50, the orthorhombic phase of CoTe 2 was observed, while for x = 0.75, the orthorhombic phase of CoTe 2 and cubic phase of CoSe 2 coexisted. Up to x = 0.50, the power factor decreased slightly as the Hall mobility and the density-of-state effective mass decreased. The total thermal conductivity decreased as x increased to 0.50, owing to a decrease in the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity. Despite the decrease in total thermal conductivity, no significant increase in zT values was observed in the range of x = 0.25–0.50 due to a more pronounced decrease in the power factor. Nevertheless, cubic phase CoSe 2 exhibited higher power factors and thus higher zT of 0.13 at 700 K. Further analysis based on single Kane band model suggests that significant enhancement in the power factor and zT could be achieved by reducing the carrier concentration from ∼10 21 to ∼10 19 cm −3 for all compositions.},

In this work, we report the detection of a much higher (about four times) spin asymmetry in SrTiO 3 (011) by spin resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, with samples characterized also by core level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction. The explanation of a so important spin asymmetry is related to the partial neutralization of O 2 (4−) or SrTiO(4+) end layers. Missing electrons from O 2p states in the case of O 2 terminations enable robust atomic spins, according to Hund’s rule. The parallel analysis of core level shifts for surface atoms and the amplitude of spin asymmetry suggests that 50% of the oxygens from the surface SrO layer of SrTiO 3 (001) have a 2p 5 configuration with an unpaired electron (the rest are in a 2p 6 configuration), while in the case of O 2 terminated SrTiO 3 (011), about 50% of surface oxygens have a 2p 5 configuration and 50% of surface oxygens are neutral (2p 4 ), yielding a net charge per O 2 surface unit cell of (−1) instead of (−4).

The results show that as-prepared ZnS/SnS 2 consists of hybrid morphological microparticles and exhibits a nanoparticle/nanosheet interspersed structure. The multi-touch interface of the constructed heterostructures can significantly shorten the carrier transport path and greatly promote the charge separation and transfer under the action of the local electric field at the semiconductor/semiconductor interface. Exposed dual-crystal planes of SnS 2 coupled with ZnS enrich the active sites and enhance the performance of pure SnS 2 and ZnS material.

  abstract     = {The complex interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic state variables of strongly correlated insulator thin films is drawing interest as it shows memristive behavior that may be applicable to neuromorphic computing. Cerium oxide is an interesting material as its band structure is modified due to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects. The polaron formation that results from the reduction of the Ce 4+ state to the Ce 3+ state through oxygen vacancies is crucial for the electron transport in cerium oxide and is strongly influenced by temperature. In this work, we examined the relationship between the change in band structure and the associated conductivity at lower temperatures when ceria is exposed to light. Following light excitation, the creation of oxygen vacancies results in electron localization in the Ce 4f state, followed by the electron transition from 4f 1 to 4f 0 , generating the PL spectra. With decreasing temperature, the lattice vibration decreases, and the splitting in the PL peak at a particular energy state validates the weaker electron–phonon interaction with an exciton trap. This reduces the carrier mobility of the film as observed from the resistance vs temperature curve of ceria under dark conditions. When excited by a particular energy of light, the electrons move more easily from the defect state to the conduction band, increasing conductivity at much lower temperatures than the conductivity under dark conditions.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the behavior of nitrogen and other liquefied gases under shock compression, with a focus on temperature variations and molecular dissociation. Through dynamic compression experiments on liquefied Ar, O 2 , CO, and N 2 , we aimed to understand shock-induced cooling and radiance changes at the sample/lithium fluoride (LiF) interface. The experiments were conducted using a setup involving a Doppler pin system and pyrometer to measure shock velocities, pressures, and temperatures across the interface between shocked liquids and LiF. Under the first-shock, molecular liquids experienced partial dissociation due to a rapid rise in pressure, density, and temperature within nanoseconds. Upon re-shocking at the sample/LiF interface, a radiance drop was observed for all liquids except Ar. Our data analysis suggests that the cooling effect is likely due to a chemical reaction occurring at the interface between reactive species, produced during the initial shock, and the layer of LiF at the surface under re-shock conditions. One probable interpretation is that this reaction formed a thin, partially transparent layer on the LiF, which absorbed a significant portion of the radiation emitted by the shocked fluid. Thus, the observed temperature drop in re-shocked liquid nitrogen is likely attributable to radiation reduction.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal is a promising high-capacity anode material for solid-state batteries, but it typically suffers from poor cyclability. Carbon scaffold hosts have the potential to improve this performance due to their high electronic conductivity and large surface area, which facilitates lithium-ion adsorption and desorption. Scaffold surface chemistry is known to significantly influence performance outcomes, but the details of these interactions are not fully understood. This study employs first-principles simulations to explore lithium transport and nucleation on graphene anodes with various surface chemistries. Using enhanced sampling techniques, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculations, we find that although surface chemistry has a minimal impact on lithium interfacial transport, it influences surface nucleation significantly. Both heteroatom dopants and intrinsic defects lower the nucleation barrier, creating a more favorable environment for lithium nucleation compared to pristine graphene. In addition, our results reveal a complex interplay between surface lithium concentration, lithium transport, and nucleation kinetics. These findings highlight the potential of surface modifications to precisely control nucleation processes on carbon-based anodes and provide design guidance for reducing dendrite formation and improving the cycle life of solid-state batteries.},

The 1D-VSFG spectra show a broad positive peak in the hydrogen-bonded region, which means that water molecules are oriented upward toward the lipid bilayer. Although DMPC is a zwitterionic lipid, the negatively charged phosphate group primarily influences the orientation of the water molecules. The absence of a dangling peak in the 1D- and 2D-VSFG spectra shows that the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the lipid headgroup atoms. The spectral diffusion timescales obtained from the 2D-VSFG metrics of the slope of the nodal line clearly reveal a dynamical crossover and exhibit Arrhenius behavior with different activation energies before and after the melting of the lipid bilayer. Apart from 2D-VSFG, the frequency fluctuation time correlation function also exhibits a dynamical crossover upon melting of the lipid bilayer.},

  abstract     = {We have investigated the liquid–vapor interface of aqueous acetic acid solution through calculations of the structure and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectra of the interfaces for varying concentrations of the acetic acid (AA). Our findings reveal the surface propensity of the AA molecules. As the concentration of AA increases, more AA molecules are found to be present in the interfacial region. The AA molecules at the interface are found to be oriented in a manner where the hydrophobic part (methyl chain) is oriented toward the vapor phase and the hydrophilic part is pointed toward the liquid phase. The total VSFG spectrum reveals that the intensity of the peak of dangling OH groups of water around 3750 cm −1 decreases when the concentration of AA increases, while the intensity of the peak around 3550 cm −1 due to OH groups having hydrogen bonds between water and AA molecules increases. Furthermore, the latter peak is redshifted as the AA concentration increases, which is due to the partial cancellation between the positive response of water OH modes and the negative response of the OH modes of AA molecules. It is also noted that the AA molecules make the interfacial water more structured by making hydrogen bonds with its otherwise dangling OH modes at the surface.},

  abstract     = {Reorienting polyatomic ions such as NH 4 + and NO 3 − exhibit weak magnetic fields because the ions at the extremities trace out current loops; if the periodic reorientations become long-range ordered (i.e., gearing of neighboring NO 3 − ), then the magnetic susceptibility should exhibit a unique signature along the different crystallographic axes. For the case of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ), we report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic susceptibility along the a - and b -axes upon crossing its order–disorder phase transition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest that the first step pertains to the NO 3 − planes shifting away from facing only along the b -axis and onto the a -axis by 45°. The second step is attributed to the disordering (ungearing) of the NH 4 + and NO 3 − . In contrast, only one step was observed in the magnetic susceptibility along the c -axis, and its large magnitude suggests that the NO 3 − remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find evidence that the NH 4 + become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c -axis only until phase V. The approach employed in this work can be extended to experimentally study the lattice dynamics of other solids possessing planar ions such as amphidynamic crystals.},

Using time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance to observe light-induced generation and transfer of quantum entanglement, we directly observed a photoexcited quartet state generated in a radical-chromophore coupled system and clarified details of the electron spin polarization mechanism including a decoherence effect by activation of anisotropic molecular motion by the steric effects.},

The rounded dynamical transition around ϕ d , which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ( > ϕ d ) ⁠ . Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around ϕ d , which not only depends on the pinning method but is also different from ϕ d of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wavelength limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multiparticle structure factor, S m p c ( q , t ) ⁠ , that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamical length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of S m p c ( q , t ) ⁠ , increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in a glass-forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.},

In this work, we investigate the microscopic dynamics of a CuZr glass former with oxygen content up to 2 at. % using molecular dynamics simulations based on specially developed neural network interatomic potentials. Our findings indicate a gradual increase in the glass transition temperature with oxygen addition, with an anomalous peak at 0.4 at. % O. We reveal an anti-correlation of kinetic fragility and dynamic heterogeneity behind this unusual rise, where the system exhibits reduced kinetic fragility alongside more significant dynamic heterogeneity. Using the continuous time random walk method, we show that at 0.4 at. % O, a highly mobile Cu atomic layer forms around O–Zr clusters, resulting in notable dynamic heterogeneity. This dynamic behavior is closely linked to the bonding pattern within the O–Zr network, particularly favoring the configuration with edge and surface sharing. In addition, such structures contribute to a more compact O–Zr network, leading to lower kinetic fragility. These findings provide detailed insights into the microscopic dynamics behind the effects of minor oxygen additions.},

Exploiting the scattering contrast between neutrons and x rays, difference functions are derived that eliminate contributions due to O–O pairs, revealing, for the first time, the nearest-neighbor B–B peak in the pair distribution function. This peak occurs at r BB = 2.430(1) Å in B 2 O 3 glass, consistent with a mean B–O–B bond angle β ≃ 124° and a large boroxol ring fraction. In the liquid, a much larger r BB ≃ 2.54 Å and β ≃ 134° are indicative of either a much lower ring fraction f , a larger non-ring B–O–B bond angle, β NR , or a combination of both.

We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while also considering nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole–dipole relaxation rate of spin 1/2 nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions and includes a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical information from CCMD trajectories is considered, leading to a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, which can also be expressed by the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H–H vector D 0 × τ HH . The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contributions to the 1 H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike what was predicted earlier from fully classical MD simulations.},

C8S3 is known to self-assemble in water into double-walled J-aggregates. Thus far, the molecular self-assembly steps remain shrouded in mystery. Here, we employ a multiscale approach to unravel the first self-assembly step: dimerization. Our multiscale approach combines molecular dynamics simulations with quantum chemistry calculations to obtain a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian, which we then use in spectral calculations to determine the absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectra of C8S3 monomer and dimer systems. We model these systems solvated in both water and methanol, validating our model with experiments in methanol solution. Our theoretical results predict a measurable anisotropy decay upon dimerization, which is experimentally confirmed. Our approach provides a tool for the experimental probing of dimerization. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the dimer conformation is characterized by the interaction between the hydrophobic aliphatic tails rather than the π – π stacking previously reported for other cyanine dyes. Our results pave the way for future research into the mechanism of molecular self-assembly in similar light-harvesting complexes, offering valuable insights for understanding and optimizing self-assembly processes for various (nano)technological applications.},

  abstract     = {The photophysical properties of a boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy, BDP) derivative ( BDP-SA ) in which one F atom at the BDP core was replaced by an O atom and condensed with salicylaldehyde were investigated. This compound has a twisted molecular structure and unusually low fluorescence quantum yield (1% in toluene). No intersystem crossing was observed with a nanosecond transient absorption study. The triplet state lifetime of BDP-SA was determined to be 115 μ s by photosensitizing. Femtosecond transient absorption shows a structure relaxation of ∼1.5 ps for the S 1 excited state. Theoretical studies show conical intersections, which are responsible for the efficient non-radiative decay of the S 1 state, which has extremely weak fluorescence.},

  abstract     = {Due to their unique physiochemical properties that may be tailored for specific purposes, ionic liquids (ILs) have been investigated for various applications, including chemical separations, catalysis, energy storage, and space propulsion. The different cations and anions comprising ILs may be selected to optimize a range of desired properties, such as thermal stability, ionic conductivity, and volatility, leading to the designation of certain ILs as designer “green” solvents. The effect of counterions on the properties of ILs is of both fundamental scientific interest and technological importance. Herein, we report a systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of the size, charge, stability toward dissociation, and geometric/electronic structure of 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium (EMIM)-based IL clusters containing two different atomic counterions (i.e., bromide [Br − ] and iodide [I − ]). This work extends our studies of EMIM + cations with atomic chloride (Cl − ) and molecular tetrafluoroborate (BF 4 − ) anions reported previously by Baxter et al. [Chem. Mater. 34 , 2612 (2022)] and Zhang et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 6844 (2020)], respectively. Distributions of anionic IL clusters were generated in the gas phase using electrospray ionization and characterized by high mass resolution mass spectrometry, energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation, and negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The experimental results reveal anion-dependent trends in the size distribution, relative abundance, ionic charge state, stability toward dissociation, and electron binding energies of the IL clusters. Complementary global optimization theory provides molecular-level insights into the bonding and electronic structure of a selected subset of clusters, including their low energy structures and electrostatic potential maps, and how these fundamental characteristics are influenced by anion substitution. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how the fundamental properties of ILs, which determine their suitability for many applications, may be tuned by substituting counterions. These observations are critical in the sub-nanometer cluster size regime where phenomena do not scale predictably to the bulk phase, and each atom counts toward determining behavior.},

  abstract     = {The photodissociation and photoionization of O 2 and the subsequent photodissociation of O 2 + in the wavelength region of 200 to 240 nm are reported using resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and velocity map imaging detection. A series of two-photon allowed Rydberg states with principle quantum number n = 3–11 converging to the ground electronic state of O 2 + X 2 Π g are used as doorway states to reach the region of superexcited states of O 2 in the three-photon energy range of 15.8–18.6 eV. A detailed analysis of the kinetic energy release and anisotropy parameters of photofragments extracted from velocity map images reveals competition between neutral dissociation and autoionization and leads to the identification of different O + formation channels. Moreover, the measurement of anisotropy parameters for each channel gives additional information on the symmetry of electronic states involved in the absorption process. Formation followed by the dissociation of vibrationally excited O 2 + is the strongest channel over the full wavelength range studied. Ground and vibrationally excited O 2 + ( X 2 Π g , a 4 Π u , A 2 Π u ) are formed and dissociated to ionic products via one and two-photon processes. Neutral dissociation to form electronically excited atoms is important at the longer wavelengths studied and becomes noticeably less important at shorter wavelengths. These results agree with and expand on a previous study from our lab of O + formation at a single (2 + 1) REMPI wavelength, and the results obtained in this study are found to complement our study of the electronically analogous counterpart S 2 , where most of the S + ions arise from electronically excited S* atoms. The results of this study will also be of use in the pixel-to-velocity calibration of any velocity map imaging apparatus in the wide ultraviolet wavelength regions. Because O 2 is a common reactant or product in many molecular dynamics studies, knowledge of its ionization/dissociation pathways at commonly used wavelengths should also be useful in avoiding signal overlap problems.},

Our results reveal that the adsorption free energy of NH 3 on (Fe 2 O 3 ) n ( n = 1–4) decreases with increasing cluster size up to n = 3, followed by a slight increase at n = 4. The strongest NH 3 adsorption energy, 28.55 kcal/mol, was found for Fe 2 O 3 , where NH 3 interacts with a two-coordinated Fe site, forming an Fe–N bond with a length of 2.11 Å. A comparative analysis of NH 3 dehydrogenation and H 2 formation on various Fe(III) oxide sizes identifies the rate-determining steps for each reaction. We found that the rate-determining step for the full NH 3 dehydrogenation on (Fe 2 O 3 ) n ( n = 1–4) is size-dependent, with the NH* → N* + H* reaction acting as the limiting step for n = 1–3. In addition, our findings indicate that H 2 formation is favored following the partial decomposition of NH 3 on Fe(III) oxides.},

Removing one electron from each constitutive molecule results in van der Waals bond cleavages through Coulomb explosion.

Here, we report an experimental measurement of the two-body Coulomb explosion of ( C O ) 2 2 + and ( C O ) 3 2 + ⁠ , produced in a 40 keV Ar 2+ double-electron capture collision with a CO dimer and trimer. Accurate reaction pathways are identified with the advanced ion–ion coincidence and momentum-imaging techniques. The measured kinetic energy release deviates from the calculated results based on the reciprocal of internuclear distance (i.e., Coulomb interaction only) and which, therefore, requires the inclusion of rotational energy of CO + initiated by molecular electric-dipole momentum. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the separation defining the rotational energy takes place within a few hundred fs after the onset of dissociation. This molecular-scale environmental effect significantly brings calculations and measurements of the kinetic energy release into agreement.},

These three Ln ’s were specifically targeted because they vary in their spin state and orbital angular momentum associated with the 4f N subshell occupancies. From the anion PE spectra of Ce 3 O − , Sm 3 O − , and Gd 3 O − measured with 2.330 and 3.495 eV photon energies, we determine the adiabatic electron affinities of the corresponding neutrals to be 0.83 ± 0.03, 1.11 ± 0.05, and 1.17 ± 0.05 eV, respectively. The lowest energy features in all three spectra can readily be reconciled with molecular structures in which the O-atom is central to all three Ln centers, with Ce 3 O − /Ce 3 O assuming pyramidal structures and Sm 3 O − /Sm 3 O and Gd 3 O − /Gd 3 O assuming planar structures. Computationally, the lowest-energy structure of neutral Ce 3 O is a kite-like structure, which is not consistent with the observed spectrum. The kite-like and pyramidal structures of Ce 3 O − are predicted to be nearly isoenergetic. Electronic states in which all three 4f N centers are ferromagnetically coupled are predicted to be energetically favored for all species, but spin-frustrated states in which one 4f N center is antiferromagnetically coupled to the remaining centers are computed to lie 0.05 eV higher in energy than the FM-coupled states for Ce 3 O − and Sm 3 O − . The PE spectrum of Sm 3 O − exhibits striking anomalies in the photoelectron angular dependence. This effect is attributed to strong photoelectron–valence electron interactions that drive nominally forbidden changes in the M f state of the remnant neutral.},

The two-photon transition in the REMPI spectrum is rotationally resolved, allowing ionization from a selected rovibrational state of O 2 . Fits to this spectrum determine spectroscopic parameters of the O 2 d 1 Π g state and resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding its band origin.

We discuss strategies for maximizing the fraction of ions produced in the ground rovibrational state.

The resulting passage effects induce significant responses of magnetizations, most notably an inversion of longitudinal magnetization. The change in longitudinal magnetization can be observed in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), but the passage effect has not been investigated in cw-ODMR spectroscopy. In this study, we combine the ODMR technique with the rapid scan of the magnetic field to demonstrate the impact of fast passage effects on the field-swept cw-ODMR. An ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV − ) centers in a diamond crystal is used as a model system. By selecting the fast passage adiabatic region among six distinct passage regions, efficient ODMR detection is achieved through the macroscopic control of longitudinal magnetization. Experimental results are explained by the numerical analyses of classical time-dependent Bloch equations and related rate equations under an optical cycle.

  abstract     = {This study introduces a machine-learning approach to enhance signal-to-noise ratios in scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). While s-SNOM offers a high spatial resolution, its effectiveness is often hindered by low signal levels, particularly in weakly absorbing samples. To address these challenges, we utilize a data-driven “patch-based” machine learning reconstruction method, incorporating modern generative adversarial neural networks (CycleGANs) for denoising s-SNOM images. This method allows for flexible reconstruction of images of arbitrary sizes, a critical capability given the variable nature of scanned sample areas in point-scanning probe-based microscopies. The CycleGAN model is trained on unpaired sets of images captured at both rapid and extended acquisition times, thereby modeling instrument noise while preserving essential topographical and molecular information. The results show significant improvements in image quality, as indicated by higher structural similarity index and peak signal-to-noise ratio values, comparable to those obtained from images captured with four times the integration time. This method not only enhances image quality but also has the potential to reduce the overall data acquisition time, making high-resolution s-SNOM imaging more feasible for a wide range of biological and materials science applications.},

  abstract     = {Chromatin loop formation plays a crucial role in 3D genome interactions, with misfolding potentially leading to irregular gene expression and various diseases. While experimental tools such as Hi-C have advanced our understanding of genome interactions, the biophysical principles underlying chromatin loop formation remain elusive. This review examines computational approaches to chromatin folding, focusing on polymer models that elucidate chromatin loop mechanics. We discuss three key models: (1) the multi-loop-subcompartment model, which investigates the structural effects of loops on chromatin conformation; (2) the strings and binders switch model, capturing thermodynamic chromatin aggregation; and (3) the loop extrusion model, revealing the role of structural maintenance of chromosome complexes. In addition, we explore advanced models that address chromatin clustering heterogeneity in biological processes and disease progression. The review concludes with an outlook on open questions and current trends in chromatin loop formation and genome interactions, emphasizing the physical and computational challenges in the field.},

Such an approach allows working with the full dynamical self-energy, without approximating the latter by a symmetrized static form as in the standard qs GW scheme. Calculations on the GW 100 molecular test set lead, nevertheless, to a good agreement, at the 60 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respect to the conventional qs GW approach. We show further that constructing the density matrix from the full Green’s function as in the fully self-consistent sc GW scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticle one-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between the qs GW and sc GW approaches, closer to coupled-cluster reference values.},

This method allows for the calculation of transport coefficients, such as thermal conductivity and viscosity. The relation between the induced fluxes and the control parameters of RNEMD (such as the time interval between successive swap events) is not clear. Thus, trial-and-error is required to realize the desired fluxes in RNEMD simulations. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework using extreme value statistics to estimate the relation between the time interval and the resulting induced fluxes. Our RNEMD simulations, conducted with varying time intervals, confirm that the theoretical predictions are quantitatively consistent with the simulation results when the time interval exceeds the momentum relaxation time. Our RNEMD simulations also show that our theoretical predictions, which are valid for a large number of particles for swap candidates, work well even for a relatively small number of particles for swap candidates. These findings demonstrate that the induced fluxes can be reliably estimated, providing a valuable tool for selecting appropriate RNEMD parameters for simulations.},

  abstract     = {The wetting properties of a liquid in contact with a solid are commonly described by Young’s equation, which defines the relationship between the angle made by a fluid droplet onto the solid surface and the interfacial properties of the different interfaces involved. When modeling such interfacial systems, several assumptions are usually made to determine this angle of contact, such as a completely rigid solid or the use of the tension at the interface instead of the surface free energy. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones liquid in contact with a Lennard-Jones crystal and compare the contact angles measured from a droplet simulation with those calculated using Young’s equation based on surface free energy or surface stress. We analyze cases where the solid atoms are kept frozen in their positions and where they are allowed to relax and simulate surfaces with different wettability and degrees of softness. Our results show that using either surface free energy or surface stress in Young’s equation leads to similar contact angles but different interfacial properties. We find that the approximation of keeping the solid atoms frozen must be done carefully, especially if the liquid can efficiently pack at the interface. Finally, we show that to correctly reproduce the measured contact angles when the solid becomes soft, the quantity to be used in Young’s equation is the surface free energy only and that the error committed in using the surface stress becomes larger as the softness of the solid increases.},

The developed methodology is based on the use of Slater determinants composed of non-orthogonal Kohn–Sham-like orbitals for the evaluation of kinetic energy expectation values and the expansion of the inverse molecular-orbital overlap matrix into a Neumann series. By applying these techniques, we derived and implemented a series of orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy, which are employed self-consistently. Our proof-of-principle computations demonstrated quantitatively correct results for potential energy curves and electron densities and hinted on the applicability of the introduced empirical parameters to different types of molecular systems and intermolecular interactions. Therefore, we conclude that the presented study is an important step toward constructing accurate and efficient orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy applicable to large molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a numerical simulation approach to investigate singlet–triplet interconversion effects in organic materials with rigid molecular structures that facilitate the photogeneration of charge-separated (CS) states, such as zwitterions resulting from intramolecular electron transfer. Our approach enables the detailed modeling of electron and nuclear spin-dependent observables, including magnetic field-affected reaction yields (MARY) and chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP). The equilibrium solution of the stochastic Liouville equation can be obtained with simple algebraic manipulation by noting the relationship between the Laplace transform of the density operator and the time-domain representation of the same operator. Experimental MARY and CIDNP data are modeled as functions of key external and internal system parameters, such as magnetic field strength, hyperfine interactions, and exchange couplings. This allows for exploring processes that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible, providing deeper insights into the spin dynamics of the photoinduced CS state. Understanding these interconversion processes is not only essential for the fundamental photochemistry studies but also for the rational design and development of novel organic materials for photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of singlet–triplet interconversion on the overall efficiency of charge separation and recombination processes, highlighting the importance of spin dynamics in the design of next-generation organic photovoltaic materials.},

A comparison of the system with a 5% vacancy concentration with pure lattice data shows a decrease in frequency and a decrease in lifetime for all transverse spin wave excitations observed. In addition, the clearly defined transverse spin wave excitations are distorted with the introduction of vacancy defects, and we observe reduced excitation lifetimes due to increased magnon–magnon scattering. We observe further evidence of increased magnon–magnon scattering, as the peaks in the longitudinal spin wave spectrum become less distinct. Similar impacts are observed in the vibrational subsystem, with a decrease in characteristic phonon frequency and flattening of lattice excitation signals due to vacancy defects.},

Our analysis focuses on a wide range of different cell lines and two distinct organisms and provides a unified picture of chromatin structure for scales ranging from 5 kb (kilobases) up to 2 Mb (megabases), thus covering a genomic region of almost three orders of magnitude. Confirming recent analysis [Remini et al. , Phys. Rev.

  abstract     = {Second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory is well-known as a computationally inexpensive approach to the electron correlation problem that is size-consistent with a size-consistent reference but fails to be regular. On the other hand, the less well-known many-body version of Brillouin–Wigner perturbation theory has the reverse properties: it is regular but fails to be size-consistent when used with the standard MP partitioning. Consequently, its widespread use remains limited. In this work, we analyze the ways in which it is possible to use alternative non-MP partitions of the Hamiltonian to yield variants of BW2 that are size-consistent as well as regular. We show that there is a vast space of such BW2 theories and also show that it is possible to define a repartitioned BW2 theory from the ground state density alone, which regenerates the exact correlation energy. We also provide a general recipe for deriving regular, size-consistent, and size-extensive partitions from physically meaningful components, and we apply the result to small model systems. The scope of these results appears to further set the stage for a revival of BW2 in quantum chemistry.},

  abstract     = {First steps toward a molecular dynamics (MD) implementation in a cluster of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are presented, reaching a simulation speed of a few microseconds/day. The nodes in this cluster are programmed into a mid-ranged FPGA (Artix 7 XC7A200T), interconnected as a 3D torus by fast optical links. The implemented MD algorithm is highly parallelized and highly pipelined internally. The FPGA cluster is freely scalable in terms of size, i.e., a larger MD system requires more nodes, however, without compromising simulation speed. The performance in terms of energy stability and simulation speed is analyzed. At present, the focus lies on the fast networking, while only minimal MD functionality has been implemented so far, i.e., Lennard-Jones interactions and a thermostat, which were needed to demonstrate the feasibility of the FPGA cluster to run multi-microsecond simulations. To that end, the nucleation of a super-cooled Lennard-Jones liquid is investigated by unbiased MD simulations, which is a difficult MD problem since a high nucleation barrier has to be overcome. Finally, the pathways toward a full MD implementation are outlined. The current implementation will be made available as an open-source development project.},

Although these three defects all produce occupied electronic levels near the conduction band minimum, they impose quite different effects. Ov and Ce-int induce strong peaks in the low-energy region of the imaginary part of the microscopic dielectric function, indicating stronger electronic screening compared to the pristine CeO 2 . This causes pronounced narrowing of the bandgap, e.g., by 0.8 eV in G 0 W 0 and 1.6 eV in the eigenvalue self-consistent GW for Ov. Comparatively, Hy affects little electronic screening and bandgap at different levels of GW calculations. For the lowest several 4 f orbitals, the exchange part of the self-energy (|Σ x | > 9 eV) in GW is much stronger than the correlation part (|Σ c | < 5 eV) for Ov and Ce-int, while |Σ c | is much stronger than |Σ x | instead for the pristine CeO 2 and Hy. Quasiparticle weights in Ov and Ce-int decrease by a large quantity compared to the pristine CeO 2 . Consideration of Ov and Ce-int might to some extent relieve the discrepancy between the GW bandgap of the pristine CeO 2 and the experimental gap. Ov and Ce-int could reduce the excitonic binding energy several times and result in optical absorption, which corresponds to the experiments.},

  abstract     = {We present an analytical description of the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) for molecular binding using the Potential Distribution Theory (PDT) formalism. ATM models the binding free energy by mapping the bound and unbound states of the complex by translating the ligand coordinates. PDT relates the free energy and the probability densities of the perturbation energy along the alchemical path to the probability density at the initial state, which is the unbound state of the complex in the case of a binding process. Hence, the ATM probability density of the transfer energy at the unbound state is first related by a convolution operation of the probability densities for coupling the ligand to the solvent and coupling it to the solvated receptor—for which analytical descriptions are available—with parameters obtained from maximum likelihood analysis of data from double-decoupling alchemical calculations. PDT is then used to extend this analytical description along the alchemical transfer pathway. We tested the theory on the alchemical binding of five guests to the tetramethyl octa-acid host from the SAMPL8 benchmark set. In each case, the probability densities of the perturbation energy for transfer along the alchemical transfer pathway obtained from numerical calculations match those predicted from the theory and double-decoupling simulations. The work provides a solid theoretical foundation for alchemical transfer, offers physical insights on the form of the probability densities observed in alchemical transfer calculations, and confirms the conceptual and numerical equivalence between the alchemical transfer and double-decoupling processes.},

  abstract     = {Correlated orbital theory (COT) is an exact one-particle treatment that adds essential electron correlation into its molecular orbitals, potentially reducing correlated treatments of response properties to one-particle coupled-perturbed Hartree–Fock- or Kohn–Sham-like calculations. Such a computation is vastly simpler than the usual ab initio correlated approach that would add correlation typically with EOM-CC after a perturbed mean-field solution. The question then is, how well can this be accomplished via the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) exchange–correlation (XC) functionals that are meant to emulate the rigorous COT framework? This paper addresses this question for response properties by making comparisons between such orbital-specific calculations and those from well-correlated EOM-CC solutions for static polarizabilities, nuclear magnetic resonance coupling constants, and chemical shifts. The simple orbital-specific version provides an accurate realization of the correlated EOM-CC results, but now in a mode that facilitates an orbital-by-orbital interpretation. Here, we compare 33 XC functionals from the different Jacob’s ladder rungs always against the EOM-CCSD results. Thus, the smallest mean absolute deviation for the static polarizability comes from LC-QTP XC, 0.28 a.u. Regarding the total nuclear spin–spin coupling constants, QTP01 performs best, %Error = 10.63% (QTP02 and LC-QTP are second and third best). Finally, the XC that stood out in the chemical shift analysis was TPSS0, which presented the best result for the majority of the chemical shifts. However, considering the overall performances based on linear fitting of all isotope data points, five functionals are recommended for a chemical shift study: TPSS0, ω B97X, QTP00, QTP01, and QTP02, all presenting R 2 = 0.96.},

  abstract     = {We study the transport property through the serially coupled double quantum dots (DQDs) system with Kondo resonance based on the dissipation equation of motion theory. A nonlinear behavior of the transport current is exhibited due to the competition between the interdot coupling strength of the two QDs and the Kondo effect. With the increase in interdot coupling strength, the transport current first increases at low interdot couplings and then decreases with the strong interdot couplings. The reason is that the interdot coupling strength will result in a continuous evolution from the Kondo singlet state of individual QDs to the spin singlet state forming between the two QDs. Moreover, we define the physical quantity ∂G / ∂t as the differential function of differential conductance G with respect to interdot coupling strength t . The nonlinear transport behavior and the physical quantity ∂G / ∂t with differential conductance at different bias voltages can be used to detect the potential Kondo resonance in the nonequilibrium transport experiments.},

One force is directed toward the minimum-energy point, while the other is directed toward the conical intersection seam. The root-mean-square deviation based bias potential is added to the potential energy surface to force the structure escape from the already explored regions. The additional constraint function is used to enable the structure reach different intersection seams. This method can be used for systematically and automatically searching MECIs or exploring conical intersection seams. Compared to the penalty function-based metadynamics method, this new method is more effective and stable in searching MECIs. Furthermore, this method can be combined with any kind of constraint, whether geometric or non-geometric, making it a generalized tool for the automated search of constrained minimum.},

  abstract     = {The multilayer-multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method has garnered significant attention in the realm of theoretical chemistry owing to its powerful ability to perform numerically exact descriptions of multi-dimensional quantum dynamics and exhibit the remarkable performance in simulating the nonadiabatic dynamics of complex systems. Despite the availability of computational packages within the ML-MCTDH framework, executing these calculations seamlessly is not a straightforward task. Typically, substantial efforts are necessitated to configure the correct inputs for ML-MCTDH calculations, which require to correctly define several non-trivial parameters, to reasonably setup the optimal tree expansion of wavefunctions, and to properly select basis function numbers. To address these challenges, we have developed an auxiliary package named ML-MCTDH-Aid, which facilitates the setup of ML-MCTDH calculations using the Heidelberg MCTDH package in a user-friendly manner. This package is primarily tailored to handle the high-dimensional nonadiabatic dynamics governed by the Hamiltonian composed of several electronic states, several vibrational modes and their linear vibronic coupling terms. It automatically generates multiple essential input files, and all the calculations can be performed in an all-in-one black-box easy-to-use manner. To show the utility of the ML-MCTDH-Aid package, we provide a step-by-step tutorial that demonstrates running ML-MCTDH studies on three models. These examples illuminate how the utilization of the ML-MCTDH-Aid package significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of ML-MCTDH calculations. This substantially boosts the accessibility of ML-MCTDH calculations in tackling the high-dimensional quantum dynamics of complex systems.},

  abstract     = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used precipitant to concentrate proteins. The effect of PEG is generally understood to be an entropic attraction between proteins due to the depletion effect of PEG around proteins. However, measurements by Bloustine et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 , 087803 (2006)] of the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) temperature have shown that a lysozyme solution is stabilized and destabilized by the addition of low and high molecular-weight PEG, respectively. They also presented a theoretical model of the LLPS temperature as a virial expansion of the free energy and concluded that, in addition to the depletion effect, the attractive interaction between protein and PEG is necessary to explain the experiments. In the present study, theoretical calculations based on liquid-state density functional theory utilizing coarse-grained models are conducted to demonstrate that the protein–PEG effective attraction is responsible for the suppression and promotion of LLPS upon the addition of low- and high-weight PEG, respectively. In contrast, if the interactions between the protein and the PEG are solely due to the excluded volume effect, PEG of any molecular weight destabilizes the solution. These results suggest the necessity to reconsider the conventional understanding of the effects of polymer addition, which have been historically attributed to solely the depletion force.},

  abstract     = {Membrane properties are determined in part by lipid composition, and cholesterol plays a large role in determining these properties. Cellular membranes show a diverse range of cholesterol compositions, the effects of which include alterations to cellular biomechanics, lipid raft formation, membrane fusion, signaling pathways, metabolism, pharmaceutical therapeutic efficacy, and disease onset. In addition, cholesterol plays an important role in non-cellular membranes, with its concentration in the skin lipid matrix being implicated in several skin diseases. In phospholipid membranes, cholesterol increases the tail ordering of neighboring lipids, decreasing the membrane lateral area and increasing the thickness. This reduction in the lateral area, known as the cholesterol condensing effect, results from cholesterol–lipid mixtures deviating from ideal mixing. Capturing the cholesterol condensing effect is crucial for molecular dynamics simulations as it directly affects the accuracy of predicted membrane properties, which are essential for understanding membrane function. We present a comparative analysis of cholesterol models across several popular force fields: CHARMM36, Slipids, Lipid17, GROMOS 53A6 L , GROMOS-CKP, MARTINI 2, MARTINI 3, and ELBA. The simulations of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) membranes with varying cholesterol concentrations were conducted to calculate the partial-molecular areas of cholesterol and other condensing parameters, which are compared to the experimental data for validation. While all tested force fields predict small negative deviations from ideal mixing in cholesterol–DOPC membranes, only all-atom force fields capture the larger deviations expected in DMPC membranes. United-atom and coarse-grained models under-predict this effect, condensing fewer neighboring lipids by smaller magnitudes, resulting in too small deviations from ideal mixing. These results suggest that all-atom force fields, particularly CHARMM36 or Slipids, should be used for accurate simulations of cholesterol-containing membranes.},

  abstract     = {Heteropolar two-dimensional materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), are promising candidates for seawater desalination and osmotic power harvesting, but previous simulation studies have considered bare, unterminated nanopores in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. There is presently a lack of force fields to describe functionalized nanoporous hBN in aqueous media. To address this gap, we conduct density functional theory (DFT)-based ab initio MD simulations of hBN nanopores surrounded by water molecules. The results reveal a high propensity for hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) functionalization at boron edges, while nitrogen edges are functionalized with H and occasionally with oxygen (O), highlighting a route to tune membranes. We demonstrate the role of the Grotthuss mechanism during the functionalization of hBN edges in water. We develop high-fidelity force fields for H- and OH-functionalized hBN nanopores using potential energy surface fitting based on DFT calculations. The nonbonded parameters for H functionalization are obtained by training a force field for borazine (B 3 N 3 H 6 ). We find that the proposed force field enables stable MD simulations of water/ion transport through B- and N-terminated hBN nanopores. Our results also indicate that previous studies that considered bare nanopores without functional groups overestimated the water flux and underestimated the ionic rejection of nanoporous hBN. Overall, our work is expected to enable the realistic modeling of edge-functionalized hBN in aqueous media for various application areas.},

A combination of soft x-ray spectroscopic methods (XPS, XAS, and ResPES) was used to investigate the electronic structure. The lattice parameters as a function of the metal concentration x obey Vegard’s law. It was shown that the substitution of Ti by Zr results in an increase in the Fermi energy, attributed to the lower binding energy of Zr 4 d compared to Ti 3 d in the Zr x Ti 1−x Se 2 valence band. Given that the oxidation states of both Ti and Zr are +4, and the concentration of free charge carriers remains unchanged upon substitution, the observed effect is explained by a reduced density of electronic states near the Fermi level. The influence of temperature on the Ti 2 p –3 d and Zr 3 p –4 d ResPES spectra is interpreted in terms of pseudodoping occurring with the substitution of Ti by Zr.},

Our findings show that in the bulk system, both the tetrahedral and octahedral iron sub-lattices undergo a phase transition prior to melting. Cooling the system from above this transition, or from above the melting point, leads to the formation of different metastable maghemite structures. In contrast, this sub-lattice transition is absent in nanoparticles, where melting occurs through an interface-mediated process. At temperatures just above the transition, nanoparticles adopt an ellipsoidal shape, which is retained during cooling. In addition, the specific heat of both bulk and nanoparticle systems at temperatures above the Debye temperature is evaluated and compared with the available experimental data. Overall, our results highlight the complex thermal behavior of maghemite across a range of temperatures, which remains insufficiently explored experimentally.

  abstract     = {Oil has become a prevalent global pollutant, stimulating the research to improve the techniques to separate oil from water. Materials with special wetting properties—primarily those that repel water while attracting oil—have been proposed as suitable candidates for this task. However, one limitation in developing efficient substrates is the limited available volume for oil absorption. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of disordered fractal materials in addressing this challenge, leveraging their unique wetting properties. Using a combination of a continuous model and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the hydrophobicity and oleophilicity of substrates created through ballistic deposition (BD). Our results demonstrate that these materials exhibit high contact angles for water, confirming their hydrophobic nature while allowing significant oil penetration, indicative of oleophilic behavior. The available free volume within the substrates varies from 60% to 90% of the total volume of the substrate depending on some parameters of the BD. By combining their water and oil wetting properties with a high availability of volume, the fractal substrates analyzed in this work achieve an efficiency in separating oil from water of nearly 98%, which is significantly higher compared to micro-pillared surfaces made from the same material but lacking a fractal design.},

Neither first principles-based nor force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations satisfy these three criteria unequivocally. Herein, we report the development of a machine learning potential (MLP) for a classic glass, B 2 O 3 , which meets these goals well. The MLP is trained on condensed phase configurations whose energies and forces on the atoms are obtained using periodic quantum density functional theory. Deep potential MD simulations based on this MLP accurately predict the equation of state and the densification of the glass with slower quenching from the melt. At ambient conditions, quenching rates larger than 10 11 K/s are shown to lead to artifacts in the structure. Pressure-dependent x-ray and neutron structure factors from the simulations compare excellently with experimental data. High-pressure simulations of the glass show varied coordination geometries of boron and oxygen, which concur with experimental observations.},

We find that low-frequency atoms are structurally unfavored and tend to aggregate. High-frequency atoms originating from compressed atomic pairs are also mechanically unstable. As yield approaches, shear-transformation rearrangements shift from low-frequency to high-frequency atoms. Subhigh-frequency atoms play the role of stable backbones. Given that atoms can have different identities, multiple identities are observed to overlap in space. Atoms with one vibrational identity often transform to another one, showing different preferences in transformation routes.

  abstract     = {The detection of HC(S)CN in TMC-1 suggests that HC(S)NC may also exist. To aid in its possible detection, HC(S)NC and its deuterated isotopologue DC(S)NC were investigated via high-level ab initio methods, specifically CCSD(T) and CCSD(T)-F12. By utilizing multidimensional potential energy surfaces derived from explicitly correlated coupled-cluster calculations, we analyzed their geometrical parameters, vibrational frequencies, rotational constants, and a comprehensive set of spectroscopic constants generated via the vibrational second-order perturbation theory, vibrational self-consistent field, and vibrational configuration interaction theory(VCI) approaches. HC(S)NC is thermodynamically stable relative to the HCS + NC dissociation limit, with a predicted bond dissociation energy of 4.1 eV. The calculated vibrational frequencies are characterized by two bright modes that correspond to CN stretching. Finally, HC(S)NC shows a significant dipole moment, predicted to be 1.9 D, making its detection via rotational spectroscopy plausible.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the ultrafast vibrational relaxation following photoexcitation of molecules in a condensed phase is essential to predict the outcome and improve the efficiency of photoinduced molecular processes. Here, the vibrational decoherence and energy relaxation of a binuclear complex, [ Pt 2 ( P 2 O 5 H 2 ) 4 ] 4 − (PtPOP), upon electronic excitation in liquid water and acetonitrile are investigated through direct adiabatic dynamics simulations. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme is used where the excited state of the complex is modeled with orbital-optimized density functional calculations while solvent molecules are described using potential energy functions. The decoherence time of the Pt–Pt vibration dominating the photoinduced dynamics is found to be ∼1.6 ps in both solvents. This is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements in water, where intersystem crossing is slow ( ⁠ > 10 ps). Pathways for the flow of excess energy are identified by monitoring the power of the solvent on vibrational modes. The latter are obtained as generalized normal modes from the velocity covariances, and the power is computed using QM/MM embedding forces. Excess vibrational energy is found to be predominantly released through short-range repulsive and attractive interactions between the ligand atoms and surrounding solvent molecules, whereas solute–solvent interactions involving the Pt atoms are less important. Since photoexcitation deposits most of the excess energy into Pt–Pt vibrations, energy dissipation to the solvent is inefficient. This study reveals the mechanism behind the exceptionally long vibrational coherence of the photoexcited PtPOP complex in solution and underscores the importance of short-range interactions for accurate simulations of vibrational energy relaxation of solvated molecules.},

The associated BDEs for the three pathways differ not only quantitatively but, in some cases, also in terms of opposite trends along the C–X series. Based on activation strain analyses and quantitative molecular orbital theory, we explain how these differences are caused by the profoundly different electronic structures of, and thus bonding mechanisms between, the resulting fragments in the three different dissociation pathways. We demonstrate that the nature and strength of a chemical bond are only fully defined when considering both (i) the molecule in which the bond exists and (ii) the fragments from which it forms or into which it dissociates.},

Herein, we report results for electron attachment to 2-bromo-5-nitrothiazole (BNT) in the gas phase. Employing two crossed electron–molecule beam experiments, we determined the efficiency curves of various fragment anions as a function of the initial electron energy between about 0 and 10 eV as well as the emission angle and kinetic energy distributions of Br − and NO 2 − ions formed from a resonance near 4 eV. The experiments were supported by quantum chemical calculations, exploring possible dissociation pathways along with their reaction energies. We also compared the electron attachment characteristics of BNT with those of the native thiazole molecule by performing electron attachment experiments and calculations for this molecule as well. Compared to thiazole, which is primarily degraded only by electrons with kinetic energies between about 5 and 10 eV, BNT is susceptible to low-energy electrons near 0 eV with enhanced cross section for (dissociative) electron attachment. However, although BNT offers two localization sites with high electron affinity (Br and NO 2 moieties), we do not find the corresponding anions as the dominant negatively charged species formed upon electron attachment. Instead, the reaction channels with an abstraction of Br and NO 2 as neutral radicals prevail, accompanied by the opening of the thiazole ring due to the relatively weak C–S bond.},

Transitions were assigned for two conformers: cis -3MS and trans -3MS. In the cis conformer, the vinyl group is oriented toward the methyl group, while in the trans conformer, it is positioned away from the methyl. The energy difference between the two conformers was calculated to be only 2.1 cm −1 , with the cis conformer having lower energy. Significant tunneling splitting, caused by the low-barrier internal rotation of the methyl group, was observed and analyzed using the XIAM and BELGI-Cs codes. The BELGI results show that the V 3 barrier is 30.6688(87) cm −1 for the cis conformer and 11.0388(88) cm −1 for the trans conformer. The experimental rotational and torsional parameters are compared to their density functional theory counterparts. The planarity of the molecular geometry of cis - and trans -3MS is discussed, contributing to the long-standing topic of discussion about the planarity of styrene derivatives.},

The PECs of Na 2 were consistent with the experimental data and with the FS-CCSD (2,0) calculations, reproducing the double-well and the “shelf” character for some of the potentials of the excited states. For K 2 , the PECs behaved in a similar way and the spectroscopic parameters for the ground and the excited states are in good agreement with the available experimental values. The dissociation energy of K 2 was predicted to be D e = 4454 cm −1 , within an agreement of 5 cm −1 with the experiments. For Na 2 , D e = 5789 cm −1 compared to the experimental value of 6022 cm −1 . The inclusion of spin–orbit coupling effects resulted in avoided crossings, which affect the PECs. Spin–orbit changes the predicted curves for some excited Ω states arising from ΛS states that overlap each other, affecting their associated vibrational frequencies and bond distances. The current studies of the low-lying states in K 2 reveal a similar structure to those of Na 2 , which suggests the accessibility of long-lived energy storing reservoir states and possible population inversions in K 2 following prior experimental work on the reaction of halogen atoms with Na 3 to produce excited states of Na 2 .},

  abstract     = {The hydroxysilylene (HSiOH) molecule has been spectroscopically identified in the gas phase for the first time. This highly reactive species was produced in a twin electric discharge jet using separate precursor streams of 16 O 2 / 18 O 2 and Si 2 H 6 /Si 2 D 6 , both diluted in high pressure argon. The strongest and most stable laser induced fluorescence (LIF) signals were obtained by applying an electric discharge to each of the precursor streams and then merging the discharge products just prior to expansion into vacuum. Bands of the Ã 1 A – X ~ 1 A ′ electronic transition of HSiOH were found in the 455–420 nm region, and single vibronic level emission spectra showed only transitions attributable to the trans -hydroxysilylene ground state isomer. High resolution, rotationally resolved spectra were obtained for the 0-0 bands of HSi 16 OH and HSi 18 OH. The rotational constants were used to obtain ground and excited state molecular structures of HSiOH, with some necessary constraints. The derived ground state structure is trans -HSiOH, with geometric parameters similar to theoretical predictions from the literature. In the excited state, a skew -HSiOH structure was obtained with a dihedral angle of 102°. Our own CASSCF/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations predict a similar excited state skew geometry. The lack of odd quantum number changes in the torsional mode in emission and our difficulties in obtaining DSiOD spectra, despite considerable effort, all suggest that further experimental and theoretical efforts will be necessary to thoroughly understand the electronic spectrum of hydroxysilylene.},

This framework utilizes the recently developed nuclear–electronic orbital time-dependent configuration interaction (NEO-TDCI) approach, which treats all electrons and specified nuclei quantum mechanically on the same footing. A strategy is presented for calculating time-resolved vibrational and electronic absorption spectra from any initial condition. Although this strategy is general for any TDCI implementation, utilizing the NEO framework allows for the explicit inclusion of quantized nuclei, as illustrated through the calculation of vibrationally hot spectra. Time-resolved spectra produced by either vibrational or electronic Rabi oscillations capture ground-state absorption, stimulated emission, and excited-state absorption between vibronic states.

By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we obtain transferable structural representations that are useful for learning conformational dynamics without further fine-tuning. We show how the learned GNN representations can capture interpretable relationships between structural units (tokens) by combining them with expressive token mixers. Importantly, decoupling training the GNNs from training for downstream tasks enables analysis of larger molecular graphs (that can represent small proteins at all-atom resolution) with limited computational resources. In these ways, geom2vec eliminates the need for manual feature selection and increases the robustness of simulation analyses.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful means of investigating the structure and dynamics of complex molecules in condensed phases. However, even in theory, analysis of 2D spectra resulting from complex inter- and intra-molecular motions using only molecular dynamics methods is not easy. This is because molecular motions comprise complex multiple modes and peaks broaden and overlap owing to various relaxation processes and inhomogeneous broadening. On the basis of an anharmonic multimode Brownian oscillator model with nonlinear system–bath coupling, we have developed an approach that simulates 2D spectra, taking into account arbitrary modes of intermolecular and intramolecular vibrations simultaneously. Although only two-mode quantum calculations are feasible with this model, owing to high computational costs, here we restrict ourselves to the classical case and perform three-mode calculations. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by calculating 2D correlation infrared spectra of water for symmetric stretching, antisymmetric stretching, and bending modes. The quantum effects of these results are deduced by comparing 2D quantum spectra previously obtained for two intramolecular modes with those obtained using our classical approach under the same physical conditions. The results show that the 2D spectra calculated by separating the stretching modes into symmetric and asymmetric modes provide better descriptions of peak profiles, such as the splitting of cross-peaks.},

Although Ehrenfest dynamics (ED) is computationally efficient and well-suited for large complex systems, ED often yields inaccurate results. To address these limitations, we improve the accuracy of the traditional ED by adding a random force (E + σ ). In this work, the construction of random forces is considered in Markovian and non-Markovian scenarios, and we ensure the dynamics satisfy the detailed balance in both scenarios. By comparing our E + σ with existing methods such as the electronic friction model and surface hopping, we furthermore validate its reliability. In addition, the E + σ model still retains the high efficiency of ED and does not incur much additional computation. We believe that this method provides an alternative to accurately describe the mixed quantum–classical dynamics in open quantum systems, particularly for large complex systems.},

The latter is described by a combined atomistic–continuum model, where the core is described using the implicit boundary element method (BEM) and the surface retains a fully atomistic picture and is treated employing the frequency-dependent fluctuating charge and fluctuating dipole ( ω FQF μ ) approach. The integrated QM/ ω FQF μ -BEM model is numerically compared with state-of-the-art fully atomistic approaches, and the quality of the continuum/core partition is evaluated.

  abstract     = {Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) modeling is an effective means of bypassing the limited spatiotemporal scales of conventional atomistic molecular dynamics while retaining essential information from the atomistic model. A central challenge in CG modeling is the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, as the inclusion of often pivotal many-body interaction terms in the CG force-field renders simulation markedly slower than simple pairwise models. The Ultra Coarse-Graining (UCG) method incorporates many-body terms through discrete internal state variables that modulate the CG force-field according to, e.g., changes in local environment when substantial chemical heterogeneities exist. However, assigning optimal internal states systematically from atomistic simulation data, as well as the practical application of bottom-up UCG theory to biomolecular systems, remain open problems. We develop two synergistic methods to aid in the development of UCG models that can capture inhomogeneities in atomistic systems such as those induced by phase coexistence. The first method establishes the systematic construction of UCG force-fields from a relative entropy minimization principle, while the second method utilizes machine-learning to obtain optimal local order parameters for enhanced model efficiency and transferability. We apply these methods to a methanol liquid–vapor interface and the ripple phase of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayer and demonstrate that UCG modeling alone recapitulates aspects of phase coexistence that are otherwise not observed in CG modeling.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) of the absolute electronic energy for charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomics at fixed interatomic distance d 0 . To account for variations in distance, we combine AHA with this ansatz for the electronic binding potential, E ( d ) = ( E u − E s ) E c − E s E u − E s d / d 0 + E s ⁠ , where E u , E c , E s correspond to the energies of the united atom, calibration at d 0 , and the sum of infinitely separated atoms, respectively. Our model covers the two-dimensional electronic potential energy surface spanned by distances of 0.7–2.5 Å and differences in nuclear charge from which only one single point (with elements of nuclear charge Z 1 , Z 2 , and distance d 0 ) is drawn to calibrate E c . Using reference data from pbe0/cc-pVDZ, we present numerical evidence for the electronic ground-state of all neutral diatomics with 8, 10, 12, and 14 electrons. We assess the validity of our model by comparison to legacy interatomic potentials (harmonic oscillator, Lennard-Jones, and Morse) within the most relevant range of binding (0.7–2.5 Å) and find comparable accuracy if restricted to single diatomics and significantly better predictive power when extrapolating to the entire iso-electronic series. We also investigated Δ-learning of the electronic absolute energy using our model as a baseline. This baseline model results in a systematic improvement, effectively reducing training data needed for reaching chemical accuracy by up to an order of magnitude from ∼1000 to ∼100. By contrast, using AHA+Morse as a baseline hardly leads to any improvement and sometimes even deteriorates the predictive power. Inferring the energy of unseen CO converges to a prediction error of ∼0.1 Ha in direct learning and ∼0.04 Ha with our baseline.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the folding mechanisms of multi-domain proteins is crucial for gaining insights into protein folding dynamics. The BphC enzyme, a key player in the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls consists of eight identical subunits, each containing two domains, with each domain comprising two “ βαβββ ” motifs. In this study, we employed high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations to systematically analyze the unfolding dynamics of a BphC subunit. Our results reveal that the unfolding process of BphC is a complex, multi-intermediate, and multi-phased event. Notably, we identified a thermodynamically stable partially unfolded intermediate. The unfolding sequences, pathways, and rates of the motifs differ significantly. Motif D unfolds first and most rapidly, while Motif C initiates unfolding before Motifs A and B but completes it slightly later. The unfolding behavior of the motifs strongly influences the domain unfolding, leading to the early initiation of Domain 2 unfolding compared to Domain 1, although at a slower rate. The motifs and domains exhibit both independence and cooperativity during the unfolding process, which we interpret through proposed cascading effects. We hypothesize that the folding mechanism of BphC begins with local folding, which propagates through cooperative interactions across structural hierarchies to achieve the folded state. These findings provide new insights into the folding and unfolding mechanisms of multi-domain proteins.},

These deformations can extend over length scales larger than the size of a nanoparticle, leading to an effective membrane-curvature-mediated interaction between nanoparticles. Nanoparticles with uniform surfaces tend to aggregate into unidimensionally close-packed clusters at moderate adhesion strengths and endocytose at high adhesion strengths. Here, we show that the suppression of close-packed clustering and endocytosis can be achieved by the surface modification of the nanoparticles into Janus particles where a moiety of their surface is grafted with polymers under a good solvent condition. The osmotic pressure of the polymer brushes prevents membrane wrapping of the nanoparticles’ moieties that are grafted with polymers, thus suppressing their endocytosis. Furthermore, a repulsion between polymer brushes belonging to two nearby nanoparticles destabilizes the dimerization of the nanoparticles over a wide range of values of the polymers’ molecular weight and grafting density. This surface modification of nanoparticles should allow for reliable, non-close-packed, and tunable self-assemblies of nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) is a fruitful approach for modeling polymer dynamics, benefiting from its multiscale and hybrid nature. However, the Onsager coefficient, the only free parameter in DDFT, is primarily derived empirically, limiting the accuracy and broad application of DDFT. Herein, we propose a machine learning-based, bottom-up workflow to directly extract the Onsager coefficient from molecular simulations, circumventing partly heuristic assumptions in traditional approaches. In this workflow, the Onsager coefficient is derived from the proposed DDFT-informed ordinary differential equation network, trained to replicate density evolution observed in Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. We validate our method by studying the lamellar transition in symmetric diblock copolymer melts, where the DDFT model with the extracted Onsager coefficient precisely reproduces both the density evolution and interface narrowing predicted by BD simulations, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the present scheme. Meanwhile, our studies reveal the strong relevance of the Onsager coefficient with dynamic processes and identify the explicit connection between dynamic correlations, characterized by the correlation strength and correlation length, and the system parameters, e.g., the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter. We found that far from the transition point, the correlation that transmits the thermodynamic force into a density current is localized and strong, while close to the transition point, it becomes long-ranged but weak. Our approach aims to develop a more generalized framework to bridge more refined particle-based simulations to more coarse-grained field-based calculations, and the insights gained by using our approach could be extended to other non-equilibrium systems in polymer sciences.},

The CZTSSe film for high-performance solar cells can be obtained by annealing the deposited CZTS precursor films with selenium (a process known as selenization). The design of the selenization process significantly affects the quality of the absorber layer. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of heating rate on the selenization kinetics and the microstructural characteristics of the films using a two-step selenization method. The results indicate that a slow heating rate promotes surface crystallization, resulting in a thick and dense layer of large grains at the film surface that impedes the diffusion of Se vapor. Conversely, a rapid heating rate enhances the diffusion of Se into the interior of the film, synthesizing more low-melting-point intermediate compounds that facilitate grain growth and reduce the thickness of fine grains at the film bottom. Ultimately, a CZTSSe solar cell with an efficiency of 10.17% was fabricated at a heating rate of 200 °C/min. This research deepens the understanding of thin film growth mechanisms and advances the development of high-performance solar cells.},

However, emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, pose significant challenges to water quality and safety. Nanomaterial-based technologies emerge as a promising solution for removing those contaminants from water. Nevertheless, interfacial water plays a major role in the adsorption of chemical compounds in nanomaterials—as it plays in biological processes such as protein folding, enzyme activity, and drug delivery. To understand this role, in this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to explore the adsorption dynamics of potassium diclofenac on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), considering both dry and wet conditions. Our findings reveal that the structuring of water molecules around CNTs creates hydration layers that significantly influence the accessibility of active sites and the interaction strength between contaminants and adsorbents. Our analysis indicates higher energy barriers for adsorption in DWCNTs compared to SWCNTs, which is attributed to stronger water–surface interactions. This research highlights the importance of understanding nanoscale water behavior for optimizing the design and functionality of nanomaterials for water purification. These findings can guide the development of more efficient and selective nanomaterials, enhancing contaminant removal and ensuring safer water resources while contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental biological interactions.},

The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. A comparison with the simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers shows a similar performance of the two functionals.

These findings are corroborated by MD simulations, comparing the experimentally observed echo decay times to those of a computed velocity echo.

Recently, a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) was trained for GST to reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies and forces at a fraction of the computational cost [Zhou et al. , Nat. Electron. 6 , 746 (2023)]; however, simulations of large length and time scales are still challenging using this GAP model. Here, we present a machine-learned (ML) potential for GST implemented using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. This ACE potential shows comparable accuracy to the GAP potential but performs orders of magnitude faster. We train the ACE potentials both directly from DFT and also using a recently introduced indirect learning approach where the potential is trained instead from an intermediate ML potential, in this case, GAP. Indirect learning allows us to consider a significantly larger training set than could be generated using DFT alone. We compare the directly and indirectly learned potentials and find that both reproduce the structure and thermodynamics predicted by the GAP and also match experimental measures of GST structure. The speed of the ACE model, particularly when using graphics processing unit acceleration, allows us to examine repeated transitions between crystal and amorphous phases in device-scale systems with only modest computational resources.},

In this study, we introduce a theoretical framework that captures higher-order effects, and we explore the limits of the standard description of a molecular emitter as a point-dipole. We particularly focus on the role played by the emitter chain length and electron conjugation. Strong deviations are observed from the point-dipole approximation, demonstrating that higher-order effects are essential to fully capture the emission rate of extended molecules in the vicinity of nanoparticles. This deviation strongly depends on the orientation of the conjugated chain relative to the nanoplasmonic structure. Finally, we propose a simple rationalization that qualitatively assesses the difference from the point-dipole approximation.},

  abstract     = {Absolute line strength measurements of hydroperoxyl (HO 2 ) radical in the OO-stretching (ν 3 ) fundamental band have been performed by means of mid-infrared time-resolved dual-comb spectroscopy. By employing two sets of dual-comb spectrometers, high-resolution time-resolved spectra of HO 2 and HCl, formed in the photolysis reaction system of Cl 2 /CH 3 OH/O 2 , could be, respectively, measured near 1123 and 3059 cm −1 . With kinetic simulations, spectral analysis of both HO 2 and HCl, as well as the accurate line strength of the HCl R(9) transition at 3059.316 cm −1 , an absolute line strength of the ν 3 13 1,13 ← 12 1,12 F 1,2 transitions in HO 2 at 1122.983 cm −1 was first determined to be 1.80 × 10 −20 cm molecule −1 with a small uncertainty down to 4% under the conditions with low initial concentrations of Cl radical (1.63–1.81 × 10 13 molecule cm −3 ). Furthermore, broadband high-resolution spectra of the ν 3 fundamental band of HO 2 were recorded in the range of 1088–1124 cm −1 with an average spectral resolution of 0.002 cm −1 . By contour fitting the measured broadband spectra with PGOPHER, the line strengths of hundreds of rovibrational transitions were obtained relative to the well-determined HO 2 lines at 1122.983 cm −1 , and those values were observed to be higher than those tabulated in the HITRAN database by a factor of ∼2.8. Moreover, the absolute band strength of the ν 3 fundamental band in HO 2 was derived to be 22.3 km mol −1 with an uncertainty of 5%. This work providing precise and detailed spectral data would be crucial in revisiting the theoretical modeling of HO 2 geometry and updating the database of the HO 2 radical.},

  abstract     = {The water trimer, as the smallest water cluster in which the three-body interactions can manifest, is arguably the most important hydrogen-bonded trimer. Accurate, fully coupled quantum treatment of its excited intermolecular vibrations has long been an elusive goal. Here, we present the methodology that for the first time allows rigorous twelve-dimensional (12D) quantum calculation of the intermolecular vibration-tunneling eigenstates of the water trimer, with the monomers treated as rigid. These 12D eigenstates are used to simulate the low-frequency absorption spectrum of the trimer for direct comparison with the measured far-infrared (FIR) spectrum of the water trimer in helium nanodroplets. The 12D calculations reveal weak coupling between the large-amplitude torsional and intermolecular stretching vibrations. The calculated torsional tunneling splittings are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic results. There are visible differences between the spectrum simulated using the 12D eigenstates and that based on our earlier 9D calculations where the stretching vibrations are not included. The peaks in the 12D spectrum are generally shifted to slightly lower energies relative to those in the 9D spectrum, as well as the measured FIR spectrum, and are often split by intermolecular stretch–bend Fermi resonances that the 9D treatment cannot capture.},

In this work, we present a study of the second harmonic scattering (SHS) intensity for two different scattering angles, namely, the forward and the right angle geometries. This method performed at optical wavelengths is indeed selective toward long correlation lengths. A polarization analysis demonstrates that it is then possible to clearly evidence a coherent component to the total SHS intensity using a fast Fourier transform analysis of the SHS intensity as a function of the fundamental angle of polarization despite its weak relative contribution. A model is then derived based on the rotational invariants to fully unravel the different contributions to the SHS intensity for the two right angle and forward angles of scattering as well as the dependence with the fundamental beam polarization angle. This model fully supports the experimental results, further confirming an azimuthal geometry of the water–water orientational correlation function in neat water.},

We use variational quantum Monte Carlo with deep-learning Ansätze to obtain highly accurate wave functions free of basis set errors and from them, using our novel method, correspondingly accurate electron densities, which we demonstrate by calculating dipole moments, nuclear forces, contact densities, and other density-based properties.},

  abstract     = {The linear scaling divide–expand–consolidate (DEC) framework is expanded to include unrestricted Hartree–Fock references. By partitioning the orbital space and employing local molecular orbitals, the full molecular calculation can be performed as independent calculations on individual fragments, making the method well-suited for massively parallel implementations. This approach also incorporates error control through the fragment optimization threshold (FOT), which maintains precision and consistency throughout the calculations. A benchmark was conducted for correlation energies of open-shell systems and the relative energies of both open- and closed-shell molecules at the MP2 level of theory. The full calculation result is achieved as the FOT approaches zero. For correlation energies, an FOT of 10 −3 is sufficient to recover over 98% of the full result in all cases. However, for relative energies and the electronic energy component of oxidation potentials, a tighter FOT of 10 −4 is required to keep the DEC error within 10% for both open- and closed-shell molecules. This is likely due to a lack of systematic error cancellation for the molecules with vastly different chemical natures. Therefore, for accurate relative energies, the FOT should be an order of magnitude lower, and additional caution is needed, particularly for large systems. The DEC method extension to unrestricted references maintains favorable features of linear scaling and can be implemented in a massively parallel algorithm to calculate correlation energies for large open-shell systems.},

It is shown that by employing a rotationally resolved model for the molecules, revealing the various cavity-mediated interactions between the field-free molecular eigenstates, it is possible to obtain a detailed understanding of the physical processes governing the energy level structure, absorption spectra, and dynamic behavior of the confined systems. Collective effects, arising due to the cavity-mediated interaction between molecules, are identified in energy level shifts, in intensity borrowing effects in the absorption spectra, and in the intermolecular energy transfer occurring during Hermitian or non-Hermitian time propagation.},

  abstract     = {Methods based on density-functional theory usually treat open-shell atoms and molecules within the spin-unrestricted Kohn–Sham (KS) formalism, which breaks symmetries in real and spin space. Symmetry breaking is possible because the KS Hamiltonian operator does not need to exhibit the full symmetry of the physical Hamiltonian operator, but only the symmetry of the spin density, which is generally lower. Symmetry breaking leads to spin contamination and prevents a proper classification of the KS wave function with respect to the symmetries of the physical electron system. Formally well-justified variants of the KS formalism that restore symmetries in real space, in spin space, or in both have been introduced long ago, but have rarely been used in practice. Here, we introduce numerically stable KS inversion methods to construct reference KS potentials from reference spin-densities for all four possibilities to treat open shell systems, non-symmetrized, spin-symmetrized, space-symmetrized, and fully-symmetrized. The reference spin-densities are obtained by full configuration interaction and high-level coupled cluster methods for the considered atoms and diatomic molecules. The decomposition of the total energy in contributions such as the non-interacting kinetic, the exchange, and the correlation energy is different in the four KS formalisms. Reference values for these differences are provided for the considered atoms and molecules. All KS inversions, except the fully symmetrized one, lead in some cases to solutions violating the Aufbau principle. In the purely spin-symmetrized KS formalism, this represents a violation of the KS v -representability condition, i.e., no proper KS wave functions exist in those cases.},

While a minimal asymmetry in the potential landscape is crucial for observing this effect in passive colloidal systems, the introduction of activity can either amplify or reduce the threshold of this minimal asymmetry, resulting in the activity-induced and suppressed Mpemba effect.

Traditional methods of data generation, such as random sampling or exhaustive exploration, are either intractable or may not capture rare, but highly informative configurations. In this study, we propose a method that leverages uncertainty as the collective variable (CV) to guide the acquisition of chemically relevant data points, focusing on regions of configuration space where ML model predictions are most uncertain. This approach employs a Gaussian Mixture Model-based uncertainty metric from a single model as the CV for biased molecular dynamics simulations. The effectiveness of our approach in overcoming energy barriers and exploring unseen energy minima, thereby enhancing the dataset in an active learning framework, is demonstrated on alanine dipeptide and bulk silica.},

  abstract     = {Reliable computational methodologies and basis sets for modeling x-ray spectra are essential for extracting and interpreting electronic and structural information from experimental x-ray spectra. In particular, the trade-off between numerical accuracy and computational cost due to the size of the basis set is a major challenge, since molecular orbitals undergo extreme relaxation in the core-hole state. To gain clarity on the changes in electronic structure induced by the formation of a core-hole, the use of sufficiently flexible basis for expanding the orbitals, particularly for the core region, has been shown to be essential. This work focuses on the refinement of core-hole ionized state calculations using the equation-of-motion coupled cluster family of methods through an extensive analysis on the effectiveness of “hybrid” and mixed basis sets. In this investigation, we utilize the CVS-EOMIP-CCSD method in combination and construct hybrid basis sets piecewise from readily available Dunning’s correlation consistent basis sets in order to calculate x-ray ionization energies (IEs) for a set of small gas phase molecules. Our results provide insights into the impact of basis sets on the CVS-EOMIP-CCSD calculations of K-edge IEs of first-row p-block elements. These insights enable us to understand more about the basis set dependence of the core IEs computed and allow us to establish a protocol for deriving reliable and cost-effective theoretical estimates for computing IEs of small molecules containing such elements.},

  abstract     = {Inferring underlying microscopic dynamics from low-dimensional experimental signals is a central problem in physics, chemistry, and biology. As a trade-off between molecular complexity and the low-dimensional nature of experimental data, mesoscopic descriptions such as the Markovian master equation are commonly used. The states in such descriptions usually include multiple microscopic states, and the ensuing coarse-grained dynamics are generally non-Markovian. It is frequently assumed that such dynamics can nevertheless be described as a Markov process because of the timescale separation between slow transitions from one observed coarse state to another and the fast interconversion within such states. Here, we use a simple model of a molecular motor with unobserved internal states to highlight that (1) dissipation estimated from the observed coarse dynamics may significantly underestimate microscopic dissipation even in the presence of timescale separation and even when mesoscopic states do not contain dissipative cycles and (2) timescale separation is not necessarily required for the Markov approximation to give the exact entropy production, provided that certain constraints on the microscopic rates are satisfied. When the Markov approximation is inadequate, we discuss whether including memory effects can improve the estimate. Surprisingly, when we do so in a “model-free” way by computing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the observed probability distributions of forward trajectories and their time reverses, this leads to poorer estimates of entropy production. Finally, we argue that alternative approaches, such as hidden Markov models, may uncover the dissipative nature of the microscopic dynamics even when the observed coarse trajectories are completely time-reversible.},

  abstract     = {Charge layering in the close vicinity of charged interfaces is a well-known effect, extensively reported in both experiments and simulations of Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) and concentrated electrolytes. The traditional Poisson–Fermi (PF) theory is able to successfully describe overcrowding effects but fails to reproduce charge ordering even in strong coupling regimes. Simple models, yet capable of investigating the interplay between these important interfacial phenomena, are still lacking. In order to bridge this gap, we herein present a modified PF approach that is able to capture layering effects in strong coupling regimes typical of RTIL. The modification is based on the introduction of charge cavities around test-particles, which simply extend the exclusion volume effects to also incorporate the accompanying depletion of charges due to particle insertion. The addition of this simple ingredient is shown to reproduce overscreening and charge ordering, thereby extending the predictive power of the PF approach to strong coupling regimes. Using a linear response theory, we were able to study the emergence of charge ordering based on two characteristic lengths: a wavelength responsible for charge layering, along with a damping length that screens charge oscillations. At large ionic strengths and strong couplings, the system undergoes a transition to undamped charge layering. The transition takes place when the poles of the Fourier components of the linear potential become real-valued. This criterion allows one to identify the transition line across the parameter space, thus delimiting the region of stability against unscreened charge ordering.},

  abstract     = {The orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) based method is a convenient tool to carry out electronic structure calculations scaling almost linearly with the number of electrons. However, the main impediment in the application of this method is the unavailability of the accurate form for the non-interacting kinetic energy functional in terms of electron density. The Pauli kinetic energy functional is the unknown part of the kinetic energy functional, and the corresponding Pauli potential appears in the governing Euler equation. In the present study, we present a feed-forward neural network (NN) approach to represent the Pauli potential of a group of atomic systems possessing spherically symmetric ground-state densities. This NN-based representation of Pauli potential combined with the Hohenberg–Kohn variational principle yields self-consistent radial densities that accurately exhibit the correct atomic shell structure. For this approach, the electron density in the form of a grid serves as the input to the NN model. In addition, we calculated the non-interacting kinetic energy by summing the Pauli kinetic energy, derived from the NN-based Pauli potential, and the von Weizsäcker kinetic energy. Our results demonstrate high accuracy for smaller atoms, while larger atoms exhibit greater deviations when compared with smaller atoms. The method presented in this paper provides an efficient way to calculate the Pauli potential and the Pauli kinetic energy without the need for functional derivatives. Our study represents a significant step forward in the application of machine learning techniques to OF-DFT, showcasing the potential of NNs in improving the accuracy and efficiency of quantum mechanical calculations in atomic systems.},

  abstract     = {Among the large family of spin-crossover (SCO) solids, recent investigations focused on polynuclear SCO materials, whose specific molecular configurations allow the presence of multi-step transitions and elastic frustration. In this contribution, we develop the first elastic modeling of thermal and dynamical properties of trinuclear SCO solids. For that, we study a finite SCO open chain constituted of successive elastically coupled trinuclear (A=B=C) blocks, in which each site (A, B, and C) may occupy two electronic configurations, namely, low-spin (LS) and high-spin (HS) states, accompanied with structural changes. Intra- and inter-molecular springs couple the sites inside and between trimers. The model also includes the change of length inside and between the trinuclear units subsequent to the spin states changes. First, we studied the mechanical relaxation of a LS chain initially prepared with HS distances, from which we dissected the dynamics of the atomic displacements for various strengths of intra- and inter-molecular elastic constants. Second, we investigated the thermal properties of the chain at equilibrium, which revealed the existence of a rich variety of behaviors, going from: gradual LS to HS transition to multiple spin transitions with the presence of self-organized spin state structures in the plateaus. The latter were identified as emerging from antagonist short- and long-range elastic interactions between intra- and inter-block size changes. The present model opens several possible extensions, among which are the cases of coupled non-linear trimer molecules as well as that of inter-chain interactions with block–block interactions, leading to unexpected hysteretic spin transitions.},

  abstract     = {The quantum-electrodynamic non-adiabatic emission (QED-NAE) is a type of radiatively assisted vibronic de-excitation due to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations on non-adiabatic processes. Building on our previous work [Tsai et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14 , 5924 (2023)], we extend the theory of the QED-NAE rate from a single cavity photonic mode to infinite photonic modes and calculate the QED-NAE rates of 9-cyanoanthracene at the first-principles level. To avoid the confusion, the quantum electrodynamic internal conversion process is renamed as “QED-NAE” in our present work. According to our theory, we identify three key factors influencing the QED-NAE processes: light–matter coupling strength (mode volume), mass-weighted orientation factor, and photonic density of states. The mode volume is the primary factor causing rate differences between the two scenarios. In a single cavity with a small mode volume, strong light–matter coupling strength boosts QED-NAE rates. In contrast, in free space with infinite photonic modes, weak coupling strength significantly reduces these rates. From a single cavity photonic mode to infinite photonic modes, the mass-weighted orientation factor only causes an 8 π /3-fold increase in the QED-NAE rate. In free space, the photonic density of state exhibits a flat and quadratic distribution, which slightly reduces the QED-NAE rate. Our study shows that cavities can significantly enhance non-adiabatic QED effects while providing a robust analysis demonstrating that QED vibronic effects can be safely ignored in free space.},

  abstract     = {Estimating rare event kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations is a non-trivial task despite the great advances in enhanced sampling methods. Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation, a special class of enhanced sampling techniques, offers a way to directly calculate kinetic rate constants from biased trajectories without the need to modify the underlying energy landscape using bias potentials. Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes to partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable states of interest. In this work, we have developed a new “binless” WE simulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures. Our proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE simulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new algorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b Trp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding times spanning the range between 3 and 40 μ s using projections along predefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors as CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good accuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation time than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the CVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear CVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for resampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated nonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.},

However, theoretical accuracies still lag behind experimental ones, making it challenging to distinguish experimentally distinguishable similar structures, a deficiency largely attributed to the limitation of GIPAW codes to generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) functionals. In this study, we investigate whether hybrid DFT functionals can enhance the EFG calculation accuracy and the associated geometry optimization. Using the many-body expansion method, we focus on nitrogen EFGs in amino acids with complex H-bonding, which are often poorly described with GGA functionals. Our results show that both functionals provide highly accurate calculations that surpass current studies and approach experimental precision. The accuracies are also almost three times higher than available GIPAW/GGA calculations in the literature. However, we show that this difference is not due to the GGA functional but rather due to the improper selection of the nitrogen quadrupole moment.},

We denote this model as the multiconfigurational self-consistent on-top pair-density functional theory (MC-srPDFT) model. We have previously shown how the multiconfigurational short-range DFT (MC-srDFT) hybrid model can describe many multiconfigurational cases of any spin symmetry and also state-specific calculations on excited states [Hedegård et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148 (21), 214103 (2018)]. However, the srDFT part of the MC-srDFT has some deficiencies that it shares with Kohn–Sham DFT; in particular, (1) self-interaction errors (albeit reduced because of the range separation), (2) that different M S states incorrectly become non-degenerate, and (3) that singlet and non-singlet states dissociating to the same open-shell fragments incorrectly lead to different electronic energies at dissociation. The model that we present in this paper corrects these deficiencies by introducing the on-top pair density as an auxiliary variable replacing the spin density. Unlike other models in the literature, our model is fully variational and employs a long-range version of the on-top pair density. The implementation is a second-order optimization algorithm ensuring robust convergence to both ground and excited states. We show how MC-srPDFT solves the mentioned challenges by sample calculations on the ground state singlet curve of H 2 , N 2 , and Cr 2 and the lowest triplet curves for N 2 and Cr 2 . Furthermore, the rotational barrier for ethene is investigated for the S 0 and T 1 states. The calculations show correct degeneracy between the singlet and triplet curves at dissociation and the results are invariant to the choice of the M S value for the triplet curves.},

  abstract     = {Host–guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution, which enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of N -methylacetamide in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to β -cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD–aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be −5.2 ± 0.1 and −5.03 ± 0.09 kcal mol −1 , respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [−4.2 ± 0.2 and −4.1 ± 0.2 kcal mol −1 for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, which is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, because of the limit of full configuration interaction, complete active space (CAS) theory is most often used to model bond dissociation and other dynamical processes where the multi-reference character becomes important. Inconveniently, the CAS method is highly dependent on the choice of active space and, therefore, inherently non-black-box, in addition to the exponential scaling with respect to electrons and orbitals. This illustrates the need for methods that can accurately treat multi-reference electronic structure problems without significant dependence on input parameters. Selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods have experienced a revival in recent years because of their independence of these predicaments. SCI methods aim to exploit the sparsity of the full configuration interaction space to identify all relevant electronic configurations and, therefore, keep the wave function as compact as possible while still representing the total multi-reference electronic structure accurately. In this work, we take the recent achievement by Gao et al. to run full configuration interaction on the propane molecule in a minimal basis set (23 electrons in 26 orbitals) as an occasion to demonstrate that our SCI methods implemented in the GeneralSCI program package can achieve high energetic accuracy in conjunction with very compact wave functions, which considerably alleviate computational cost. Furthermore, we show the good performance of our SCI methods in reproducing a propane bond dissociation surface and energy. This illustrates that SCI methods can be readily applied to problems in chemical reactivity.},

The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through transport calculations on SMJs with benzene-1,4-diamine and its tetramethylated and tetrafluorinated variants, using the CAM-B3LYP range-separated hybrid functional for the embedded molecule and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for the electrodes. The findings indicate a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the predicted zero-bias conductance compared to traditional modeling using the PBE functional across the entire system. The causes for the noted improvement are demonstrated through the examination of alterations in the energy levels of the embedded molecule, along with variations in the electrode–molecule interactions.},

  abstract     = {Effective potential methods, obtained by applying a quantum correction to a classical pair potential, are widely used for describing the thermophysical properties of fluids with mild nuclear quantum effects. In case of strong nuclear quantum effects, such as for liquid hydrogen and helium, the accuracy of these quantum corrections deteriorates significantly, but at present no simple alternatives are available. In this work, we solve this issue by developing a new, three-parameter corresponding-states principle that remains applicable in the regions of the phase diagram where quantum effects become significant. The new principle emerges from a mapping procedure, which shows that quantum-corrected pair potentials can be made conformal to their underlying classical pair potential by modifying the latter’s repulsive range. This mapping enables an accurate description of fluids with quantum-corrected interactions based on off-the-shelf methods for classical fluids (e.g., equations of state, classical density functional theory, and entropy scaling) using effective, mapped intermolecular-potential parameters. These effective parameters depend on temperature and molecular mass; simple analytic equations in case of a classical Mie potential with Feynman–Hibbs quantum corrections are presented. Using Mie Feynman–Hibbs force fields from the literature, we show that this procedure provides accurate predictions for the properties of fluids with mild nuclear quantum effects, such as neon or hydrogen at moderate temperatures. Moreover, by adjusting the functional form of the effective intermolecular-potential parameters to experimental data for helium and hydrogen, we are able to apply the corresponding-states principle for optimal quantum-corrected pair potentials that far surpass the accuracy of the Feynman–Hibbs correction.},

  abstract     = {Nucleosomes are fundamental units of chromatin in which a length of genomic DNA is wrapped around a histone octamer spool in a left-handed superhelix. Large-scale nucleosome maps show a wide distribution of DNA wrapping lengths, which in some cases are tens of base pairs (bp) shorter than the 147 bp canonical wrapping length observed in nucleosome crystal structures. Here, we develop a thermodynamic model that assumes a constant free energy cost of unwrapping a nucleosomal bp. Our model also incorporates linker DNA—short DNA segments between neighboring nucleosomes imposed by the folding of nucleosome arrays into chromatin fibers and other higher-order chromatin structures. We use this model to study nucleosome positioning and occupancy in the presence of nucleosome “breathing”—partial unwrapping and rewrapping of nucleosomal DNA due to interactions with the neighboring particles. We find that, as the unwrapping cost per bp and the chemical potential are varied, the nucleosome arrays are characterized by three distinct states, with low, intermediate, and high densities. The transition between the latter two states proceeds through an equiprobable state in which all nucleosome wrapping lengths are equally likely. We study the equiprobable state theoretically using a mean-field approach, obtaining an excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Finally, we use our model to reproduce S. cerevisiae nucleosome occupancy profiles observed in the vicinity of transcription start sites, as well as genome-wide distributions of nucleosome wrapping lengths. Overall, our results highlight the key role of partial nucleosome unwrapping in shaping the genome-wide patterns of nucleosome positioning and occupancy.},

Upon curing, the detected motions are localized and depict a system evolving toward structural arrest dominated by slower hyperdiffusive dynamics, characterized by a compressed exponential regime, pointing to a structural relaxation process subjected to internal stresses, in a context of marked dynamical and structural heterogeneity. The system ages through a “densification” process producing declining small angle scattered intensity, as two finely intermixed gel-like reaction products, namely, one hydrated aluminophosphate and one hydrated silica, form a percolated network possessing surface fractal scaling of progressively shorter average correlation length. In this scenario, the nominal Al/P molar ratio of the mix, being an index of network-forming ability, is positively correlated with the dynamic viscosity and the overall kinetics, whereas the contrary occurs for the fraction of water.},

In our model, a species representing a domain of chromatin is embedded in a binary fluid. This fluid phase separates to form a droplet rich in a macromolecule (B). Chromatin particles are trapped in a harmonic potential to reproduce the coil and globular phases of an isolated polymer chain. We investigate the role of the droplet material B on the radius of gyration of this polymer and find that this radius varies nonmonotonically with respect to the volume fraction of B. This behavior is reminiscent of a phenomenon known as co-non-solvency : a polymer chain in a good solvent (S) may collapse when a second good solvent (here B) is added in low quantity and expands at higher B concentration. In addition, the presence of finite-size effects on the coil–globule transition results in a qualitatively different impact of the droplet material on polymers of various sizes. In the context of genetic regulation, our results suggest that the size of chromatin domains and the quantity of condensate proteins are key parameters to control whether chromatin may respond to an increase in the quantity of chromatin-binding proteins by condensing or expanding.},

  abstract     = {Silk-fibroin hydrogels have gained considerable attention in recent years for their versatile biomedical applications. The physical properties of a complex hydrogel, comprising silk fibroin and riboflavin, surpass those of the silk fibroin-hydrogel without additives. This study investigates silk fibroin–riboflavin (silk–RIB) hydrogel at the atomistic level to uncover molecular structures and chemical characteristics specific to silk fibroin and riboflavin molecules in an aqueous medium. The interplay between hydrophilic riboflavin and hydrophobic silk fibroin polymers facilitates the formation of solubilized silk fiber, which subsequently evolves into a nano-scale hydrogel over time. Eventually, the interlinked RIB stacks form a scaffold that not only accommodates silk fibroin aggregates but also encloses water pockets, preserving the moisture level and enhancing the thermal conductivity of the hydrogel. To explore water retention properties and the role of ions, two sets of simulations of semi-hydrated hydrogel in the presence and absence of ions are conducted. The presence of ions significantly influences the dynamics of RIB and silk fibroin. Favorable interactions with the ions impede the unrestricted diffusion of these larger molecules, potentially leading to a stable structure capable of retaining water for a prolonged duration. The complete removal of water results in further shrinkage of the anhydrous silk–RIB hydrogel or xerogel (XG), yet its porosity and structural integrity remain intact. These findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of silk fibroin hydrogel and XG, paving the way for materials engineering in aqueous environments to develop biomedical devices with customized functional properties.},

Different conclusions on the size-dependence of the transformation conditions are reached by modeling or theory focusing on the impact of either one (internal, solid-state-) critical-point wetting of the nanoparticle surface or coherency constraints from solute-saturated surface layers. We report a hybrid numerical approach, combining atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation with a continuum mechanics analysis of coherency stress and modeling simultaneously wetting and mechanical constraints. When the ratio between chemical and misfit-strain-related contributions to the solute-solute interaction energy takes values realistic for interstitial solutions—which are typical for energy storage materials—we find that the impact of solid-state wetting is weak and that of coherency stress is dominant. Specifically, mechanical interaction can act to reduce the phase transformation hysteresis at small system size, and it can make the solid more binding for solute, thereby reducing the “plateau” chemical potential at phase coexistence. We present equations for the impact of coherency stress on the size-dependence of upper consolute temperature, plateau chemical potential, and charging/discharging hysteresis.},

Using these data, a systematic analysis of ideal/real adsorbed-solution theory (IAST/RAST) was conducted and activity coefficients were derived for ethanol/water mixtures adsorbed in different zeolites based on RAST. It was found that activity coefficients of ethanol are close to unity while activity coefficients of water are larger in most zeolites, indicating a positive excess free energy of the mixture. This observation can be attributed to water/ethanol interactions being less favorable than water/water interactions in the single-component adsorption of water at comparable loadings. The deviation from ideal behavior can be highly structure-dependent but no clear correlation with pore diameters was identified. Our analysis also demonstrates the following: (1) accurate unary isotherms in the low-loading regime are critical for obtaining physically sensible activity coefficients; (2) the global regression scheme to solve for activity model parameters performs better than fitting activity models to activity coefficients calculated locally at each binary state point; and (3) including the dependence on adsorption potential offers only a minor benefit for describing binary adsorption at the lowest fugacities. Finally, the Margules activity model was found incapable of capturing the non-ideal adsorption behavior over the entire range of fugacities and compositions in all zeolites, but for conditions typical of solution-phase adsorption, RAST predictions using zeolite-specific or even bulk Margules parameters provide an improved description compared to IAST.},

Here, we use ab initio and machine-learned molecular dynamics to scrutinize the behavior of the electronic contribution to ɛ r ( z ) as a function of distance z from a Pt(111) surface. We show that the resulting dielectric profile can largely be explained as a sum of the metallic response and the density-scaled water response at the interface. A slight enhancement of the dielectric response close to the surface can be explained by elongated, strongly polarizable orbitals induced by metal/water bonding. In spite of this enhancement, our results suggest the presence of a region with a very low dielectric constant close to the surface (where the orientational dielectric response does not kick in yet), even for water in contact with hydrophilic metallic interfaces. This region will restrict the double layer capacitance to relatively low values even at potentials where dielectric saturation does not play a role yet. This finding has implications on possible interpretations of double layer capacitances, the dependence of surface electric fields on the ion size, and on electrochemical kinetics.},

This study investigates an environmentally sustainable Tenebrio molitor antifreeze protein ( Tm AFP) modified to be a potential kinetic hydrate inhibitor. The aim of this study was to enhance the inhibitory activity of Tm AFP by systematically substituting threonine (Thr) residues with glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), or serine (Ser) at positions 29, 39, and 53. The Ala mutant demonstrated superior inhibition of hydrate formation, attributed to its optimized spatial conformation and enhanced hydrophobic interactions, followed by the Gly and Ser mutants. The wild-type Tm AFP showed limited efficacy. The radial distribution function (RDF) analysis indicated that the mutations facilitated a better accommodation of adjacent residues within the hydrate crystal structure by adjusting the distance between Thr i and Thr i+2 to closely match the second peak in the RDF of methane molecules at 6.4 Å. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations revealed that the Ala and Ser mutants exhibited enhanced interactions with hydrate cages, with PMF values of −0.73 and −0.71 kJ/mol, respectively, compared to the Gly mutant, which had a PMF value of 1.46 kJ/mol. By identifying the optimal mutation combination (T29 39 53A) to significantly increase the potency of Tm AFP, this study provides a fundamental basis for the further development of hydrate inhibition strategies.},

  abstract     = {Organic donor–acceptor (D–A) cocrystals are gaining attention for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices. This study explores the dynamics of charge transfer (CT) and triplet exciton formation in various D–A cocrystals. By examining a series of D–A cocrystals composed of coronene (COR), peri -xanthenoxanthene (PXX), and perylene (PER) donors paired with N,N -bis(3′-pentyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (PDI), naphthalene-1,4:5,8-tetracarboxy-dianhydride (NDA), or pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) acceptors, using transient absorption microscopy and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we find that the strength of the CT interaction influences the nature and yield of triplet excitons produced by CT state recombination. In particular, in the PER-PDI, COR-PTO, and PER-PTO cocrystals, localized triplet excitons are lower in energy than the CT state. By contrast, no localized triplet excitons are available to the CT states of the PXX-NDA , PER-NDA , and PXX-PTO cocrystals, and as a result, the CT states rapidly decay to ground state with no triplet formation. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that the transition between delocalized CT states to a triplet state localized to a single donor or acceptor unit provides the source of spin–orbit coupling necessary when the triplet states are energetically accessible. These findings provide insights into the design of molecular materials with tailored exciton properties for optoelectronic applications.},

The experimentally unreachable dynamical properties could provide new insights into this field.

After that, the work [van de Bund et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 (22), 225701 (2021)] reports the ab initio treatment of isotopic effects on diffusion in H 2 /D 2 and a significant increase in its value in the region of the phase transition. Both works indicate the anomalous growth of diffusion, but the reasons for this phenomenon are unclear. In the present work, we reveal the plasma-like behavior of the diffusion growth. We apply the classical molecular dynamics method using a machine learning potential developed on the ab initio modeling for the prediction of diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients. We consider dependencies of the vibrational spectrum, molecule lifetime, diffusion, and shear viscosity coefficients on density along the isotherms in the temperature range from 600 to 1100 K.},

  abstract     = {Structural indicators, also known as structural descriptors, including order parameters, have been proposed to quantify the structural properties of water to account for its anomalous behaviors. However, these indicators, mainly designed for bulk water, are not naturally transferrable to the vicinity of ions due to disruptions in the immediate neighboring space and a resulting loss of feature completeness. To address these non-bulk defects, we introduced a structural indicator that draws on the concept of clique number from graph theory and the criterion in agglomerative clustering, denoted as the average cluster number. This structural indicator aims to discern intrinsic structural characteristics within the water molecules regardless of the ions occupying the neighboring space, without requiring additional corrections. From molecular dynamics simulation results for neat water and salt aqueous solutions utilizing the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 force field, we characterized the variations in densities with temperature using this network-based indicator, thereby demonstrating its practical utility. The findings suggest that at lower temperatures, the addition of ions disrupts the intrinsic structure of water molecules, with this effect diminishing as the temperature rises. Cations with larger charge density tend to induce stronger disruptions. This study highlights the importance of mitigating the impact of non-bulk defects before applying the indicators to analyze water’s intrinsic structural properties in solutions. By doing so, the relationship between changes in water structure and solution behaviors can be more accurately assessed.},

We apply seven commonly used local structure detection algorithms to characterize crystal nuclei obtained from transition path sampling simulations. The polymorph composition of these nuclei varies significantly depending on the algorithm used. Our results indicate that one should be very careful when characterizing the local structure near solid–solid and solid–fluid interfaces. Particles near such interfaces exhibit a local structure distinct from that of bulk fluid or bulk crystal phases. We argue that incorporating outlier detection into the local structure detection method is beneficial, leading to greater confidence in the classification results. Interestingly, the bcc coating nearly disappears when adopting a machine learning method with outlier detection.},

  abstract     = {How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ( N ) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and 2 d -IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations (“pseudo-nematic domains”) as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with N . But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables) is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order—and that knowing the relationship between the two (the “equation of state”) can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.},

While the ground- and excited-state reduction potentials differ only slightly among the isomers of these complexes, our findings reveal significant variations in the radiative and non-radiative decay rates of the reactivity-controlling triplet 3 MLCT states of these closely related species. The observed differences in radiative decay rates could be traced back to variations in the transition dipole moment, vertical energy gaps, and spin–orbit coupling of the isomers. In [Ir(ppy) 2 (bpy)] + , transition dipole moment differences play a significant role in controlling the relative lifetime of the triplet states, which we rationalized by a vectorial analysis of permanent dipole moments of the ground and excited states. Regarding the two isomers of Ir(ppy) 3 , changes in radiative decay rates were primarily attributed to variations in vertical energy gaps and intensity borrowing from other singlet-singlet transitions driven by spin–orbit coupling. Non-radiative decay variations were assessed in terms of differences in reorganization energies, adiabatic energy gap, and spin–orbit coupling. For both complexes, reorganization energies associated with low-energy molecular vibrations and metal–ligand bond length changes following the de-excitation process were major contributors. These insights provide a deeper understanding of how molecular design can be leveraged to optimize the performance of iridium-based photoredox catalysts, potentially guiding the development of more efficient catalytic systems for future applications.},

Chemical dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental reaction rate and reveal that the E2 proceeding through a direct elimination mechanism dominates over S N 2 for the hydroxide ion reaction. This unexpected finding of a pronounced contribution of direct reaction dynamics, even at a near-thermal energy, is in strong contrast to the complex-mediated indirect mechanism for the fluoride case that characterizes the low-energy ion–molecule reactions. The entrance channel structures are found to be crucial and the differences are attributed to subtle changes in the hydrogen-bonding interaction of the approaching reactants.

  abstract     = {The first excited state of conjugated donor–acceptor molecules of C 3 symmetry (octupolar molecules) is doubly degenerate. Such a doublet is known to be isomorphic to a spin 1/2. It is shown that a large electric dipole moment is associated with this spin. Since the mean value of the electric dipole moment of an octupolar molecule is a measure of the symmetry breaking charge transfer, a dimensionless dipole moment called the dissymmetry vector is introduced. The dissymmetry vector operator is constructed. A linear tensor connection between this operator and the Pauli matrices is found. The tensor character is due to the two-dimensionality of the dipole moment. The dipole moment can rotate freely in the plane of the molecule as long as the C 3 symmetry is maintained. The rotation is associated only with the rearrangement of the electronic subsystem of the molecule and does not affect the spatial position of the nuclei. This opens up the possibility of changing the dipole moment state on a subpicosecond time scale. The Jahn–Teller effect on the dissymmetry vector is considered in detail. It is shown that the dissymmetry vector can be controlled using electric fields in the same way as three-dimensional spin if both static and alternating electric fields are in the plane of the molecule. The conducted studies indicate that the dipole moment of excited octupolar molecules is a promising candidate for the physical implementation of a qubit.},

These are the first gas-phase infrared spectra of H 2 O–O 2 and among only a few such results for O 2 -containing complexes. Almost 100 infrared lines are assigned based on the ground state combination differences from the microwave spectrum of H 2 O–O 2 . These lines belong to a main fundamental band, plus four combination bands lying 2 to 5 cm −1 above the fundamental. All correspond to the ortho -H 2 O ( I = 1) nuclear spin species. Interpretation of the observed rotational levels is discussed. The original microwave analysis conflicts with the infrared results but can be corrected by changing the sign of a term or, better still, by using a published theory for weakly bound open shell complexes. The combination bands suggest that analogous ground state bands should be observable in the millimeter wave range. Many infrared transitions remain unassigned, including another extensive band apparently centered at 1603 cm −1 , and some of these are probably due to the para -H 2 O spin species ( I = 0). Splittings due to the unpaired O 2 electron spin ( S = 1), due to large amplitude tunneling motions, and due to a -axis rotational motion all have similar magnitudes for H 2 O–O 2 , so the resulting energy levels will be heavily mixed and not amenable to simple modeling. Accurate theoretical predictions of these effects should be possible for obtaining an enhanced understanding of the observed spectra.},

Having polarizing agents as part of the structure enables signal enhancements within the bulk of the material. Nuclear spins can be hyperpolarized either directly through their coupling to the polarizing agent or via homonuclear spin diffusion. In this work, we addressed what are the factors determining the relative sizes of the spin pools polarized by each of these two mechanisms and how changing their contribution to the polarization process affects the experimental outcome. Experimentally, we adjusted the spin diffusion rate through modifying the isotope ratio 6 Li/ 7 Li in otherwise identical samples, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 doped with paramagnetic Fe(III). DNP experiments on samples with typical content of polarizing agents for MI-DNP, corroborated by simulations, evidenced that while the efficiency of spin diffusion has large effects on the polarization buildup times, the enhancements remain largely unaffected.},

  abstract     = {We present an algorithm that combines quantum scattering calculations with probabilistic machine-learning models to predict quantum dynamics rate coefficients for a large number of state-to-state transitions in molecule–molecule collisions much faster than with direct solutions of the Schrödinger equation. By utilizing the predictive power of Gaussian process regression with kernels, optimized to make accurate predictions outside of the input parameter space, the present strategy reduces the computational cost by about 75%, with an accuracy within 5%. Our method uses temperature dependences of rate coefficients for transitions from the isolated states of initial rotational angular momentum j , determined via explicit calculations, to predict the temperature dependences of rate coefficients for other values of j . The approach, demonstrated here for rovibrational transitions of SiO due to thermal collisions with H 2 , uses different prediction models and is thus adaptive to various time and accuracy requirements. The procedure outlined in this work can be used to extend multiple inelastic molecular collision databases without exponentially large computational resources required for conventional rigorous quantum dynamics calculations.},

  abstract     = {Vibro-polaritons are hybrid light–matter states that arise from the strong coupling between the molecular vibrational transitions and the photons in an optical cavity. Developing theoretical and computational methods to describe and predict the unique properties of vibro-polaritons is of great significance for guiding the design of new materials and experiments. Here, we present the ab initio cavity Born–Oppenheimer density functional theory (CBO-DFT) and formulate the analytic energy gradient and Hessian as well as the nuclear and photonic derivatives of dipole and polarizability within the framework of CBO-DFT to efficiently calculate the harmonic vibrational frequencies, infrared absorption, and Raman scattering spectra of vibro-polaritons as well as to explore the critical points on the cavity potential energy surface. The implementation of analytic derivatives into the electronic structure package is validated by a comparison with the finite-difference method and with other reported computational results. By adopting appropriate exchange–correlation functionals, CBO-DFT can better describe the structure and properties of molecules in the cavity than CBO-Hartree–Fock method. It is expected that CBO-DFT is a useful tool for studying the polaritonic structures and properties.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, excitation energies in coupled-cluster (CC) theory have been calculated by solving the CC Jacobian eigenvalue equation. However, based on our recent work [Jørgensen et al. , Sci. Adv. 10 , eadn3454 (2024)], we propose a reformulation of the calculation of excitation energies where excitation energies are determined as a conventional molecular property. To this end, we introduce an excitation-energy function that depends on the CC Jacobian and the right and left eigenvectors for the Jacobian eigenvalue problem. This excitation-energy function is variational with respect to the right and left eigenvectors but not with respect to the cluster amplitudes. Instead, the cluster amplitudes satisfy the cluster-amplitude equations, and we set up an excitation-energy Lagrangian by adding to the excitation-energy function the cluster-amplitude equations with an undetermined multiplier for each cluster-amplitude constraint. The excitation-energy Lagrangian is variational in all its parameters. Based on the variational property of the Lagrangian, we have determined two quadratically convergent excitation-energy series: the total-order cluster-perturbation (tCP) and variational cluster-perturbation (vCP) excitation-energy series. Calculations of the excitation energies of three small molecules have shown that the vCP series is to be preferred over the tCP series. The test calculations have been carried out for CPS(D) expansions [targeting the CC singles-and-doubles (CCSD) wave function from the CC singles wave function] and the CPSD(T) expansion [targeting the CC singles-doubles-triples (CCSDT) wave function from the CCSD wave function]. For the S(D) and SD(T) orbital excitation space calculations, we obtain in the second vCP iteration excitation energies with a mean deviation from CCSD excitation energies of about 0.04 eV for the S(D) orbital spaces, and for the SD(T) orbital space calculation, we obtain a mean deviation from the CCSDT excitation energies of 0.001 eV.},

  abstract     = {Typical path integral Monte Carlo approaches use the primitive approximation to compute the probability density for a given path. In this work, we develop the pair discrete variable representation (pair-DVR) approach to study molecular rotations. The pair propagator, which was initially introduced to study superfluidity in condensed helium, is naturally well-suited for systems interacting with a pairwise potential. Consequently, paths sampled using the pair action tend to be closer to the exact paths (compared to primitive Trotter paths) for such systems leading to convergence with less imaginary time steps. Our approach relies on using the pair factorization approach in conjunction with a discretized path integral ground state paradigm to study a chain of planar rotors interacting with a pairwise dipole interaction. We first use the Wigner–Kirkwood density expansion to analyze the asymptotics of the pair propagator in imaginary time. Then, we exhibit the utility of the pair factorization scheme via convergence studies comparing the pair and primitive propagators. Finally, we compute energetic and structural properties of this system including the correlation function and Binder ratio as functions of the coupling strength to examine the behavior of the pair-DVR method near criticality. The density matrix renormalization group results are used for benchmarking throughout.},

  abstract     = {One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e., accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Similarly, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g., by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid–liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibrium processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes and could suggest a possible biological reason for the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of several density-based methods in predicting the inversion of S 1 and T 1 states of a few N-heterocyclic triangulene based fused ring molecules (popularly known as INVEST molecules) with an eye to identify a well performing but cost-effective preliminary screening method. Both conventional linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) and ΔSCF methods (namely maximum overlap method, square-gradient minimization method, and restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham) are considered for excited state computations using exchange–correlation (XC) functionals from different rungs of Jacob’s ladder. A well-justified systematism is observed in the performance of the functionals when compared against fully internally contracted multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles and/or equation of motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD), with the most important feature being the capture of spin-polarization in the presence of correlation. A set of functionals with the least mean absolute error is proposed for both the approaches, LR-TDDFT and ΔSCF, which can be more cost-effective alternatives for computations on synthesizable larger derivatives of the templates studied here. We have based our findings on extensive studies of three cyclazine-based molecular templates, with additional studies on a set of six related templates. Previous benchmark studies for subsets of the functionals were conducted against the domain-based local pair natural orbital-similarity transformed EOM-CCSD (STEOM-CCSD), which resulted in an inadequate evaluation due to deficiencies in the benchmark theory. The role of exact-exchange, spin-contamination, and spin-polarization in the context of DFT comes to the forefront in our studies and supports the numerical evaluation of XC functionals for these applications. Suitable connections are drawn to two and three state exciton models, which identify the minimal physics governing the interactions in these molecules.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) approach to address the rotational corrections in multicomponent quantum chemistry calculations where hydrogen nuclei and electrons are described with orbitals under Hartree–Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) frameworks. The rotational corrections are required in systems such as diatomic (HX) and nonlinear triatomic molecules (HXY), where localized broken-symmetry nuclear orbitals have a lower energy than delocalized orbitals with the correct symmetry. By restoring rotational symmetry with the proposed NOCI approach, we demonstrate significant improvements in proton binding energy predictions at the HF level, with average rotational corrections of 0.46 eV for HX and 0.23 eV for HXY molecules. For computing rotational excitation energies, our results indicate that HF kinetic energy corrections are consistently accurate, while discrepancies arise in total energy predictions, primarily from an incomplete treatment of dynamical correlation effects. Rotational energy corrections in multicomponent DFT calculations, using the epc17-2 proton–electron correlation functional, lead to an overestimation of proton binding energies. This is as a result of double-counting of proton–electron correlation effects in the off-diagonal NOCI terms. As a correction, we propose a scaling scheme that effectively adjusts the proton–electron correlation contributions, bringing our results into close agreement with reference CCSD(T) data. The scaled rotational corrections, on average, increase the epc17-2 proton binding energy predictions by 0.055 eV for HX and 0.025 eV for HXY and yield average deviations of 1.0 cm −1 for rotational transitions.},

Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe’s method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, Explicitly Correlated Gaussian (ECGs) functions with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Hénon–Heiles potential and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30–40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Therefore, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe’s method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.},

The first is a test case validation of our approach for the insertion of a Xe atom in UO 2 . The second explores the relationship between cluster structure stability and oxygen chemical potential in overstoichiometric UO 2+x oxide as a function of temperature from 800 to 2000 K and composition, from UO 2 to UO 2.16 , using two different empirical potentials. We find that the evolution of the oxygen chemical potential is irregular, with dips for specific numbers of added oxygen atoms. Five oxygen clusters are stable at 800 K and are associated with strong dips in the chemical potential values. At intermediate temperatures, clusters of four and five oxygen atoms compete in stability. They become unstable at the highest temperatures, and the evolution of the chemical potential is then monotonous with composition.},

  abstract     = {While most thermostats in molecular dynamics are designed for equilibrium systems, their extension to non-equilibrium simulations has little theoretical justification. In the literature, an artifact referred to as “lane formation” was discovered; however, its cause remained unclear and was simply attributed to a constraint on velocity fluctuations or non-ergodicity in thermostats. In addition, global deterministic thermostatted dynamics was found to exhibit unceasing phase-space compression in steady states, incompatible with their expected stationary distributions and Gibbs entropy, which was mistakenly perceived as inescapable. In this work, we pinpoint that the dynamical cause of artificial lane formation is a stable fixed point in the momentum space induced by improper velocity rescaling, which produces effective repulsion between different species in a color flow, drains transverse kinetic energy and generates the unceasing compression. This artifact is deeply rooted in global deterministic thermostats, such as the Nosé–Hoover dynamics and configurational thermostat. With proper rescaling, the Langevin thermostat completely eliminates artificial lane formation and exemplifies how incompressible phase space and stationary distributions can be retained for non-equilibrium steady states.},

These ML-predicted KS Hamiltonians are then employed for sTDA-based excited-state calculations (sTDA/ML). The results demonstrate that excited-state energies, time-derivative nonadiabatic couplings, and absorption spectra from sTDA/ML calculations are accurate enough compared with those from conventional density functional theory based sTDA (sTDA/DFT) calculations. Furthermore, sTDA/ML-based nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations on two different materials systems, namely chloro-substituted silicon quantum dot and monolayer black phosphorus, achieve more than 100 times speedup than the conventional linear response time-dependent DFT simulations.

As a proof of concept, the estimator is applied to calculate the partition function for several model systems, ranging from a simple harmonic oscillator to a Lennard-Jones fluid with hundreds of particles. Our results agree well with the numerically exact solutions or reference data, demonstrating that efficiently estimating partition functions for the studied example cases is possible and computationally affordable.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasound can be used to manipulate protein function and activity, as well as for targeted drug delivery, making it a powerful diagnostic and therapeutic modality with wide applications in sonochemistry, nanotechnology, and engineering. However, a general particle-based approach to ultrasound modeling remains challenging due to the significant disparity between characteristic time scales governing ultrasound propagation. In this study, we use open-boundary molecular dynamics to simulate ultrasound waves in liquid water under ambient conditions by employing supramolecular water models, i.e., the Martini 3, dissipative particle dynamics, and many-body dissipative particle dynamics models. We demonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces the solution of the traveling wave equation and captures the velocity dispersion characteristic of high-frequency ultrasound waves.},

  abstract     = {Much can be learned about molecular aggregates by modeling their fluorescence-type spectra. In this study, we systematically describe the accuracy of various methods for simulating fluorescence-type linear spectra in a dimer system with a complex system–environment interaction, which serves as a model for various molecular aggregates, including most photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). We consider the approximate full cumulant expansion (FCE), complex time-dependent Redfield (ctR), time-independent Redfield, and modified Redfield methods and calculate their accuracy as a function of the site energy gap and coupling, excitonic energy gap, and dipole factor (i.e., type of spectrum). We find that the FCE method is the most accurate method for couplings smaller than 300 cm −1 at 300 K, but this method fails for very strong couplings or low temperatures due to inaccurate modeling of the equilibrium initial state. The ctR method performs well for the calculation of fluorescence and linear anisotropy spectra but poorer for circularly polarized fluorescence spectra or for all spectra when the coupling is strong ( ∼ 100 c m − 1 ) ⁠ . The Redfield and modified Redfield methods generally perform much more poorly than the ctR and FCE methods—especially for small excitonic energy gaps and strong couplings. We show that accurate modeling of the Stokes shift is crucial and present a version of the ctR method that treats both the Stokes shift and initial state correctly for the parameter ranges in plant LHCs. Apart from the application to LHCs, our results will be useful for the spectral characterization and design of organic molecular aggregates.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic DNA is packaged in the cell nucleus into chromatin, composed of arrays of DNA–histone protein octamer complexes, the nucleosomes. Over the past decade, it has become clear that chromatin structure in vivo is not a hierarchy of well-organized folded nucleosome fibers but displays considerable conformational variability and heterogeneity. In vitro and in viv o studies, as well as computational modeling, have revealed that attractive nucleosome–nucleosome interaction with an essential role of nucleosome stacking defines chromatin compaction. The internal structure of compacted nucleosome arrays is regulated by the flexible and dynamic histone N-terminal tails. Since DNA is a highly negatively charged polyelectrolyte, electrostatic forces make a decisive contribution to chromatin formation and require the histones, particularly histone tails, to carry a significant positive charge. This also results in an essential role of mobile cations of the cytoplasm (K + , Na + , Mg 2+ ) in regulating electrostatic interactions. Building on a previously successfully established bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) nucleosome model, we have developed a CG nucleosome array (chromatin fiber) model with the explicit presence of mobile ions and studied its conformational variability as a function of Na + and Mg 2+ ion concentration. With progressively elevated ion concentrations, we identified four main conformational states of nucleosome arrays characterized as extended, flexible, nucleosome-clutched, and globular fibers.},

Investigating the structural and property characteristics of composite hydrogels is crucial in tailoring their performance for specific applications. This study focuses on investigating the correlation between the structural arrangement and properties of a composite hydrogel of thermoresponsive polymer, gelatin, and light-responsive antimicrobial porous gold nanorods ( PAuNRs ). The rheomechanical properties of the composite hydrogels are correlated with their nanoscale structural characteristics, investigated using small-angle neutron scattering ( SANS ). Analysis of SANS data reveals a decrease in the fractal dimension of PAuNRs incorporated hydrogel matrix, as compared to pure gelatin. Incorporating PAuNRs results in the formation of a softer composite hydrogel, as evident from the decrease in viscoelastic moduli, critical yield strain, denaturation temperature, and swelling ratio. Our results demonstrate that the structural modulation at the nanoscale can be precisely controlled through adjusting PAuNRs concentration and temperature, providing a fabrication mechanism for hydrogels with desired elastic properties. The reduced elasticity of the composite hydrogel and light-sensitive/antimicrobial property of the PAuNRs make this system suitable for specific biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, device fabrication, and stimuli-based controlled drug delivery devices.},

In addition, they are able to affect the physical mechanisms shaping chromatin 3D structure, with a consequent impact on gene activity. Here, we investigate with polymer physics genome re-organization of the host genome upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and how it can impact structural variability within the population of single-cell chromatin configurations. Using published Hi-C data and molecular dynamics simulations, we build ensembles of 3D configurations representing single-cell chromatin conformations in control and SARS-CoV-2 infected conditions. We focus on genomic length scales of TADs and consider, as a case study, models of real loci containing DDX58 and IL6 genes, belonging, respectively, to the antiviral interferon response and pro-inflammatory genes. Clustering analysis applied to the ensemble of polymer configurations reveals a generally increased variability and a more heterogeneous population of 3D structures in infected conditions. This points toward a scenario in which viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity with, likely, a consequent impact on the correct regulation of host cell genes.},

  abstract     = {Diblock copolyelectrolytes have significant potential in applications such as solid-state single-ion conductors, but precisely controlling their nanostructures for efficient ion transport remains a challenge. In this study, we explore the phase behavior and microphase transitions of A X B Y -type diblock copolyelectrolytes under alternating electric fields using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We systematically investigate the effects of various electric field features, including unipolar and bipolar square-waves, as well as offset and non-offset sine-waves, focusing on how field strength and period influence the self-assembling morphology of the copolyelectrolytes. Under unipolar square-waves, both the lamellar and cylindrical phase regions expand, while the disordered phase regions shrink as the field strength increases. In contrast, bipolar square-waves maintain lamellar structures more robustly, with reversed stretching behavior observed in the polymer chains. As the electric field period exceeds a critical value, both waveforms converge with the results seen under constant electric fields. In addition, sine-waves induce smoother phase transitions, expanding the ordered phase regions, particularly the cylindrical phase, due to continuous field variation. We further examine the detailed structural and dynamic properties, such as mean-square displacement, polymer conformation, and chain orientation during these transitions. This work provides fundamental insights into the structural regulation of diblock copolyelectrolytes under oscillating electric fields, guiding the design of advanced polymeric electrolytes with tailored nanostructures.},

  abstract     = {In biological systems such as cells, the macromolecules, which are anisotropic particles, diffuse in a crowded medium. In the present work, we have studied the diffusion of spheroidal particles diffusing between cylindrical obstacles by varying the density of the obstacles as well as the spheroidal particles. Analytical calculation of the free energy showed that the orientational vector of a single oblate particle will be aligned perpendicular, and a prolate particle will be aligned parallel to the symmetry axis of the cylindrical obstacles in equilibrium. The nematic transition of the system with and without obstacles remained the same, but in the case of obstacles, the nematic vector of the spheroid system always remained parallel to the cylindrical axis. The component of the translational diffusion coefficient of the spheroidal particle perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder is calculated for the isotropic system, which agrees with analytical calculation. When the cylinders overlap such that the spheroidal particles can only diffuse along the direction parallel to the axis of the cylinder, we can observe dimensional confinement. This was observed by the discontinuous fall of the diffusion coefficient, when plotted against the chemical potential both for a single particle and for a finite volume fraction. The rotational diffusion coefficient quickly reached the bulk value as the distance between the obstacles increased in the isotropic phase. In the nematic phase, the rotational motion of the spheroid should be arrested. We observed that even though the entire system remained in the nematic phase, the oblate particle close to the cylinder underwent a flipping motion. The consequence is that when the rotational mean squared displacement was calculated, it showed a super-diffusive behavior even though the orientational self-correlation function never relaxed to zero, showing this to be a very local effect.},

  abstract     = {Although impurities are unavoidable in real-world and experimental systems, most numerical studies on nucleation focus on pure (impurity-free) systems. As a result, the role of impurities in phase transitions remains poorly understood, especially for systems with complex free energy landscapes featuring one or more intermediate metastable phases. In this study, we employed Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the effects of static impurities (quenched disorder) of varying length scales and surface morphologies on the crystal nucleation mechanism and kinetics in the Gaussian core model system—a representative model for soft colloidal systems. We first explored how the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size are influenced by the fraction of randomly pinned (or, static) particles ( f p ) and the size ( n p ) of the pinned region or cluster. Both the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size increase sharply with increasing f p but decrease as n p grows for a given fraction of pinned particles, eventually approaching the homogeneous nucleation limit. On examining the impact of impurity’s surface morphology on nucleation kinetics, we observed that the nucleation barrier significantly decreases with increasing the impurity (or, seed) size with crystalline surface morphologies with body-centered cubic showing the greatest facilitation. Interestingly, seeds with random surface roughness had little effect on nucleation kinetics. In addition, the polymorphic identity of particles in the final crystalline phase is influenced by both the seed’s surface morphology and system size. This study further provides crucial insights into the intricate relationship between surface-induced local structural fluctuations and the selection of the polymorphic identity in the final crystalline phase, which is essential for understanding and controlling crystallization processes in experiments.},

The structure, compositions, and morphology of the carbon-based Mo 2 C were characterized, and the Mo 2 C NPs were well dispersed on the carbon nanosheets. The electrochemical study shows that optimal Mo 2 C exhibits excellent electrochemical properties for the oxidation of nicotine compared with other materials in the broad linear range of 0.2–300 μ M. In particular, it displays a remarkable oxidation ability for the low-concentration nicotine (0.2–5 μ M), and the detection limit is about 0.17 μ M. Furthermore, the exposed dual crystal planes of Mo 2 C play a critical role in the oxidation. Notably, this characteristic of Mo 2 C NPs makes it possible to detect nicotine from the extracted solution and be used for chip electrodes to detect nicotine quickly via wireless response, which exhibits actual application prospects for portable detection.

A comparison of the SFG spectra of the CCl 4 /RTIL and air/RTIL interfaces revealed that the solvation of the alkyl chains of the [C n mim] + cations by CCl 4 reduces the number of gauche defects in the alkyl chain and the interface number density of the cation at the CCl 4 interface. The orientational change of the [TFSA] − anion and concomitant increase in the area it occupies at the CCl 4 interface was observed to be greater than that at the air interface. This is accompanied by the expansion of the space among the alkyl chains of the cations to be solvated by CCl 4 . The structural change of the CCl 4 interface from the air interface can be attributed to the solvophilic effect of CCl 4 on the alkyl chains of the cations at the CCl 4 /[C n mim][TFSA] interface. This is in contrast with the solvophobic effect of CCl 4 on the Langmuir film at the CCl 4 /water interface. This phenomenon is caused by the loosely packed alkyl chains of the cations at the RTIL surface and the flexible anion–cation arrangement owing to the weak basicity and acidity of the ions in the RTILs.},

  abstract     = {Organic multilayer systems, which are stacked layers of different organic materials, are used in various organic electronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). In particular, OFETs are promising as key components in flexible electronic devices. In this study, we investigated how the inclusion of an insulating tetratetracontane (TTC) interlayer in ambipolar indigo-based OFETs can be used to alter the crystallinity and electrical properties of the indigo charge transport layer. We find that the inclusion of a 20-nm-thick TTC film thermally annealed at a low temperature of 70 °C acts to significantly increase the ambipolar electrical transport of the indigo layer. X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and vibrational sum frequency generation measurements showed that annealing the TTC film significantly improved its ordering. The electronic sum-frequency generation spectra of TTC/indigo bilayers show that this improved ordering of TTC films promotes the growth of crystalline indigo films that exhibit charge mobilities in OFET that are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those measured for devices grown on unannealed TTC layers. Furthermore, using vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy, we found that pre-annealing the TTC layer prior to indigo deposition can suppress the formation of defects within the TTC layer during indigo film growth, which also contributes to enhanced charge transport. Our results highlight the importance of controlling the molecular ordering within the interlayer contacts in OFET structures to achieve an enhanced performance.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic materials hold tremendous potential for many advanced applications, but candidates are quite scarce, especially at two dimensions. Here, we focus on two-dimensional (2D) metal dichalcogenides and dihalides with the chemical formula MX 2 by screening structures sharing the P 4 ̄ m 2 space group among 330 MX 2 compounds from the computational 2D materials database. Via high-throughput first-principles computations, 25 stable MX 2 ( M = Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ge, Cd, Sn; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se) systems with in-plane negative Poisson’s ratios (NPRs) are successfully identified. Within these structures, 2D NiCl 2 has the largest NPR value of −0.34, with a magnitude significantly higher than those of black phosphorene (−0.027) and SnO 2 (−0.1). The distinct auxetic effect in MX 2 originates from both the unique local corner-sharing tetrahedral structural motif under the low-dimensional effect and the strong orbital interaction between the d orbitals of M and the p orbitals of halogen/chalcogen atoms. As a result, Poisson’s ratio can be effectively tuned by enhancing the d – p interaction through an external biaxial strain. We reveal that these auxetic materials exhibit rich electronic and magnetic properties, covering nonmagnetic, ferromagnetic, or anti-ferromagnetic metals, semiconductors, and insulators. The extraordinary auxetic behaviors in combination with rich physical properties could lead to multifunctional nanomechanical, optoelectronic, and spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous-dominated magnesium oxide hollow spheres (A-MgO) were prepared using a spray-drying method in this study. These hollow spheres exhibited excellent sphericity, large specific surface areas, and abundant porosity. A-MgO exhibited outstanding fluoride adsorption properties, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 260.4 mg/g. When the pH value was less than 8, the fluoride removal percentage remained more than 87.4%. Moreover, the removal percentage remained above 75% even after five application cycles. In addition, the research revealed that SO 4 2− , CO 3 2− , and PO 4 3 − exerted a more pronounced effect on fluoride removal, whereas coexisting ions such as Br − , Cl − , NO 3 − , and HCO 3 − had minimal impact on this process. An in-depth analysis of the adsorption mechanism demonstrated that the process of fluoride adsorption by A-MgO involves various synergistic mechanisms, such as electrostatic adsorption, ion exchange, oxygen vacancy adsorption, physical adsorption, and pore filling. To predict the fluoride ion adsorption performance of A-MgO under complex conditions, a high-performance machine learning model, GBDT-S, was developed using hyperparameter optimization. The R 2 of 0.99 and 0.80 for the training and testing datasets, respectively, with the RMSE of 3.26 and 3.89. Interpretative analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations technology indicated that reaction time, PO 4 3 − concentration, and pH were key factors influencing the fluoride ion removal percentage.},

In these applications, the rubrene crystals often contact ionic liquids and other materials. Consequently, their surface properties and interfacial interactions influence the device’s performance. Although rubrene has been extensively studied with multiple structure characterization techniques, a complete description of the structure of rubrene single-crystal surfaces at the molecular level remains elusive. This study elucidates the molecular orientation and arrangement on the surface of rubrene single crystals with sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and reflection high-energy electron diffraction, respectively. The results confirm the near-surface unit cells with in-plane lattice parameters of a = 7.24 Å and b = 14.3 Å and an out-of-plane constant of c = 26.9 Å. Furthermore, the SFG analysis yields the tilt and rotation angles of θ = 15° and φ = 43° with respect to the crystalline c and a axes, respectively, and an in-plane twist of ψ = 3° for the surface phenyl rings.},

  abstract     = {Rigid, non-polarizable water models are very efficient from a computational point of view, and some of them have a great ability in predicting experimental properties. There is, however, little room for improvement in simulating water with this strategy, whose main shortcoming is that water molecules do not change their interaction parameters in response to the local molecular landscape. In this work, we propose a novel modeling strategy that involves using two rigid non-polarizable models as states that water molecules can adopt depending on their molecular environment. During the simulation, molecules dynamically transition from one state to another depending on a local order parameter that quantifies some local structural feature. In particular, molecules belonging to low- and high-tetrahedral order environments are represented with the TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/Ice rigid models, respectively. In this way, the interaction between water molecules is strengthened when they acquire a tetrahedral coordination, which can be viewed as an effective way of introducing polarization effects. We call the resulting model TIP 4 P 2005 Ice and show that it outperforms either of the rigid models that build it. This multi-state strategy only slows down simulations by a factor of 1.5 compared to using a standard non-polarizable model and holds great promise for improving simulations of water and aqueous solutions.},

The proportion of electride increases with pressure and temperature until reaching saturation, leading to notable changes in the pair-correlation function and coordination number of l -Al at saturation pressure. Furthermore, this electride transition was found to profoundly impact the thermodynamic and dynamic properties, as evidenced by anomalous crossovers in the isothermal bulk modulus, thermal expansivity, heat capacity, sound speed, and self-diffusion coefficient correlated with varying pressure and temperature. The finding of the anomalous behavior of l -Al described in this work will deepen our understanding of the electronic structure and also lay ground work for interpreting and predicting new physical and chemical behavior under extreme conditions.},

Then, ring polymer molecular dynamics is used to derive the free energy barrier of the reaction at the experimental temperature range of 472.55–532.92 K. Reaction kinetics are studied at the high-pressure limit and in the fall-off region by standard transition state theory and the master equation, respectively. The calculated temperature- and pressure-dependent rate coefficients are in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical results. Furthermore, quasi-classical trajectory simulations are performed on this PES to study the intramolecular energy transfer dynamics at initial vibrational energies of 4.336, 5.204, and 6.505 eV.},

This approach treats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial for the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of merit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in vibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the dynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends on voltage and electronic–vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We demonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational polarization, indicating that the dynamics of molecular vibrations is the driving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.},

Among the observed molecules are oxygen-bearing organic molecules, which are of high interest given their significant role in astrobiology. Despite the observed rich chemistry, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for molecular formation in such cold dilute areas are still not fully understood. In this paper, we study the unique chemistry taking place in astronomically relevant ices, where UV radiation is a central driving force for chemical reactions. Photofragmentation of ice components gives rise to highly reactive species, such as the O( 1 D) atom. These species provide a pathway for chemical complexity even in cold areas. Using quantum chemistry calculations, we demonstrate that O( 1 D) reacts barrierlessly with hydrocarbons. Moreover, photoprocessing of the reaction products (and other components of the ice), followed by radical recombination, is found to be an essential part of the overall mechanism. In ice containing O( 1 D) and hydrocarbons, the formation of formaldehyde in methane ice, acetaldehyde in ethane ice, and carbon monoxide in acetylene ice, and the consumption of alcohol in all systems, was predicted in agreement with experimental results.},

However, their differences in hot-electron relaxation dynamics remain unclear.

In this work, the hot-electron relaxations of endohedral B@C 60 + and exohedral C 60 B + are investigated using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the location of the boron atom—inside or outside the fullerene—significantly impacts the bonding interactions between boron and C 60 . Compared to C 60 B + , the weaker interactions in B@C 60 + reduce the orbital overlap between LUMO+3 and LUMO+2 and increase the energy gap between them. This, in turn, slows hot-electron relaxation by weak nonadiabatic coupling, making B@C 60 + more suitable for PSC applications. This study provides valuable insights into how atomic positioning affects the electronic properties in fullerene-based materials, contributing to the design of more efficient electron acceptors for photovoltaic devices.},

The electron–electron (e–e) interactions in these sequences can severely disrupt the efficiency of electron–nuclear (e–n) polarization transfer. In order to tackle this issue, we propose the magic-NOVEL DNP method, utilizing Lee–Goldburg decoupling to counteract e–e coupling effects. Our theoretical analysis and quantum mechanical simulations reveal that magic-NOVEL significantly improves the transfer efficiency of DNP, even at shorter e–e distances. This method offers a new perspective for advancing pulsed DNP techniques in systems with dense electron spin baths.

  abstract     = {We developed a technique allowing the direct observation of photoinduced charge-transfer states (CTSs)—the weakly coupled electron–hole pairs preceding the completely separated charges in organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends. Quadrature detection of the electron spin echo (ESE) signal enables the observation of an out-of-phase ESE signal of CTS. The out-of-phase Electron–Electron Double Resonance (ELDOR) allows measuring electron–hole distance distributions within CTS and its temporal evolution in the microsecond range. The technique was applied to OPV bulk heterojunction blends of different donor polymers, including the benchmark polymer P3HT and the high-performance polymer PCDTBT, with the fullerene PC 61 BM acceptor. The corresponding electron–hole distance distributions were obtained using the Tikhonov regularization. It was found that not only the dipolar interaction but also the exchange interaction contributes to the formation of the out-of-phase ELDOR signal. By varying the delay time after photoexcitation, we observed CTSs at different stages of charge separation. The initial distribution of the electron–hole distances for different blends correlates with their photoelectric conversion efficiency, with shorter average thermalization distances found for the blends of PC 61 BM with the less efficient regiorandom polymer P3HT. Spin-selective recombination of the CTS was unambiguously demonstrated for the blend of regioregular P3HT with PC 61 BM. It produces characteristic features in the out-of-phase ELDOR trace for small “dipolar” evolution times. These data allow us to estimate the CTS recombination rate for a certain distance between the electron and the hole within the CTS. The proposed method can be used to probe CTS in a variety of OPV active layer materials.},

  abstract     = {We outline two general theoretical techniques to simulate polariton quantum dynamics and optical spectra under the collective coupling regimes described by a Holstein–Tavis–Cummings (HTC) model Hamiltonian. The first one takes advantage of sparsity of the HTC Hamiltonian, which allows one to reduce the cost of acting polariton Hamiltonian onto a state vector to the linear order of the number of states, instead of the quadratic order. The second one is applying the well-known Chebyshev series expansion approach for quantum dynamics propagation and to simulate the polariton dynamics in the HTC system; this approach allows us to use a much larger time step for propagation and only requires a few recursive operations of the polariton Hamiltonian acting on state vectors. These two theoretical approaches are general and can be applied to any trajectory-based non-adiabatic quantum dynamics methods. We apply these two techniques with our previously developed Lindblad-partially linearized density matrix approach to simulate the linear absorption spectra of the HTC model system, with both inhomogeneous site energy disorders and dipolar orientational disorders. Our numerical results agree well with the previous analytic and numerical work.},

  abstract     = {Isonitrile-derivatized amino acids are emerging as highly effective infrared (IR) probes for investigating the structures and dynamics of hydrogen (H)-bonds. These probes enable the quantification of chemical exchange processes in solute–solvent complexes via two-dimensional IR spectroscopy and hold significant promise for site-specific dynamic studies within proteins. Despite their potential, theoretical models that elucidate the solvatochromism of isonitriles remain underdeveloped. Here, we present the development and validation of a solvatochromic charge model for isonitrile (N≡C) probes. Using density functional theory calculations, we parameterized solvatochromic charges for isonitrile and integrated them into classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of β -isocyanoalanine in various solvents, including water and fluorinated alcohols. The model incorporates solvent-induced frequency shifts and accurately reproduces complex experimental line shapes, including asymmetric features from non-Gaussian dynamics. The model successfully reproduced the bimodal distribution of frequency shifts corresponding to free and H-bonded species in alcohols, as well as cross-peaks due to chemical exchange. Achieving reproducibility required long MD trajectories, which were computationally demanding. To manage this, we implemented graphics processing unit acceleration, drastically reducing the computational time and enabling the efficient processing of extensive MD data. While some discrepancies in population ratios suggest the need for refined solvent force field parameters and modeling transition dipole moment variations, the developed solvatochromic model is a reliable tool for studying the solvation dynamics. The model enables more detailed investigations of ultrafast dynamics in solute–solvent complexes and represents important steps toward modeling site-specific dynamics of biomolecules with isonitrile probes.},

Moreover, in sharp contrast to a constant height, the height of the peaks will manifest a damped oscillation with respect to the population time. It seems that the quantum-beat phenomenon appears.

  abstract     = {Developing efficient path integral (PI) methods for atomistic simulations of vibrational spectra in heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces has long been a challenging task. Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid centroid molecular dynamics, which combines the recently introduced fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that are believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g., water, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are treated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the infrared spectra of the interfacial D 2 O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90 framework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially adiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are also made with classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected entirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250–600 K show that h-CMD produces O–D stretches that are in close agreement with the experiment, correcting the known curvature problem and redshifting of the stretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too artificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing the characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering it unsuitable for these systems. The new h-CMD method broadens the applicability of f-QCMD to heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, where defining curvilinear coordinates for the entire system is not feasible.},

  abstract     = {The self-consistent field (SCF) procedure is the standard technique for solving the Hartree–Fock and Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations, while convergence is not theoretically guaranteed. Direct minimization methods, such as the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and second-order SCF (SOSCF), obtain the SCF solution by minimizing the Lagrangian with the gradient. In SOSCF, molecular orbitals are optimized by truncating the Taylor expansion of a unitary matrix represented in exponential form to ensure the orthonormality condition. This study proposes an alternative algorithm for direct-energy minimization to obtain an SCF solution using ALM Lagrangian by adopting sequential Givens rotations between occupied and virtual orbitals. The Givens rotation corresponds to unitary transformations that guarantee orthogonality and avoid variational collapse. Complex gradients for sequential Givens rotation were obtained by the error back-propagation method, which is based on the chain rule. Illustrative applications clarified the features of the present DGR methods by comparing with other SCF algorithms such as direct inversion in iterative subspace, SOSCF, and ALM.},

In this study, we explore the effectiveness of SCAN in simulating the electronic properties of displacive ferroelectrics (BaTiO 3 and PbTiO 3 ) and magnetoelectric multiferroics (BiFeO 3 and YMnO 3 ), which encompass a broad spectrum of bonding characteristics. Due to a significant reduction in self-interaction error, SCAN manifests its improvements over the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) method in three aspects: SCAN predicts more accurate ionicity, produces more compact orbitals, and better captures d -orbital anisotropy. Particularly, these synergistic enhancements lead to notable phenomena in calculating the bandgap of YMnO 3 : while the PBE+ U simulation may suggest a strong correlation appearance attributed to high Hubbard-like U values (∼5 eV), the value is dramatically lower (∼1 eV) in the SCAN+ U method. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive analysis of SCAN’s operational principles by examining the complex electron densities involved. These insights are theoretically intriguing and have practical implications, potentially encouraging wider adoption of SCAN in the computational modeling of complex functional materials.},

  abstract     = {The computational spectroscopy of water has proven to be a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of chemical systems and for providing atomistic insight into experimental vibrational spectroscopic results. However, such calculations have been limited for biochemical systems due to the lack of empirical vibrational frequency maps for the TIP3P water model, which is used in many popular biomolecular force fields. Here, we develop an empirical map for the TIP3P model and evaluate its efficacy for reproducing the experimental vibrational spectroscopy of water. We observe that the calculated infrared and Raman spectra are blueshifted and narrowed compared to the experimental spectra. Further analysis finds that the blueshift originates from a shifted distribution of frequencies, rather than other dynamical effects, suggesting that the TIP3P model forms a significantly different electrostatic environment than other three-point water models. This is explored further by examining the two-dimensional infrared spectra, which demonstrates that the blueshift is significant for the first two vibrational transitions. Similarly, spectral diffusion timescales, evaluated through both the center line slope and the frequency–frequency time correlation function demonstrate that TIP3P exhibits significantly faster spectral dynamics than other three-point models. Finally, sum-frequency generation spectroscopy calculations suggest that despite these challenges, the TIP3P empirical map can provide phenomenological, qualitative, insight into the behavior of water at the air–water and lipid–water interfaces. As these interfaces are models for hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments observed in biochemical systems, the presently developed empirical map will be useful for future studies of biochemical systems.},

We implemented AL with Gaussian processes (GP) and used the many-body tensor as molecular representation. For the first task, we tested different data acquisition strategies, batch sizes, and GP noise settings. AL was insensitive to the acquisition batch size, and we observed the best AL performance for the acquisition strategy that combines uncertainty reduction with clustering to promote diversity. However, for optimal GP noise settings, AL did not outperform the randomized selection of data points. Conversely, for targeted searches, AL outperformed random sampling and achieved data savings of up to 64%. Our analysis provides insight into this task-specific performance difference in terms of target distributions and data collection strategies. We established that the performance of AL depends on the relative distribution of the target molecules in comparison to the total dataset distribution, with the largest computational savings achieved when their overlap is minimal.},

The focus is on the mean particle lifetime, which is its mean first-passage time to one of the spots. When the spots are small and their radii are well below the cavity radius, this time can be analyzed using the narrow escape (NE) theory, which describes it as a function of the spot radii and the only parameter of the cavity, its volume, independent of the cavity shape and the particle initial position. We derive an approximate analytical solution for the mean particle lifetime that goes beyond the scope of the NE theory. In particular, our solution shows how this mean lifetime depends on the cavity shape, i.e., its length and radius, the particle initial position in the cavity, and the spot radii, which can be arbitrary. It reduces to the NE solution, as the spot radii tend to zero. To check the accuracy of our approximate result, we determine the mean lifetimes from three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations. The comparison shows excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and simulation results when the initial distance from the particle to both cavity bases exceeds the cavity radius.},

  abstract     = {Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions—for example, with various mutations or bound ligands—in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant to a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named Python ENSemble Analysis (PENSA) that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurization and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding the bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, for example, tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps us determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.},

  abstract     = {In the quest to harness the power of quantum computing, training quantum neural networks (QNNs) presents a formidable challenge. This study introduces an innovative approach, integrating the Bees Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to overcome one of the most significant hurdles—barren plateaus. Our experiments across varying qubit counts and circuit depths demonstrate the BOA’s superior performance compared to the Adam algorithm. Notably, BOA achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and greater computational efficiency. This study confirms BOA’s potential to enhance the applicability of QNNs in complex quantum computations.},
