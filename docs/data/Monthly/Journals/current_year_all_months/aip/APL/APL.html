  abstract     = {The aerodynamic stability of large-scale birds, attributed to their covert feathers, has long fascinated biologists and bio-inspired design communities. However, existing theories cannot accurately describe the biological physics of coverts. Here, we propose a theory, based on their biological constraints, by defining covert behavior in terms of two modes: Mode Attach and Mode Deform. To validate the theory and to provide a greater understanding of the physics involved, we conduct a series of wind tunnel experiments using coverts on a man-made wing. Both the biological and physical aspects of this theory are well validated. The results show that in Mode Attach, the covert wake coincides with the wing-bound vortices, whereas in Mode Deform, it detaches from the wing wake vortices. The root constraint level affects the process of transitioning from Mode Attach to Mode Deform. Coverts positioned closer to the wing's leading edge result in smaller coherent turbulence structure scales exhibited in the wake region and higher shedding stability of the wake vortices. Furthermore, compared to those in the clean wing case, the nonlinear vortex packets attached to the wing's suction surface are modulated into self-sustaining attached vortices at multiple scales. Additional anechoic tunnel tests also demonstrated that this theory and definition provide a platform for studying both the aerodynamics and the aeroacoustics of coverts.},

In this Letter, we report the discharge similarities in steady-state CF 4 rf plasmas via fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. The results show that the rf discharges of different dimensional scales obey the similarity law in both the striation mode and drift-ambipolar mode when the similarity conditions are fulfilled with the scaling factor k being relatively small (e.g., k ⩽ 2 ⁠ ). As the scaling factor k increases, violations caused by “nonlinear collisions” become important, and deviations from the similarity are observed. The nondimensional parameters, η ω and η n ⁠ , for characterizing the formation of the striation mode are evaluated for understanding the mode transitions under similar discharge conditions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, I-V-VI 2 compounds have attracted significant scholarly attention due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. However, almost no n -type counterpart with a similar rock salt structure has been identified within the I-V-VI 2 family. It is worth noting that AgBiSe 2 synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state method stands out as one of the rare n -type semiconductors. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of AgBiSe 2 was significantly improved by partial substitution of Ag + upon Mn 3+ ions. Electrical conductivity ( σ ) of Ag 1− x Mn x BiSe 2 ( x = 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.045, 0.06) compounds increases from ∼39 S cm −1 ( x = 0, at 727 K) to ∼166 S cm −1 ( x = 0.06, at 733 K), while the total thermal conductivity ( κ t ) reduces from ∼0.44 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0 at 727 K to respective ∼0.38 and ∼0.36 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0.03 and 0.015, at 733 K. Accordingly, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT ( ZT max ) value of ∼0.80 is achieved at 733 K for both x = 0.03 and 0.015 samples, representing a substantial improvement by 74% in comparison with the pristine AgBiSe 2 ( ∼ 0.46 at 727 K). These results demonstrate that the Mn 3+ ion doping should be a very promising strategy in designing medium-temperature n -type thermoelectric materials.},

In this work, an interfacial synergy strategy was proposed to overcome this limitation by integrating micro- and nanostructured interfaces between polyimide (PI) and polyamide (PA) materials. Through systematic investigation, the combination of electrospun PI nanofiber membranes with microstructured PA fabrics maximizes the effective contact area and charge-transfer pathways. The results showed that the PI nanofiber/PA fabric pairing yields an open-circuit voltage of 76 V and a short-circuit current of 5.9 µA under a 20 N load at 3 Hz. The optimized device powered 56 light-emitting diodes and charged commercial capacitors with high efficiency. Additionally, an intelligent security system based on TENG technology was developed, underscoring its versatility for self-powered electronics and energy storage. This work elucidates the pivotal role of coordinated micro-/nanostructural matching in enhancing triboelectric output and provides a generalizable approach for advancing TENG performance in sustainable energy, flexible electronics, and smart device applications.},

It is observed that the salt treatment could raise the power conversion efficiency of the devices, and CsI treatment comes out with the fastest rising rate. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies observe that CsI treatment triggers secondary growth of PVSK, as well as the doping behavior at the A site of PVSK. Transient photovoltaic/photocurrent decay curve recording and Mott–Schottky study on the devices show that CsI treatment comes out with the longest lifetime of charge carriers, the shortest charge-extraction time, and the highest built-in potential. Accordingly, CsI blending upgrades the power conversion efficiency from 17.22% to 19.16% (on average, optimized to 19.89%), leading to an increment of 11%, compared to that of 7%,1% and 2% for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. Moisture stability is estimated. CsI blending comes out with a T 80 lifetime (time for efficiency dropping to 80% of the initial value) of ∼209 h, compared to that of ∼180h, ∼67h, and ∼90h for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. The observation is ascribed to the improved crystallization, and molar Gibbs free energy of hydration (Δ hyd G * ) for these alkaline-metal ions. Cs + owns the lowest Δ hyd G * , thus enhancing the hydrophobicity of the CE. Besides, Li + owns the highest Δ hyd G * , thus triggering the “slow-release effect” on H 2 O molecules from open air.},

It is observed that power conversion occurs only after 20 min of annealing, though severe hysteresis is seen due to the existence of an intermediate phase. Meanwhile, the heterojunction structure evolves obviously in the device, from that formed between the electron transport layer (ETL) and PVSK precursor, to that formed between ETL and PVSK crystallites. As annealing time increases to 120 min, the intermediate phase is reduced, and the buried interface of PVSK is strengthened, leading to accelerated charge-extraction and retarded charge-recombination, as well as an upgraded built-in potential ( V bi ). Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) improves from 10.47% to 12.42%, with the hysteresis index sharply dropping from 19.19% to 1.06%. Increasing the carbon-electrode thickness and prolonging the annealing time could further improve the crystallization quality of PVSK, thus elevating the PCE up to 15.26%, as well as the T80 lifetime of ∼390 h for unsealed devices, during the quasi-maximum power point tracking test in open air.},

Finally, we built an artificial neural network to recognize handwritten digits in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, achieving 93.9% recognition accuracy.

In this work, we develop a multi-physical field microscopic imaging system, which is capable of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution characterization in an individual GaN Micro LED. By integrating fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and time-correlated single-photon counting, our system enables real-time tracking of the evolution of defects under coupled optical, electrical, and thermal fields. Equipped with this system, we systematically analyze the spatial distribution and depth of defects introduced by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Two distinct regions are observed: a narrow fluorescence lifetime decrease zone (∼2 μ m) near the chip edges and a broader fluorescence intensity decrease zone (∼5 μ m). To explain this, we propose a physical model that describes the interplay between defect-induced non-radiative recombination and carrier diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wet etching effectively mitigates these ICP-induced damages, leading to enhanced brightness across a wide range of Micro LED sizes. Notably, this passivation process enables a 3 μ m size blue Micro LED chip to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.6% with a current density of 33.7 A/cm 2 . These findings provide insights into the localized impact of plasma etching and highlight the potential of wet etching for enhanced performance in Micro LED.},

In this study, we propose a direct encapsulation of inorganic clusters into highly aligned CNT microfibers and demonstrate the modulation of the electrical conductivity ( σ ) and thermal conductivity ( κ ) through the incorporation of Mo 4 S 4 nanoclusters. Commercially available CNT microfibers were used as the host material, and the encapsulation was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As a result, both κ and σ were reduced by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to pristine microfibers at room temperature. This modulation contributes to an improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit. The methodology indicates the potential of nanomaterial encapsulation for tuning the thermal transport properties of CNT-based bulk materials, offering a promising strategy for advanced thermal engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {We propose a metasurface design filled with porous medium inside Helmholtz resonators, which can project multiple predesigned images at different frequencies. It is easier to fabricate and more practical than the conventional multiplexed acoustic holographic metasurface of collateral Helmholtz resonators. Moreover, the amplitude and phase of the reflected acoustic wave it modulates have decoupled characteristics, which means there is no need to search for amplitude-phase space by algorithms. We theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the meta-unit can achieve arbitrary amplitude-phase combinations at four frequencies. Then, the fourfold acoustic holographic images are numerically generated by one metasurface at 1180, 1490, 2340, and 3480 Hz, respectively. These proposed strategies significantly increase the degree of freedom of the classical metasurfaces, which may open up additional avenues for multifunctional compact acoustic devices.},

Bi, Ta, and Kr ions with linear energy transfer (LET) values of 99.7, 75, and 37 MeV/(mg·cm 2 ), respectively, were used in the experiments. The results show that the SEB threshold voltage decreases with increasing LET, indicating a strong dependence on energy deposition. In addition, reverse bias is identified as a critical triggering condition for SEB, which occurs only when the applied voltage is high enough to initiate thermal runaway and cause irreversible damage. To further elucidate the failure mechanism, Kr ions were selected for detailed investigation. technology computer-aided design simulations combined with scanning electron microscopy-based failure analysis revealed that transient current surges can rapidly elevate the local temperature. Once the temperature reaches the melting point of Ga 2 O 3 material, SEB is triggered by irreversible thermal failure. Moreover, the failure sites were primarily located at the edge of the Schottky junction, indicating structural vulnerability in this region. These findings clarify the LET and reverse bias dependence of SEB in ultra-wide bandgap devices and provide insights into radiation-hardened design.},

This challenge becomes even more critical in cryogenic environments, such as superconducting quantum computing and space exploration applications, where ultralow quiescent power consumption is essential for maintaining reliable circuit operation at extremely low temperatures. Using the unique low-temperature electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials, we fabricated a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that exhibits significantly reduced currents under cryogenic conditions. These carbon-based FETs were implemented to construct a carbon nanotube analog operating amplifier (CNT-OPA). Comprehensive experimental characterization across a wide temperature range (293–10 K) revealed that the CNT-OPA's quiescent power consumption decreases at cryogenic temperatures without any degradation in the gain performance. These results demonstrate the strong potential of carbon-based analog amplifiers for cryogenic electronic applications, particularly in superconducting quantum computing systems and space electronics where conventional silicon-based devices face fundamental limitations.},

By systematically varying the strain conditions, we study how different strain configurations influence the electronic and interfacial properties of this two-dimensional (2D) material-based system. Under tensile strain, the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the Au/MoS 2 interface decreases and the interfacial binding energy increases, leading to a reduced van der Waals gap and enhanced electron tunneling probability. In contrast, compressive strain has the opposite effect, i.e., compressive strain increases the SBH and weakens the interface interaction. The SBH reduction under tensile strain gives rise to enhanced electron transfer from Au to MoS 2 , resulting in charge redistribution that effectively dopes MoS 2 with electrons and shifts its Fermi level closer to the conduction band minimum. The tunability of SBH and tunneling barriers via strain highlights a viable strategy for optimizing metal–2D semiconductor contacts in nanoelectronics applications.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics devices. However, the intrinsically low carrier mobility severely limits device performance. In this work, we have systematically investigated the carrier transport in 2D hexangular InN based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport theory. The room-temperature carrier mobility is evaluated over a wide range of carrier concentration (n 2D ), with the free-carrier screening effect incorporated via the 2D homogeneous electron gas model. The high intrinsic electron mobility of InN is verified. At low n 2D , the electron mobility remains nearly a constant of 790 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , whereas a peak value of 1150 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is observed at high n 2D . Our mode-by-mode analysis of the scattering events demonstrates that the long-range electron–phonon couplings govern the electron transport. The high electron mobility is attributed to the exceptionally small effective masses in combination with the significant suppression of LO-phonon scattering. Furthermore, we show that applying biaxial tensile strain can significantly enhance the electron transport. At low n 2D = 1 × 10 10 cm −2 , 3% tensile strain makes the mobility increase by 186%. The further analysis has demonstrated that the mobility enhancement results from the increased band velocity and the reduced scattering rates. Our work not only sheds light on the carrier transport in 2D InN but also underscores its great promise for high-performance electronic devices. Moreover, the provided estimation of the gauge factor highlights the potential for strain-sensing applications.},

Moreover, comparing thin films obtained through different techniques is not straightforward. Particularly, analyzing grain size across samples is challenging, making it difficult to clearly correlate growth conditions with the resulting crystal structure. In this Letter, we developed an approach based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology measurements to analyze nanograins in large-area thin films obtained through relevant growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and sputter deposition followed by pulsed laser annealing. To address the challenges in comparing thin films grown by different methods, we propose a robust approach based on statistical grain analysis. By combining well-established investigation tools, such as AFM, with advanced watershed-segmentation algorithms, we demonstrate a reliable method for identifying grains and grain boundaries. This approach allows for a robust and quantitative comparison of film morphology across different growth conditions, providing a crucial benchmark for evaluating and differentiating various growth methods.},

Although carrier doping is the most straightforward way for achieving metallization, and it can be realized by interlayer charge transfer in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure constructed with another two-dimensional material, current attempts such as graphene/ h- BN and α -In 2 Se 3 /h-BN vdW heterostructures fail in the h- BN metallization. In this work, a vdW heterostructure of graphene/ α -In 2 Se 3 / h − BN is proposed. Interestingly, with the negative (positive) charge side of α -In 2 Se 3 interfacing with h -BN (graphene), the polarization field of α -In 2 Se 3 pushes the valence band of h -BN to higher energy and the Dirac point of graphene to lower energy so that charge transfer mediated by α -In 2 Se 3 from h -BN to graphene becomes possible, driving h -BN to be metallic. In contrast, with the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization of α -In 2 Se 3 , no charge transfer from or to h -BN is allowed, and h -BN recovers its insulating feature. The nonvolatile resistance switching of h -BN by the graphene/In 2 Se 3 / h -BN vdW heterostructure will promote its practical applications, such as memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving both high electrocaloric effect and broad working temperature span in ferroelectric materials is crucial for practical cooling applications, yet it remains a big challenge. In the present work, a large electrocaloric temperature change ( ΔT ) over a wide temperature range is obtained through disorder modulation of perovskite titanates, specifically by introducing an electric field-sensitive Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT) into Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO 3 (BST). Ceramic samples in the BST-100xBNT (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.28) solid solution system show typical characteristics of relaxor ferroelectrics with a high density of polar nano-regions due to short-range ordering of A-site cations. As the concentration of BNT (x) increases, the freezing temperature ( T f ) decreases and the Burns temperature ( T B ) increases, suggesting the extension of the temperature range of the relaxor in the ergodic state. Moreover, the field-induced polarization was found to increase along with x. The observed structurally induced changes in the relaxor behavior are proposed to contribute to the optimal electrocaloric performance of the BST-28BNT ceramic, with a maximum ΔT of 0.91 °C and a maximum working temperature span of 24.4 °C under an applied electric field of 5 kV/mm. The concept of the A-site disorder modulation provides an innovative strategy to develop high-performance electrocaloric materials from lead-free relaxor ceramics.},

While 6 and 8 nm films achieve optimal ferroelectric properties ( ⁠ 2 P r up to 41 μ C / cm 2 ⁠ ) and good endurance, they suffer from accelerated retention loss, suggesting that prominent (002) texture may enhance charge injection and time-dependent imprint.

We attribute this to its significantly lower remanent polarization, which likely stems from a distinct nanocrystalline/amorphous microstructure, suppressing imprint development. Through quantitative imprint analysis, we establish that wake-up cycling simultaneously improves polarization while degrading retention—a fundamental constraint arising from the coupling between spontaneous polarization and charge injection dynamics.

However, solid-phase synthesis often yields secondary silicide phases that degrade performance. Here, we investigate the influence of substrate properties using two silicon-on-insulator architectures: one with a polycrystalline HfO 2 buried layer (group A) and the other with amorphous SiO 2 (group B). Both systems exhibit superconductivity consistent with V 3 Si formation, yet structural analysis reveals mixed-phase films in both cases. Crucially, only group A maintains an atomically sharp and chemically stable interface, a prerequisite for phase purity. Prolonged annealing in group A reduces the unwanted V 5 Si 3 phase but also leads to the emergence of Si-rich VSi 2 , likely due to localized substrate degradation. Preliminary atomic-resolution imaging suggests that HfO 2 crystallinity may promote local phase-selective nucleation.

  abstract     = {Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with two antiferromagnetic coupled edges possess PT (combined spatial inversion and time reversal) symmetry and spin double degenerate electronic structures. By breaking PT symmetry via the structure design, we are able to generate spatial spin density in twisted bilayer ZGNRs (TBZGNRs) with different stacking configurations and twisted angles, forming a class of quasi-one dimensional carbon nanoribbon antiferromagnets. We investigate the spin transport in TBZGNRs by employing the non-equilibrium Green's functions method and reveal that the electric current is nonreciprocal and spin-polarized in non- PT symmetric TBZGNRs. Moreover, in PT symmetric TBZGNRs, the spin degenerate can be lifted by applying bias voltage. It shows unique nonreciprocal spin transport with opposite spin-polarization under positive and negative bias voltages. Our results indicate that TBZGNRs should be useful carbon-based materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic order and spin-polarized transport. Thus, this work provides a strategy to achieve spin transport in graphene nanoribbons and carbon-based spintronics via the structural design.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets are two kinds of classic magnetic materials and are particularly important for modern magnonic and spintronic devices because of their steadily coupled antiferromagnetic sublattices, which result in chirality-dependent magnons, efficient charge-spin conversion, altermagnetism, and great scalability for high-density integration. However, here, we report the observation of asynchrony among sublattices by using typical CoGd ferrimagnets, where the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices fail to remain synchronized during high-speed precession. By employing magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that the asynchrony occurs when the resonance frequency exceeds a critical value corresponding to the delay time ( τ d ) between the two sublattices under microwave excitations. The determined τ d is about 60 ps in CoGd, varies slightly with temperature and composition, but decreases sharply near magnetization and angular momentum compensation. These results demonstrate the speed limit of device performance relying on the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices as a matter of fundamental principle, and also indicate that the antiferromagnetic attributes during high-speed operations cannot be described as statically coupled sublattices.},

The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector-pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating-pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data.

In this work, an unclosed evolution protocol is proposed, which consists of parallel coupling and buffering branches and evolves through five distinct stages. Buffering the variation of Hamiltonian, inducing the transition to a low energy state, the evolution with favorable adiabaticity guarantees the EP encircling no longer depends on the precise loss manipulation. A non-Hermitian acoustic waveguide coupler (AWC), which is composed of combined cavities and air slit arrays, is presented to realize the encirclement. Experimental results of chiral phase conversion in a 0.5 m long AWC, spanning a broad bandwidth from 9.5 to 17.5 kHz, confirm the simplicity and effectiveness of state evolution encircling the EP.

Following rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550 °C for 30 s, all dielectrics are confirmed to exhibit the orthorhombic (111) phase by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Electrical measurements reveal that the SL5 structure achieves an outstanding reduction in leakage current, decreasing from 0.936 A cm −2 (HZO) to 0.004 A cm −2 at 3 V, and exhibits the highest remanent polarization (2P r = 29.3 μ C cm −2 ), compared to 27.3 μ C cm −2 (HZO), 22.4 μ C cm −2 (SL10), and 17 μ C cm −2 (SL15). Moreover, the SL5 capacitor demonstrates excellent reliability, maintaining robust endurance up to 1 × 10 11 cycles at room temperature and 1 × 10 10 cycles at 150 °C without degradation and stable retention over 1 × 10 4 s. Importantly, interface state analysis reveals that after annealing, SL5 maintains the lowest and most stable interface trap density within the energy range of 0.25–0.45 eV. The trap state density (6.39 × 10 12 –7.11 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 ) is significantly lower than that of HZO in the same energy range.

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap beta-phase gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) power devices hold great promise in space applications; however, their intrinsic vulnerability to heavy ion irradiation, particularly defect behavior and catastrophic burnout mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. By performing bias voltage-dependent multiple rounds of statistical experiments with 1.35 GeV high-energy Ta ion irradiation, this work identifies electron and hole traps before burnout in NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs), among which the introduced hole trap H2 ( E V + 0.6 eV, 2.9 × 10 13 cm −3 ) is revealed to dominate the irrecoverable leakage degradation associated with device damage by deteriorating the junction barrier. This trap in Ga 2 O 3 is attributed to the electron energy loss along the ion incidence trajectory based on the “thermal spike” physics theory, possibly resulting in a localized amorphous latent track. Beyond device damage, the catastrophic burnout in irradiated HJD is identified in two distinct regions: Region I (p-NiO/n − -Ga 2 O 3 ) dominated by trap-assisted electric field breakdown, and Region II (n − -Ga 2 O 3 /n + -Ga 2 O 3 ) characterized by thermally driven damage from charge accumulation. Additionally, thermal effects also impact the active area of Region I along the carrier dissipation pathway. These findings provide insight into the damage and failure physics of β -Ga 2 O 3 devices under heavy-ion strikes and inform strategies for improved irradiation hardness.},

Remarkably, the grown NWs, even with sub-micron active volumes, could generate short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltage of several mA/cm 2 and several hundreds of mV, respectively, under white light illumination.

  abstract     = {Multiferroic (MFE) systems with rich tunability encompassing multiple degrees of freedom like spin and dipole are competitive candidates for nonvolatile memory applications. The development of two-dimensional (2D) MFE configurations could further enhance this technology, facilitating the advancement of next-generation microcontroller units. However, most reported 2D multiferroics rely on spatially separated ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers, which introduce interfacial complexities and limit device scalability. Here, we design a van der Waals multiferroic tunneling junction using antiferromagnetic VSe 2 as a unified magnetic and ferroelectric layer, with 2D metallic TaS 2 and Au (intercalated by monolayer graphene, Gr) serving as the right and left electrodes, respectively. Through ab initio quantum transport simulations, we systematically investigate its electronic transport properties. Our results reveal that the device exhibits four switchable ferroelectric conductance states, which can be modulated via interlayer sliding. When the magnetization alignment of trilayer VSe 2 is additionally controlled, the number of distinguishable conductance states increases to 12. The conductance difference is quantified by tunneling magnetoresistance and tunneling electroresistance, which can maximally increase to 8000% and 4000%, respectively, under optimized bias voltages. Our research expands the application of 2D antiferromagnetic materials and provides a viable strategy for designing high-performance, multi-state memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen passivation has been established as an effective method to decrease the interface state density (D it ) for silicon carbide (SiC) devices. However, the effect of nitrogen passivation on the carrier capture cross section distributions of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects is still unclear, which is another critical factor governing the interface recombination characteristics and device performances of SiC power devices. In this work, the local band bending is regulated in deep level transient spectroscopy characterizations to modulate the carrier capture and emission behaviors of interface defects in localized energy levels. Therefore, the distribution of carrier capture cross section is determined as a function of the interface state density. Surprisingly, it is found that nitrogen passivation leads to an increase in the capture cross sections of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects, especially for deeper interface states within the bandgap. Based on those findings, the mechanisms of the temperature dependence of leakage current characteristics are explored, where the leakage currents first decrease with rising temperature, reaching a minimum at 250 K, and subsequently increase further with elevated temperature. An interfacial defect-assisted Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism is proposed to explain the temperature dependence of leakage currents, which is suggested to originate from the synergistic interplay between the energy-level dependent capture cross section and interface state densities.},

While in the classical physical paradigm, the causal relationships are deduced based on physical principles or via experiment, the rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of material structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here, we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By applying ChatGPT to domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining the obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for directed acyclic graphs that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO 3 . This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.},

Metal thiophosphates (MTPs), with their layered structures and tunable electronic properties, are of particular interest. However, the link between crystal symmetry, stacking order, and anisotropic optical behavior remains inadequately understood in MTPs. Herein, we synthesized high-quality, large-sized monoclinic phase of SnP 2 S 6 single crystals via the chemical vapor transport method. Structural analysis revealed that the monoclinic phase is featured by a unique bilayer stacking configuration with a 180° in-plane rotation of adjacent metal sites. This stacking arrangement disrupts the threefold rotational symmetry of the monolayer, resulting in in-plane structural anisotropy as revealed by polarized Raman spectroscopy and consequently optical birefringence. To showcase its application potential, photodetectors based on monoclinic SnP 2 S 6 were fabricated, exhibiting exceptional polarization-sensitive performance under 405 nm excitation. This work highlights the importance of interlayer stacking patterns on the structural and optical properties of van der Waals MTPs, delivering a unique strategy for property tailoring.},

By tuning linewidth, gap, and electrode layout, discrete LIG elements can be activated individually or along predefined paths, delivering millimeter-scale, site-specific heating without mechanical reconfiguration. A 4 × 4 matrix heater offers programmable thermal pixels: switching two bias lines directs current, and consequently heat, along the shortest-resistance path, producing local temperatures from 25 to 150 °C. Representative tracks reach 165 °C at 5 V, while a 2 V bias yields an increase in ≥ 40 °C. Because the temperature field is primarily governed by the geometry of the conductive tracks, not the overall heater size, the same fabrication step can yield regions with different thermal outputs by adjusting local pattern dimensions such as linewidth and length. This ability to spatially program heating behavior within a thin, flexible film, where heat distribution can be reconfigured simply by changing the biasing direction, highlights its potential for applications in reconfigurable soft robotics, on-skin thermal therapy, and adaptive microfluidic control.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying energy dissipation in dissipative periodic discrete metamaterials remains a challenge, as traditional interpretations of metadamping, based on summing modal damping ratios, do not consistently reflect actual time-domain energy loss in multi-modal systems. The study addresses this critical gap by introducing a framework grounded in a consistent definition of the unit cell for discrete dissipative systems. A single-term exponential energy decay coefficient, obtained through least squares minimization of the transient response, is proposed as a robust descriptor of system-level dissipation. The coefficient approximately captures energy decay behavior in both phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, offering a more physically meaningful measure than conventional damping metrics. The proposed meta-dissipation framework establishes a critical link between dispersion-based analysis and transient energy dissipation, enabling more effective design and optimization of metamaterials for vibration attenuation across a wide range of engineering applications.},

Balancing the advantages of high capillary force of the V-shape and low viscous resistance of the U-shape, long-distance wicking velocity of gradient designs efficiently improved over 40% than conventional V-shape designs. Leveraging the enhanced mechanism, segmental structures with maximized long-distance wicking velocity were further developed, reaching a 100% enhancement.

By decomposing the Bessel vortex wave into a spectrum of plane wave components, we independently compute the PO and EEC scattering contributions for each spectral element. The coherent superposition of these contributions yields the total scattered field, significantly improving modeling accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate a 20%–30% enhancement in radar cross section prediction accuracy over the standard PO method.

  abstract     = {The p -type Cu 2 SnS 3 compounds have been experimentally identified as a promising thermoelectric material. Here, we demonstrate the p-type nature of mohite Cu 2 SnS 3 using experimental techniques as well as density functional theory calculations. The experimental results have shown that Ga substitution at the Sn site remarkably enhances the hole concentration and electrical conductivity, reduces the bandgap, and decreases the thermal conductivity, resulting in increased figure of merit. First principle calculations have indicated that Ga substitution changes the electronic structure of Cu 2 SnS 3 , primarily due to the reduction in lattice volume and interatomic bond distances. Notably, the appearance of DOS states near the Fermi level has been significantly increased, driven by enhanced hybridization among Cu 3d, Ga 4p, Sn 5p, and S 3p orbitals, which has led to increased electrical conductivity of Cu 2 Sn 0.80 Ga 0.20 S 3 to 79 S/cm. Moreover, the substitution of Ga in Cu 2 SnS 3 modifies the electronic structure of Cu 2 SnS 3 substantially, especially the density of states near fermi level is increased, which leads to high carrier concentration of 9.38 × 10 20 cm −3 , power factor of 329 μ W/mK 2 , and lattice thermal conductivity of 0.50 W/mK, thus high zT of 0.4 is realized in Cu 2 Sn 0.70 Ga 0.20 S 3 .},

However, the enormous diversity of material structures and the substantial costs associated with experimental validation have hindered the exploration of MXenes' potential. In this work, we obtained property data for 213 different MXene structures through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and subsequently developed an atomic descriptor suitable for MXenes. Building upon this foundation, we established two machine learning (ML) prediction models, used the predicted data to perform high-throughput screening of numerous MXene structures, and finally conducted theoretical validation using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) method and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of the two optimal prediction models reached 95% and 93%, respectively. Through high-throughput screening, 21 photocatalyst candidates were identified from 23 857 MXene structures, among which YTaC(OCl)(NCS) and Y 2 CFH exhibit high optical absorption coefficients (>1 × 10 5 cm −1 ), solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies (>14%), and thermodynamic stability.

In particular, eco-friendly flexible supercapacitors (Eco-FSCs) are essential for advancing technologies within the Technology with Sustainability (TWS) framework. In this work, a one-step, binder-free, direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering technique was employed for the reactive fabrication of vertically aligned vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) nanorods at room temperature (RT) over a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) substrate. The symmetric two-electrode mode electrochemical characterization in 1M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte revealed a specific capacitance of 160 F/g, a power density of 2 kW/kg, and an energy density of 3.6 Wh/kg. It demonstrated 100% capacitance retention for 2000 charging-discharging cycles, excellent mechanical flexibility, and rapid disposability. For the real-time application, four devices connected in series powered the different colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for over 60 s. Therefore, this work presents a facile strategy for fabricating eco-friendly FSCs with superior storage performance. The fabricated materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).},

  abstract     = {Sodium-ion layered transition metal oxides (Na x [TM 1 , TM 2 ]O 2 , where TM denotes transition metals) serve as potential cathodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity and operating voltage. Nonetheless, the ordering of Na + /vacancy and the cationic arrangement of TM 1 /TM 2 adversely affect their structural stability and Na + diffusion kinetics. Herein, an F − doping method on a typical P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 (NNMO) layered oxide is presented to disrupt the above-mentioned ordering. First, the redox center is altered by the introduction of F − , resulting in the reduction of Mn 4+ and the redistribution of Ni/Mn ions. The TM 1 /TM 2 cationic ordering and Na + /vacancy ordering are disrupted, hence improving ion transport efficiency. Second, as the amount of F − introduced rises, the interlayer gap of the alkali metal layer is extended, which is helpful for the insertion and extraction of Na + . Third, the associated strong TM–F bonds could considerably boost the stability of the NNMO. Hence, the optimized sample P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 1.73 F 0.07 gives an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 85% after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C and 2.0–4.0 V.

This approach integrates in situ -grown MIL-53(Fe) nanosheets with sulfur-modified ZIF-L (S-ZIF-L), synergistically enhancing interfacial charge transfer dynamics while optimizing active site accessibility. The S-ZIF-L@MIL-53/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER performance in an alkaline medium, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 336 mV at 500 mA cm −2 . Remarkably, it exhibits robust stability for 300 h at 350 mA cm −2 . In situ characterization reveals the coexistence of adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen-mediated mechanisms, which collectively govern intermediate adsorption energetics and reaction kinetics. The sulfur-doping-induced morphological modulation and oxygen vacancy enrichment further contribute to enhanced electronic conductivity and catalytic activity.

In this study, we present an innovative growth strategy utilizing an FTO substrate as an in situ Sn source, enabling controlled synthesis of large-area (4 cm × 4 cm) SnSe 2 nanosheet arrays. One-dimensional (1D) Te/two-dimensional (2D) SnSe 2 vertical mixed-dimensional heterostructures were further fabricated. The Te/SnSe 2 vertical heterostructures demonstrate significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction performance compared to individual Te and SnSe 2 nanostructures, achieving an overpotential of 0.73 V at 10 mA/cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 110.05 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The first-principles calculation results reveal that interfacial charge redistribution at the heterojunction substantially lowers the water dissociation energy barrier while optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy. This growth strategy establishes a viable pathway for fabricating large-area 1D/2D vertical heterojunctions, and the combined experimental and theoretical findings advance our fundamental understanding of their hydrogen evolution reaction mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Reliability of β -Ga 2 O 3 based trench Schottky barrier diodes with a breakdown voltage of 4 kV and a Baliga's figure of merit of ∼1 GW/cm 2 is reported. The devices were stressed with reverse voltages up to 3 kV in increasing steps of 250 V, followed by an evaluation of the on-state characteristics after each step-stress. The step-stress testing revealed an increase in on-state resistance of <3% when stressed up to 2.25 kV but degrades to 13% when stressed at 3 kV, recovering fully after 3 h rest time. The degradation in on-state characteristics (current collapse) under high reverse bias stress is attributed to the negative charge trapping near the bottom corner of the fins, which reduces the net conductive area of the fins. The current degradation could be replicated through drift-diffusion simulations, with trapped charge density of ∼3 × 10 12 cm −2 required to match 13% degradation observed experimentally. This work highlights the critical influence of dielectric properties and charge trapping on the reliability and performance of ultra-wide bandgap materials like Ga 2 O 3 .},

Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi 2 X 4 could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.},

We report both linear and nonlinear current–voltage characteristics over a temperature range of 5–300 K. The thermal evolution of the nonlinear characteristics exhibits power-law scaling and collapses onto a single universal curve when scaled by temperature.

  abstract     = {To elucidate the origin of ferroelectric properties and underlying mechanisms in experimentally discovered two-dimensional (2D) vermiculite, we performed first-principles calculations on structures with varying Al 3+ doping concentrations in the Mg–O octahedra. Our results reveal that intrinsic ferroelectricity stems from Al 3+ induced proton symmetry breaking. Ferroelectricity emerges with doping along the x -direction, while doping along the y -direction produces antiferroelectricity. This direction dependence arises because the ferroelectric phase along y experiences stronger short-range ionic repulsion, forcing adjacent dipoles into antiparallel alignment to minimize close ionic contacts. Furthermore, the 2D vermiculite exhibits both in-plane and out-of-plane polarization, with components of 1.47, 1.37, and 0.63 e Å/proton and 0.18, 0.17, and 0.12 e Å/proton, respectively. The formation of a local dioctahedral configuration effectively reduces the ferroelectric switching barrier. Additionally, we designed 1D and 3D-P vermiculite structures to preserve semiconductor properties while mitigating the depolarization effect inherent in the antiferroelectric configuration. Compared to traditional perovskite materials, vermiculite demonstrates superior ferroelectricity and greater robustness during switching. These attributes position 2D vermiculite as a promising candidate for developing low-cost, high-performance room-temperature ferroelectric materials.},

Under biaxial strain and a -axis uniaxial strain, the system undergoes a phase transition from the original G-type antiferromagnetic to C-type antiferromagnetic order due to a significant reduction in the out-of-plane bond angles. Simultaneously, marked changes also occur in both the spectral weight distribution of low-energy spin wave modes and the in-plane longitudinal thermal conductivity.

Currently, three mechanisms of magnetization switching have been identified through theoretical and experimental studies: domain wall motion, coherent rotation, and magnetization curling. Here, we report a different mechanism of magnetization switching characterized by uniform and continuous transformation of a single ferromagnetic microdomain into alternating nanodomains of two magnetization vectors with different directions. Such a “magnetization spinodal” mechanism occurs at the ferromagnetic morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of the Tb 1− x Dy x Fe 2 system when the magnetization vector of the microdomain is located within the region on the free energy curve with respect to the magnetization direction where the second derivative becomes negative, which is similar to the compositional spinodal mechanism in diffusional phase transformations. Further calculations show that magnetization spinodal mechanism enables easier magnetization rotation as compared to coherent magnetization rotation and contributes to large magnetostriction at MPB. This finding could advance the theory of magnetization switching and phase transitions. It could also shed light on the design of ferromagnetic devices.},

A high-quality yttrium iron garnet film was structured via precise laser ablation to form an integrated resonator system incorporating magnonic-crystal sections. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy alongside micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert framework, we demonstrate that the resonator element induces Fabry–Pérot-like interference, leading to multi-mode spin-wave propagation and selective energy transfer between the magnonic-crystalline and waveguiding regions. The resonator enables selective excitation of transverse modes, leading to distinct directional coupling regimes: at specific frequencies, spin waves propagate preferentially into either the MC or waveguide sections. Simulations reveal mode interference and bandgap effects, aligning with experimental observations. Resonant modes within the system enable distinct coupling regimes: at specific frequencies, spin waves are directionally routed into either the waveguide or MC section, governed by transverse mode formation and Bragg scattering effects. In this case, the modes of directional coupling of the spin waves are associated with the intersection of the dispersion characteristics of the forward and backward waves for the first and third modes. These findings highlight the potential of resonator-coupled magnonic systems for reconfigurable signal processing, enabling applications such as frequency-division multiplexing, logic gates, and adaptive magnonic circuits with ultra-low-power consumption.},

Motivated by the recent synthesis of SGS CoFeCrAl (CFCA) with a high Curie temperature (575.2 K) and the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based on the CFCA electrode, we utilized density functional theory combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function method to investigate the magnetic anisotropy energy of the CFCA/MgO heterostructure and the spin transport properties of the CFCA/MgO/CFCA MTJ, with a comparative analysis against the experimentally fabricated CoFe/MgO/CFCA MTJ. Our findings demonstrate that the CoFe–O interface configuration is the most stable and shows a considerable interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of 0.69 mJ/m 2 , with its origin elucidated through layer- and orbital-resolved analysis. More intriguingly, the CFCA/MgO/CFCA MTJ exhibits a large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 1.3 × 10 7 %, resulting from the interfacial spin filtering. Additionally, we reveal that the TMR of CoFe/MgO/CFCA MTJ is only 1.56 × 10 3 % due to mismatched wave function distribution between the left and right electrodes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the PMA and TMR, indicating that CFCA is a promising SGS material for spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {An integrated magnonic device is a miniaturized system that manipulates magnons to perform computing, signal processing, or sensing functions. These devices leverage the wave-like nature of magnons to transmit and process information with low energy consumption. However, a major contemporary challenge lies in managing the reflections between cascaded magnonic devices during the design of two-dimensional integrated magnonic circuits. To address this issue, a magnonic directional coupler with non-reciprocal behavior has been developed using interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (iDMI). This design has been validated through micromagnetic simulations. The iDMI induces an asymmetric dispersion curve in the coupled waveguide, resulting in non-reciprocal coupling strength in the spin waves transmitted in the positive and negative directions. The non-reciprocal directional coupler effectively suppresses reflections along the original propagation path, functioning similarly to a circulator to isolate connected magnonic devices. This advancement represents a significant step forward in the development of robust and scalable spin-wave computing systems.},

The magnetic damping of the epitaxial FeV film is revealed to be anisotropic in the FeV/Al bilayer without any spin sink, which is confirmed by the spin-pumping effect in the FeV/Pt bilayers with spin sink. The spin transport between the FeV layer with anisotropic magnetic damping and the Pt layer is anisotropic, which demonstrates by the measurement of the anisotropic SOT efficiency. The anisotropic magnetic damping and SOT can be attributed to the variation of the spin–orbit coupling in different crystallographic directions of the FeV film. These results provide insights and effective pathways for constructing anisotropic charge-to-spin conversion systems based on ferromagnetic materials with anisotropic magnetic damping.},

Here, the spin mixing conductance serves as a pivotal parameter to quantify spin transport efficiency at ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic interfaces. To date, most studies have focused on optimizing the efficiency of spin current generation, while the modulation of interfacial spin transparency remains underexplored. In this work, we fabricate freestanding MoS 2 /NiFe heterostructures with intrinsically high spin mixing conductance surpassing conventional ferromagnetic systems by two orders of magnitude. Owing to the high tunability of the band structure in MoS 2 with strain and charge doping, a 135% enhancement in the spin mixing conductance of MoS 2 /NiFe heterostructures has been achieved using PMN-PT ferroelectric single-crystal substrates. Our findings demonstrate a model for dynamically tuning spin transport at 2D/ferromagnetic interfaces and further provide foundational insight into the design of flexible, freestanding spintronic devices with ultralow power consumption and field-tunable functionality.},

However, the validity of this correlation remains an open-ended question, especially in the context of inelastic scattering at room temperature. To address this gap in knowledge, we perform independent measurements of the in-plane thermal and electrical conductivities across four AlCu (0.5% Cu) films [thickness ( ⁠ h ⁠ ) ≈ 174, 98, 53, and 24 nm] using optical pump–probe metrologies and four-point probe techniques, respectively. For in-plane thermal conductivity measurements, we utilize time-domain thermoreflectance, in both concentric and beam-offset configurations, and the time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect. Our results show that the WF law overpredicts the thermal conductivity by at least ∼10% in all films, thus demonstrating modest deviations in predicted thermal conductivity when applying the WF law to dilute AlCu films. Using infrared variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, we demonstrate increased electron scattering rates in the thinnest film ( ⁠ h ≈ 24 nm), indicating electron-boundary scattering drives the reduction in in-plane thermal conductivity. This is generally an elastic scattering process, which is supported by our thermal conductivity measurements and analysis.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimension (2D) Janus materials with asymmetric atomic structure have been found to have unique intrinsic vertical polarization properties, where an electron is more likely to deviate from the neutral center and make a greater contribution to the dipole moment. Here, based on the calculation of the piezoelectric properties of ten types of 2D Janus materials, we identify the sole material Y 2 Se 2 IF, where the contribution of internal-strain piezoelectricity plays a dominant role. We further conduct a lattice dynamics analysis of its piezoelectric properties and find that the A1(6) (9.313 THz) mode contributes 73% of the internal-strain piezoelectric component e 31 i ⁠ , resulting from the large mode polarity and large phonon–strain coupling. The electronic structure indicates that this significant mode contribution comes from high bond ionicity, large electronegativity differences, and the effective regulation of bond length by modal factors. We further analyze the evolution of the piezoelectric components, phonon mode contributions, atomic contributions, mode polarity, and phonon–strain coupling of the piezoelectricity of the Y 2 Se 2 IF under biaxial strain. The results show that strain leads to an enhancement of phonon–strain coupling, resulting in a significant fluctuation in the piezoelectric contribution of the A1(6) mode. These dynamic analyses of the piezoelectric properties provide a theoretical basis for the application of 2D Janus materials in the field of piezoelectrics.},

Here, we investigated the phase evolution of solid nitrogen at low temperatures (87–300 K) and high pressures (0–175 GPa) along two different thermodynamic pathways: the isothermal compression and the isobaric cooling. When we compress nitrogen above 130 GPa, below 150 K, we find an extended solid (named μ- N 2 ) that exhibits Raman vibron fluctuations, which may be related to exciton–vibron coupling or electron–vibron coupling. Three missing low-temperature and high-pressure phase transition boundaries ( ζ – κ , κ – μ , μ – η ) have been identified by using a self-designed isothermal compression Raman spectroscopy. We also find that the dissociation of nitrogen significantly alters the Clapeyron slope in the phase diagram.},

Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by three to seven times (e.g., shifting from 250–430 to 1400–2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.},

By combining the advantages of a phonon and a photon, the long-lifetime PP generated by minor Mg-alloying of ZnTe marks an improvement over the PP of pristine ZnTe, which, from the Raman cross section calculation, can only achieve a balanced compromise between the two kinds of advantages, intensity and speed. The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ≤ 0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro- and microstructure using x-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the native phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ∼ 0), considering various Mg isotopes.},

The results indicate that under reverse gate bias, the leakage mechanism consistently remains trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) both before and after irradiation. However, under forward gate bias, the dominant conduction mechanism shifts from Poole–Frenkel emission to TAT as a result of the introduction of hole traps with an energy level of E V + 0.93 eV.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient halide perovskites (HPs) is critical for advancing optoelectronic device performance. Herein, we systematically investigate the excited-state dynamics of three crystalline systems with distinct symmetries using time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. Compared to the tetragonal phase P4 mm with higher symmetry, the orthorhombic phase Fmmm significantly alters the spin polarization at the conduction band minimum, leading to the classification of two exciton types: charge-transfer excitons and Frenkel excitons. The two exciton types exhibit distinct temporal responses under photoexcitation. To ensure the generality of our findings, we employed a comprehensive set of crystalline models for MAPbI 3 , including Fmmm, Im3, Pm 3 ¯ m, Pnma, I4/mcm, P4 mm, and P4/mbm symmetries, which were optimized and subjected to ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. Incorporating spin–orbit coupling effects to approximate realistic scenarios, the NAMD simulations reveal that the electron–hole recombination in the tetragonal P4 mm phase with a narrow bandgap occurs within approximately 78.63 fs, whereas the orthorhombic Fmmm phase exhibits an extended carrier lifetime of ∼93 fs due to the spatial separation of charge density between electrons and holes. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to modulate the excited-state dynamics in metal HPs through tailored structural ordering, offering critical insights for designing high-performance perovskite materials tailored for optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {The aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) nanoarray is becoming increasingly significant as a photocathode configuration for use in electronic devices and ultraviolet sensors. Traditional photocathode design techniques rely on physical models that utilize empirical data and trial-and-error methods, making it difficult to optimize all parameters simultaneously. This research explores how machine learning (ML) can expedite the photocathode design process by creating a comprehensive database derived from a full-parameter photoemission model. This database includes various characteristic parameters (such as structural, material, and system parameters) alongside target parameters like photocurrent. We compare the effectiveness of several ML algorithms (including linear regression, random forest, support vector machine, and bi-layer/tri-layer fully connected neural network) using the data generated from the physical model. The findings indicate that ML can significantly enhance the design workflow for nanoarray photocathodes and assess the significance of each parameter. The neural network effectively maintains an error rate in performance predictions of around 4.7% while achieving a prediction speed of 13 000 observations per second. Optimal ranges for several parameters were identified, including nanowire diameter (243–347 nm), nanoarray height (278–412 nm), incident light angle (40–60°), Al component (0.3–0.5), and surface emission rate (10 3 –10 5 cm/s). These outcomes imply that combining ML with physical modeling presents a fresh perspective for the design and conceptualization of nanoarray photocathodes.},

The incorporation of two WO x interfacial layers has significantly reduced the concentration of oxygen vacancies at the interface of the HZO film, leading to an impressive decrease in leakage current density by 94.9% compared to the conventional Si/W/HZO/W capacitor. Consequently, the remnant polarization of the capacitor retains 98.9% and 96.3% of its initial value after more than 10 11 read/write cycles at voltages of 1.5 V under temperatures of 25 and 150 °C, respectively. Furthermore, during the “1/0” hold process at 150 °C, the imprint voltage is reduced by 44.4% relative to that observed in the Si/W/WO x /HZO/W capacitor.

However, the practical realization of electrically programmable excitonic functionalities remains hindered by inefficient and power-intensive exciton–trion switching. Here, we demonstrate an energy-efficient exciton–trion switching strategy through integration of monolayer WSe 2 with gold micropillar arrays. Micropillars with radii down to 1 µm induce strong localized strain in WSe 2 , significantly enhancing modulation efficiency and reducing the required gating voltage to as low as 0.6 V—approximately an order of magnitude lower than previously reported values. Periodic gating enables robust, reversible switching between neutral and trion exciton, supporting logic-like functionalities including binary encoding and signal inversion. Combined experiments and simulations reveal that this enhanced tunability arises from the synergistic interplay between strain localization and plasmonic field enhancement at the micropillar apex. These results establish an integrable, low-power approach for electrically programmable excitonic states, advancing integrated excitonic circuits based on two-dimensional semiconductors.},

LaCoO 3 is paramagnetic in bulk, while the epitaxially strained films become ferromagnetic, whereas the origin of the emergent ferromagnetic order remains controversial. Here, we report the observation of an unexpected ferromagnetic order in freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes, even though the strain has completely released in the membranes. Atomic-resolution microscopy revealed that the freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes have maintained a large Co–O–Co bond angle after releasing from the substrates, giving rise to a hidden ferromagnetic phase as supported by density-functional theory calculations. Moreover, the magnetic state of the freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes is controllable by wrinkle formation via transferring the membranes to wafers with distinct surface roughness. Our work proposes an alternative pathway for the creation of hidden phases in correlated oxides and demonstrates that strain is not a prerequisite of emergent ferromagnetism in LaCoO 3 films.},

The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction.

The Bi doping concentration is up to around 30 at. % owing to the high similarity of In 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 lattice structures. At low doping concentrations (0.2–2 at. %), the β -In 2− x Bi x Se 3 films possess improved crystallinity and present good layer-by-layer epitaxial growth.

  abstract     = {The texture of superhydrophobic surfaces can reduce solid–liquid contact time by altering the droplet impact dynamics, which is widely used in applications such as self-cleaning and anti-icing. However, the influence of the roughness of superhydrophobic surfaces on the behavior of droplet impact has not been fully elucidated, which limits the engineering applications of such surfaces. In this study, superhydrophobic surfaces with different roughnesses were prepared, and the kinetic behavior of droplets impacting these surfaces for different Weber numbers ( We ) was systematically analyzed by combining high-speed photographic experiments and hydrodynamic simulations. The results show that the droplets become more thermodynamically unstable due to the significant tensile deformation developed at the droplet retraction stage with increasing We , and secondary droplet splashing occurs due to the Plateau–Rayleigh instability. Moreover, the critical We for a droplet transitioning from complete rebound to breakage splashing decreases monotonically with increasing surface roughness. The physical mechanism of the droplet splashing phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces facilitated by surface roughness is elucidated by modeling the quantitative relationship between the air spillage velocity and the initial impact velocity of the droplets, combined with the synergistic analyses of the contact force distributions, the internal velocity field, and the pressure field distributions during the retraction phase of the droplets. This study not only deepens our understanding of the complex physical processes underlying the impact of droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces but also provides a theoretical basis for self-cleaning and anti-icing applications.},

However, the limited average power of the modulation laser poses a bottleneck for increasing the repetition rate of these coherent radiation sources. To address this challenge, improving the efficiency of laser–electron interaction is essential. In this Letter, we propose an efficient scheme to enhance the laser–electron energy coupling by employing a perfect vortex laser beam within a helical undulator. The electron beam trajectory is highly consistent with the helical wavefront of the laser field, which improves the utilization efficiency of the optical electric field. Three-dimensional time-dependent simulation results indicate that the repetition rate can be improved by over two orders of magnitude over the conventional Gaussian laser beam at the same input power. We anticipate that the proposed scheme will pave the way for the development of high repetition rate coherent radiation sources.},

  abstract     = {Negative terahertz photoconductivity is a rare effect that holds great significance for numerous applications. However, the maintenance and enhancement of negative photoconductivity response still face a huge challenge. Here, combined with material selection and band alignment engineering, we have proposed a mixed-dimensional heterostructure comprised of 1D tellurium (Te) nanowires and 2D monolayer graphene. Intriguingly, the Te/graphene heterojunction could enhance negative terahertz photoconductivity by twice compared with graphene, following a transition from negative to positive photoconductivities. We have further performed first-principles calculations and characterizations to elucidate the type-I band alignment at the heterointerface, revealing the phenomena attributed to interfacial charge transfer. Our results provide in-depth physical insights into the carrier transport mechanism, which is crucial for further exploration of optoelectronic devices based on mixed-dimensional heterostructures.},

Recent studies on dual-comb Yb-doped light sources with an all-normal dispersion mechanism have been proposed. In this work, we experimentally and numerically demonstrate a variable and switchable all-normal dispersion dual-wavelength Yb-doped fiber mode-locked laser based on a birefringent filter. In contrast to the previous dual-comb spectroscopy demonstrations directly enabled by the single-wavelength dual-comb all-normal dispersion Yb-doped laser, this work demonstrates broadband spectral coverage expansion in a dual-wavelength dual-comb laser source through an external Yb-doped fiber amplifier and photonic crystal fiber, with little additional intensity and phase noise. To evaluate mutual coherence and verify the feasibility by utilizing broadening combs, we performed proof-of-concept dual-comb spectroscopy of the transmission measurements with a homemade Sagnac filter; the results showed very good agreement with those obtained using an optical spectrum analyzer. It is of great significance to use a periodic filter in the cavity and eventually measure the transmission curve of such a periodic filter. Our work paves the way for the development of broadening all-normal-dispersion Yb-doped fiber lasers, which are well-suited for dual-comb applications.},

The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.},

A comprehensive analysis of the signal mode profile yields valuable insights into the modal characteristics of the waveguides, enabling the optimization of N-doping profiles for the optimal incorporation of V2 silicon vacancy color centers, which possess unique optical and spin properties essential for quantum sensing applications.

Furthermore, we minimize surface roughness of the coupling facets to an root mean square value of 0.2 nm, thereby reducing scattering losses and enhancing device performance while maintaining compatibility with high-volume manufacturing processes. V2 color centers are created within the waveguide through proton implantation, as evidenced by the detection of fluorescence light above 850 nm within the guided waveguide mode, highlighting the potential of our platform for highly sensitive and compact SiC-based quantum sensors.},

However, how to evaluate the effect of these passive cooling strategies on the solar cell performance was lacking, which is critical for the passive cooling design of solar cells. In this work, an electricity-thermal model was built to discuss the solar cell performance under different passive cooling conditions. Compared with the common solar cell with a glass cover, the sky radiative cooling by improving mid-infrared thermal emittance or above- λ g (effective cutoff wavelength) reflectance in the solar spectrum had a slight effect on the temperature drop or power improvement under natural convection. The core point was to ensure the near-perfect sub- λ g transmittance using anti-reflection coatings, which played the main role in the solar cell performance. A low cell temperature did not mean a high cell outpower under the selective spectral cover, and the sub- λ g transmittance could not be suppressed to improve heat dissipation performance. After introducing an evaporation cooling layer, the output power could be enhanced greatly, showing the wide adaptability to cool the solar cell with little effect on solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in sub- λ g spectra. These results could guide subsequent cooling structure design by integrating different cooling strategies to achieve a near-perfect passive cooling system.},

  abstract     = {Fe doping is widely known to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni-based electrocatalysts; however, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial, with interpretations focused on post-incorporation effects. Here, we uncover a previously overlooked pre-incorporation mechanism: Fe 3+ -mediated redox cycling in solution that directly generates high-valent Ni 3+ species, facilitating the formation of catalytically active Ni 2 O 3 H and nanostructures. Under hydrothermal conditions, spontaneous electron transfer occurs from Ni 2+ to Fe 3+ , yielding Ni 3+ , while simultaneous regeneration of Fe 2+ sustains a self-perpetuating redox cycle for continuous Ni 2+ oxidation. Remarkably, at ultra-low Fe 3+ concentrations, a hybrid morphology featuring both 2D and 1.5D structural characteristics emerges. Most Fe 3+ precipitates as colloidal Fe(OH) 3 without incorporation into the lattice, particularly near critical doping thresholds. The trace Fe-induced 2/1.5D nanostructures exhibit superior OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of merely 225 mV––comparable to that of heavily doped counterparts. Additionally, Fe doping synergistically activates both the lattice oxygen mechanism and the adsorbate evolution mechanism. These findings reveal a paradigm in Fe–Ni catalyst design, wherein controlled dopant-mediated redox chemistry and nanostructure play pivotal roles in optimizing electrocatalytic performance.},

  abstract     = {Air stability issues in layered oxides present significant challenges for sodium-ion batteries due to the high activity in humid air. The fundamental instability arises from inherently weak Na–O bonding, exacerbated by their wider interlayer spacing. Here, we propose that incorporating ions with high electronegativity can effectively modulate the Na + binding strength, thereby enhancing intrinsic air stability. As a case study, P'2-type Na 0.67 MnO 2 (NM), one of the promising cathodes that benefits from its cost-effectiveness and high specific capacity, was selected to verify the above-mentioned concept by introducing strongly electronegative Pb 4+ ions. To synergistically enhance structural stability, electrochemically inactive Mg 2+ ions were also incorporated, resulting in the P'2-type Na 0.67 Pb 0.04 Mg 0.08 Mn 0.88 O 2 (NMP4M8). As confirmed by x-ray diffraction, the reduced layer spacing in NMP4M8 effectively inhibits spontaneous Na + /H + exchange, resulting in excellent air stability. After 4-day air-exposure (20 °C, 50% RH), no significant hydrated phases were detected, whereas the unmodified NM exhibits clear structural degradation. After 7-day air-exposure, NMP4M8 achieved a capacity retention rate of 80.6% after 200 cycles, significantly higher than the 20.8% observed in aged NM. Density functional theory calculation revealed that Pb 4+ incorporation strengthened Na–O attraction, while Gibbs free energy analysis showed thermodynamically unfavorable degradation for NMP4M8. This co-doping strategy presents a promising pathway toward developing air-stable layered oxides.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior carrier transport is critical in thermoelectric (TE) materials. However, traditional strategies, such as doping and alloying, always generate a trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility caused by the complex scattering of carriers, limiting the carrier transport properties. Herein, we report a unique high-pressure strategy without introducing scattering centers to optimize carrier transport properties by taking Bi 2 S 3 as an example. The layered nature of Bi 2 S 3 offers a strong response of band structures to pressure. It was found that a unique electronic topological transition emerged under ∼4 GPa revealed by the in situ high-pressure Raman spectra, leading to simultaneous increases in carrier concentration and mobility. This enabled significant enhancement of carrier transport property to boost the electrical conductivity while maintaining a high Seebeck coefficient due to the accompanied large enhancement in the density of states, resulting in a notably improved power factor. Separately, the relatively low thermal conductivity remained due to the preserved layered structure characteristic. Consequently, a record-high figure of merit of 1.05 was achieved at 5 GPa and 744 K, which is higher than those reported state-of-the-art Bi 2 S 3 -based thermoelectrics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of pressure in optimizing carrier transport properties, providing profound insights of high pressure in designing high-performance thermoelectrics.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most promising high-speed nonvolatile memristors, aluminum nitride-based memristors have shown ultrafast switching at or even below nanoseconds. However, the on/off ratio, lifespan, and endurance of nitride memristors are very limited due to their intrinsic nitrogen vacancy conduction. Here, we demonstrate that memristors built on wide bandgap semiconductor aluminate nitride AlN possessed a representative prototypical digital memristive behavior through device structure optimization. The on/off ratio of the AlN memristors could be improved to 10 6 using one device cell, which consists of two memristors connected in parallel with a common bottom electrode. We identified space charge limited conduction in the low resistance state and Schottky emission in the high resistance state as the dominant conduction mechanisms. The AlN-based memristors could transform to volatile memory by reducing the interfacial barrier height. We further designed and fabricated a vertically integrated double barrier AlN memristor as a nonvolatile ReRAM on 2-in. sapphire and silicon wafers. These integrated double barrier AlN memristors possess high performance with an endurance of 10 4 , a retention of 10 5 s, and clear switching threshold voltages, indicating a promising nonvolatile memory.},

  abstract     = {Thin-film transistors with a source barrier—such as source-gated transistors and tunneling contact transistors—exhibit ultrahigh intrinsic gain ( A i ) and low power consumption, making them promising candidates for low-power circuits and wearable devices. However, their low output saturation current ( I dsat ) remains a significant challenge. In this work, tunneling contact thin-film transistors (TC-TFTs) with a high-mobility indium tin oxide (InSnO) channel were fabricated, and the effect of oxygen partial pressure on their performance was systematically investigated. Compared to conventional InSnO transistors, InSnO TC-TFTs demonstrated a significant increase in intrinsic gain and a reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure during the sputtering of InSnO, the output current of the TC-TFTs was improved to a level comparable to that of conventional InSnO transistors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the output current's dependence on oxygen partial pressure is attributable to variations in Schottky barrier height, which are induced by changes in carrier concentration. These results demonstrate the potential for fabricating high-performance InSnO TC-TFTs that combine large saturation current, high intrinsic gain, and low power consumption.},

Responsivity monotonically increases with incident optical power density. After 500 kGy irradiation, responsivity degrades by 80%, with dose dependence following a double-exponential decay. Vacuum annealing at 800 K restores 79% of the pre-irradiation optical gain, confirming a partial reversibility of irradiation-induced defects. Deep level transient spectroscopy reveals defect evolution post-annealing, identifying corresponding energy levels, identities, and annihilation dynamics. High-temperature annealing primarily annihilates irradiation-induced point defects, enabling significant recovery, while thermally stable defect complexes prevent full restoration.},

The nitrogen atoms of pyridine and hydrazine (-NH-NH 2 ) as active sites can effectively drive coordination with unsaturated Pb 2+ ions by Lewis acid–base interaction and anchor iodine-related defects by forming hydrogen bond. This synergistic defect passivation strategy reduced trap-state density and suppressed the defect-induced charge recombination loss. Consequently, the optimal 2-HP-modified CsPbI 3 devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.08%, corresponding to a 12% enhancement over their unmodified counterparts.

In this study, we engineered a minimized topological electronic structure with controllable gaps in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , through a synergistic strategy combining bulk antimony (Sb) doping and surface potassium (K) modification. Systematic investigations were performed using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 80 K. Bulk Sb doping effectively induces the formation of topological surface state gaps, with their magnitude dramatically increasing from 10 meV in Mn(Bi 0.95 Sb 0.05 ) 2 Te 4 to 103 meV in Mn(Bi 0.76 Sb 0.24 ) 2 Te 4 , while simultaneously reducing carrier concentration and shifting the Dirac point toward the Fermi level. Subsequent K surface modification induces a non-monotonic Fermi level shift, accompanied by a distinctive “closure-reopening” evolution of the topological surface state gap. We attribute this phenomenon to the transition of surface termination types induced by low-dose K modification and surface potential reconstruction caused by high-dose K deposition. This synergistic doping strategy establishes an effective pathway to achieve the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.},

In this study, we introduce fluorination of C 3 N as an innovative strategy to create a monolayer that features a quasiflat band near the Fermi level. The absorption energy, molecular dynamics simulations, and calculations of mechanical constants indicate that it is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable. Additionally, the orbital-projected energy band structure analysis shows that the quasiflat band predominantly arises from the unfluorinated carbon atoms. Further calculations reveal that its quasiflat band is partially occupied when spin freedom is disregarded. According to the Stoner criterion, spin splitting and ferromagnetism would be induced if spin freedom is considered. Subsequent calculations indicate that the spin-up channel hosts a nontrivial second-order topological phase with spin-polarized corner states existing in the zero-dimensional nanodisk. It is suggested that the spin-polarized quasiflat band can be effectively preserved around the Fermi level when placed on the h-BN monolayer. Taking into account the experimentally synthesized C 3 N and experimentally achievable fluorination for 2D materials, our work introduces a material for investigating the fascinating properties of flat bands and spin-polarized second-order topological states.},

It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet, established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.},

Throughput analysis of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and the possible magnetic configurations show that most of them look like 2D Ising ferromagnets, while Cr 3 TeF 7 is like an XY ferromagnet. Moreover, Cr 3 TeBr 7 is an ideal candidate to verify the Mermin–Wagner theorem due to its negligible MAE. More interestingly, three neighboring magnetic moments capped by a Te atom in Cr 3 TeCl 7 are ferromagnetically coupled with each other, and then these trimers will form an inverse in-plane triangular spin configuration at an angle of 120° with S eff = 9/2. For Cr 3 XY 7 , their flatbands show very weak dispersion, and the Dirac cones will open a gap due to the breaking anisotropy. However, van Hove singularities at M point still remain intact. In addition, Berry curvatures of single isolated Dirac bands show the opposite and identical symbols at K and K′ points for Cr 3 SCl 7 and Cr 3 XCl 7 (X = Se and Te), respectively, further indicating that they are very promising candidates for valleytronics.},

Improving their ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and photoelectric properties is essential for expanding their functional scope. In this work, we report the application of ultrathin self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for effective surface defect passivation in PZT film. By introducing [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) as a SAM on the surface of PZT films, both Pb 0 surface states and oxygen vacancy defects are efficiently passivated. As a result, the remanent polarization ( P r ) is enhanced from 26 to 31 μ C/cm 2 , while the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) increases significantly from 100–150 to 200–250 pm/V. Furthermore, the favorable energy level alignment between Me-4PACz and PZT contributes to improved polarization performance under illumination. These results underscore the potential of SAM-based strategies to enhance the functional performance of perovskite ferroelectric films and offer a promising route for integrating perovskite ferroelectric films into lightweight and portable electronic devices.},

A characteristic Δ T ∝ E 2 / 3 dependence of the caloric temperature change is found right at the phase transition, which rapidly evolves to a complex field dependence within less than 1 K above the phase transition. An analytical expression for this complex field dependence is derived from the Landau–Devonshire theory which accurately describes the observed Δ T ( E ) ⁠ . In the ferroelectric phase below the phase transition, a linear field dependence is observed. Bipolar electric driving fields lead to additional dips to negative values of the temperature change here, which can enhance the overall electrocaloric effect in this regime.},

This is achieved by locally heating the ferroelectric recording medium for a very short time at the data reading position using laser irradiation. We discuss the relationship between the maximum number of laser irradiation cycles and the heating duration for a LiTaO 3 medium. We also conduct a basic experiment and confirm that laser pulse irradiation greatly increases SNDM signal strength. Furthermore, we experimentally confirm that high-speed SNDM signal amplification occurs with nanosecond-order light irradiation.

  abstract     = {Local dipoles significantly influence the properties of paraelectric perovskites. Potassium tantalate niobate (KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 , abbreviated as KTN) is a perovskite with excellent electro-optic and piezoelectric properties. Manipulating dipoles via electric fields in paraelectric KTN demonstrates significant application potential. Therefore, such dipole dynamics under electric fields are essential to research. In this work, we investigated dipole reorientation under electric fields in paraelectric KTN crystals. We found that, under an electric field of 10 kV/cm, local polarization opposing the direction of the applied field still exists in the KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 ( T C = 13 °C) crystal. Additionally, a macroscopic piezoelectric coefficient of ∼40 pC/N was achieved in the paraelectric KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 crystal by applying a 12.5 kV/cm electric field for 24 h. This phenomenon is attributed to the maintainable field-induced reorientation state of the dipoles after the removal of the electric field. Furthermore, since complete dipole reorientation requires strong fields, in the case of a KTa 0.61 Nb 0.39 O 3 crystal with a T C (23 °C) approaching room temperature, a field-induced phase transition (at 2.1 kV/cm) occurs prior to the complete switching of dipoles in the paraelectric phase. This results in a multi-domain state in the recently phase-transformed crystal. Our findings help in understanding the performance exhibited under electric fields and can facilitate the optimization of paraelectric perovskites.},

This observation indicates that the previously considered domain wall can be a local object. Its occurrence is associated with the competition of polar and antipolar arrangements.

The electron–phonon coupling constant is independent of the external magnetic field, while the spin–lattice dynamics are strongly influenced by the applied field. We demonstrate that the magnetic-field-induced modification of the spin–lattice interaction originates from a reduction in the magnetic entropy.

Currently, it is established that valley polarization in altermagnetism remains largely insensitive to spin–orbit coupling and spin. We select monolayer Cr 2 S 2 as a model altermagnetic system to investigate the mechanism through which an external field modulates valley polarization in altermagnetism. This effect arises from breaking the diagonal mirror symmetry M x y under uniaxial strain, which lifts the degeneracy of the X and Y valleys, inducing significant valley polarization. Crucially, biaxial strain preserves M x y symmetry and fails to induce polarization. Uniaxial strain simultaneously induces valley polarization and a nearly uniform Zeeman-like field in the reciprocal lattice space, reaching up to 118.39 T under 5% uniaxial strain. Moreover, the symmetry breaking in the monolayer Cr 2 S 2 leads to strong piezomagnetic effects, merging piezomagnetic and altermagnetic characteristics in two-dimensional materials.},

A synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer configuration has been proposed to enhance the robustness of these devices against external magnetic field disturbance. Here, we systematically investigate the stochastic properties of SAF-based s-MTJs, with a particular focus on their size dependence. We demonstrate that decreasing the junction size from approximately 100 nm to around 40 nm reduces the relaxation time. Importantly, smaller junctions show markedly enhanced robustness against external magnetic fields, achieving susceptibility values below 0.1 mT −1 for sizes under 80 nm. Furthermore, we observe that smaller junctions exhibit enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage, with sensitivity values of around 0.5 V −1 at device sizes of approximately 40 nm, which is 100 times lower than that of conventional s-MTJs. These quantitative results provide clear guidelines for designing robust and scalable s-MTJ devices, essential for advancing spintronic probabilistic computing toward practical implementation.},

Interestingly, as tensile strain is progressively applied, RuICl transforms from the initial PMA to in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which leads to the evolution of spin texture through a sequence of transitions, progressing from a single-domain state to stripe domains, followed by a mixed state of domain walls and skyrmions, and ultimately transitioning to in-plane stripe domains. Furthermore, the synergistic application of tensile strain and an external magnetic field effectively induces skyrmions states. Spin texture modulation strongly depends on the magnetic field orientation. In addition, tensile strain significantly modulates the vertical polarization in the Janus RuICl monolayer. Our findings highlight the potential of the RuICl monolayer as a promising candidate for spintronic devices based on topological spin textures.},

Such advancements can significantly enhance logical operation capabilities, functional diversity, signal processing prowess, stability, and integration density while reducing power consumption. However, it remains challenging. In this study, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the spin-FET based on the altermagnetic monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 with spin–layer coupling can achieve perfect and controllable spin filtering depending on the transport direction. Notably, at zero gate voltage, the spin-FET exhibits a remarkable 100% spin-filtering efficiency (SFE) for spin-up and spin-down electrons along the [100] and [010] transport directions, respectively. Interestingly, due to the spin–layer coupling inherent in the monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 , the application of gate voltage can effectively modulate the SFE and improve the current in the [110] transport direction. Specifically, a positive (or negative) gate voltage enhances the SFE to 100% of spin-down (or spin-up) currents.

After HPT processing, the unit cell volume was reduced, and the inserted strain promoted the appearance of ferromagnetic domains. Thus, HPT processing provides a platform for exploring the strain-induced magnetic behavior of NiO.},

  abstract     = {Thermal imaging technology has significantly advanced the fields of thermal engineering and fundamental physics by enabling precise and non-contact temperature measurements. In the field of spin caloritronics, an active infrared emission microscopy approach based on lock-in thermography (LIT) has significantly advanced the study of thermoelectric and thermal transport phenomena in magnetic materials and their hybrid structures; however, its measurements have been largely limited to room temperature and above. Here, we report on the measurements of transverse thermoelectric conversion in a magnetic material, the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE), below room temperature using the LIT technique. Although the infrared emission decreases with decreasing temperature, the high temperature resolution of LIT allows to observe the AEE-induced temperature modulation in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co 2 MnGa slab down to 200 K and reliably quantify the anomalous Nernst coefficient down to around 240 K. The methodology demonstrated in this work will pave the way for further developments in both fundamental research and practical applications in spin caloritronics.},

  abstract     = {Lead chalcogenides crystallizing in NaCl-type structure are known as excellent thermoelectric materials. Yet, they have suffered the long-standing issue of performance imbalance between n -type and p -type thermoelectric devices. In this work, we have explored a highly stable low-energy allotrope of those lead chalcogenides, namely rockseline phase. This phase is energetically close to the stable NaCl-type phase with a hull distance of only 50 meV/atom. It can be potentially realized by applying elevated pressure on an existing experimental phase. Compared with the NaCl-type structure containing solely octahedron units with an isotropic bonding network, the rockseline structure has alternatively stacked octahedron and triangular prism units, thus exhibiting the appealing feature of hierarchical bonds. This causes the lattice thermal conductivity in the rockseline structure being few times smaller than its NaCl-type counterpart, thanks to the softened phonon modes and concurrently enhanced anharmonicity. In addition, the rockseline structure favors superior electrical conductivity at n -type doping and an appealing valence band convergence feature, being beneficial for the pronounced Seebeck coefficient at p -type doping, causing balanced thermoelectric performances under different doping conditions. As an outstanding representative of the rockseline family, rockseline PbTe exhibits an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.8 W / ( m · K ) at room temperature and an excellent yet balanced figure of merit approaching 2 at both n -type and p -type doping and high temperatures. This work highlights the important role of crystal structure engineering in the design of thermoelectric materials with superior thermoelectric performances.},

  abstract     = {The ultrawide-bandgap gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) polymorphs have opened frontiers in high-power electronics and multifunctional devices. Among these, the orthorhombic phase (commonly referred to as κ-Ga 2 O 3 or ε-Ga 2 O 3 , hereafter denoted as ε-Ga 2 O 3 in this work) stands out with its exceptional spontaneous polarization and large piezoelectric coefficients, positioning it as a prime candidate for next-generation high-electron mobility transistors and radio frequency resonators. However, the epitaxial growth of high-quality ε-Ga 2 O 3 films remains challenging due to interfacial transition layers and limited crystallographic control. Herein, we demonstrate a pioneering Sn-assisted low-pressure mist chemical vapor deposition technique that enables the growth of single-phase ε-Ga 2 O 3 films on c-plane sapphire substrates with unprecedented crystalline quality. The resulting films exhibit a remarkably narrow x-ray diffraction rocking curve (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 0.08°) while achieving atomically smooth surfaces (root mean square, RMS roughness = 1.51 nm). Key innovations include the complete suppression of interfacial transition layers through Sn-mediated nucleation and the realization of true layer-by-layer growth under optimized low-pressure conditions. This synergistic approach combines the inherent cost-effectiveness of Mist-CVD with enhanced crystallographic precision, establishing a viable pathway for industrial-scale production of ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based quantum well devices and polarization-engineered heterostructures.},

Activation energy (E a ) of 0.74 eV confirms the temperature-dependent nature of the trapping mechanisms. Furthermore, partial V TH recovery after stress removal highlights the presence of deep-level sidewall traps with a slow detrapping process. Additionally, by extrapolating time-dependent gate dielectric breakdown (TDDB) data across high-temperature stress conditions, the device demonstrates a 10-year lifetime at 150 °C under an operating voltage of approximately 8.22 V. Furthermore, the extracted E a ranging from 0.59 to 0.63 eV confirms the presence of deep-level traps within the AlGaN barrier layer, which contributes to the electron trapping during degradation, leading to the point-level defect generation, ultimately driving TDDB.},

Two electron emission signals have been detected in DLTS spectra of all Al x Ga 1− x N samples and the activation energy for electron emission relative to the conduction band edge ( E C ) from the first level shifts from E C –0.25 to E C –0.34 eV and that for the second level shifts from E C –0.6 to E C –0.68 eV upon changes of x from 0 to 0.063. In the L-DLTS spectra of the Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N samples, the electron emission signals associated with the E C –0.34 eV donor and E C –0.68 eV acceptor levels split into individual components due to aluminum fluctuations in the nearest neighbor (NN) shells. The splitting patterns are nearly identical for both signals and the ratios of peak magnitudes are consistent with calculated probabilities of finding a given number of aluminum atoms in the second NN shell around a Ga lattice site. These findings provide strong evidence that the E C –0.34 and E C –0.68 eV trap states in Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N are related to point defects in the Ga sub-lattice. Finally, a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defect levels in GaN and Al x Ga 1−x N using first-principles calculations suggests that the E C –(0.25–0.34) eV electron trap in Al x Ga 1− x N (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.063) is most likely related to carbon or molybdenum donor states, specifically, C Ga (0/+) or Mo Ga (0/+).},

This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of lattice-matched single- and multichannel AlScN/GaN heterostructures. A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forms at the AlScN–GaN interface with a lattice-matched AlScN barrier as thin as 2.5 nm and increases with AlScN thickness, exceeding 2.5 × 10 13 /cm 2 for a 10 nm barrier. Stacking of lattice-matched AlScN/GaN multilayers produces parallel 2DEGs whose total density scales linearly with the number of AlScN/GaN periods, reaching 1 × 10 14 /cm 2 for five-period structures, with moderate average electron mobility of 583 cm 2 /V.s and sheet resistance of 106 Ω / □ at 300 K. Structural analyses reveal that coherently strained epilayers with sub-nm surface roughness were achieved. The electron mobility in the lattice-matched AlScN/GaN single- and multichannel heterostructures is limited by alloy disorder and interface roughness scattering. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements confirm the presence of multiple conducting 2D carrier sheets with less than 15% carrier freeze out, carrier mobility of 851 cm 2 /V.s, and sheet resistance of 78 Ω / □ at 10 K.

  abstract     = {This work demonstrates an in situ etching technique for β-Ga 2 O 3 using solid-source metallic gallium (Ga) in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on ( ⁠ 2 ¯ 01) β-Ga 2 O 3 films and patterned (010) β-Ga 2 O 3 substrates as a function of temperature (1000–1100 °C), Ar carrier gas flow (80–400 sccm) and Ga source-to-substrate distance (1–5 cm). The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of ∼2.25 µm/h on (010) substrates at 1050 °C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding. Collectively, these findings establish LPCVD-based in situ etching as a scalable, damage-free, and orientation-selective technique for fabricating high-aspect-ratio β-Ga 2 O 3 3D structures in next-generation power devices.},

This study investigates the relaxation characteristics of the high-resistance state collected from a 2 Kb RRAM array which was fabricated in 28 nm commercial foundry. Three distinct drift behaviors of the RRAM resistance states were observed: (1) transient conductance drift, (2) stair-stepping conductance drift, and (3) reversible conductance drift. A programming strategy based on electron release was proposed to identify unstable devices efficiently. The amplitude and width modulation of the release pulse reveals that amplitude modulation has a more significant effect due to a certain barrier height for trapped electrons to be released. A physical model based on the trap-assisted tunneling mechanism is proposed to fit the cumulative distribution function of unstable bits under different pulse amplitudes and widths. Compared to existing long pulse and delay verify programming strategies, the release verify method significantly reduces the impact of RRAM relaxation while maintaining programming efficiency.},

In this work, the thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ l ⁠ ) of the BiOCl monolayer was studied using first-principles calculations and the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, in which four-phonon scattering processes are explicitly considered. Our results indicate that the predicted κ l is reduced from 7.1 to 5.2 W/(mK) after including four-phonon scattering (a 27% reduction). When introducing a tensile strain of 3%, the room temperature κ l can be further reduced by 77% as compared to that of the strain-free case. Such a huge reduction primarily arises from the flattening transverse acoustic branch and the densified low-frequency phonons in the strained BiOCl monolayer, which enables qualitative changes in the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering: from three-phonon scattering to four-phonon scattering. These findings provide deeper insights into the thermal transport behavior of the BiOCl monolayer and underscore the significant potential of strain engineering as a power tool to tailor high-order anharmonic effects for symmetry-breaking 2D materials.},

Two trap states were observed consistently and uniformly, with their trapping parameters quantified. Consistent with the high performance of these 1.55 μ m photodetectors, total trap concentrations were very low, in the order of 10 12 cm −3 . The activation energies of the two detected states were found to be E C - 0.21 eV and E C - 0.40 eV. The near mid-gap position of the E C - 0.40 eV state implies a role as an efficient recombination-generation center and could be an important lifetime-limiting defect for MBE-grown GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 . A comparison was made with an inferior performing GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodiode. DLTS measurements revealed the same defect states and spectra, implying that the sources of these defects are the same. However, trap concentrations were found to be substantially higher for the poorer-performing device. This correlation was further supported by comparing the minority carrier lifetimes of the two samples, measured using transient microwave reflectance (TMR). A significantly lower minority carrier lifetime was extracted for the lower performance device, consistent with higher trap concentrations. It was suggested that the near mid-gap trap detected at E C - 0.40 eV could be an important contributor to limiting the minority carrier lifetime within 1.55 μ m GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodetectors grown by MBE.},

The ZnSnN 2 layer in ZnSnN 2 \Cu is bulk inhomogeneous with one smaller work function from the minor phase resulting from Cu in-diffusion and suppressed oxygen out-diffusion besides the larger one from the original major phase, while the Cu layer is also bulk inhomogeneous, resulting from the higher chemical activity of Cu, which leads to the observed barrier height inhomogeneity and quenches the photovoltaic effect.},

The decrease in the plasmon resonance frequencies (redshift) with the increase in the lateral current was observed for both types of structures. We show that the change of the electron concentration profile and Joule heating are the main phenomena responsible for the shift of the plasma resonant frequency. These results are important for designing plasmonic resonance-based filters, detectors, and emitters operating under voltage bias conditions.},

The RFSS acts as a strong absorption layer, while dual 3D MSs (3D MS-I/II) with low loss characteristics synergistically broaden absorption bandwidth. Multi-interface exploitation optimizes angular stability, featuring resistive patch integration in 3D MS-II for compensation absorption under TE polarization and strategically positioned vertical metal patches in 3D MS-I extending the propagation distance of electromagnetic waves in 3D MS-I under TM polarization. Benefiting from the hybrid absorbing mechanism, the proposed absorbing material demonstrates over 90% absorptivity from 6.3 to 27.2 GHz with angular stability below 60°, covering full X/Ku bands (−20 dB bandwidth). Notably, 80% wideband absorption persists even at 70° oblique incidence.},

However, the growth of atomically flat polar oxide MgO films with arbitrary thickness has been hindered by polarity issues. In this study, we analyze the interfacial structure and band alignment of MgO (111) thin films deposited on 6h-SiC (0001) by the molecular beam epitaxy method. An epitaxial growth of the MgO (111) thin film on SiC is demonstrated. We show that the interface is O-terminated by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The insulating characteristics are preserved in the vicinity of the interface according to electronic structure calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the valence band offset is approximately 1.6 eV. Electronic structure calculations for a realistic model constructed using the atomically resolved electron microscopy images show an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured valence band offsets, further confirming the validity of the developed atomic interface model. These findings pave the way for further advancements in MgO-based electronic devices, considering the ability to tailor the interface atomic structure, which could be employed to engineer the overall electronic properties at the interface, including the valence band offset.},

SrFeO 2.5 films were grown on (001) oriented Nb:SrTiO 3 to enable high-quality interfaces and future integration with Si CMOS technologies. Post-growth vacuum annealing and growth pressure were used to control film orientations, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Films grown with diffusion planes oriented in-plane had oxygen-rich, perovskite-like nanodomains spread throughout the film, and fabricated devices exhibited worse switching consistency and more stochasticity. In contrast, films grown with diffusion planes oriented out-of-plane had a more uniform oxygen-rich perovskite interfacial layer above the bottom electrode, and devices built from this film orientation showed significant statistical improvements in switching voltages and cycling consistency.},

For samples without the AlN interlayer, the defects in the GaN channel layer near the heterointerface were induced by the strain from the Al 1−x Ga x N barrier depending on the AlN mol fraction. The density of strain-induced defects was markedly increased near the conduction band minimum to 1 × 10 18 cm −3 peaked at a depth of ∼10 nm from the heterointerface for the Al 0.24 Ga 0.76 N/GaN sample. The AlN interlayer was confirmed to suppress the formation of strain-induced defects. The carrier mobility evaluated by magneto transport measurements was also improved clearly in samples with the AlN layer because of the reduction in the density of strain-induced defects leading to remote 2DEG scattering. We have clarified the correlation between the density of strain-induced defects and the 2DEG mobility for a comprehensive understanding of the carrier transport in strained heterostructures.},

In our experiments, femtosecond second harmonic generation (SHG) signals were temporally broadened to the nanosecond scale through an absorption-and-remission process facilitated by a highly efficient quantum dot material positioned in front of a photomultiplier tube. This process yielded a 77% increase in SHG SI, along with improved image quality. Furthermore, the enhancement in both SI and SBR was consistently observed throughout the full imaging depth of three-dimensional collagen fiber samples. This method not only boosts signal strength and SBR simultaneously but also reduces the risk of photodamage and enables faster imaging. Owing to its simplicity, compatibility with other intensity-enhancing techniques, and ease of integration, the proposed time-stretching strategy holds significant potential for advancing both fundamental research and industrial applications in NLM.},

The impedance mismatch effects that cause issues for VOETs are shown to be absent in LOETs as the medium impedance appears as an element parallel to the photoconductor impedance instead of being in series. Results from the model are found to be in good agreement with electric field results obtained from full-wave numerical solvers.

  abstract     = {Collimating high-current-density sheet electron beams using external magnetic fields presents significant challenges, particularly due to complications such as diocotron instability. To address these issues, we introduce a non-magnetic, plasma-assisted planar collimator in this Letter. In this study, a plasma-assisted planar collimator was developed, and its performance was analyzed by utilizing a pulsed electron beam source to propagate a transient sheet electron beam through it for 50 ns duration. A collimated beam of dimensions 7.1 mm × 0.75 mm was captured near the collimating region, exhibiting notable compression along the beam height compared to its width. This uneven compression highlights the need for a detailed understanding of particle dynamics within the collimator. However, experimental diagnostics using traditional probes inside a planar collimator are constrained due to spatial limitations. To overcome this, a 3D Particle-In-Cell simulation study was conducted using VSim Multiphysics to model the interaction of the electron beam with neutral gas, resulting in impact ionization within the collimator. The simulation results reveal the role of the temporal and spatial ionization profiles that drive beam compression and shaping. A good correlation of compression factor between experimental and simulated results was observed, with the simulated beam size measuring 6.75 mm × 0.65 mm. This work offers valuable insights into the design of collimators for high-current-density sheet electron beams, with applications in high-power, compact microwave and THz sources.},

The joint measurement is possible only with prior knowledge of the target's location, which is unknown in many cases. The technique described in this article overcomes this limitation by using optical entanglement and quantum cross-correlated homodyne measurement. This technique offers the following additional advantages in comparison with QI implementation through joint measurement: (1) quantum storage and prior knowledge about the target's distance are not required, (2) it adds ranging capability, and (3) it adds anti-stealth mechanism to suppress the low-reflectivity of the target. As the detection is at optical frequencies, the environment is considered as a stray laser, which could be a decoy, a jamming field, a probe field from another ranging application, or a field used to mask the actual probe. Thus, the environment considered in this Letter is suitable for ranging applications like lidar.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of aqueous polymer-based supercapacitors is significantly hampered by issues such as limited operating potential windows and low energy density. To address these challenges, this study introduces a straightforward and rapid approach involving the incorporation of an active metal, copper (Cu), into a conductive polymer matrix, poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor configuration (CP//AC). This strategy aims to broaden the potential window of individual cells within aqueous electrolytes, thereby enhancing energy density. The synthesized polymer composite (CP) features a layered nanoflake morphology that facilitates conduction pathways, substantially boosting electron transfer and ion mobility rates. Notably, the CP electrode (CP-2) achieves a specific capacity of 935 mAh g −1 at 3 A g −1 and demonstrates cycling stability with negligible capacity loss over 10 000 cycles at 20 A g −1 in a three-electrode system, corresponding to a maximum power density of 8249 W kg −1 and energy density of 189 Wh kg −1 . Upon fabrication of a flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor using CP-2//AC, an 80.3% capacity retention is observed after 1500 charge–discharge cycles at 15 A g −1 . This research highlights the potential of polymeric materials for energy storage and demonstrates their feasibility in flexible aqueous supercapacitor technologies.},

  abstract     = {O3-type layered oxides, as high-capacity cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), face practical limitations due to poor structural stability, high Na + diffusion barriers, and inadequate rate performance. This work proposes a Ca/Cu/Ti co-doping strategy and systematically regulates the crystal phase among 24 types of layered oxides, from P2-, mixed P2/O3- to O3-type phase, by precisely controlling the Na content and adjusting the transition metal layer microenvironment. The optimum O3-type Na 0.80 Ca 0.06 Ni 0.48 Mn 0.40 Cu 0.06 Ti 0.06 O 2 delivers a high initial capacity of 151.37 mAh g −1 at 1 C (120 mA g −1 ) with 102.56 mAh g −1 retained after 200 cycles, while maintaining 80.67% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that an optimal Ca/Cu/Ti doping improves the Na + diffusion kinetics, where Na vacancies activate Cu/Ni redox activity to sustain capacity under Na + -deficient conditions, and effectively suppresses Mn activity, thereby simultaneously enhancing the cycling stability of cathodes. This work provides a wide range of component-phase regulation, achieving highly stable Na-deficient O3-type layered oxides through a multi-cation trace doping strategy for SIBs.},

  abstract     = {Fluorite-structured antiferroelectric (AFE) dielectric capacitors have emerged as promising candidates in energy storage applications. The AFE behaviors of dielectrics generally stem from an electric field-induced phase transition. Thus, the initial phase composition in the AFE film plays an important role in determining the performance of energy storage. This work systematically investigates the impact of oxygen plasma pulse time (OPPT) on the AFE properties of atomic-layer-deposited ZrO 2 films. As the OPPT increases from 3 to 5 s, the as-deposited ZrO 2 film changes from an amorphous to polycrystalline state. The ratio of cubic/tetragonal phase (C/T) in the polycrystalline ZrO 2 film gradually rises with increasing the OPPT from 5 to 15 s, accompanied by a gradual decrease in defect oxygen. To improve the performance of the as-deposited ZrO 2 capacitors, post-annealing is performed at 450 °C for 30 min in the forming gas. It is found that the post-annealing increases the concentration of the T phase in the ZrO 2 films, which reduces gradually with prolonging the OPPT. For the amorphous as-deposited ZrO 2 film under an OPPT of 3 s, the post-annealing generates the largest maximum polarization ( P max ) and energy storage density, corresponding to 19.7 μ C/cm 2 and 34.7 J/cm 3 , respectively. The results indicate that the AFE properties of the ZrO 2 film are determined by the T phase content, which can be modulated by the oxygen plasma dosing duration and post-annealing. Our findings provide a different perspective for improving the energy storage performance of AFE capacitors.},

Here, we introduce a PEDOT:PSS/NiO x bilayer hole transport layer (HTL) that optimizes energy-level alignment, achieving a threefold enhanced hole extraction rate ( k H = 1.17 × 10 8 s −1 ). Comprehensive microscopic analyses reveal that the optimized bilayer HTL effectively reduces localized charge accumulation, kinetically suppressing ion migration and phase separation. Consequently, the perovskite film retains compositional homogeneity under prolonged illumination, substantially enhancing both photovoltaic performance and operational stability.

However, obtaining excellent morphology of the active layer is an important challenge for achieving efficient all-PSCs. In this work, a ternary-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy is used to optimize the morphology of all-PSCs. The polymers PM6, PM1, and PY-IT are selected as host donor, guest donor, and acceptor to fabricate a series of LbL all-PSCs, respectively. The high compatibility between PM6 and PM1 promotes the formation of an alloy state within the active layer, which enhances molecular arrangement orderliness and crystallinity, and vertical structural phase distribution. The ternary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6:PM1/PY-IT exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.10% and better stability compared to the binary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6/PY-IT with a PCE of 16.96%. The optimized ternary LbL all-PSCs retain over 82% of their initial PCE after 790 h of storage in a glovebox.

Here, we demonstrate a carbazole-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM), [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz), as an efficient electron-selective layer in [poly(3,4 ethylenedi oxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)]/Si solar cells. The Me-4PACz SAM introduces a directional dipole moment at the c-Si/Al interface, generating a built-in electric field that enhances electron extraction. This interface modification leads to a linear Ohmic contact, reducing the contact resistivity between n-Si and the metal electrode interface to 4.12 mΩ cm 2 . Consequently, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.75% with a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 651 mV and fill factor of 78.03%, representing a ∼14% relative PCE improvement over the control device (PCE = 14.75%).

  abstract     = {We report a method of engineering a reversible change in interlayer bonding between layers of exfoliated thin films of MoS 2 by means of hydrogen intercalation through forming gas annealing. Interlayer bonding strength is probed through the behavior of MoS 2 under process-induced strain engineering, where two-dimensional (2D) flakes are encapsulated with a deposited stressed thin film layer to transfer strain into the underlying 2D materials. It is shown that after forming gas annealing, the depth of the strain transferred into multilayer MoS 2 is enhanced as determined through layer-thickness-dependent Raman spectroscopic mapping. This change represents a transition from a 2D van der Waals-bonded material in the as-exfoliated samples to a more three-dimensional (3D)-bonded system in the annealed samples. We demonstrate the reversibility of this effect by means of vacuum annealing of previously forming gas annealed samples. The process of forming gas annealing itself also imparts strain into MoS 2 due to a combination of 2D-to-3D bonding transition with differential thermal mismatch between the MoS 2 and the substrate. These strains are shown to be retained after the vacuum annealing process, despite the transition back to 2D bonding. Since forming gas annealing is a common technical process in engineering 2D electronic devices, these results represent an important consideration in understanding non-intentionally applied strains due to changes in the mechanical properties of 2D materials.},

By applying synchronized voltage stress (SVS) with optimized pulse parameters, the proposed method significantly suppresses channel temperature buildup and reduces device degradation. A predictive thermal model, rigorously validated through coupled simulations and experimental measurements, enables precise control of temperature dynamics under diverse operating conditions. Experimental demonstrations using light-emitting diode-integrated driver circuits reveal substantially improved operational stability under SVS, in sharp contrast to the rapid performance degradation observed with continuous stress. This purely electrical approach requires no structural modifications and offers a practical and cost-effective solution to enhance the reliability of advanced display technologies.},

However, most existing strain-engineering approaches face critical limitations: (i) incompatibility with real-time nanoscale characterization, (ii) restricted maximum strain, and (iii) discontinuous strain application. To overcome these challenges, we develop NanoGap, a piezoelectric-driven strain platform that achieves full compatibility with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques while enabling continuous strain in multilayer vdW crystals. Applying this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride flakes (20–50 nm thickness), we achieve 1.2% uniaxial tensile strain, as quantified through in situ atomic force microscopy measurements. Moreover, our strain-SPM integration reveals the direct correlation between progressive lattice deformation and phonon polariton dispersion alterations, as demonstrated through photo-induced force microscopy. This synergistic methodology establishes a paradigm for strain engineering by enabling simultaneous real-time nanoscale characterization and continuous strain manipulation.},

In this work, amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 films were grown by magnetron sputtering, and the effect of H 2 thermal annealing on the changes of microstructure and macroscopic physical properties of the materials was systematically investigated. The passivation of oxygen vacancy after H 2 annealing allows the photodetector (PD) constructed by the amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 film to be highly sensitive to 228 nm deep ultraviolet illumination with exceptional photoresponse behaviors. Under the deep UV light with 29.38 μ W/cm 2 irradiation at 228 nm, the photo-to-dark current ratio ( PDCR ), responsivity ( R ), detectivity ( D * ), response speed, and UV-visible rejection ratio ( R peak / R 400 nm ) were as high as 2.37 × 10 6 , 15.15 A/W, 2.35 × 10 13 Jones, 0.20/0.21 s, and 2.46 × 10 6 , respectively. In addition, the PD based on H 2 -annealed ZnGa 2 O 4 still exhibits a high PDCR of ∼10 3 under extremely minimal light intensity irradiation. This PD can sensitively record a brief “FJ” image generated by deep UV light. This work provides a feasible method for the construction of high-performance optoelectronic devices and systems based on amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 .},

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) field-effect transistors (FETs) demonstrate notable enhancements in their performance after electron beam irradiation (EBI) of the contact regions. Systematic studies revealed an optimal relationship between EBI dose and MoS 2 layer thickness, with field-effect mobility ( μ EF ) as a key metric. Under an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and an irradiation dose of 600 µC/cm 2 , 7 nm thick MoS 2 FETs achieved a μ FE exceeding 150 cm 2 /V s, representing a tenfold improvement over untreated devices, while contact resistance decreased significantly to 1.4 kΩ µm, an order of magnitude reduction. The observed performance improvement is attributed to EBI-induced sulfur vacancies, which narrow the Schottky barrier width by approximately 45% and enhance electron injection efficiency. The results highlight that EBI-induced defect engineering is a promising method for optimizing electrical performance in 2D-based FETs.},

However, due to the large thermal expansion coefficient difference between perovskite and inorganic substrate, such heterostructure faces the challenge of thermal stress induced mechanical instability. This problem will be extremely severe for the thick perovskite film for radiation detection because the thermal strain energy accumulates with film thickness. Here, first by theoretical analysis, we quantized the thermal stress instability and found that a temperature variation of only 20 °C around room temperature will suffice to delaminate a 100 µm thick perovskite film from the substrate, which prediction agrees with experiments. We then proposed to promote the heterostructure's mechanical stability by increasing the perovskite nucleation rate on inorganic substrate to enhance the interface adhesive energy. Based on a sacrificial seeding layer, we realized stable interface between the thick perovskite film and the typical inorganic substrate, including indium tin oxide, silicon, and gallium nitride that can withstand at least 100 cycles of temperature variation between 25 and 150 °C and then fabricated high performance radiation detectors based on such heterostructures.},

This study reveals that the addition of Al 3+ can concurrently augment both the luminescence and photosensitization abilities of glutathione-protected gold nanoclusters. Time-resolved spectroscopic investigations indicate that Al 3+ induces intermolecular aggregation of gold nanoclusters, thereby promoting the radiative transition of the excited triplet state and enhancing the energy transfer efficiency to molecular oxygen.

  abstract     = {Lead-free Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 perovskite memristors have emerged as promising candidates for nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing due to their environmental friendliness and stability. However, their practical applications are hindered by severe endurance degradation during repetitive resistive switching (RS) cycles, attributed to incomplete RESET of conductive filaments (CFs) at grain boundaries (GBs). Herein, we systematically investigate this degradation mechanism and propose two innovative strategies to enhance device endurance: (1) grain engineering via thermal annealing to reduce GB density and (2) GB passivation using polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives. By optimizing annealing temperatures (100–250 °C), Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 films exhibit progressively larger grain sizes (158.6–295.2 nm), which delays high resistance state degradation by minimizing CF nucleation sites. However, residual GBs still permit partial Ag accumulation. To address this, PEG incorporation chemically passivates GBs, effectively blocking ion migration and trapping. The optimized PEG-passivated Ag/Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 :PEG/ITO memristor achieves remarkable improvements: endurance is extended from 100 to 1000 cycles, and the switching window expands from 6 to 176 times. Furthermore, the optimized device demonstrates continuous conductance modulation for multilevel storage and synaptic function emulation, enabling a 784–100–10 fully connected neural network to achieve 92.2% recognition accuracy on the MNIST dataset after 100 training epochs. This study elucidates the GB-mediated degradation mechanism and demonstrates that combining grain size optimization with GB passivation provides a universal framework for high-performance RS devices in neuromorphic computing and nonvolatile memory.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) material-based devices hold significant promise for next-generation electronics, yet their performance is often compromised by interfacial defects, material degradation, and electrode incompatibility. In this work, we report a transistor featuring a MoS 2 /graphite heterojunction with a platinum (Pt) bottom source and a mechanically transferred graphite top drain electrode. This architecture preserves the structural integrity of MoS 2 while optimizing interfacial properties. The device, fabricated via pre-patterned Pt deposition and sequential dry transfer of MoS 2 and graphite, exhibits exceptional performance metrics: a rectification ratio exceeding 10 6 , an ideality factor of ∼1.47, and a switching ratio of about 6 × 10 6 at room temperature. Energy band analysis reveals that rectification originates from asymmetric Schottky barriers at the MoS 2 /electrode interfaces, where negative drain–source bias enables carrier conduction, while positive bias blocks current via channel depletion. We demonstrate that Pt electrodes outperform Ag counterparts due to strategically engineered potential barriers that suppress electron leakage. Dynamic rectification measurements confirm reliability under switching cycles, enabling dual-mode functionality as a reconfigurable AND logic gate and an optoelectronic ternary-state output unit. This work establishes a scalable framework for high-frequency, energy-efficient nanoelectronics, effectively bridging the gap between the theoretical promise of 2D materials and their multifunctional practical applications.},

Mn 3 Ga possesses the highest Néel temperature among this family, providing huge potential for realistic spintronic device application. However, the small anomalous Hall conductivity of Mn 3 Ga makes it lack competitiveness. In this paper, c axis oriented Mn 3 Ga thin films with D0 19 hexagonal structure were prepared by optimizing the MgO(111) substrate temperature. Large anomalous Hall resistivity up to 1.53 μ Ω cm at 300 K is observed for (0002) oriented Mn 3 Ga film grown at 450 °C, corresponding to a Hall conductivity of about 30 Ω −1 cm −1 . Further analysis indicates that the skew-scattering mechanism, which is attributable to the presence of a small amount of the D0 22 -Mn 3 Ga phase, is the main source for the large Hall conductivity observed here. These results raise the intriguing prospect of Mn 3 Ga films as a key component in antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {This study micromagnetically investigates the intricate interplay among threshold current, constriction geometry-induced demagnetizing fields, and applied out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic fields in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). While the threshold current scales linearly with magnetic damping at a fixed OOP field, a distinct non-monotonic behavior emerges with varying OOP field strength, giving rise to a tunable current–field minimum. This phenomenon is consistently observed across constriction widths ranging from 20 to 150 nm and is particularly pronounced in narrower constrictions. As the OOP angle decreases, the current–field minimum shifts toward lower field values, reflecting changes in spin-wave localization and spin-transfer torque efficiency. Analysis with an extended macrospin model reveals that the observed behavior results from transitions between distinct spin-wave localization regimes, each associated with varying degrees of radiation losses, driven by geometry-induced demagnetizing fields under different OOP field strengths. These findings provide key insight into the complex auto-oscillation dynamics of nano-constriction SHNOs and establish a strategic pathway to optimize current–field conditions, paving the way for energy-efficient and scalable SHNO networks in neuromorphic and unconventional computing applications.},

The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI 3 , Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 , and Fe 3 GeTe 2 monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here, we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr 2 Ge 2 Se 3 Te 3 with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal–semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te 3 atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from p z / p y and p x / p y orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.},

Among them, CaSnO 3 possesses the widest bandgap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO 3 across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ∼ 10 20 cm −3 , the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO 3 , establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.},

The sensor demonstrates a rapid response time of 80 ms and a linear electrical output in response to gentle airflow ranging from 0.5 to 3 m/s under bending conditions.

In this study, we investigate the temporal coherence properties of excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) using interferometric Fourier spectroscopy. We reveal a coherence time of approximately 24 ps and a homogeneous linewidth of 0.017 nm (55 μ eV) at 4.7 K under non-resonant two-photon excitation. We also analyze the impact of relaxation, scattering, and the experimental setup on the decrease in coherence time. The 1S orthoexciton shows robust photoluminescence intensity and negligible spectral diffusion over 120 min. These results suggest that Cu 2 O presents itself as an exceptional material for generating indistinguishable single photons, demonstrating considerable potential for advanced applications in quantum photonics.},

  abstract     = {Chemically robust III-nitrides (III-N) with bandgaps in the visible spectral range are critical for advancing emerging technologies such as solar-driven photocatalysis and optoelectronics. Conventional methods for bandgap reduction of GaN, such as increasing indium content in InGaN alloys, are limited by lattice mismatch strain-induced defects that compromise device performance. Incorporating small number of anions like arsenic (As) or antimony (Sb) offers an alternative through significant band bowing in GaN; however, achieving high visible emission efficiency remains challenging for in situ epitaxial incorporation due to thermodynamic barriers of limited solubility. This study demonstrates high-temperature (550 and 1000 °C) ion implantation as an effective strategy to tailor the spectral response of various GaN semiconductor structures into the visible range, achieving bright room-temperature photoluminescence at ∼485 and ∼550 nm for As- and Sb-related emissions, respectively. Notably, the implanted impurity concentration is only at the ∼1 × 10 19 cm −3 level and localized at a depth of ∼30 nm below the surface. Based on density functional theory calculations, the observed As-related emission arises from a combined effect of valence band edge shifting by As replacing N isoelectronically and an Arsenic interstitial (As i 3+ ) defect level formation. The Sb-related emission was attributed only to the substitutional Sb in N site (Sb N 0 ) related band energy shift, as previously reported for epitaxial incorporation. This work establishes high-temperature ion implantation as a viable technique to enable effective concurrent impurity activation and crystal damage repair, opening pathways for deep-level defect and bandgap engineering in GaN for energy conversion and photonic and quantum applications.},

To address this challenge, we employ swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation—516 MeV Xe ions—on Pt/SrTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 devices, introducing controlled ion track defects that guide filament formation. The irradiated memristors demonstrate remarkable performance improvements, achieving a lower SET voltage of 0.65 V (compared to 0.85 V for unirradiated devices), extended retention (>10 6 s vs <10 5 s), and superior stability (σ/μ = 0.06/0.06 vs 0.14/0.04). Moreover, these devices reliably emulate synaptic plasticity with minimal cycle-to-cycle variations (<7.2%), enabling high-fidelity neuromorphic applications. When deployed in simulated neural networks for handwritten digit recognition, the irradiated memristors attain a recognition accuracy of 91.6%, showcasing their robustness in real-time computing tasks.

Unlike conventional TMDs, Janus TMDs lack mirror symmetry and exhibit a built-in in-plane dipole due to their asymmetric atomic configuration. A larger electronegativity gradient across the Janus TMDs leads to enhanced charge redistribution at the vdWH interface and a stronger in-plane dipole, resulting in unusual Fermi-level pinning (FLP). The calculated pinning factors for 1T-TMDs/MoSTe and 1T-TMDs/WSTe vdWHs are particularly low, reflecting a strong FLP effect. Despite the wide variation in work functions among the 1T-TMDs, their Fermi levels are consistently pinned near the band edges of MoSTe and WSTe, enabling quasi-Ohmic or Ohmic p -type and n -type contacts. Furthermore, the vdWHs exhibit low tunneling-specific resistivity, confirming their potential for ultra-low contact resistance applications in next-generation single-layer transistors.},

  abstract     = {The development of ultraviolet (UV) heterojunction photodetectors plays a critical role in a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, biomedical imaging, and secure communications. In this study, we present self-powered solar-blind UV photodetectors based on a vanadium dioxide (VO 2 )/silicon carbide (SiC) heterojunction. The integration of the narrow-bandgap VO 2 film with the wide-bandgap SiC creates a Z-type heterojunction, which significantly enhances photocurrent due to the built-in electric field at the interface. Furthermore, a notable increase in photocurrent is achieved by the deposition of gold nanoparticles on the device's surface. This modification enhances the local electric field via the plasmonic effects, thereby further improving photocurrent. The synergistic effect of the plasmonic field enhancement effect and the built-in electric field of the heterojunction enhances the generation, separation, and transport efficiency of photogenerated carriers, ultimately resulting in a superior photocurrent response. The self-powered UV heterojunction photodetector offers a promising strategy for the advancement of SiC-based optoelectronic devices.},

Revealing the dynamics of octahedral distortion and ion migration during these transitions is vital to understanding their exceptional characteristics. This study reveals the atomic-scale dynamics of phase transitions induced by ion migration in mixed halide perovskites CsPbBrCl 2 using an integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscope. Unlike pure perovskites, the orthorhombic-to-cubic transition in mixed halide perovskites involves octahedral distortions and halogen migration. This ion migration facilitates a uniform halogen distribution within the structure, correcting the initially uneven arrangement. The dynamics of octahedral distortions are also examined, with accurate changes in Pb-X bond lengths and distortion angles identified throughout the transition. This cubic phase helps suppress ion migration, as supported by first-principles calculations. These in situ observations enhance the fundamental understanding of octahedral distortions and ion migration in halide perovskites, providing valuable insights for the design of stable perovskite materials.},

  abstract     = {The in situ exsolution process for metallic Co is crucial for developing low-cost and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on perovskite materials. However, traditional exsolution methods normally require working in a hydrogen-reducing atmosphere. To address these limitations, by introducing nanodiamond (ND) into La 0.7 Sr 0.2 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3 (LSFC), Co nanoparticles (NPs) were exsolved on the surface after thermal treatment. Owing to the unique sp 2 /sp 3 hybrid structure of ND, the electron transfer at high temperature enhances the electron density on the ND surface, creating a reducing environment for the exsolution of Co NPs. The electrocatalyst exhibits significantly reduced overpotentials (265 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 327 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ), a small Tafel slope of 52.14 mV dec −1 , and good stability (88.9% of initial current density after a chronoamperometric durability test). This enhancement primarily results from the exsolution of Co NPs, which increases the number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations explain the role of ND in improving OER performance. This approach holds great promise for innovating various energy storage and conversion technologies.},

In contrast, the EuSe film grown on the BLG substrate has various in-plane rotational domains. The electronic band structures of the EuSe films are experimentally characterized by in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, showing a semiconductive nature with the Eu 4 f band as the top of the valence band. The bandgap size of EuSe grown on BLG is further determined as about 2.8 eV via low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

The ZrTe 3 interconnects fabricated with a conventional photolithography process show high contact resistance, low breakdown current density, and electromigration-dominated structural breakdown characteristics. By supplementing a reactive ion etching step to reduce contact resistance, the breakdown current density and structural characteristics change significantly. Further contact resistance reduction by adopting a transfer process promotes significantly increased breakdown current density and distinct thermal decomposition-dominated structural characteristics.

The development of metasurfaces offers an approach to overcoming the complexities and bulkiness of conventional zoom systems. Most current tunable zoom metalenses only adjust focus in axial or transverse directions and lack multi-dimensional light field adjustment capabilities. In this study, a dual-polarization responsive three-dimensional zoom metalens based on the Moiré lens effect was designed. The metalens can provide continuous three-dimensional control of the focal point by adjusting the rotation angles of the three metasurfaces, achieving micrometer-level positioning accuracy across the entire spatial range. Furthermore, the metalens exhibits phase modulation characteristics associated with chirality. Specifically, when the incident light is excited in different circular polarization states (right-handed and left-handed), it produces a focal field distribution that depends on the polarization state. This is important for acquiring multi-dimensional information and enhancing target features in complex scenes. The metalens achieves axial zoom ranges of 1–6.5× for right handed circularly polarized light and 1–5.7× for left-handed circularly polarized light, with lateral deflection angles of ±12.5° and ±15.4°, respectively. The focusing efficiencies reach 65.2% and 67.1% for right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. This dual-polarization three-dimensional zoom metalens shows great promise for machine vision, microscopic imaging, and dynamic three-dimensional tracking, advancing multifunctional integrated optical systems.},

The disks act as perfect reflectors at the resonance frequency, and the energy becomes perfectly trapped between the disks, forming an FP-BIC when the distance between them satisfies the Fabry–Pérot quantization condition. We investigate the system both theoretically and experimentally, revealing how the total and radiative quality ( Q ) factor depends on the inter-disk distance. We gain valuable insights into the Fano features observed in the transmission spectra using the quasi-normal mode technique and temporal coupled-mode theory. Notably, we find that as the system approaches the BICs, the Fano asymmetry parameters diverge, resulting in a Lorentzian peak in the transmission spectrum. The experimentally measured radiative Q factor is on the order of 10 5 ⁠ , while the total Q factor, limited by material losses, remains around 10 3 ⁠ . These results open up new possibilities for utilizing BICs in microwave technology, with the potential to significantly enhance the performance of microwave devices.},

Results showed a clear dependence on metal type, with charge polarity and magnitude following a descending trend from positive to negative: Pb > Al > Fe > Cu > Sn. The observed trends correspond strongly with the triboelectric series, indicating that triboelectric charging is the primary charge generation mechanism. Other factors, such as electrochemical reactions, thermoelectric effects, wettability, and pre-existing droplet charge, showed limited influence.

Owing to diamond's high laser-induced damage threshold and exceptional thermal stability, the SC exhibits significant potential for long-term stable operation at high pump energies. Furthermore, simulations effectively corroborate experimental observations, indicating that longer crystals and smaller pump numerical apertures facilitate broader SC generation.

With this design, zeroth-, first-, and second-order differentiations are spatially separated, and the local linear polarization always orients toward the normal of optical edges for linearly polarized incidence. Thereby, selective edge subtractions can be carried out through simply rotating a polarizer. The design is verified in a photopatterned liquid crystal, whose electro-optical tunability enables a broadband operation across the entire visible spectrum. Rotating a polarizer confirms omnidirectional edge extraction in first- and second-order differentiations while preserving the zeroth-order bright field imaging.

Simulations reveal that synchronously displacing the first two defect layers toward the third layer significantly enhances the central defect mode's density of states (DOS), particularly in asymmetric configurations near the third defect layer. This asymmetry-induced DOS enhancement boosts dye emission efficiency. Experimentally, we use wedge-shaped LC films to continuously tune defect positions and observe that asymmetric structures near the third defect layer exhibit higher lasing intensity and a lower threshold. The threshold of the asymmetric structure could be reduced by a factor of 3.4 compared to the symmetric structure.

  abstract     = {Perovskite memristors have attracted considerable attention for their potential in emulating artificial synapses. However, the widespread use of the toxic lead-based perovskites poses significant challenges to futural application. In this work, we developed a lead-free memristor with an Ag/PMMA/Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 /ITO architecture, in which the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 halide perovskites functional layer was fabricated by physical vapor deposition. The memristor demonstrated a data retention time of 10 4 s and stable resistive switching behavior over 100 cycles under electrical pulses stimulation. Furthermore, it emulated a range of biologically relevant synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, spike-amplitude-dependent plasticity, spike-number-dependent plasticity, and spike-duration-dependent plasticity. Capitalizing on its nonlinear dynamics and short-term memory characteristics, the device was further integrated into a reservoir computing (RC) system. The RC system demonstrated strong recognition performance and robustness when tested with distorted digital image datasets. These results suggest that the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 -based memristor provides a promising, environmentally friendly platform for next-generation artificial intelligence hardware.},

  abstract     = {Droplet splashing is a common issue in various applications, from industrial processes to natural phenomena. This study demonstrates a method for suppressing droplet splashing by adding minute concentrations (as low as 0.1 wt. %) of fumed silica, titania, alumina, or magnesia nanoparticles to glycerol–water mixtures. Surprisingly, the suppression is more effective at higher impact velocities, where splashing is typically more severe. Our high-speed imaging and rheological measurements reveal that this effect arises from the emergence of elasticity in the nanofluids at extreme shear rates. This emergent elasticity, due to particle agglomeration and network formation, is demonstrated in the dilute fumed metal oxide nanofluids. Based on our findings, we propose a splashing threshold applicable to all liquids, including the non-Newtonian nanofluids studied here. This threshold is validated using Drop Impact Viscometry to accurately measure viscosity at high shear rates. These results offer an approach to designing splash-resistant liquids with minimally altered bulk properties.},

By incorporating both near-field radiative transfer and the bidirectional space-charge effect into our analysis, we demonstrate that the bidirectional discharge model predicts lower efficiency at elevated anode temperatures and smaller optimal interelectrode gaps width for peak efficiency compared to models considering only forward discharge. When the anode temperature ranges from 600 to 1000 K, the optimal gap width for the space-charge forward-discharge (SCBD) model falls within the interval of 1.275 to 0.901 μ m. In contrast, for the SCBD model, this range is smaller, spanning from 1.275 to 0.683 μ m. In addition, the cathode temperature generally rises as the gap width d increases. However, it exhibits a slight decline within the range of d ≈ 0.8 ∼ 2 μ m, attributed to changes in the transport conditions of the heat fluxes. These findings underscore the necessity of including bidirectional space-charge effects in the performance analysis and design optimization of PETE devices.},

Here, we report a simple charge-transport-layer-free (CTL-free) sandwich-structure for Sb 2 S 3 solar cells, featuring an innovative fluorine-doped tin oxide/Sb 2 S 3 /Au configuration that eliminates traditional planar heterojunction components like the commonly used CdS electron transport layer and Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer.

Benefitting from the favorable charge-carrier transport and collection, the as-obtained CTL-free Sb 2 S 3 solar cells yield an impressive PCE of 5.24% under 3000 K 1000 lux WLED illumination with superior long-term performance stability.

Therefore, we focus on the standard redox potential of Li + /Li [ E º (Li + /Li)], because the charge–discharge behavior of all-solid-state batteries is nearly identical to that of Li-ion batteries. In this study, we have demonstrated that the E º (Li + /Li) at the Li/amorphous-Li 3 PO 4 interface can serve as a reliable standard potential, comparable to the E º (Li + /Li) at Li/liquid-electrolyte interfaces, by using ultraviolet and low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy.

However, solution-processed fabrication induces deep-level trap states within perovskite films, posing constraints on both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational durability of devices. Herein, we developed a ligand-mediated crystallization modulation strategy that simultaneously optimizes the growth quality of perovskite on flexible substrates and deciphers the structure-performance correlations. Guanidinium incorporation promotes a more than threefold increase in grain sizes of perovskite films by refining the crystallization rate. These enlarged crystals function as the oriental scaffolding to improve the interface adhesion, residual strain, and trap density within the modified films, thus ensuring efficient charge transfer and extraction. The resultant devices achieved a champion efficiency of 42.8% under 1000 lux white LED illumination, recording as among the highest efficiencies for indoor F-PSCs. Furthermore, the device stability under potential operational conditions, including ambient exposure, continuous illumination, and mechanical bending, was collectively improved. This work elucidates the crystallization mechanism governing structural resilience and carrier kinetics in F-PSCs, providing a practical methodology for high-efficiency and stable indoor photovoltaics.},

However, conventional methods such as two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or mechanical exfoliation for constructing heterostructures often encounter issues such as interfacial contamination and limited structural diversity, making it difficult to meet the demands of diverse applications. Herein, we present a one-step, two-stage CVD strategy that enables the controllable synthesis of high-quality, large-area MoS 2 /MoO 2 heterostructures. By precisely regulating the concentration of the metal source precursor, the MoS 2 /MoO 2 heterostructure structures can be effectively extended to different dimensions, including 2D/0D, 2D/1D, and 2D/2D. Furthermore, this synthesis strategy exhibits excellent universality, as demonstrated by its application to the MoSe 2 /MoO 2 heterostructure system. Compared to individual MoS 2 and MoO 2 , the MoS 2 /MoO 2 heterostructure demonstrates significantly enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Kelvin probe force microscopy further confirms the existence of a Schottky barrier height at the MoS 2 /MoO 2 interface, which effectively facilitates interfacial charge transfer. This work demonstrates a simple and efficient strategy for fabricating multidimensional heterostructures, providing important experimental support for future functional devices based on heterostructure materials.},

This study reports a high-entropy aluminum (Al)-based halide SE, Li 1.245 Al 0.745 (ZrPSiB) 0.0636 O 0.7 Cl 3.1 , synthesized from inexpensive precursors using a high-entropy strategy.

  abstract     = {Minimizing energy loss is pivotal for achieving high-performance indoor organic photovoltaic (IOPV) cells, where charge transfer (CT) rate critically governs exciton-to-charge conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the fundamental correlation between CT rate and energy loss remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how CT rate affects the radiative and non-radiative energy loss in IOPV devices employing PBDB-T donor and three wide-bandgap BTA3 series acceptors. A developed global fitting model for charge separation pathways demonstrates that the intra-moiety delocalized excitations and CT states show comparable contributions to exciton dissociation efficiency (each accounting for approximately 50%). Notably, our findings reveal that excessive driving forces can paradoxically reduce CT rate, resulting in prolonged existence of CT states at the donor:acceptor interfaces that amplifies radiative and non-radiative recombination. The lower CT rate-mediated energy loss becomes increasingly dominant under indoor weak illumination compared to standard solar conditions due to reduced density of CT states and intensified influence of trap states. This elucidates a CT rate-dependent energy loss mechanism that warrants greater consideration in the design of IOPVs. These results highlight the importance of CT rate modulation for suppressing energy loss, providing valuable insights for the rational design of photovoltaic materials for diverse indoor energy harvesting applications.},

By exploring the interface of physical and biological interactions, this study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying CAP's anticancer activity and provides compelling experimental evidence to support its clinical potential. These insights broaden the biomedical applications of CAP and offer additional perspectives for advancing innovative physical therapies.},

Herein, we report a buried interface engineering strategy based on Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (Cu-MOF) to fabricate high-quality MAPbI 3 thin films. The results reveal that the carbonyl groups (C=O) in Cu-MOF effectively passivate undercoordinated Pb 2+ at the buried interface through strong coordination interactions, while simultaneously modulating crystallization dynamics to yield enlarged grain sizes and reduced grain boundaries. Furthermore, Cu 2+ ions released from the MOFs occupy Pb 2+ vacancies in MAPbI 3 . According to this, the crystalline quality of MAPbI 3 thin films has been improved. The enhancement in device performance further demonstrated the crucial roles of Cu-MOF.

  abstract     = {The prospect of achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing with semiconductor spin qubits in Si/SiGe heterostructures relies on the integration of a large number of identical devices, a feat achievable through a scalable (Bi)CMOS manufacturing approach. To this end, both the gate stack and the Si/SiGe heterostructure must be of high quality, exhibiting uniformity across the wafer and consistent performance across multiple fabrication runs. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of Si/SiGe heterostructures and gate stacks, fabricated in an industry-standard 200 mm BiCMOS pilot line. We evaluate the homogeneity and reproducibility by probing the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the shallow silicon quantum well through magnetotransport characterization of Hall bar-shaped field-effect transistors at 1.5 K. Across all the probed wafers, we observe minimal variation of the 2DEG properties, with an average maximum mobility of ( 4.25 ± 0.17 ) × 10 5 cm 2 /Vs and low percolation carrier density of ( 5.9 ± 0.18 ) × 10 10 cm −2 evidencing low disorder potential in the quantum well. The observed narrow statistical distribution of the transport properties highlights the reproducibility and the stability of the fabrication process. Furthermore, wafer-scale characterization of a selected individual wafer evidenced the homogeneity of the device performances across the wafer area. Based on these findings, we conclude that our material and processes provide a suitable platform for the development of scalable, Si/SiGe-based quantum devices.},

Our findings indicate that these memristors can exhibit three NDR phenomena depending on the compliance current conditions. Specifically, under low compliance current, the memristors are forming-free and display a continuous “S-type” NDR1 characteristic. When subjected to high compliance currents, electrical forming occurs, leading to a Mott phase transition and the subsequent emergence of both S-type NDR2 and “snap-back” NDR. Furthermore, while forming-free devices produce stable NDR1, they are unable to generate stable oscillation pulses due to the lack of a fixed low resistance. In contrast, devices that have undergone the forming process can generate stable oscillating pulses with good threshold switching stability exceeding 10 7 times.},

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), with its high thermal conductivity and excellent electrical insulation, offers a promising solution for heat dissipation. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the transferred low-pressure chemical vapor deposition-grown h-BN effectively mitigates self-heating in AlGaN/gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors. All 12 tested devices showed increased current after BN transfer. The average current density in the saturation region improved from 819 to 924 mA/mm, and the current retention rose from 89% to 98%. Thermo-reflectance measurements revealed a significant reduction in channel temperature from 179 to 115 °C under a power density of 21 W/mm. The improvement is attributed to the high in-plane thermal conductivity of h-BN, which is proven by the hotspot models. This approach shows promise as a practical method to reduce self-heating and enhance the thermal reliability of GaN-based power transistors.},

In this work, we demonstrate a robust approach for the substitution of vanadium in tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ) via the selenization of pre-deposited V 2 O 5 /WO 3 thin films. By adjusting the thickness of the vanadium oxide layer, the V concentration in W 1− x V x Se 2 is systematically varied. Electrical measurements on field-effect transistors reveal a substantial enhancement in hole conduction, with drain current increasing by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to undoped WSe 2 . Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity indicates a clear insulator-to-metal transition with increasing V content, likely due to band structure modifications. Concurrently, the photoconductive gain decreases, suggesting enhanced recombination and charge screening effects. These results establish vanadium doping via selenization of V 2 O 5 /WO 3 films as a scalable strategy for modulating the transport and photoresponse of WSe 2 , offering promising implications for wafer-scale optoelectronic device integration.},

  abstract     = {Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising ferroelectric material used for emerging memories and radio frequency (RF) micromechanical resonators. The ferroelectric behavior of the bulk properties of LN has been well studied, and investigations on thin films have shown promising performance. However, the macroscopic ferroelectric properties of LN films that are sub-100 nm thick, which are desired to truly harness the advantages and scalability of the material, have not been explored. Here, we report the ferroelectric properties of 43 nm ultra-thin films of Y-36 LN sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Y-36 is a particularly promising cut for RF microacoustics, but can also be employed for integrated memories and photonics. Switching occurred with an average positive coercive field (+E c ) of 0.92 MV cm −1 and an average −E c of 0.39 MV cm −1 , resulting in the ability to switch the film polarization with < 2 V. The 43 nm film maintains a large positive remanent polarization (+P R ) of 58 μ C · cm − 2 and a -P R of 55 μ C · cm − 2 ⁠ . The thin film shows excellent endurance, maintaining a stable P R value after 1 billion polarization switching cycles. Retention characteristics also show stable P R value after 100 s. Additionally, findings indicate a power series relationship of E c ∝ F β with β value at 0.253 and 0.053 for +E c and −E c , respectively. Overall, the characterization of these ultra-thin films of LN showcase its potential for miniaturization and application to tunable RF acoustics or emerging memories.},

The Ti- K pre-edge XAS peak characteristic of Ti off-center displacement retains its intensity up to x = 0.075 ⁠ , indicating the stability of the electric dipole moment at the Ti site, which was also confirmed by the locally sensitive charge-transfer peaks observed in Ti K β XES. In contrast, Sn L 3 -edge XAS shows a monotonic decrease in the characteristic peak intensity in the same x range, which is interpreted as the association of oxygen vacancies with Sn-doping at the Ti site based on the spectral simulation. The response to the electric field of the dipole moment at the Ti site becomes significant with the help of reduced dipole–dipole interaction by inevitably introduced oxygen vacancies, which leads to an enhancement of dielectric properties in the Sn low concentration range.},

Maintaining the high ferroelectric performance of Al 1−x Sc x N far from room temperature can further broaden its applications in extreme environments. However, its cryogenic ferroelectricity has not been revealed yet. Therefore, this study focuses on the low-temperature stability of Al 0.75 Sc 0.25 N films. From 20 to −150 °C, the film retains a stable wurtzite structure [(002) peak shift < 0.1°] and strong ferroelectricity (90% remanent polarization at −150 °C). With the decrease in temperature, the coercive field of Al 0.75 Sc 0.25 N films increases by over 2 MV/cm, while the remanent polarization only decreases slightly. Rayleigh fitting indicates that the reduction in mobile domain wall density and/or mobility as temperature drops is the main reason for the change of the remanent polarization and coercive field. Moreover, the leakage current decreases with decreasing temperature, accompanied by the transition from the coexistence of Schottky emission and hopping conduction to Schottky emission dominance below −100 °C. The excellent ferroelectricity of the film after being placed at −180 °C for 12 h confirms the robust low-temperature stability. These results fill the gap in understanding the low-temperature performance of Al 1−x Sc x N films, which provide important insights into the fundamental physics and lay the foundation for high-performance, low-loss applications of nitride ferroelectric materials under liquid nitrogen conditions.},

Traditional Pt-based materials often enhance the SOT efficiency through alloying or doping, but these approaches typically involve trade-offs between power consumption and SOT performance. To address these limitations, this study proposes an innovative strategy by uniformly incorporating VO 2 into Pt, achieving dual optimization of SOT efficiency and electrical performance. The magnetization switching current density was reduced to 3 × 10 6 A/cm 2 , corresponding to a damping-like torque efficiency ( ξ DL ) of 0.27, and the volume power density decreased to 5.1 × 10 11 mW cm −3 . The values are reduced by approximately ninefold and 40-fold, respectively, compared to pure Pt. Thus, VO 2 -doped Pt provides a pathway for the design of low-power, high-efficiency SOT-MRAM devices.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetallic candidate family RTX (R = rare-earth element, T = poor metal, X = Si and Ge) has recently attracted significant attention due to its exotic quantum states and potential applications in quantum devices. In this study, our comprehensive investigations of high-quality NdGaGe and GdGaGe single crystals reveal distinct magnetic and electrical responses. Both compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic transitions with T N ∼ 7.6 and 22.4 K for NdGaGe and GdGaGe, respectively. NdGaGe exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy ( χ c / χ a ∼ 70). In contrast, GdGaGe displays weak magnetic anisotropic behavior ( χ c / χ a ∼ 1) with a distinctive spin-flop transition. Below T N , NdGaGe shows significant negative magnetoresistance due to the reduced spin-disorder scattering arising from the field-induced spin alignment. GdGaGe exhibits more complex magnetoresistance behavior: positive values at low fields transitioning to negative values attributed to the reduced spin-flop scattering. Specifically, NdGaGe demonstrates a large anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) of approximately 368 Ω −1 cm −1 , which is dominated by the intrinsic mechanism. These results reveal the pivotal role of rare-earth elements in modulating the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport characteristics of the RGaGe system, thereby providing valuable insights for developing next-generation spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, spintronics research has expanded from collinear to noncollinear magnetism, driving increased interest in the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (IL-DMI) for its role in mediating long-range chiral coupling between magnetic layers. While IL-DMI enables vertical transmission of chirality in multilayers, its microscopic origin remains less understood, particularly in relation to the well-studied interfacial DMI. Establishing whether these two forms of Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction share a common underlying mechanism is essential for the unified control of chiral spin textures in engineered heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate unambiguous polarity reversal of IL-DMI by tuning the ferromagnetic composition of the perpendicularly magnetized layer in a type-T structure composed of Co and Ni interfaced with Pt. The polarity shift correlates with transitioning from a Co to a Ni-dominated interface. Control experiments confirm that the IL-DMI direction is exclusively determined by the identity of the ferromagnetic layer in direct contact with the Pt spacer and remains unaffected by the overall ferromagnetic material thickness. Robust field-free switching, with polarity directly following this interface-defined IL-DMI direction, further reinforces the interfacial origin of the chiral coupling. These findings establish interfacial composition as a key handle for engineering chiral coupling in spintronic multilayers.},

We report a systematic study of thickness-dependent magnetic properties and ionic liquid gating effects in mechanically exfoliated Fe 4 GeTe 2 flakes using anomalous Hall effect (AHE) measurements. As thickness decreases from bulk down to 25 nm, significant changes in magnetic behavior are observed, including a 215% enhancement in AHE amplitude, a transition from magnetic phase coexistence in thicker flakes (e.g., 877 nm) to a homogenized phase below a critical thickness (e.g., 67 nm), and a strong thickness dependence of coercivity ( H c ). A spin reorientation transition around 100 K is also identified in both bulk and thin flakes. Furthermore, we demonstrate effective electrical control over magnetism in 25 nm Fe 4 GeTe 2 devices using ionic liquid gating. Applying gate voltages of ±3 V at 100 K resulted in a substantial modulation of magnetic properties, increasing the saturation Hall resistance ( R s ) by up to 74% and H c by up to 64%, attributed to gate-induced modification of hole carrier concentration. These findings highlight the tunability of magnetism in Fe 4 GeTe 2 via dimensionality and electric fields, presenting opportunities for developing vdW material-based electrically controlled spintronic applications.},

Altermagnets, a particular magnetic system, with zero net magnetizations and non-spin-degenerate conductance due to momentum-dependent spin polarization, can generate TMR when used to replace ferromagnetic and traditional antiferromagnetic electrodes. In this study, we present a ferromagnet/insulator barrier/altermagnet junction that exhibits large intrinsic TMR. In this system, the ferromagnetic electrode is a half-metallic alloy with a unidirectional Fermi surface. We demonstrate that a large TMR can be obtained in V 0.5 Cr 0.5 O 2 /TiO 2 /RuO 2 through first-principles calculations and quantum transport calculations. However, the TMR ratio is almost zero when the ferromagnetic electrode is replaced with pristine VO 2 or CrO 2 . This behavior can be attributed to the unidirectional conduction channel rather than transport direction. Our work presents an efficient approach to realize large TMR ratio in ferromagnet/insulator barrier/altermagnet MTJs, which could contribute to the potential development of altermagnet-based spintronic devices.},

Our results reveal that phonon modes propagating obliquely with respect to the graphene basal planes are the primary contributors to cross-plane thermal transport. These modes exhibit a predominantly ballistic nature, resulting in an almost linear increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity with the number of layers. The presence of nanoholes in graphene induces a broadband suppression of cross-plane phonon transport, whereas lithium-ion intercalation shows potential to enhance it. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing cross-plane heat conduction in key graphene-based structures, offering valuable guidance for thermal management and engineering of van der Waals materials.},

We have investigated the optical properties of high-quality InAs/In 0.5 Ga 0.5 As 0.5 Sb 0.5 type-II superlattices in the long-wave infrared band (6–9 μ m), where a significant carrier localization phenomenon was observed via temperature- and excitation-power-dependent photoluminescence measurements.

We also observed a large radiative to nonradiative recombination ratio (∼42.6) by analyzing localized-state ensemble equations in type-II superlattices. Finally, the InAs/In 0.5 Ga 0.5 As 0.5 Sb 0.5 superlattice showed long minority carrier lifetimes of up to 847 ns.

  abstract     = {Hg 1−x Cd x Te (MCT) is a critical material for infrared detectors. The foundation of developing ultra-high-performance detectors lies in the suppression of defects in MCT films. In this study, MCT thin films were grown on CdZnTe substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The formation mechanism and mitigation strategies of needle-like defects—macroscopic surface defects—were systematically investigated. By controlling the growth temperature, it was found that the occurrence of these needle-like defects is associated with a temperature rise on the surface during the later stages of growth. This phenomenon is attributed to stress propagation induced by the formation of internal voids within the material. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with geometric phase analysis was employed to elucidate the atomic structure and strain distribution of the needle-like defects. Through the optimization of the growth process, the formation of such defects on the MCT surface was effectively suppressed. As a result, the full width at half maximum of the x-ray double-crystal rocking curve was reduced to only 41.8 arc sec, indicating a significant improvement in crystalline quality. This work provides essential theoretical insights and practical guidance for defect control and further process optimization in high-performance MCT infrared detectors.},

  abstract     = {As data processing demands increase, embedded flash is advancing toward low power consumption, low manufacturing cost, and high operation speed, as well as large memory windows (MW). A self-aligned split-gate floating-gate (FG) NOR-type flash memory cell and array have been proposed under a 55 nm node. Low-voltage erase and high-speed program operation have been achieved owing to a low EP-to-FG coupling ratio of 0.09 and a high CG-to-FG coupling ratio of 0.67, respectively. Moreover, up to 8 masks can be reduced in our low-cost process, as compared to that of the third-generation SuperFlash. Additionally, close to 5-bit states have been realized in the large MW of 7.1 V in a single-bit cell, which is mostly attributed to the threshold voltage (V th ) tuning by drain-side dual-pocket implantation.},

  abstract     = {Twisted bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) exhibits significant bulk photovoltaic effects (BPVE) due to its unique moiré superlattice, which introduces nontrivial quantum geometry and modulates the electronic bands. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the BPVE in twisted bilayer MoS 2 , focusing on the role of phonon-assisted processes. We find that phonon-assisted transitions can mediate a non-zero displacement of electron and hole wave packets, a critical component of shift current. This displacement, driven by the interband Berry connection, leads to a measurable change in the polarization phase of the shift current. Using laser excitation at different wavelengths, we observe variations in the polarization phase during interband excitonic transitions, highlighting the critical role of phonons. Our findings reveal phonon-mediated interband processes and modulation mechanisms of shift vectors, which provide design principles for developing twist-engineered optoelectronic devices with polarization-programmable photoresponse.},

In this work, we observed that an ordered harmonic chemical wave and random spinodal wave can be simultaneously formed in polymer semiconductor solution. Such a mixed wave mode offers clear evidence that the ordered patterns originated from phase transition at non-equilibrium conditions.},

Herein, we report a facile and efficient approach for fabricating ultralong, compositionally graded CsPbBr 3 − 3x I 3x nanowires (NWs). By incorporating a ligand barrier onto the NW surface, the ion exchange is confined only to both ends of the NWs, leading to a compositional gradient extending over tens of micrometers along individual NWs. Further study shows that the funnel-like energy band structure facilitates the transport of photo-generated carriers, as evidenced by the excellent spectral and optoelectronic performance of the gradient NW device. Such ligand-assisted, spatially resolved band engineering is conducted at ambient conditions without additional process of nanofabrication or micro-manipulation, which is suitable for integration into miniaturized optoelectronic devices.},

In this work, we investigated systematically the electrical and thermal transport properties of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) antiferromagnet A Mn 6 Bi 5 ( A = Na, Rb, and Cs) and find some significant differences among them. All of them exhibit large thermopowers and considerable power factors at low temperature, but interestingly, the sign of thermopower changes from negative to positive with decreasing temperature for NaMn 6 Bi 5 . The low-temperature thermal conductivity of NaMn 6 Bi 5 is also lower than those of RbMn 6 Bi 5 and CsMn 6 Bi 5 , which is attributed to the high-density defects and stronger scattering. In addition, sufficiently large Nernst coefficients were observed in RbMn 6 Bi 5 and CsMn 6 Bi 5 but not in NaMn 6 Bi 5 . It was deduced that the dramatic change in thermoelectric characteristics observed in A Mn 6 Bi 5 was due to a large difference in their ionic sizes, leading to a complex interaction among the spin, charge, lattice, and one-dimensionality. Our work provides a unique example of the influences of alkali ions on the thermoelectric properties of Q1D-magnetic alkali metal compounds and can serve as a guide into the future direction for the improvement of the performance of the title compounds.},

While optical anisotropy driven by symmetry breaking has been extensively studied, the combined effects of magnetism and strain on anisotropy remain less explored. Here, we engineer heterostructures by integrating isotropic monolayer WSe 2 with low-symmetry antiferromagnetic CrOCl and depositing them onto Au nanopillar arrays, effectively introducing optical anisotropy into WSe 2 . Polarization-resolved PL measurements at both room temperature (300 K) and cryogenic conditions (1.7 K) demonstrate strong region-dependent anisotropies induced along distinct axes by strain and CrOCl. Application of out-of-plane magnetic fields (±9 T) induces opposing modulation of anisotropy in strained and unstrained regions—enhancing and suppressing excitonic polarization by 30.38% and 30.3%, respectively. Temperature-dependent studies further reveal tunable anisotropy up to 23.08%, indicating the interplay of magnetic and thermal effects under strain. First-principles calculations suggest anisotropy via redistribution of the in-plane charge density in WSe 2 induced by CrOCl. This work provides insights into the customization and active control of the anisotropic optical phenomena in two-dimensional heterostructures, enabling polarization-sensitive optoelectronic and spintronic applications.},

However, the mismatches of lattice structure and opposite thermal expansion behavior between constituent phases frequently induce defects that interact with lattice vibrations, thereby complicating the expected thermal response. Here, we demonstrate that the mismatch induced defects can fundamentally overturn conventional predictions based on phase mixing rules. By incorporating LaFe 9.8 Co 1.1 Al 2.1 particles into a magnesium matrix, we observe an anomalous thermal expansion behavior: low particle concentrations lead to an increase in the coefficient of thermal expansion, while higher concentrations result in a significant reduction in it. This inversion is driven by dislocation generation and immobilization at particle–matrix interfaces, as revealed by multiscale microstructural analyses. Our findings demonstrate that thermal volumetric behavior in composites can be actively tuned through defect engineering, providing a viable strategy for designing dimensionally stable structural materials under thermal loading.},

Here, based on the strong coupling of two high-quality ( Q ) guided mode resonances (GMRs), we propose an effective means to realize high-efficiency SFG in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)-based etchless lithium niobate (LN) waveguide structure. Two prominent resonances in the near-infrared region are generated due to the spectrum splitting induced by strong coupling of GMRs respectively supported by the LN waveguide (GMR LN ) and DBR (GMR DBR ), which create a remarkable condition for high-efficiency SFG. A high SFG conversion efficiency of 2.13 × 10 −2 is achieved even though the intensity of input beams is low at 0.01 MW/cm 2 . Furthermore, high-efficiency SFG exhibits wide-angle insensitivity to the incident light and perfect unidirectional emission in the backward direction due to nearly unchanged high- Q factors of GMRs and perfect blocking of forward emission by the DBR, respectively. Our results provide an excellent paradigm for enhancing light–matter interactions and boosting nonlinear conversion efficiency without breaking the in-plane structural symmetry, which may find possible applications in quantum nanophotonics, optical communication, and nonlinear light sources.},

  abstract     = {Near-infrared (NIR) semitransparent organic photodetectors (ST-OPDs) face inherent trade-off between visible transparency and NIR detectivity. This study resolves this challenge through systematic optimization of donor-acceptor material combinations and donor contents (from 50% to 5%) across nine NIR-absorbing systems. The PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F blend uniquely achieves dual optimization of average visible transmittance (AVT) more than 59% in films and shot-noise-limited specific detectivity (D * ) exceeding 10 12 Jones in opaque devices across all donor contents. At 40% donor content, large-area ST-OPDs (around 1 cm 2 ) exhibit noise-corrected D * (2.96 × 10 12 Jones) at 980 nm with 28% AVT, while reducing donor content to 10% enables 41% AVT while noise-corrected D * over 10 11 Jones, demonstrating tunable transparency-detectivity balance. Optimized large-area ST-OPDs resolve 100 µm features under 100 µW illumination (980 nm), validated by dual-side imaging, indicating the great potential for application in scalable NIR vision systems.},

This study reveals that the dynamic target modulates the beat signal in FSI, causing the phase jump phenomenon in the beat signal and subsequent measurement failures. We theoretically derive and experimentally validate the conditions for phase jumps. Additionally, we propose using time-frequency analysis methods to detect phase jump instants and reconstruct the instantaneous frequency trajectory of the beat signal modulated by phase jumps. Experimental results show that even with phase jumps, we achieved a dynamic velocity measurement of −135.40 mm/s on a 0.5 m baseline, surpassing the theoretical limit of −4.40 mm/s under this baseline, while maintaining effective measurement capability on an extended 10 m baseline. The discovery and resolution of phase jumps are expected to overcome velocity limitation in FSI, significantly expanding its velocity measurement range.},

This study presents a coupled optoelectronic oscillator (COEO) based on forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) opto-acoustic resonance, achieving sub-Hertz linewidth and ultra-low phase noise microwave generation through coordinated opto-electro-acoustic multiphysics control. The design implements an FSBS fiber resonator that leverages group velocity matching between optical fields and transverse acoustic modes, generating narrowband gain via distributed opto-acoustic coupling, thereby significantly reducing reliance on high-Q filters. Optoelectronic feedback injection of FSBS signals into the fiber cavity enables locking of opto-acoustic oscillation mode, effectively suppressing side-mode competition and thermally induced phase noise. Experimental results demonstrate the output microwave signal linewidth of this COEO is 0.1 Hz, the phase noise at 10 kHz frequency deviation is lower than −130 dBc/Hz, maintaining merely 200 Hz frequency drift over 120-min operation. This work provides an ideal signal source combining ultra-low noise and high stability for next-generation wireless communications and precision radar systems while establishing pathways for nonlinear opto-acoustic coupling in complex media.},

Light-induced alignment initiates the formation of diffraction rings, while Brownian motion acts to counter this process. The dominance of each effect is governed by the optical absorption property of the solvent. Leveraging this mechanism, we develop a switchable nonlinear optical isolator using a single-phase MXene dispersion. Upon application of a control beam, the device transitions from a nonlinear optical isolator that exhibits ring patterns in only one direction to a symmetric configuration that displays ring patterns in both directions.

Combining nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models, new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale. Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality, strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and shaping next-generation photonic devices.},

Potassium chloride (KCl) solutions with concentrations ranging from 10 −6 to 10 0 mol/L were employed to systematically manipulate the charge relaxation time ( ⁠ τ e ⁠ ) of the liquid electrode. Our findings demonstrate that the discharge behavior critically depends on the ratio of τ e to the characteristic timescale ( ⁠ t c ⁠ ) of the plasma–liquid system, derived from the applied voltage frequency. When τ e / t c < 0.1 ⁠ , charge transfer on the liquid electrode surface is significantly faster than the applied voltage switching, resulting in near-ideal parallelogram Q–V diagrams indicative of uniform and Townsend discharge. In the transition zone ( ⁠ 0.1 < τ e / t c < 1 ⁠ ), the discharge shifts from input signal to charge transfer dominance, manifesting as almond-shaped Q–V diagrams attributed to conductivity-restricted plasma region expansion. For τ e / t c > 1 ⁠ , charge transfer becomes significantly slower than voltage switching, leading to substantial charge accumulation and elliptical Q–V diagram deformation due to charge residual. Furthermore, the non-uniform surface charge distribution, coupled with inherent plasma propagation asymmetry, results in stepped Q–V curves and several individual filamentary discharges during the rising period of applied voltage. These results provide fundamental insights into designing and controlling DBDs with resistive liquid electrodes for diverse applications.},

However, once the existing absorber is prepared, its electromagnetic parameters are often fixed, and it is difficult to achieve real-time performance control, which limits its application in intelligent stealth and tunable electromagnetic shielding. Inspired by redox-controlled ion valence modulation in redox flow batteries, a structural microwave absorber using Fe 3+ -incorporated hydrogels as the functional medium with tunable properties was designed. By connecting external charge and discharge circuits, the dynamic transitions between Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ states are precisely controlled, inducing real-time modifications in the material's complex permittivity/permeability. This approach enables on-demand tuning of electromagnetic properties within the X-band (8–12 GHz). The structural absorber based on Fe 3+ -incorporated hydrogels can achieve 90% absorption in the frequency range of 8.3–10.9 GHz. As regulation progresses, the peak frequency changes continuously from 9.79 to 9.09 GHz. The demonstrated absorption adjustment strategy of redox material establishes an alternative approach for further developing tunable microwave absorbers with controlled peak frequency.},

We propose a pixel-super-resolved LOCM via precision-enhanced dynamic registration and complex-constrained phase retrieval. The approach incorporates a dynamic registration mechanism in the iterative reconstruction process, effectively suppressing global misalignment errors. The introduction of physical constraints improves the convergence stability and further enhances the fidelity. Experimental results across different sample types demonstrate a 1.78-fold improvement in spatial resolution beyond the Nyquist–Shannon sampling limit across a full field of view of 28.6 mm 2 , with the minimum resolvable size reaching 775 nm. This method achieves superior performance in resolving intricate structural details, offering an effective solution for high-fidelity lensless imaging.},

It shows that within the micro-groove structure on the dielectric surface, a locally enhanced electric field is formed along the longitudinal direction at the head of the ionizing wave. Along the transverse direction, asynchronous discharge in different regions generates a transverse electric field within the groove, causing electrons to converge toward the groove center. With the reduction of width, the electric field within the groove intensifies, concurrently increasing electron energy and the spatial proportion of high-density electrons in the main discharge region.},

  abstract     = {Gas diffusion electrode (GDE)-based flow cells are promising platforms for CO 2 electrolysis, yet their practical application is hindered by critical challenges related to GDE stability at high current densities. While hydrophobic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based GDEs demonstrate inherent flooding resistance, their poor electrical conductivity necessitates the addition of conductive layers. However, the structure reconstruction of these conductive layers induces surface micro-crack formation and propagation, ultimately compromising electrode stability through serious flooding and hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, a hydrophobic carbon layer is intercalated between the conductive layer and the catalyst layer as interlayer current collector to optimize the surface micro-cracks and enhance GDE stability for CO 2 electrolysis. Scanning electron microscopy images showed fewer surface micro-cracks in the intercalated GDE, leading to lower Ohmic loss and more integrated conductive layer. Real-time electrode surface monitoring showed that the intercalated GDE effectively suppressed surface flooding. COMSOL simulations explained that surface micro-cracks cause uneven local current distribution of catalysts, contributing to device instability. As a result, the Cu deposited PTFE-based GDE with the intercalated carbon current collector operated stably for more than 40 h with a FE (C2+) of ∼72% at current density of 600 mA cm −2 . This stability is 8 times longer than that of the GDE without intercalation.

The device utilizes a 12 cm 2 perovskite solar cell based on Cs 0.17 FA 0.83 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 absorber material with a bandgap of 1.75 eV, optimized for low-intensity artificial light and achieving a power conversion efficiency of 22.1% under 800 lux LED illumination. The sensor operates under the ZigBee 3.0 protocol and is capable of wireless communication with a hub gateway. A custom-designed energy management circuit enables stable power delivery by regulating voltage from the PSC-charged supercapacitor, ensuring uninterrupted sensor operation. The prototype demonstrated up to 87 h of autonomous functionality under 1000 lux and stable long-term operation at ≥ 3000 lux. Comparative studies show superior or comparable performance of PSCs over commercial Si solar cells of the same active area under indoor lighting.

However, applications of these materials have been constrained by low device efficiencies and an incomplete understanding of their intricate charge transport mechanisms. Traditional current–voltage transfer curve analysis is a bulk method and can lead to unreliable parameter measurements when faced with non-ideal circumstances such as contact resistance. In this work, we use modulated amplitude reflectance spectroscopy (MARS) amplitude measurements to obtain high-resolution, two-dimensional maps of the carrier distribution in the channel of an organic field effect transistor under varying bias conditions. These results are consistent with measured IV and transfer curves and are used to validate a theoretical model of the spatially varying electric potential and field in the transistor channel under operating conditions. MARS phase images provide spatially resolved maps of charge carrier transport dynamics in the transistor channel and enable quantitative measurement of the drift velocity under operating conditions. By enabling spatially resolved characterization of both charge carrier distribution and transport dynamics in an actively biased transistor, MARS imaging is a valuable experimental technique for advancing the study of organic semiconductors.},

Optimized at 8% Ag doping, the devices achieve a high current on/off ratio of 7.1 × 10 4 , steep subthreshold swing (36.68 mV/dec), threshold voltage of 2.08 V, and saturation field-effect mobility of 2.43 cm 2 /V s. The electric double layer effect of chitosan enables low operating voltages by leveraging its frequency-dependent specific capacitance. Synaptic functionalities, including short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), are emulated through proton migration dynamics in the chitosan dielectric, which induces a hysteresis window due to the slower proton transport rate compared to electron conduction in the channel. Systematic stability evaluations under negative bias stress, laser irradiation, and dynamic switching confirm robust operational reliability. The devices exhibit synaptic programmability, with PPF indices tunable via pulse intervals and amplitudes, mimicking biological learning rules. Combined with solution processability and low-temperature fabrication, these Ag-doped CuI TFTs address critical challenges in scalable neuromorphic hardware by integrating ionic-electronic coupling.

The devices, however, exhibited poor rectification behavior. Additionally, the electron-dominated conductivity indicates that electrons play a key role in the performance of the MoS 2 /GaTe vdW heterojunction device. To enhance device performance, the suppression of electron recombination was achieved by eliminating the non-heterojunction regions on the GaTe side, optimizing the device structure.

Recent approaches employing single metallic gratings, with the double function of surface plasmon–quantum well (SP–QW) coupling and polarization selection, demonstrate potential for high-performance LP-LEDs. However, challenges persist in simultaneously optimizing luminous efficiency, electrical performance, and polarization degree. Therefore, we present a GaN-based blue light-emitting diode integrated with two collaborative metasurfaces, an Ag nanocone metasurface for efficiency enhancement and an Al nanograting for polarization-selective emission. Dual-structure design with collaborative functionalities resolves the trade-off between polarization selection and SP–QW coupling, while the introduction of Ag metasurface addresses the conflict between low luminous efficiency and poor electrical performance. Thereby, the fabricated LP-LED achieves highly efficient polarized emission, with an average polarization extinction ratio (ER) of 23.2 dB within ±60°, along with a 2.5-fold enhancement in efficiency and a 1.24-fold improvement in ER relative to the conventional Ag reflector design. This integrated design offers a promising route for the realization of high-efficiency, polarization-controlled optoelectronic devices, with broad implications for secure communications, advanced display technologies, optical interconnects, and biomedical diagnostics.},

Herein, we report a vapor-phase growth strategy that enables the controlled synthesis of 2D GaSe with tunable crystal shapes and stacking configurations by adjusting precursor flux and temperature gradients. The growth mechanism is elucidated through a combined experimental and theoretical approach, involving density functional theory and kinetic Wulff construction analysis. We demonstrate that the competition between diffusion-limited and attachment-limited growth regimes governs the edge propagation rates, leading to the formation of triangular and nonconventional morphologies. Furthermore, we reveal that distinct stacking orders result in pronounced variations in SHG intensity and polarization dependence. These findings highlight the crucial role of stacking order in modulating the nonlinear optical properties of 2D GaSe and offer a rational pathway toward the design of layered semiconductors with tailored optical functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The exchange bias (EB) effect, a ubiquitous phenomenon at ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interfaces, plays a pivotal role in advancing high-sensitivity magnetic data storage and high-density spintronic devices. However, its pronounced sensitivity to interfacial environmental factors, such as lattice mismatch, contamination, and thermal fluctuations, has hindered scalable device fabrication and performance optimization. We employ a one-pot chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize Cr 2 Te 3 /Cr 2 O 3 vertical heterostructures (VHS) with atomically sharp interfaces. The formation of Cr–O–Te covalent bonds at the heterointerface ensures crystallinity and thermal stability, establishing an ideal platform for robust EB effects. Remarkably, interfacial charge transfer between Cr 2 Te 3 and Cr 2 O 3 induces near-room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in Cr 2 O 3 , with a Curie temperature (T C ) of 282 K. First-principles calculations reveal a charge transfer of approximately 0.22 electrons from each Cr 2 O 3 to Cr 2 Te 3 , resulting in the emergence of interfacial ferromagnetism. Notably, the Cr 2 Te 3 /Cr 2 O 3 VHS exhibits stable ferromagnetic behavior with a coercive field (H C ) of 28 mT at 200 K, exceeding the operational limits of pristine Cr 2 Te 3 . At 80 K, a significant exchange bias field (H EB ) of 61 mT is observed under zero-field-cooling, unequivocally demonstrating a strong interfacial spin-pinning effect. This study establishes an efficient platform for exploring strong EB effects in two-dimensional magnetic heterostructures by engineering interfacial charge transfer and spin-pinning interactions, paving the way for room-temperature spintronic systems with enhanced operational stability and scalability.},

It is revealed that the electronic and magnetic properties of these materials are stable and do not change sensitively with changes in the lattice constants. In the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), both monolayers exhibit ferromagnetic Weyl semimetallic properties. With SOC, both Ti 3 Se 3 S 2 and Ti 3 Se 3 Te 2 monoalyers exhibit intrinsic QAH insulators with a high Chern number of 2 and a high Curie temperature (T c > 1000 K).

  abstract     = {Large winding number as the unique characteristics of topological phenomena has been garnering widespread interest owing to its rich physics and potential applications in enhanced information capacity. In this work, we report the realization of the large winding number and multifold topological phase transitions by introducing layer degrees of freedom to construct topological heterostructures and experimentally demonstrate the topological edge states for circuit heterostructures in the circuit system. The effective decomposition of circuit heterostructures into independent subspaces is revealed. The multiple topological phase transitions and different large winding numbers for heterostructures can be triggered by tuning the topological properties of the subspace, leading to the multiple topological edge states reflecting in finite-size systems. Our work provides an intuitive and universal way to access the tunable large winding number and multifold topological phase transitions and may apply to engineering unique topological phenomena and further applications in classical wave systems.},

  abstract     = {Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and allied materials have attracted significant attention in various fields owing to the remarkable performance achieved at a magic angle. However, because sound waves propagate freely in an acoustic system, the tight-binding theory, which is fundamental to studying TBG, cannot be directly applied in acoustic systems, which makes it challenging to create an acoustic material resembling TBG. Thus, in this work, we introduce vortex airflows into a bilayer structure to hinder free transmission of acoustic waves and provide the tight-binding condition in the system, which leads to the practical realization of a twisted-graphene-like acoustic material (TGAM). A theoretical model is established to study the frequency band of the TGAM. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental measurement demonstrate large magic angles over 3° validated by quasi-flatbands. Moreover, the acoustic system offers flexibility in design, in which the structural parameters can be readily adjusted to achieve distinct magic angles, quasi-flatband frequencies, and bandgap widths. This study is promising for advancing the design of two-dimensional acoustic materials in future applications.},

However, practical multiferroics are extremely rare due to lack of mechanism that can simultaneously induce strong ferroelectric (FE) polarization and magneto-electric coupling. Here, we report a multiferroic monolayer Ti 2 S 2 O exhibiting ultra-strong coupling between altermagnetic (AM) and FE orderings based on first-principles calculations combined with tight-binding model analysis. Through biaxial compressive strain, the FE polarization of monolayer Ti 2 S 2 O is enhanced from 0.82 to 1.56 μ C/cm 2 , and the AM splitting is increased from 0.07 to 0.43 eV. Moreover, the tight-binding model is constructed. Accordingly, the observed increase in AM splitting is attributed to enhanced anisotropic second-neighboring hopping between Ti-3 d xy orbitals and the nearest-neighboring hopping between Ti-3 d xy and S-3 p orbitals mediated by strain-tunable FE distortions of non-magnetic O atoms. Our theoretical findings shed light on magneto-electric phenomena and the development of electrically controllable spintronic devices.},

In order to study such dynamics, we performed measurements of quasiparticle transport in a superconductor engineered to enhance quasiparticle relaxation. We found that a thin, highly disordered normal metal layer can be used to greatly reduce the relaxation time of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire, without significantly affecting the properties of the superconductor. The enhanced relaxation is likely due to an increased electron–electron scattering rate in the disordered normal metal. Our results provide a positive indication that quasiparticle relaxation can be substantially enhanced via a simple and technologically viable method, and demonstrate that direct measurement of quasiparticle imbalance can be a useful tool for the assessment and engineering of superconductors in various applications at mK temperatures.},

Among various factors, the HM/FM interface plays a pivotal role in determining the overall SOT efficiency. In this study, we examined the effect of introducing an ultrathin (∼0.2 nm) dusting layer of various dielectric oxides at the Pt/Co interface on the strength of SOT. Remarkably, the incorporation of TiO x —a high-κ dielectric—at the interface results in an 80%–100% enhancement in damping-like SOT. This significant improvement is attributed to the formation of high-dielectric TiO x islands at the interface, which act as additional scattering centers that facilitate spin current generation. Notably, this enhancement in SOT efficiency was achieved without adversely affecting the system's resistivity. Furthermore, we observed that the SOT efficiency scales with the dielectric constant of the interfacial oxide layer. These findings underscore the vital influence of interfacial dielectric properties in modulating SOT efficiency and present a promising strategy for advancing the performance of spintronic devices.},

In this study, we report rapid chirality domain wall (CDW) motion in Mn 3 Sn, driven by spin-orbit torque at over 545.3 m s −1 under a remarkably low current density of 9 × 10 10 A m −2 . The results demonstrate that the chirality of the domain wall and the direction of the current collectively determine the displacement direction of the CDW. Theoretically, we provide an analysis of the effective field experienced by the octupole moment, uncovering the underlying motion mechanism based on the unique profile of the chiral spin structure. Notably, CDWs with opposite chirality can coexist within the same sample containing the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, where the formation of a Néel-like CDW is governed by the orientation of the kagome plane, rather than by the negligible magnetostatic energy of the small net magnetization. Additionally, the CDW, with a considerable width of 770 nm, is segmented into three 60° portions due to the sixfold anisotropy in Mn 3 Sn. These emphasize that CDW motion in Mn 3 Sn cannot be quantitatively studied using ferromagnetic frameworks. We also demonstrate that a small external field can effectively regulate CDW velocity. Our comprehensive results and theoretical analysis provide crucial guidelines for integrating antiferromagnet CDWs into functional spintronic devices.},

PMA is unveiled below the transition temperature from paramagnetic to collinear ferrimagnetic phase. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) from V 3 + e g π orbitals dominates the PMA in the films.

When the films subjected to larger compressive stress (on Al 2 O 3 or LaAlO 3 substrate), the increased energy-level splitting makes the PMA weaken.

  abstract     = {As the size of transistors in electronic devices continues to shrink and power density increases, the effective thermal management has become essential. The interfacial thermal resistance now represents a key bottleneck in further miniaturizing and powering high-performance electronic products. In this study, we used the differential 3 ω method to investigate the effects of different metal interlayers on the interfacial thermal conductance of the Cr 0.22 Ni 0.78 /Al 2 O 3 interface. Specifically, a Cu interlayer of 17 nm or a Cr interlayer of 5 nm doubled the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) compared to that of the pure Cr 0.22 Ni 0.78 /Al 2 O 3 interface. In contrast, the Au interlayer reduces the ITC of the Cr 0.22 Ni 0.78 /Al 2 O 3 interface. Furthermore, the phonon spectral analysis revealed that the Cu or Cr interlayer acts as a phonon bridge, alleviating the phonon mismatch between the Cr 0.22 Ni 0.78 and Al 2 O 3 layers. This study advances the understanding of the interlayer effects on the ITC of Cr 0.22 Ni 0.78 /Al 2 O 3 interface and provides valuable guidance for improving the ITC between metal and dielectric materials in electronic applications.},

  abstract     = {The three-omega method offers a precise and simple technique for measuring the thermal conductivities of a wide range of materials. Utilizing nonlinear data enhances the determination of multiple thermophysical properties at the micro- and nanoscales. However, challenges such as dependence on initial guesses and convergence to local minima render nonlinear fitting processes unstable. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach that addresses these limitations by pre-learning a globally optimal solution. We developed a methodology that processes three-omega signals using machine learning to determine various thermophysical properties. The approach involved compiling results from the analytical three-omega model and augmenting them with Gaussian noise to create a robust machine learning model. Subsequently, a neural network was trained on this dataset. Testing confirmed the model's accurate predictions of volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Comparative analyses between machine learning-based and conventional fitting methods on the sample data extracted from the test set demonstrated the superior stability of the machine learning model in predicting thermophysical properties. Furthermore, experimental validation was carried out by applying our machine learning model to real-world data from glass and liquid samples. The correspondence between the predicted values and the theoretical curve of the third harmonic voltage affirmed the model's applicability and accuracy in practical scenarios. These findings validate the potential of our machine learning model for robustly predicting thermophysical properties based on actual measured data.},

Using the picosecond-ultrasonics method, we demonstrate that long-lived low-frequency acoustic waves can be optically excited in the delaminated cavities. At the same time, higher-frequency modes above 60 GHz exhibit a surprisingly fast damping, following a scaling law incompatible with the expected attenuation mediated by phonon–phonon scattering. Comparing measurements between delaminated cavities and a benchmark nickel film in contact with the substrate, we link our findings to structural modifications of the nickel crystal induced by the delamination process.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the influences of a graded AlGaN barrier layer on electron mobility in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. By varying the graded layer thickness, we observed a systematic mobility enhancement from 1300 cm 2 /V s (abrupt interface) to 2070 cm 2 /V s at an optimal thickness of 10 nm. Beyond this threshold, mobility decreased due to the transition from two-dimensional electron gas conduction to three-dimensional parallel conduction, as confirmed by capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements. The observed mobility enhancement is attributed to the suppression of Coulomb and alloy scattering facilitated by polarization dilution within the graded layer. Furthermore, fabricated AlGaN/graded barrier/GaN field effect transistors with a source–drain spacing of 20 μ m exhibited a significant reduction in on-resistance, approximately 40% lower than conventional abrupt heterostructures. These findings highlight the potential of graded AlGaN barriers in optimizing carrier transport for next-generation high-electron-mobility transistors.},

  abstract     = {Aluminum nitride is a promising ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for optoelectronics and power electronics. However, its practical applications have been limited by challenges with doping and achieving high electrical conductivity. Recent advances in crystal quality and defect control have led to improvements in experimentally measured mobilities. In this work, we apply first-principles calculations to determine the upper limits of the electron mobility in AlN as a function of temperature, doping, and crystallographic orientation. We account for the combined effects of electron scattering by phonons and ionized impurity to model doped systems and examine both full and partial ionization conditions. Our results show that the piezoelectric interaction from the long-range component of the acoustic modes is the dominant source of electron–phonon scattering at room temperature. Ionized-impurity scattering starts to dominate scattering at dopant concentrations above 10 16 cm −3 , reducing the mobility by more than an order of magnitude in the high doping regime. Our calculated Hall mobility values are in good agreement with experimental data for samples with comparable dopant concentrations. We also find that electron mobilities as high as 956 cm 2 /V·s could be achievable at lower dopant concentrations.},

  abstract     = {As the preferred material for high-performance infrared detection, the device performance of mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) fundamentally depends on the quality of heteroepitaxial films. The longitudinal segregation of Zn composition during CdZnTe ingot growth leads to inhomogeneous lattice constant distribution in sliced substrates. Lattice mismatch between the substrate and HgCdTe epilayer induces strain relaxation and dislocation multiplication, degrading the crystal quality of the epilayer. This study proposes a quantitative lattice-matching technique that achieves controlled lattice mismatch between CdZnTe substrates and target HgCdTe epilayers by designing gradient-varied lattice constant HgCdTe layers. Combined with high-resolution x-ray reciprocal space mapping technique, the lattice relaxation behavior in multilayer heterostructures has been systematically revealed. Experimental results demonstrate that films grown with the lattice-matching technique exhibit no lattice tilt ( ⁠ α = 0 ⁠ ), near-zero in-plane lattice mismatch ( ⁠ m | | ≈ 0 % ⁠ ), and dislocation density within one order of magnitude ( ⁠ 9.66 × 10 4 cm − 2 ⁠ ) compared to the CdZnTe substrate ( ⁠ 6.44 × 10 4 cm − 2 ⁠ ), effectively suppressing dislocation multiplication during epitaxy. In contrast, directly grown HgCdTe films with target composition show lattice tilt ( ⁠ α = 1.1075 ° ⁠ ), residual mismatch ( ⁠ m | | = 0.001 06 % ⁠ ), and a two-order-of-magnitude increase in dislocation density relative to the substrate. The fabricated mid-/long-wavelength dual-color detectors demonstrated superior performance: operable pixel rates reaching 99.8% (mid-wavelength: 3.6 − 5.0 μ m ⁠ ) and 99.7% (long-wavelength: 7.4 − 9.7 μ m ⁠ ), with noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) as low as 14.1 and 22.5 mK, respectively. This research provides key insights for achieving high-crystalline-quality HgCdTe epitaxy.},

To further understand the RS mechanism, MoTe 2 nanosheets with more Te vacancies are prepared by chemical vapor deposition method and exhibit digital RS behaviors, confirming the RS mechanism is dominated by Te vacancies. Furthermore, memristors with analog RS behavior are especially suitable for artificial synapses with diverse synaptic functions. The achieved 150 sets of long-term potentiation and long-term depression are employed to implement handwritten digit image recognition with a recognition accuracy as high as 93.8%. Moreover, decimal arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be well implemented by utilizing the good synaptic functions.

We analyzed traps near the valence band using multi-wavelength light that extended up to the above bandgap, in conjunction with dark-state measured data. Using multi-wavelength light, we extracted traps dependent on the gate voltage. Traps with underestimated density due to limited detectability within the bandgap, dependent on the energy levels of the wavelengths, are filled with photons to extract the captured traps (holes). Our results reveal that the energy-dependent density peaks of V Cu and V O , which strongly influence the p-type conduction mechanism, were observed in the trap density near the Fermi level using multiwavelength I–V photo-response. This study reports photo-responsive I–V measurements in aggressively scaled devices, crucial for instability and reliability assessments.

  abstract     = {The precise control of acceptor doping concentrations in epilayers is critical for fabricating key β -Ga 2 O 3 -based power electronic structures, including current-blocking layers, p -type epilayers, and drift layers. Unintentional nitrogen (N) compensating dopants introduced by N 2 O (a common oxygen precursor) during β -Ga 2 O 3 metalorganic chemical vapor deposition growth significantly affects electrical properties. This study demonstrates that N concentration in epilayers is largely determined by growth temperature and surface adsorption efficiency. As the epitaxial temperature increases, the N doping concentration in the epilayer decreases. When the epitaxial temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the efficiency of N adsorption on β -Ga 2 O 3 surfaces is influenced by both epitaxial parameters and substrate orientation. Modifying epitaxial parameters, especially by increasing chamber pressure, enhances the N concentration in β -Ga 2 O 3 epilayers. Stronger N adsorption occurs on the (100)-plane compared to the (001)-plane epilayer; however, the (001)-plane epilayer allows better N concentration tuning through adjustments in parameters. First-principles calculations indicate that such observed differences in adsorption efficiency are attributable to variations in adsorption energies specific to each plane, coupled with competitive interactions between nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) atoms during surface reactions.

The layers that received both Ga polishing and XeF 2 treatment showed a reduction in net donor sheet density (N D -N A ), measured by CV, by nearly an order of magnitude (from ∼5 × 10 −12 to ∼5 × 10 −11 cm −2 ). SIMS analysis corroborates this charge reduction with a reduction in the Si sheet concentration at this interface. The results provide an in situ processing method for vertical GaN devices, including regrown p–n junctions, for reducing the concentration of unintentional impurities at regrowth interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Trilayer nickelates are a rich class of materials exhibiting diverse correlated phenomena, including superconductivity, density wave transitions, non-Fermi liquid behavior along with an unusual metal-to-metal transition around T * ∼ 150 K. Understanding the electronic correlations as well as lattice and charge dynamics is crucial to unravel the origin of superconductivity and other instabilities in nickelates. Our in-depth Raman measurements show that trilayer nickelate, La 4 Ni 3 O 10 , shows transition from electron–phonon coupled phase to the electron–electron correlated one below charge density wave transition around T * with an estimated energy gap ( ⁠ Δ ⁠ ) of ∼18–20 meV. The transition around T * is also accompanied by the emergence of zone-folded phonon modes reflecting the transition into a charge density wave phase. Phonon modes self-energy parameters show anomalous changes around T * attributed to the electron–electron correlations, and the renormalization rate of the phonon is much slower in the charge-ordered phase compared to the phase above T * . The transition around T * is marked by a suppression of the electron–phonon coupling parameter by ∼70%, a change in the quasiparticle dynamics from non-Fermi liquid to the Landau–Fermi liquid-type behavior estimated using the low-frequency ( ⁠ ω → 0 ⁠ ) Raman response.},

A weakened residual diamond-cubic (dc) diffraction peak together with dominant β-Sn peaks was present at 15.2 GPa. Upon depressurization, a metastable rhombohedral r8 phase appeared at 8.4 GPa. When depressurized to ambient pressure, the XRD profile showed an almost body-centered-cubic bc8 phase with residual weak r8 and dc diffraction peaks. No appreciable Raman peaks were observed upon depressurization down to 4.1 GPa, but weak peaks appeared at ∼283 and ∼396 cm −1 at ambient pressure. Theoretical calculations based on density functional perturbation theory indicated that the observed peaks were not related to bc8 but rather to hexagonal diamond (hd).

  abstract     = {The flatband states, especially flatband quasi-bound states in the continuum (BIC) in periodic graphene nanostructures, are investigated. For a resonant plasmonic waveguide grating consisting of monolayer graphene and a binary dielectric grating with strong modulation, two types of resonant waveguide modes at the second stop band, characterized by a nearly flatband within the entire radiation continuum, are observed. One mode exhibits a high leakage rate, while the other features a low leakage rate and evolves into a symmetry-protected BIC at the band edge. A modified semianalytical Kazarinov–Henry model is developed to elucidate the underlying physics, which provides an excellent explanation of the results and can be applied to any plasmonic waveguide grating system. The model demonstrates that the flatband characteristic arises from strong, wavevector-independent coupling between eigenplasmons propagating in opposite directions. Through the strong interaction between the waveguide mode and a nearby dipolar plasmon on a graphene nanoribbon array, a flatband quasi-Friedrich–Wintgen BIC can be generated. Tuning the structural parameters enables the merging of these two types of BICs. This study holds potential applications in nanophotonics and low-intensity nonlinear optics, such as BIC-based nanophotonic devices exhibiting both tunability and ultra-wide-angle performances.},

By directing the probe beam near its Brewster angle, the terahertz (THz)-induced ellipticity is amplified while the strong probe background is suppressed prior to balanced detection. This reflection geometry eliminates the birefringence and scattering noises associated with window transmission in previously reported configurations. Using GaP as the EO medium, we achieve a tenfold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reaching the fundamental polarization noise and enabling 0.1 V/m sensitivity (1 s acquisition) over a 4.5 THz bandwidth. Our theoretical analysis extracts key polarization noise parameters and provides explicit criteria for optimizing SNR. This approach is readily extendable to other polarization-sensitive ultrafast measurements.},

At low currents, we could directly measure the reduced emission from the sidewall of 80 μ m diameter circular LEDs by inserting an SiN interlayer. This points to a reduced lateral diffusion of carriers in the QWs via an enhanced composition fluctuation indicated by the broadening of x-ray diffraction satellite peaks in addition to the formation of V-defects. Thus, the SiN interlayer increases the carrier localization in the QWs, which increases the EQE of LEDs due to fewer carriers reaching the sidewall as well as dislocations and point defects.

  abstract     = {This paper reports electromagnetically transduced multistable non-linear vibrational energy harvesters to exploit the combined dynamical effects of monostable and bistable non-linear potential energies in a single system, by utilizing the stretching of specially designed cascaded tapered spring topology along with repulsive magnetic levitation. Using comprehensive (analytical and numerical) simulations and experimental validations, we reveal the signature of coupling and its key characteristics present in multimodal non-linear wideband energy harvesters. Here, a dynamical root-tracking technique is employed to trace stable, unstable, and hidden solution branches systematically, which enables predictive configuring of physical experimental parameters to realize previously inaccessible high response dynamical regimes along with a higher normalized power integral density metric. Thus, by tuning the powerful interplay between the numerical continuation framework and available physical parameters, we offer a robust technique for optimizing design and output performances in all such types of energy harvesting systems (independent of the scale and transduction) for their enhanced figure of merit.},

  abstract     = {Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in open air usually operates in a filamentary mode, which limits the widespread application of DBD technology in the industrial field. In this Letter, a large-scale homogeneous DBD is obtained by using a wire mesh electrode in open air with a relatively high argon flow velocity. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is covered on a quartz plate, and they work together as dielectric materials. There is only one wide pulse of optical signal in each half voltage cycle for the homogeneous discharge. Fast photography reveals that the discharge is uniformly distributed over the entire electrode surface during the discharge period. When argon flow velocity is relatively low, the discharge is filamentous. There are multiple narrow optical signal pulses in each half voltage cycle for the filamentary discharge. Optical emission spectroscopy indicates that electron density ( n e ), electron temperature ( T e ), molecular vibrational temperature ( T vib ), and gas temperature ( T g ) decline in both homogeneous discharge and filamentary discharge with increasing argon flow velocity. Polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene dielectrics behave similar to PET for generating homogeneous discharge, which is of great significance for the uniform surface treatment of various materials.},

However, it is essential to achieve high-brightness silicon vacancy color-center ensembles by different irradiations for efficient signal detection and high-fidelity quantum sensing. In this work, we conducted irradiation experiments of MeV electrons, protons, and laser-driven ions to investigate the influence of irradiation parameters on the fabrication of V Si − center ensembles, confirming the vital roles of crystal damage densities in the production yield of V Si − centers. Furthermore, the hot irradiation experiments reveal that irradiation at optimized temperatures can enhance the production yield of V Si − centers and break the inherent limitation of radiation-induced crystal damage, achieving higher-brightness ensembles. 1 MeV proton irradiation with 10 13 cm −2 at 200 °C could achieve a 2–3 times stronger photoluminescence intensity enhancement than that at room-temperature irradiation. We established a controllable fabrication methodology for engineering the brightness of color-center ensembles through precise tuning of irradiation conditions, which paves the foundation for fabricating high-quality V Si − color-center ensembles and other color-center systems in wide-bandgap semiconductor materials.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Zn–I 2 batteries (AZIBs) possess great potential in future energy storage systems while facing severe restriction by the unstable Zn anode and uncontrollable shuttling of polyiodides during cycling. Herein, we propose a multi-functional amino acid, proline (Pro), in the traditional aqueous electrolyte to regulate the overall ion behaviors in both bulk electrolyte and electrode interfaces, thereby enhancing the comprehensive performance of the AZIBs. This amino acid with strong polarity can disrupt the hydrogen bonds among water networks and impair the electrostatic coupling of Zn 2+ –SO 4 2− . Besides, it can simultaneously regulate the interfacial ion behaviors on both the Zn anode and I 2 cathode, thus inhibiting various side reactions and the polyiodide shuttle effect, respectively. As a result, the stability and lifetimes of ZnǁZn symmetric batteries and ZnǁCu asymmetric batteries are significantly improved. Meanwhile, in practical ZnǁI 2 full cells, the introduction of Pro can extend the lifetime from 68 to 150 cycles at a high I 2 loading of 13 mg cm −2 and improve the capacity retention from 38.6% to 64.0% after 6800 cycles at a common I 2 loading of 1.6 mg cm −2 . This demonstrates the significant potential of this multi-functional additive in the future development of practical AZIBs.},

  abstract     = {Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a promising technique for evaluating the elasticity of ocular tissues. However, quantifying the mechanical properties of the crystalline lens remains challenging due to the difficulty of imaging the transparent structure with optical coherence tomography (OCT). We propose an OCE approach that assesses lens elasticity using acoustic radiation force (ARF) excitation. By focusing the ARF at varying depths within the lens, shear waves are generated and subsequently detected at the lens surface using OCT. The propagation velocity of the shear waves is then used to calculate the local shear modulus and quantify the Young's modulus of the lens. Experiments conducted on porcine lenses demonstrate that the Young's modulus varies spatially within the lens and differs between normal and cataractous lenses. This noninvasive method enables quantitative elasticity mapping within the crystalline lens, offering potential for improved diagnosis and treatment for lens-related ocular diseases.},

  abstract     = {Numerical models evaluating macroscopic pulsed electric field (PEF) efficacy typically neglect multicellular heterogeneity and assume homogeneous absorbed energy to reduce computational costs. In this Letter, through theoretical analyses from maximum information entropy methods and finite-element simulations of a realistic millimeter-scale monolayer (1393 cells in a 1 mm 2 square target), we demonstrate that cellular absorbed energy universally follows a gamma distribution in response to a single pulse, remaining invariant across pulsed types, cell types, and observation scales. We propose a dimensionless heterogeneity metric h (0–1) derived from gamma distribution, to quantify local fluctuations of absorbed energy. Results show h exhibits a hyperbolic tangent dependence on the pulsed width, independent of the field strength. In vitro experiments confirm that the dimensionless h also critically governs PEF efficacy: Reduced h exponentially enhances the response rate of high-dose phase in the survival curves. Real-time fluorescence damage kinetics (169 cells) further validate the gamma-distributed energy pattern. This work uncovers spatial heterogeneity as an essential predictor for PEF efficacy, which advances the resolution setting of theoretical models for PEF efficacy prediction.},

We observed an inverse correlation between the 732 cm −1 (adenine) and 765 cm −1 (phosphate backbone) band areas upon hybridization. Mainly, after hybridization, the 732 cm −1 band area decreases. This is attributed to dsDNA shortening and reorientation, placing it in a weaker electromagnetic field and exposing the SERS-active phosphate backbone. This correlation diminishes with shorter DNA strands (15 bases) and disappears for 10-base strands, due to their increased distance from the SERS “hot-spot.” These findings demonstrate SERS's potential for determining DNA strand structure and orientation within SERS hot-spots.},

In this Letter, a thin epitaxial AlN buffer layer (200 nm) is proposed to replace the conventional GaN buffer and III-nitride (III-N) transition layer in GaN device epilayers grown on Si. GaN HEMTs with a gate length of 190 nm were fabricated. Compared to conventional GaN HEMTs on Si with thick GaN buffer/III-N transition layers, the proposed device featuring a thin AlN buffer shows a negligible kink effect in the dc output characteristics. The current collapse characterized by pulsed dc measurement is also significantly suppressed. The breakdown voltage is improved from 70 to 106 V. Infrared surface temperature measurements reveal that the thermal resistance of the thin AlN buffer device was 14.9% lower than that of the thick GaN buffer device. Additionally, a higher ratio of maximum oscillation frequency ( f max ) to cutoff frequency ( f T ) indicates an enhanced output impedance. These results highlight the potential of the proposed GaN HEMTs with a thin AlN buffer for high-performance RF applications.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we demonstrate an enhanced switching speed of 589 ns and a superior double remanent polarization of 40.38 μ C/cm 2 under a low operating voltage of 2.0 V in the ferroelectric HZO/ZrO 2 /HZO stack compatible with the back-end of line process. This enhancement in ferroelectricity and switching speed is attributed to an improved fraction of FE phases and reduced domain pinning caused by the decreased oxygen vacancy in the HZO/ZrO 2 /HZO stack. The thermal instability of conventional HZO is evident in the dramatic slowdown of switching time from 2.6 to 21 μ s and the pronounced domain pinning due to the oxygen vacancy aggregation as the temperature rises from 40 to 240 °C. Conversely, the HZO/ZrO 2 /HZO stack exhibits a switching time distribution ranging from 0.32 to 1.78 μ s. Moreover, a wakeup ratio as low as ∼11.4% after cycling at 240 °C for 10 5 cycles under 2.0 V/500 kHz was achieved in the capacitor with the HZO/ZrO 2 /HZO stack film, outperforming the capacitor with conventional HZO at the same temperature. This improvement could be caused by the enhanced phase structure and suppressed oxygen vacancy generation. These findings offer a promising approach to improving the ferroelectricity and switching speed under a low operating voltage for applications in the back-end of line compatible nonvolatile memories.},

  abstract     = {Charge dynamics plays a fundamental and critical role in the performance of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). While extensive research has been conducted on charge dynamics in CdSe-based QLEDs, the influence of charge behavior on multinary Cu-In-Zn-S (CIZS) quantum dots (QDs) remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that hole transport in CIZS QD films is more efficient than electron transport. Notably, a fraction of the injected holes is trapped within the QDs even after the driving voltage is removed, leading to significant degradation in device efficiency. By incorporating an n-type small molecule hole-blocking layer at the interface between the QDs and the hole transport layer, we mitigated hole injection, resulting in a substantial improvement in QLED efficiency (from 5.5 to 6.5 cd/A). Our findings underscore the importance of a thorough understanding of charge dynamics within the QD emission layer for optimizing device design.},

  abstract     = {The weak interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interactions in two-dimensional layered materials allow the layer degrees of freedom to be used as a quantum index and couple with the charge or spin of electrons, leading to quantum layertronics. In our work, we investigate the layer-coupled topological properties in RuClX (X = F, Br) bilayers through strain-engineering and interlayer interactions. Multiple stacking patterns could be achieved by interlayer sliding and stacking orders with different interfaces. By the first-principles calculations, two stacking patterns from RuClF and RuClBr bilayers could be confirmed to be stable by the interlayer antiferromagnetic order. Our results reveal that the interlayer interactions in RuClF bilayers are much stronger than that in RuClBr bilayers, which indicates RuClX bilayers could behave as a promising platform to engineering the edge states. In the RuClBr bilayer, the negligible hybridization between the states from top and bottom layer results in the strain-induced quantum layer-spin-Hall effect (QLSHE) with quantized spin Hall conductivity and two opposite propagating chiral edge states coupled with each layer. However, in the RuClF bilayer, the unnegligible interlayer hybridization will induce the quantum anomalous Hall effect with one chiral edge state. By the tensile strain effect, a hybrid QLSHE will be emerged as the band inversion appeared in the Janus RuClF bilayer. Our work demonstrates that magnetic vdW layered materials could exhibit rich physical properties, which promise future applications in quantum layertronics.},

The FTJ in the W/ZrO 2 /HZO/Pt structure delivers giant tunnel electroresistance ratios of up to 5.6 × 10 6 , in attribution to the robust polarization of ultrathin FE and the formation of a WO x interfacial layer. Under 10 ns single-pulse programming, FTJ is capable of multiple distinct stable resistance states and can survive up to 4.3 × 10 6 bipolar switching cycles with a large memory window of over 3000.

  abstract     = {The coexistence and tunability of ferroic orders in two-dimensional materials hold great promise for next-generation spintronic and memory devices. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the interplay of chemical substitution and strain engineering enables controlled phase transitions among ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, half-metallic, and ferroelectric states in a two-dimensional bimetallic oxyhalide monolayer NbMnO 2 Cl 4 . The pristine NbMnO 2 Cl 4 monolayer exhibits intrinsic half-metallic ferromagnetism, with a Curie temperature of 285 K and magnetic anisotropy energy of 225 μ eV per Mn atom. The compressive biaxial strain triggers a sequential transition from half-metallic ferromagnetism to ferroelectric–ferromagnetic and subsequently to ferroelectric–antiferromagnetic states. Conversely, tensile biaxial strain drives a direct transition from half-metallic ferromagnetism to a ferroelectric–antiferromagnetic phase. Spin–lattice coupling plays a crucial role in these phase transitions. Moreover, the Curie temperature increases to 540 K at a tensile strain of 6%, and the magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 670 μ eV per Mn atom at a compressive strain of −8%. These findings offer an approach for tailoring multiple ferroic orders in two-dimensional materials through the synergistic effects of chemical doping and mechanical strain.},

In this study, we propose a method to introduce built-in strain into nano-thin films deposited on flexible substrates. By mechanically stretching the substrate during film deposition, a uniaxial compressive built-in strain is induced into the film upon release of the strain. We applied this technique to tailor the magnetic anisotropy of Co and Ni thin films. Systematic modulation of in-plane magnetic anisotropy was observed as a function of the magnitude of the built-in strain. Furthermore, we fabricated a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) device with orthogonally aligned magnetizations in the pinned and free layers. The device exhibited a linear resistance response to external magnetic fields—a characteristic feature of GMR devices with orthogonal magnetization configurations. The proposed method is simple yet versatile for strain engineering, offering a promising route not only for enhancing spintronic device performance but also for exploring strain-induced physical phenomena in functional materials.},

We demonstrate a magnon propagation length of 6.8 μ m in 50-nm-thick samples at 2 K, exceeding most previously reported values in antiferromagnets. Temperature-dependent studies reveal a threefold reduction in magnon diffusion length from 6.8 μ m (2 K) to 1.6 μ m (20 K) at elevated temperature, which is attributed to enhanced magnon–phonon scattering. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal a monotonically increasing diffusion length as film thickness increases, which suggests that surface scattering may significantly suppress magnon propagation in thin samples. These observations improve our understanding of magnon transport in vdW antiferromagnets and establish CrPS 4 as a promising platform for future magnonics.},

Practical implementations explored include a QTRNG-based mosaic masking technique, demonstrating superior visual obfuscation with high Shannon entropy (∼6.88 bits) and convolutional neural networks initialized with QTRNG-derived kernels. This work demonstrates the potential of FePt-based QTRNG systems for reliable multilevel random number generation, establishing a foundation for their integration into advanced spintronic solutions for information security and future deployment in fully spintronic neuromorphic hardware systems.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the magnetic transitions in van der Waals (vdW) magnets is crucial for their applications in future spintronic devices. While several vdW magnets such as CrI 3 and MnBi 2 Te 4 have been extensively studied, the spin reorientation process in CrPS 4 under a magnetic field remains unclear. We report here the magnetic transitions of multilayer CrPS 4 under both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields as revealed by tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) measurements. Theoretical calculations based on a linear-chain model combined with experimental data reveal a layer-dependent spin reorientation process. Accompanying the spin reorientation, anomalous kinks appear in the TMR curves, which could be attributed to the spin geometric phase induced interference effect. Our results shed critical light on the magnetic transitions of antiferromagnetic vdW materials, thereby advancing our mechanistic understanding of their behavior.},

  abstract     = {The strong coupling between photons and magnons, enhanced by an electromagnetic cavity, has garnered significant attention, particularly in the frequency range of terahertz (THz). The hybrid nature of the coupled states provides an ideal platform for developing ever faster and less dissipative information processing. Hereby, we employed THz time-domain spectroscopy to study the vacuum cavity–magnon coupling phenomenon based on Gd 0.5 Ho 0.5 FeO 3 single crystal. The high quality crystal itself acts as a Fabry–Pérot cavity, enabling strong coupling between cavity and magnon modes by carefully tuning magnon modes of the crystal. By altering the external magnetic field and temperature, the magnon frequencies can be tuned accordingly, and distinct anticrossing behaviors between the cavity and magnon modes have been demonstrated. The pronounced vacuum Rabi splitting, exceeding the linewidth of the polariton branches, further confirms the presence of strong light–matter interaction. These findings demonstrate that the coupling strength can be effectively controlled by dynamically tuning the magnetic field and temperature, thereby enabling the exploration of cavity–magnon interactions in the THz frequency. This study provides insights into the photon–magnon coupling mechanisms in rare-earth orthoferrites and lays the foundation for developing devices with advanced magneto-optical properties and cavity-based spintronic applications.},

Density-functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function (DFT-NEGF) transport calculations have been employed to calculate the transmission spectra, electron distributions, and current–voltage characteristics. To further understand the underlying spin transport mechanisms, we develop a semiempirical tight-binding model integrated with NEGF theory and a mean-field Hubbard model. Our DFT-NEGF calculations indicate that the weak CAC-lead coupling, odd-numbered CAC as well as CAC doping with atoms such as oxygen, boron, or sulfur enhance the spin-filtering effect. In addition, the spin-filtering performance is also found to be affected by the bias voltage. These findings highlight the metal–lead–CAC systems as promising candidates for spintronic devices, with the ability to engineer their spin transport properties through precise control of their structural and magnetic configurations.},

Herein, we present a vertical asymmetric Schottky contact Au/WSe 2 /1T'-MoTe 2 heterojunction, which exhibits broadband photodetection and near-infrared optoelectronic synaptic plasticity. The heterojunction enables broadband self-powered photodetection spanning from 405 to 1550 nm.

By tuning the power, pulse width, and pulse number of the input light stimulation, the bias-tunable heterojunction can simulate synaptic plasticity behaviors, including paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), paired-pulse depression, short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, and learning-experience behavior, under 1064 and 1550 nm light illumination.

O 2 plasma treatment induces the formation of an ultrathin (∼2 nm) oxide interlayer at the metal–semiconductor interface, which serves dual roles. It prevents direct metal–GaN interaction and reconstructs surface states through oxygen passivation. This dual functionality significantly mitigates Fermi-level pinning and reduces the effective Schottky barrier height. These interfacial modifications yield a remarkably low specific contact resistivity ( ρ c ) of 3.84 × 10 −6 Ω cm 2 , as measured by the multi-ring circular transmission line model. This plasma-based strategy establishes a scalable approach for high-performance Ohmic contacts in GaN devices.},

The fabricated HEMTs exhibit a high threshold voltage of 1.67 V, attributed to the additional negative polarization bound charges at the BaTiO 3 /AlGaN interface and the resulting expansion of depletion width under negative gate bias. A relatively large saturation output current of 374 mA/mm is also achieved thanks to the additional positive polarization bound charges and the resulting enhancement of channel electron concentration under positive gate bias. Further, the extremely high dielectric constant of BaTiO 3 and the corresponding capacitive coupling effect enable a notable improvement in channel controllability, achieving a high maximum transconductance of 108.7 mS/mm and a small subthreshold swing of 69.6 mV/dec. The proposed BaTiO 3 -MOS-HEMTs with fine post-etch treatments also exhibit low gate leakage, a competitive breakdown field of 1.4 MV/cm, and a high Baliga's figure-of-merit of 1.05 GW/cm 2 .

In this work, the spatial distribution was built to explore the formation mechanism of nanopipes in β -Ga 2 O 3 substrates. Contrary to previous reports, suggesting that nanopipes orientation aligns with the growth direction, the nanopipes were found independent of growth method and growth direction. Additionally, the evolution of nanopipe etch pit morphology was observed. Under alkaline etching conditions, nanopipe etch pits exhibit four exposed surfaces. Atomic structure analysis reveals that the center of the nanopipes is located in a three-dimensional space without chemical bonds, extending along the [010] direction. During crystal growth, bubbles trapped at the solid-liquid interface preferentially occupy this three-dimensional space, disrupting the surrounding lattice integrity. The synergistic effect between the [010]-elongated geometry of this space and the growth rate anisotropy of β -Ga 2 O 3 drives the formation of [010]-oriented nanopipes. Furthermore, nanopipe-dense regions in (010) cross sections of the bulk crystal induce X-ray rocking curve broadening, with their morphological characteristics exhibiting axial position-dependent variations. This study suggests that vertical devices on the (010) plane may exhibit leakage risks and further demonstrates that controlling bubble formation and distribution during crystal growth is the key to suppressing nanopipes defects.},

The incubation time required for crystallization was found to first decrease and then increase with liquid undercooling.

As a result, a mixed solidification microstructure composed of primary Zr 6 Al 2 Ni compound, pseudobinary (Zr 6 Al 2 Ni + Zr 5 Ni 4 Al) eutectic, and amorphous phase was observed at undercoolings beyond 110 K.

Isothermal crystallization kinetics analysis further revealed a progressive increase in activation energy from 225 to 397 kJ mol −1 during crystallization.

Herein, we employ a layer-by-layer (LBL) solution processing approach integrated with solvent-directed crystallization kinetics to govern the donor polymer assembly. Notably, in comparison with chlorobenzene (CB), 2-chlorothiophene (2Cl-Th) can shorten the liquid-to-solid transition window, which can inhibit the over-aggregation of D18 polymer. This retarded aggregation is beneficial for the acceptor infiltration into the buried D18 layer to form more donor–acceptor interfaces, which can facilitate the exciton splitting dynamics. More critically, this kinetically optimized morphology can reduce the trap-state density by 10.8% and prolongs charge carrier lifetime by 44.5%. Indeed, the optimized 2Cl-Th-processed D18/L8-BO LBL devices deliver the performance of 27.6% under 3000 K light emitting diode (LED) illumination (1500 lux), where the CB casted devices yielded a moderate performance value of 23.7%. More crucially, the 2Cl-Th solvent strategy possesses a universality, where D18/ITIC-Th systems can also harvest a performance of 25.7%.},

  abstract     = {Light or electromagnetic waves carry momentum ( ⁠ ℏ k ) in the direction of their propagation, k . This can develop radiation pressure on any object it faces, enabling the ability to optically manipulate that object. It is normally assumed that a light beam with a photon momentum ( ⁠ ℏ k ) will always push an object in the forward propagating direction, regardless of its properties. However, in the case of a pulling force, the object is attracted toward the light source when illuminated by a light beam, changing its natural behavior. Optical force on chiral particles has gained much attention in recent literature. Depending on chirality, right-handed and left-handed chiral particles should show opposite behaviors. In this article, we demonstrate an all-optical setup to exert optical pulling force on both right-handed and left-handed chiral particles simultaneously placed above a complementary metamaterial. Simultaneous pulling of oppositely headed chiral particles can significantly enhance optical manipulation efficiency, enable chirality-sensitive detection, and deepen the understanding of light–matter interactions. Our analytical theory suggests that the formation of both electric and magnetic field dipoles inside the chiral particles causes both kinds of chiral particles to experience a pulling force. There is currently no work in the literature that proposes a method to pull both kinds of chiral particles at the same time in an exact setup. Thus, this article offers a unique way to optically manipulate different kinds of chiral materials.},

  abstract     = {Rapid and precise detection of biomarkers is crucial for timely disease diagnosis. Conventional methods, such as immunohistochemistry and western blotting, lack rapid and quantitative capabilities. This paper presents reflective secondary grating metasurface biochemical sensors in the visible spectral region based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC) mode. The proposed metasurface significantly enhances the resonant field–analyte interaction by incorporating a metallic reflector beneath a dielectric secondary grating. Rather than depending on geometric asymmetry to excite quasi-BIC modes, this design leverages angular variation of the incident TE-polarized light to enable the controlled transition of BIC into quasi-BIC. This angular tuning mechanism allows for precise modulation of the Q-factor and sensing performance within a single uniform structure, circumventing the need for multiple devices with varying asymmetry. This strategy not only enhances fabrication tolerance and operational flexibility but also circumvents the technical challenges of fabricating ultra-small asymmetrical structures. The experimental results indicate that the sensitivity can be finely tuned by varying the incident angle, achieving values from 255.97 to 574.31 nm/RIU, enabling rapid and precise monitoring of claudin 18.2, an important indicator in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer. The proposed metasurface demonstrates significant potential for developing compact, high-performance biochemical sensors suitable for practical diagnostic applications.},

A recognized limitation of purely data-driven networks is their inability to accurately predict weak field regions, which can even produce negative spectrum correlations. Incorporating Maxwell loss ensures accurate weak field predictions for absorptive materials. Additionally, this constraint allows effective weak supervision, reducing labeled points needed to just 12.5% of the total field points.

  abstract     = {3R-phase molybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS 2 ) multilayers are emerging as a compelling platform for nonlinear nanophotonics, owing to their high refractive index, intrinsically broken inversion symmetry, low optical losses, and large second-order susceptibility. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient and chirality-sensitive second-harmonic generation (SHG) in 3R-MoS 2 metasurfaces by coupling them to bound states in the continuum (BICs) characterized by elliptical polarization vortex singularities. We achieve SHG efficiencies approaching 1%—over six orders of magnitude higher than those in unpatterned 3R-MoS 2 multilayers—by leveraging the quasi-BIC with Q-factor exceeding 10 4 under oblique incidence. Remarkably, the quasi-BIC exhibiting near-unity circular dichroism enables a three-orders-of-magnitude difference in SHG efficiency between left- and right-circularly polarized (LCP/RCP) excitation, manifesting a clear signature of photonic spin–dependent nonlinear generation. Intriguingly, the periodic helicity inversion of elliptical polarization states around the momentum-space BIC gives rise to azimuthal-angle-dependent chirality inversion, enabling efficient switching of SHG output between LCP and RCP excitation. Our results not only establish a versatile strategy for tailoring nonlinear optical responses via chirality reversal enabled by topological BICs in van der Waals metasurfaces but also hold promising potential for applications in chiral light sources, nonlinear holography, and optical switching.},

It can be excited with varied polarizations and any angle of incidence, attracting significantly growing attention recently. To date, the majority of TPP structures are constructed with gold or silver. The qualification of aluminum as an alternative material for TPP mode is pending. Here, we show that it is possible to realize comparable characteristics with aluminum (Al)-based TPP structures, in terms of spectral behavior, quality factor ( Q -factor), and electric field enhancement. Experimentally, we demonstrate that Al is qualified for the TPP mode with an exceptionally narrow linewidth (∼17 nm), high Q -factor (∼35.8), and moderate field enhancement (2.38-fold) in the visible band. Moreover, we found that Al-based TPP structures are more tolerant to polarization divergences (with a polarization splitting of only 11 nm at the incidence angle of 50°) compared to noble metal counterparts. This work paves the way toward the usage of Al as a viable and low-cost material for TPP devices beyond noble metals.},

This study demonstrates the heteroepitaxial growth of orthorhombic κ -Ga 2 O 3 on LiNbO 3 , focusing on phase engineering via strain competition between thermal expansion and lattice mismatch. By varying the growth temperature from 510 to 590 °C, the in-plane strain in κ -Ga 2 O 3 was tuned from tensile (+0.16%) to compressive (−0.17%). High-resolution x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy revealed that elevated temperatures induce compressive strain, suppressing the formation of a thick γ -Ga 2 O 3 transition layer and enabling atomically sharp interfaces between the κ - and γ -Ga 2 O 3 . This strain engineering significantly improves film crystallinity, reduces domain twisting disorder, and improves interfacial quality. Atomic-scale analyses via high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed the stacking sequences (A–B–A * –B * ) and the out-of-plane inversion symmetry breaking along κ -Ga 2 O 3 [001], establishing the structural origin of its ferroelectric polarization and laying the groundwork for polarization engineering in future ferroelectric device applications.},

In this study, we report observations of the non-wetting cold Leidenfrost regime of ethanol droplets on a micro-conical structured surface. We demonstrate an improvement in the levitation ability of a combined conical pillar and hole structure compared to a conical structure without pillar-hole topography. The unique topography of the conical pillar-hole structure induces a lower wetting force but a higher non-wetting force, resulting in better non-wetting properties. The increased ratio of the non-wetting force to the wetting force not only allows for the levitation of ethanol droplets but also results in the spontaneous jumping of a millimeter-scale pinned droplet. These findings provide valuable insights into the non-wetting properties of conical structures and contribute to the development of methods for maintaining a non-wetting state at lower temperatures.},

Traditional thermoreflectance transducers are comprised of metal thin-films and exhibit relatively poor temperature sensitivity and limited tunability. The ability to exploit optical resonance in high-index dielectric materials to enhance the thermoreflectance response is promising but remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate quantitative thermometry using a nanophotonic transducer comprised of a single silicon nanodisk. We fabricated the nanodisk from a silicon-on-insulator wafer using electron beam lithography and calibrated its thermoreflectance response with a tightly focused laser beam of 532 nm wavelength. For a 406 nm disk diameter, we achieve a thermoreflectance coefficient of −2.76 × 10 −3 K −1 , which is 10 times higher than what can be achieved with a traditional metal transducer. Supporting calculations reveal that the observed thermoreflectance enhancement is due to the resonant excitation of a magnetic dipole-type mode in the disk. Enabled by the improved thermoreflectance response, we demonstrate a temperature resolution of 153 μ K in a 7.8 mHz bandwidth at room-temperature. Ultimately, improving the temperature- and spatiotemporal-resolution of the thermoreflectance technique could unlock measurements that improve our fundamental understanding of energy transport and conversion in emerging nanomaterials and optoelectronic devices.},

Three absorption channels (ACs) are formed through impedance matching and dielectric loss mechanisms. Leveraging the characteristics of PTCs, the proposed TMNA is capable of operating at any angle, exhibiting complete angle insensitivity. Unlike traditional multi-channel narrowband absorbers in non-time-varying systems, TMNAs offer controllable properties.

  abstract     = {Vector beams have been extensively studied in recent years owing to their versatile polarization distributions. However, it is difficult to generate a vector beam by mapping a real object without an explicit mathematical expression. Herein, we propose a method for generating arbitrary vector beams by combining the epicycle model with the higher-order and hybrid-order Poincaré sphere techniques. Simulation and experimental results show that the method effectively accomplishes the vector beam mapping of objects and polarization modulation. Furthermore, the beam quality is improved, and the degree of “vectorness” is quantitatively characterized. Consequently, arbitrary vector beams with a versatile polarization distribution are obtained. This is an alternative method for generating vector beams, with potential applications in 3D holography, optical manipulation, and material micro/nanoprocessing.},

  abstract     = {Altermagnets have recently emerged as the third class of magnetic materials, sharing properties of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets. Despite very small net magnetization, they show phenomena usually associated with ferromagnetism, such as the Faraday, Kerr, and anomalous Hall effects, resulting from the relativistic spin–orbit coupling, as well as the spin splitting of electron bands and spin Hall effect of non-relativistic origin. Spin space groups and magnetic multipoles are used to explain the symmetry properties of altermagnets. Here, I show that the conventional phenomenological description in terms of a vector antiferromagnetic order parameter can be applied to all effects observed in altermagnets with collinear and non-collinear spin orders. I also discuss non-relativistic effects in non-altermagnets.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen major developments in thermal management approaches for semiconductors and thermoelectric materials, which serve as critical technologies for achieving carbon neutrality. Modern electronic and optoelectronic devices require effective heat dissipation and thermal energy conversion to achieve better performance and maintain reliability and efficiency. In particular, as device dimensions continue to shrink to the nanoscale, conventional bulk thermal transport theories become inadequate, necessitating a deeper understanding of phonon transport mechanisms at interfaces, in nanostructures, and across heterogeneous systems. The field of phonon engineering has emerged through the convergence of several scientific disciplines: Theoretical modeling of phonon heat transport together with nanoscale thermal measurement methods, advanced materials development, and materials informatics approaches have driven the development of phonon engineering. The combination of multiple scientific disciplines has sped up advancements in our knowledge and ability to control thermal transport at micro- and nanoscale levels.},

A concentration-dependent patterning of CFZNCs clusters has been found to nucleate during the Fréedericksz transition on the application of sufficient dc bias across the CFZNCs/5CB samples. Well-ordered two-dimensional patterns were seen for intermediate doping concentrations of CFZNCs (0.05 wt. % and 0.1 wt. %), whereas, intense aggregation was observed at higher concentration (0.2 wt. %). It has been found that the size of the planarly aligned patterned domains (PPDs) varied (from 25 to 6 μ m) on increasing the dc bias across the CFZNCs/5CB composite during the Fréedericksz transitions. Interestingly, the chain-like clusters of CFZNCs appeared on the circumference of the PPDs embedded within the homeotropically aligned 5CB material. The formation of PPDs could be attributed to the LC-anisotropy-imparted ordering of CFZNCs in the vicinity of Fréedericksz transition. We hope that the present work will add to our understanding of LC-imparted self-assembly of NCs/QDs in an anisotropic medium like LCs for facilitating their applications in the fabrication of photonic devices.},

In our experiments, a single-hole spin is initially placed in one of the quantum dots, while the other dot is kept empty. The hole spin rotations are stimulated due to multiple anti-crossing events with empty spin levels of the other dot during the Landau–Zener–Stückelberg–Majorana interference.

Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC, where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable for all excitation energies above resonant excitation. We provide ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC.

Experimental results demonstrated that a differential sensitivity of 300 fT/Hz 1/2 can be realized with a millimeter-scale vapor cell, even in the geomagnetic field range, which is consistent with the theoretical differential Cramér–Rao lower bound. To characterize magnetometer noise sources, in-phase and quadrature resonance curves were recorded using a lock-in amplifier, identifying single-channel photon shot noise of approximately 180 fT/Hz 1/2 as the primary limitation of the device sensitivity.

Here, we show that a multimode coaxial cable can mediate high‐contrast interaction between spatially separated superconducting qubits. Leveraging interference between cable modes, we can implement high-fidelity controlled-Z and ZZ -free iSWAP gates by simply modulating qubit frequencies. Numerical simulations under realistic coherence and coupling parameters predict fidelities above 99% for both gate schemes.

However, modulation of triplet-state emission pathways remains a key challenge. Here, we report pressure-induced emission switching in the Sb-based 0D hybrid perovskite (TPP) 2 SbBr 5 . Under ambient conditions, the material exhibits broadband red emission (∼735 nm) arising from self-trapped excitons (STEs) associated with a low-energy triplet state. Upon increasing pressure to 0.97 GPa, lattice symmetry breaking and enhanced Sb 5s 2 –Br 4p orbital hybridization induce splitting of the triplet state, activating a new high-energy emission band at 638 nm. Further compression beyond 3.0 GPa completely suppresses the low-energy channel, resulting in dominant recombination via the high-energy STE channel. A combination of in situ photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and femtosecond transient absorption reveals that exciton localization, orbital coupling, and lattice distortion collectively govern the emission channel transition. Our findings establish a pressure-responsive triplet-state reconfiguration mechanism in 0D perovskites and offer a strategy for designing stimuli-adaptive optoelectronic materials.},

Herein, we report a dual-modified NVPF cathode material (NC@NVGPF) through simultaneous Ga doping and N-doped carbon coating. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ga doping not only reduces Na-ion migration energy barriers by 19.6% (0.56 → 0.45 eV) but also decreases the bandgap by 40% (2.37 → 1.43 eV), significantly enhancing ionic and electronic transport properties. Structural characterization confirms Ga doping stabilizes the NVPF framework by strengthening V–F bonds (1.89 → 1.62 Å), effectively suppressing fluorine loss and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 phase formation. Electrochemically, NC@NVGPF delivers 125.5 mAh g −1 at 0.2C and 90.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C. When assembled into a full cell coupled with commercialized hard carbon, it achieves a reversible capacity of 105.5 mAh g −1 with 92.9% capacity retention over 100 cycles at 1C.

  abstract     = {Layered transition metal oxides, owing to the presence of anion redox reactions (ARRs), are promising candidates for high-energy-density cathodes. However, ARR often leads to irreversible lattice degradation and a decline in electrochemical stability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that doping with non-electrochemically active metals (such as Zn, Ti, Mg, etc.) can enable reversible ARR, the phenomenon of a sloping charge “plateau” in the modified materials when charged to high voltages has been overlooked. This work investigates the effect of Mg doping on the oxygen redox reaction in sodium-ion manganese-based layered oxide cathodes. By gradient doping Mg into Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 , we find that Mg doping suppresses ARR. Experimental and density functional theory analyses reveal that Mg forms strong covalent bonds with oxygen, localizing the electron distribution and reducing the participation of lattice oxygen in the charge compensation process. This work provides insights into the ARR mechanism in layered oxide cathodes.},

  abstract     = {Plasma-activated water (PAW) shows promise as an alternative antimicrobial agent for disinfection and infection control due to its broad-spectrum bactericidal activity and high biosafety. However, the strong acidity required for its efficacy limits its applicability in pH-sensitive scenarios. This Letter proposes that pre-loading 0.1% H 2 O 2 prior to plasma activation elevates the bactericidal pH threshold of PAW to milder acidic conditions, achieving >99.999% inactivation of S. aureus at pH = 4.0, with a 5-log improvement compared to conventional PAW. Furthermore, PAW pre-loaded with H 2 O 2 contains much higher concentration of ONOO − /ONOOH and O 2 − /HO 2 compared to post-loaded or non-supplemented groups. Mechanistic investigation reveals that reactive species in PAW damage bacterial membrane at low pH (2.0–3.0), which significantly inactivates bacteria, but cannot disrupt membrane at higher pH (4.0) even with pre-loading H 2 O 2 . In contrast, by observing the bubble generation and intracellular ROS levels, it is discovered that reactive species can inhibit catalase to reduce the decomposition of loaded H 2 O 2 , thereby achieving bacterial inactivation through H 2 O 2 -dominated oxidative attack. This Letter proposes a strategy to optimize the adaptability of PAW as an antimicrobial agent for pH-sensitive medical scenarios, offering insights into the roles of acid environments and H 2 O 2 in bacterial inactivation.},

  abstract     = {Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) provides quantifiable polarization parameters, offering enhanced material characterization and biomedical analysis. Speckle noise is an inherent noise in interferometric imaging, which will seriously degrade the imaging quality of PS-OCT. However, current noise reduction methods mainly use spatial averaging, leading to a trade-off between speckle suppression and spatial resolution. In this Letter, we constructed a speckle modulation PS-OCT (SM-PS-OCT) system. The optimization effect of the speckle modulation method on polarization measurements was analyzed by comparing the imaging results of the agar phantom and the chicken tendon. Quantitative evaluation of the mouse brain showed that the measurement precision of polarization parameters (retardation and optic axis) was improved by nearly two times. Mouse brain imaging results showed that SM-PS-OCT was able to distinguish nerve fibers by suppressing speckle noise. In addition, we found that SM-PS-OCT has a high-resolution advantage in calculating the degree of polarization uniformity (DOPU), and the introduction of the speckle modulation method can avoid the need for the spatial window required for calculating DOPU. The imaging results of gold nanorod phantoms demonstrated that SM-PS-OCT can obtain DOPU images with an accuracy comparable to that of the spatial window method without sacrificing imaging resolution. Our work demonstrated that the speckle modulation could provide a robust method for precise and reliable polarization imaging, contributing to the development of high-precision detection tools for various applications.},

  abstract     = {In Parkinson's disease (PD), approximately 60% of the nigrostriatal neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated before neurologists can establish a diagnosis based on widely accepted clinical diagnostic criteria. Therefore, identifying patients at risk and in the earlier stages of the disease is crucial for neuroprotection. This study proposes a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor based on –SH and Au nanoparticles coupled with atomic-level defect-enriched molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) sulfur vacancy bonding for the specific detection of glucose. Utilizing the SERS method, the sensor enables glucose monitoring for PD patients, addressing challenges such as the short effective response distance in SERS detection and the electronic transition difficulties from MoS 2 to the glucose receptor 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid. The sensor achieves a detection limit of 10 −9 M for glucose. Its performance was validated in saliva and urine samples, showing detection errors between 1.91% and 3.77% compared to commercial test kits and glucometers, with highly consistent results. This study lays the foundation for the development of portable, low-cost, and non-invasive glucose monitoring devices, providing research perspectives for the monitoring of other diseases.},

A real-time control method for plasma dose intensity based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. This method ensures the stability of the plasma output dose intensity (Equivalent Total Oxidation Potential: ETOP intensity) while effectively adapting to unknown and time-varying environmental changes. The developed plasma dose intensity controller employs a DRL algorithm to interact with the environment, learning optimal control strategies to automatically adjust the ETOP intensity output of plasma devices under varying conditions. In silico simulations demonstrate that the ETOP intensity controller excels in baseline setpoint tracking and effectively regulates plasma dose intensity even when environmental parameters (e.g., humidity) fluctuate. Additionally, the controller simultaneously adjusts multiple parameters to regulate ETOP intensity, with its control range and disturbance rejection ability significantly improving as the number of controlled parameters increases. This research highlights the importance of automatic control of dose delivery in clinical applications of plasma medical devices, toward advancing plasma therapy from laboratory research to clinical practice.},

Here, first-principles calculations are used to predict that negative μ as measured by the slope of corrugation in the sliding potential-energy barrier subject to an external load can be achieved when bilayer GaInS 3 in commensurate contact slides relatively along the b -direction. Such remarkable observations can be attributed to the competition and alternating dominance of the van der Waals attraction regime and the electronic repulsion regime between the layers caused by variation of interlayer distance during pressurization. In addition, the transfer and redistribution of interlayer charges enhance the S–In and S–Ga ionic bonds of the maximum-energy configuration, further lowering the potential-energy corrugation and causing negative differential friction. This study not only identifies a material exhibiting a negative friction coefficient during relative sliding across multiple configurations but also uncovers the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon. These findings offer fresh theoretical insights and practical possibilities for addressing friction-related challenges.},

Recently, wafer-scale, single-unit-cell height P 62 m W 5 N 6 , which was difficult to be synthesized in the past, has been grown using a restricted vapor–liquid–solid method. Here, we report experimental evidence for hysteretic magnetoresistance (MR) mediated by temperature in paramagnetic W 5 N 6 . Surprisingly, hysteretic MR is weak or even non-existent at millikelvin temperatures where hysteresis is expected to be most pronounced. With increasing temperature, hysteretic behavior becomes the strongest at around 9 K. With further increase in temperature, hysteresis becomes weaker and undetectable at around 26 K. The observed paramagnetism in the Efros–Shklovskii variable range hopping (E–S VRH) regime, where Coulomb interactions are important, provides a paradigm for probing magnetism in 2D TMNs. Importantly, such paramagnetism in TMNs in the E–S VRH regime, which is supported by density functional theory calculations, may find applications in medical imaging, magnetic refrigeration, and magnetic sensing.},

This study demonstrates strain-engineered control of PAHE in Sb 2 Te 3 thin films with thicknesses ranging from 5 to 20 quintuple layers (QLs). Through systematic strain-dependent measurements, we reveal a non-monotonic thickness-mediated response: the PAHE current initially increases then decreases under uniaxial tensile strain across all studied thicknesses. Remarkably, the seven QL sample under 0.18% tensile strain exhibits a record-high photoinduced anomalous Hall conductivity of 1.88 × 10 3 m/( ⁠ Ω · W) under 1064 nm illumination. Comprehensive analysis of strain-dependent sheet resistance ( ⁠ R s ⁠ ), photoconductivity current ( ⁠ I PC ⁠ ) of the Si substrates, and circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) current of the Sb 2 Te 3 films on Si substrates, uncovers a strain-mediated mechanism governed by the synergistic effects of spin injection from Si substrates and strain-modulated spin–orbit coupling strength.

However, the relationship between E b and E QP in 2 D tetragonal crystals is still lacking so far.

Moreover, we have systemically verified the relationship of E b and E QP in different 2 D tetragonal crystals by utilizing G 0 W 0 and Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations, which are in good agreement with the previously theoretical results. Importantly, the exciton lifetime of most KAgSe-like monolayers (up to 1.76 ps) is significantly higher than that of 2 D transition metal sulfides at 0 K, which usually depends on the larger E b ⁠ .

  abstract     = {Cosmic rays and background radioactive decay can deposit significant energy into superconducting quantum circuits on planar chips. This energy converts into pair-breaking phonons that travel across the substrate and generate quasiparticles, leading to correlated energy and phase errors in nearby qubits. To mitigate this, we fabricated two separate dies and placed them adjacently without a galvanic connection between them. This blocks phonon propagation from one die to the other. Using microwave kinetic inductance detectors on both dies, we detected high-energy bursts and demonstrated the blocking effect. However, we also observed simultaneous events in both dies, likely originating from a single cosmic particle traversing both dies.},

The resulting low magnetization and ordering temperature has limited their use in practice but the search for ferromagnetism at room temperature has been ongoing. Here, we show that a strong ferromagnetic response can be obtained at room temperature in the MAX phase Mn 2 GaC by partially substituting Mn by Cr. Polycrystalline (0001) textured (Mn 1− x Cr x ) 2 GaC films are obtained on SiO 2 /Si (001) substrates for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.29 and films with 0.06 ≤ x ≤ 0.29 show a ferromagnetic response at room temperature.

Two-dimensional Van der Waals materials provide an ideal platform to study the effects of curvature on magnetic properties due to their flexibility. In this work, we use noncollinear-spin density functional theory (DFT) to study the magnetic properties of CrSBr as a function of curvature. We found that curvature drives a transition from a cycloidal magnetic state at higher curvatures to the azimuthal magnetization at lower curvatures, stabilized by an effective curvature-induced DMI. To explain this behavior, we apply a continuum model to distinguish the contributions from spin stiffness, anisotropy, and DMI strength, with parameters obtained from the DFT calculations. Our findings not only reveal that the curvature-induced DMI plays a crucial role in shaping the curvature-induced effective anisotropy but also highlight the crucial role of noncollinear-spin DFT in providing an accurate description of flexomagnetic coupling parameters.},

We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump–probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.},

However, beyond initial proposals of its topological nature, the fundamental characteristics of its magnetic ordering remain largely unexplored. Investigating the critical behaviors of a magnet provides deep insight into its underlying spin interactions and universality class. In this work, we synthesized high-quality CrVI 6 single crystals, demonstrating strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy below the Curie temperature (∼58.2 K) via DC magnetization and heat capacity measurements. The critical magnetic behavior in the vicinity of the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition region has been systematically analyzed using multiple approaches, yielding the critical exponents β = 0.294(8), γ = 0.947(9), and δ = 4.21(5). These values do not conform to any single universality class but instead demonstrate a distinct crossover behavior between the three-dimensional Ising and tricritical mean-field models. This crossover is indicative of complex magnetic ordering, characterized by the coexistence of short-range and long-range exchange interactions. Further analysis using renormalization group theory quantifies the decay of the exchange interaction J ( r ) ≈ r − 4.80 ⁠ , confirming the behavior consistent with the crossover model. Our findings establish a comprehensive picture of the fundamental spin correlations in CrVI 6 , highlighting it as a fertile platform for developing future quantum and spintronic applications.},

Therefore, seeking a direct and efficient method to flexibly generate spin currents in a single device, especially fully spin-polarized current (FSPC) and pure spin current (PSC), remains crucial. Inspired by this, we design a spin optoelectronic device based on the half-metal YSi 2 N 4 , and investigate its transport behavior influenced by photogalvanic effects. Remarkably, the YSi 2 N 4 spin device can generate FSPC and PSC under linearly polarized light irradiation with parallel electrode magnetic configuration (PC) or anti-parallel configuration (APC). For the YSi 2 N 4 device in PC, FSPC can be generated at any polarization angle when the photon energy is less than 2.36 eV, fulfilling the spin filtering effect. For the device in APC, PSC can be obtained across an extensive range of photon energy, which acts as an important carrier for spin transport. More interestingly, the magnetoresistance ratio of the YSi 2 N 4 device generally exceeds 90%, demonstrating excellent spin-valve effect. Our work suggests that the monolayer YSi 2 N 4 spin optoelectronic device can generate FSPC and PSC flexibly and efficiently, making it an advanced candidate for multifunctional spin devices.},

The absence of THE in a single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small magnetic nucleation centers. This aligns with the seemingly unresolvable domain structures by the employed techniques during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring the chirality of domain walls through the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) offers promising opportunities for developing spin-based applications. Recent theoretical and experimental progress on interlayer DMI has attracted considerable attention because of its unique role in creating long-range chiral spin textures. Still, little is known about how reversing the chirality of interlayer DMI affects the motion of domain walls. In this work, it is experimentally shown that reversing the chirality of the interlayer DMI reverses the polarity of the asymmetric spin–orbit torque switching. It also reverses the direction of asymmetric domain wall propagation when the current polarity remains the same. The change in switching polarity comes from a reversal in the tilt angle, which is set by the chirality of the interlayer DMI. The shift in domain wall motion reflects a transition from right- to left-handed chirality. It is attributed to the consistent homochiral alignment of the down-to-up domain wall with the interlayer DMI. This ability to deterministically modulate asymmetric domain wall motion through interlayer DMI chirality introduces a powerful design approach for chiral spintronic systems. This control holds great promise for domain wall-based logic and neuromorphic computing architectures.},

Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin–charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS 2 , inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba–Edelstein effect or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS 2 interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in proximitized graphene or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS 2 . SCI due to in-plane spin is characterized over a wide range of temperatures, up to 300 K, and a range of gate voltages.},

While crystalline interlayers are known to enhance thermal conductance, the potential of amorphous interlayers remains underexplored. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we examine how mass distribution in amorphous interlayers affects interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) between Si and Ge. Compared to crystalline interlayers, amorphous ones generally show lower ITC, except under strong vibrational mismatch (e.g., 5 amu mass). This enhanced performance is attributed to the increased phonon density of states overlap and the broadened interfacial mode spectrum induced by amorphous disorder, which collectively facilitate both elastic and inelastic phonon transport. Notably, ITC peaks at 10 amu and exhibits a plateau over a range of masses—distinct from the sharp peaks of crystalline systems. Such plateau behavior can be attributed to a competing interplay between increased elastic contributions and suppressed inelastic transport as the interlayer mass increases. Our findings offer guidance for optimizing ITC in amorphous semiconductor interfaces.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we investigated the noise sources in NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 p–n heterojunctions and demonstrated the field management for noise suppression to enhance radiation detection performance. Combining TCAD simulations and experimental electrical analysis, we identified two primary noise sources, including shot noise originating from carrier density fluctuations and non-uniform carrier drift velocities, and flicker noise associated with localized carrier trapping centers. To mitigate these noise contributions, we developed a large-area (1 × 1 mm 2 ) NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 p–n heterojunction detector incorporating an amorphous high- k dielectric BaTiO 3 layer as the field-plate (FP) structure. By effectively redistributing the electric field, the FP implementation minimizes field crowding at device edges, reduces leakage current, and enhances carrier transport uniformity, thereby leading to significant background noise suppression. Consequently, the detector achieves an improved energy resolution of 4.3% for α -particle detection, surpassing the previously reported Ga 2 O 3 radiation detectors. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of noise mechanisms in β -Ga 2 O 3 devices and demonstrate a robust field-engineering strategy for achieving low-noise and high-energy-resolution radiation detectors.},

However, quantitative measurements of absolute biexciton quantum yields (QYs) have long been limited to extremely weak excitation conditions, which has hindered the study of biexciton dynamics and related applications. Here, we present a significant improvement to the time-resolved photon statistics method for measuring absolute biexciton QY. This improvement takes into account the contribution of biexciton emission to the rate of single-photon events, which enables the method to break the limitation of weak excitation conditions and measure the absolute biexciton QYs of single QDs under high excitation conditions. Using the measured QYs of both charged and neutral biexcitons at high excitation conditions, we can calculate the ratios of the radiative and Auger recombination rates of the two types of biexciton. These ratios are in agreement with the theoretical predictions of the asymmetric band structures of CdSe-based QDs, thereby verifying the accuracy and reliability of the method. Accurate measurement of absolute biexciton QYs under high excitation conditions enables the study of QD biexciton dynamics and applications based on biexcitons.},

Although film stack design is a common method for K eff 2 adjustment, its effectiveness diminishes above 5 GHz, where AlN/AlScN composite films present a promising alternative. In this work, we developed a composite film Mason model specifically for characterizing AlN/AlScN composite film resonators. This model not only accurately predicts K eff 2 across varying thickness ratios but also simulates composite film resonator impedance, establishing a framework for quantitative analysis and filter design. Leveraging this model, we designed and fabricated high-performance composite film BAW resonators and filters. The optimized resonators achieved a center frequency of 5.3 GHz, a Q max of 1277, and an f × K eff 2 × Q max of 815.9 GHz, higher than that of pure AlScN film resonators (Q max = 471, f × K eff 2 × Q max = 275.6 GHz). Furthermore, a BAW filter with a center frequency of 5.3 GHz and a −3 dB bandwidth of 300 MHz was fabricated, exhibiting steep roll-off, high out-of-band rejection, and low insertion loss. These performance improvements originate from the synergistic optimization of K eff 2 and resonator performance enabled by the composite film architecture, conclusively demonstrating its distinct advantages for high-frequency, custom-designed BAW filters.},

All these BF–BCT films demonstrated substantial ferroelectric properties with twice the remnant polarization values (2 P r ) of 155–208 μ C/cm 2 , and enhanced piezoelectric behavior with effective piezoelectric coefficients ( d 33 * ) of 38–52 pm/V.

Through in-depth investigation, we have ruled out the influence of substrate resistivity and finally attributed the enhancement of the anti-Ohmic effect to a decreased ideality factor in the KTaO 3 /NiFe junction.

Crucially, the absence of HDPC when the photocurrent-collecting electrodes are aligned within the laser incidence plane provides rigorous confirmation of the system's C 3 v symmetry, excluding extrinsic symmetry-breaking artifacts. Quantitative analysis of the Rashba-induced effective electric field ( ⁠ α e ⁠ ) reveals distinct temperature dependence: the Pb-doped QW exhibits a positive correlation between the SOC strength and temperature, whereas the undoped QW shows a negative trend. Furthermore, bias-dependent modulation demonstrates superior HDPC tunability in the undoped QW, facilitated by its higher photocarrier concentrations. These findings establish PbTe QWs as a promising platform for opto-spintronic device design.},

  abstract     = {BaTiO 3 (BTO) is a ferroelectric material that has a large Pockels coefficient. Recently, there has been increasing interest in epitaxial BTO films integrated on silicon as a promising material platform for building electro-optic (EO) modulators. For BTO integration on Si, a SrTiO 3 (STO) buffer layer was first deposited on a Si (001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. BTO films were then grown on this STO-buffered Si template via pulsed laser deposition at various oxygen pressures (10–50 mTorr) and substrate temperatures (600–760 °C). We found that the measured electro-optic response of the BTO films is highly dependent on their domain orientations and film thickness. By adjusting the oxygen deposition pressure and substrate temperature, we were able to grow a -oriented BTO films which are a preferred domain structure for EO modulators due to the large Pockels effect in this configuration. An effective Pockels coefficient of up to 432 pm/V was demonstrated in 500 nm thick BTO films in transmission measurements using 1550 nm light, showing the potential of BTO films for use in integrated silicon photonic devices.},

However, device stability still faces significant challenges. In this work, by using a CMOS-compatible process, we fabricate a high-performance memristor based on Pd/Al 0.77 Sc 0.23 N/TiN/Si devices on a silicon substrate. The crystallinity, surface roughness and ferroelectric properties of the epitaxially grown films were optimized by changing the doping ratio through dual-targeted nitrogen reactive magnetron sputtering. The device maintains good stability after 1000 consecutive scans of its I–V curve. The device can achieve switching ratios of about 100 and rectification ratios of 33. In addition, we simulated biological synapses and synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation/inhibition, excitatory postsynaptic current, spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP), and double-pulse facilitation, and realized bidirectional control of conductance. More importantly, we designed a trajectory-based STDP circuit model by leveraging the amplitude characteristic of the device. This model was used to train spiking neural networks for the recognition of four flight markers: forward, landing, left turn, and right turn. Subsequently, the trained neural network was deployed on a drone, validating its effectiveness. This study demonstrates a feasible approach for the hardware implementation of unsupervised spiking neural networks based on AlScN ferroelectric memristors.},

We call these unique knotted structures chiral balls . Moreover, chirality can bring about polarization transformation in electromagnetic waves. As a consequence of their 3D rotational symmetry, we further expect the polarization transformation performance of chiral balls to exhibit ultra-wide angle-independent behavior. Such a remarkable property has not been previously reported on in the literature. As a case study, we investigate the intrinsic electromagnetic scattering properties of a representative conductive chiral ball using characteristic mode analysis and then further verify them by measuring its radiation performance. The result shows that the chiral ball can exhibit an unprecedented extraordinary omnidirectional circularly polarized electromagnetic scattering property. Because of their unique properties, chiral balls are expected to not only have a profound impact on the fields of electromagnetics and optics but also potentially far beyond.},

  abstract     = {Speckle-correlation optical scattering imaging is an emerging technology for imaging through turbid media without requiring prior knowledge of the medium's scattering properties. However, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions remains challenging due to noise corruption in captured speckle patterns originating from both ballistic light interference and diffuse scattering disturbances. While existing denoising methods have demonstrated success in improving reconstruction quality, limitations persist in ideal scattering envelope fitting, system complexity reduction, and the need for extensive training-validation datasets. Herein, a structure-boosted de-scattering reconstruction (SBDR) framework was proposed to address these challenges, which integrates the computational steps into the physical modeling and consists of three modules: unrolled phase retrieval, object structure extraction and generation, and diffusion-based detail recovery. Experimental validation under strong scattering conditions (PSNR < 2.1 dB) demonstrates the framework's robustness in achieving high-fidelity reconstructions and its transferable adaptability to diverse scattering imaging configurations. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art network-based de-scattering methods reveal that SBDR achieves an average improvement of more than 20% in reconstruction fidelity while reducing the required training dataset size by over 96%.},

The technique relies on detecting the polarization fluctuations of a far-off resonant focused probe light passing through the atoms, driven by two coherent Raman lasers connecting adjacent Zeeman spin states. This is an easily implementable scheme with a wide-ranging applicability in detecting cold atoms. Unlike traditional fluorescence and absorption imaging techniques, this approach does not require stochastic photon scattering from trapped atoms, thereby leaving the cold cloud unperturbed. The data can be collected in MHz refresh rate, allowing for near real-time detection. We validated this technique by monitoring the strength of the RDSNS signal by varying the key parameters of the three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) and the cold atom source (two-dimensional MOT). We performed experiments to probe local densities across the cold atom cloud using our technique and compared it with the inverse Abel-transformed density profiles extracted from the fluorescence of a spherically symmetric atomic cloud and found excellent agreement. This detection protocol is particularly advantageous for probing systems that lack inherent symmetry, where the Abel transformation is inapplicable. Moreover, RDSNS imaging is suitable for extracting the dynamical properties of systems in real time.},

  abstract     = {Local resistance imaging can provide information on nm-scale carrier distribution in semiconductor devices. Scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM), an atomic force microscopy-based nm-scale resistance mapping technique, has been developed for carrier delineation in Si microdevices. We report on the development and validation of SSRM on CdTe materials, by testing on molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown CdTe films. The probe/CdTe contact resistance was suppressed sufficiently below sample's spreading resistance by pressing the probe into the sample with ∼mN contact force and applying a large sample/probe forward bias voltage (V s ), which was understood by analyzing current-voltage (I-V) involving a serially connected insulating top layer with underlying spreading resistance. The carrier concentration as deduced from the resistance measurement, using a single mobility value, is consistent with Hall measurement with a standard deviation of 14% based on a set of MBE films with carrier concentrations in the range of 10 15 –10 16 /cm 3 . The doping polarity was readily identified by flipping V s polarity, where the resistance with reverse V s is orders of magnitude larger than forward V s .

  abstract     = {Perovskite photovoltaics (PPV), due to their compatibility with a flexible substrate, low cost, and high indoor performance compared to existing inorganic and organic photovoltaic technologies, are emerging as a potential candidate to power the internet of things (IOT). Dual-cation and mixed halide [FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.62 Br 0.38 ) 3 ] (FACsPbIBr) based wide bandgap perovskite composition's long-term stability and energy bandgap made them ideal for indoor applications. In this work, we have developed the PPV devices using flexible substrate based on FACsPbIBr perovskite composition for indoor application. PPV were also fabricated on rigid substrate as control devices. The flexible and rigid substrate-based PPV devices delivered power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.02 (36.33)% and 18.90 (37.25)%, respectively, under AM1.5G (LED 2700 K, 1000 lux). Remarkably, flexible-PPV devices delivered open-circuit voltage ( ⁠ V O C ) of 1.11 V under indoor light (1000 lux). The study suggests the potential of flexible substrate-wide bandgap perovskite-based PPV for futuristic IOT applications.},

Incorporating STFB resulted in high-quality perovskite films with increased grain sizes and decreased defect densities. Meanwhile, the optimized energy level alignment facilitates carrier extraction and transport, effectively increasing the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ). Ultimately, the STFB-modified devices achieved a 12.22% relative enhancement in power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) compared to the control devices. Additionally, the STFB-modified unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent long-term stability, maintaining 92.01% of the highest PCE after 1440 h.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed rapid Na + transport during the charge–discharge process. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further provided quantitative evidence of reduced charge transfer resistance after F doping. Density functional theory calculations revealed that F doping lowers the crystal formation energy of NMTP, enhancing its structural stability. It also reduces the Na extraction energy and narrows the energy bandgap, facilitating rapid Na+ ion transport for high-rate performance. Projected density of states analysis shows F doping induces new spin-up states in Ti and F below the Fermi level, reducing the bandgap from 1.16 to 0.75 eV, improving electronic conductivity.},

This study employs all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using hybrid CHARMM36/ClayFF force fields to systematically investigate how Zn 3 Al-LDH nanosheets modify Escherichia coli -mimetic membranes. Our results reveal a three-stage interaction process that induces structural reorganization and compaction of the lipid bilayer, manifesting as membrane thickening and a reduced area per lipid. We find that these changes arise from synergistic charge screening and molecular ordering, particularly when the nanosheets are aligned parallel to the membrane. Based on these findings, we propose a dual antimicrobial mechanism that combines mechanical membrane stiffening with oxidative stress induced by Zn 2+ leaching. These insights provide a foundation for engineering LDH-based surfaces with enhanced antibacterial efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The speed of a plasmonic wave in the presence of electron drift in a conductor depends on the wave's propagation direction, with the wave traveling along the drift (“forward wave”) faster than the wave traveling against the drift (“backward wave”). Phenomena related to this plasmonic non-reciprocity—which is relatively more pronounced in two-dimensional conductors than in bulk conductors and could lead to solid-state device applications—have been studied in THz and optical spectral regimes. Here, we demonstrate the plasmonic non-reciprocity at microwave frequencies (10–50 GHz). Concretely, we conduct, at 4 K, a microwave network analysis on a gated GaAs two-dimensional electron gas with electron drift (i.e., DC), directly measuring the forward and backward wave speeds via their propagation phase delays. We resolve, for example, forward and backward wave speeds of 4.26 × 10 − 3 ± 8.97 × 10 − 6 (normalized to the speed of light). Sufficient consistency between the electron drift speed obtained from the microwave measurement and that alternatively estimated by a DC transport theory further confirms the non-reciprocity. We conclude this paper with a discussion on how to enhance the non-reciprocity for real-world applications, where degeneracy pressure would play an important role.},

Utilizing these properties, we connected two Ag/Ti/TaO x /Pt devices in a back-to-back configuration to form a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. Moreover, only a one-step lithography process is required to realize a compact neuron with LIF functions. The electrical tests of the artificial neurons were carried out to verify their ability to execute the LIF function and their adaptability to input signals. This work provides a bifunctional device and a highly compact artificial neuron for neuromorphic computing.},

Different from the widely observed trade-off between negative bias stress stability and mobility, a high In–Ga ratio brings both higher mobility and PBS stability. By increasing the In–Ga ratio from 3:1 to 7:1, the mobility was improved from 16 to 30 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . Simultaneously, the shift of V T H at continuous gate bias V Stress = 4 V for 1500 s was suppressed from 0.8 to 0.33 V. The higher PBS stability in larger In:Ga ratio samples was attributed to the larger energetic offset between the transport band, i.e., E C in InGaO, and the typical defect band E T in SiO X dielectric, which effectively weakens the charge trapping process from the channel to the insulator layer. The assumption was supported by further photoemission characterizations, which showed a clear dependence of energetic position of E C on the In–Ga ratio.},

By doping ambipolar pristine WSe 2 transistors, we have converted them into unipolar p-type transistors with a regular increase in hole concentration by 8.1 × 10 12 cm −2 . More importantly, the doping states in WSe 2 channel have remained unchanged even after 6 months.

The isothermal entropy change Δ S contains dipole entropy change Δ S dip due to dipole alignment and phonon entropy change Δ S ph due to intrinsic structure response. As the temperature increases, the typical ferroelectric material BaTiO 3 undergoes a series of phase transitions from rhombohedral, orthorhombic, and tetragonal ferroelectric phase to cubic paraelectric phase. Moreover, the phase transition mode is the coexistence of displacive and order–disorder type. Prior studies have predominantly focused on the electrocaloric effect in the displacive model. Here, we thoroughly investigate the phonon entropy change Δ S ph and phonon temperature change Δ T ph based on both phase transition models and three ferroelectric phases and evaluate their contribution to the total electrocaloric effect. Our findings reveal that Δ T ph contributes up to 45% of the total electrocaloric effect in the rhombohedral phase, representing the greatest average contribution among the phases. Furthermore, we employ the phonon density of states to elucidate the mechanisms of Δ S ph under external electric fields.

First-principles calculations demonstrate that the Ti 2 Br 2 O monolayer exhibits ideal BAMS behavior under moderate uniaxial strains, featuring excellent structural stability, robust Néel-type antiferromagnetism, and strongly anisotropic spin transport. Remarkably, the unconventional spin Hall effect (noncollinear spin current) arising from its unique anisotropic transport can be realized and well manipulated by combining strain and gate voltage tuning. These findings introduce a class of magnetic semiconductors and highlight Ti 2 Br 2 O as a promising candidate for spin manipulation through mechanical and electrical means.},

  abstract     = {Parametric instabilities of forward volume spin waves pumped by a traveling surface acoustic wave (SAW) were investigated in an unpatterned yttrium iron garnet film under perpendicular magnetic bias. Conservation of momentum of the SAW enables spin wave modes with specific propagation directions to be selectively amplified from the thermal background. Devices with wavevector-selective transducers were fabricated to unambiguously detect spin waves pumped in different directions. Spin wave thickness modes at half the pump frequency were observed at distinct bias field values consistent with theory. Tilting the bias field resulted in lower instability thresholds, with linearly excited non-propagating magnons decaying into degenerate spin waves contributing to the instability in an additional pathway for energy transfer. These results establish traveling acoustic wave pumping as a method for selective excitation of spin wave modes and wavevectors for wave-based signal processing and computing applications.},

In this work, we investigate how the coherent spin precession in the ferromagnetic state of FeRh is influenced by various types of spatial magnetic inhomogeneity, including a deficiency of ferromagnetic ions and two- or three-dimensional mixtures of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases. H + -ion irradiation is widely used to stabilize the FM state of FeRh at room temperature, and our results reveal that it has little effect on the main characteristics of spin precession dynamics. In the coexisting FM–AFM phases, we found that FM resonance is strongly influenced by exchange interactions across the magnetic phase boundaries, resulting in significant changes in the precessional frequency and the damping coefficient. These findings highlight both the robustness and the tunability of spin dynamics using the material design and the magnetic phase control, which can be useful for spintronic applications.},

Recent studies have suggested that ANE can be enhanced by increasing magnetic anisotropy, based on investigations of ferromagnetic alloys such as FePt, FePd, and MnGa, which possess varying degrees of magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, it has been reported that interfacial effects can also significantly influence the ANE. However, these materials differ not only in anisotropy but also in other intrinsic properties, leaving it unclear whether uniaxial magnetic anisotropy alone plays a decisive role in enhancing ANE. To isolate the effect of magnetic anisotropy, we studied MgO/Ta/CoFeB/W thin films, where voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy enables modulation of magnetic anisotropy without altering other material characteristics. Despite a 30% reduction in magnetic anisotropy, we observed less than a 3% change in ANE, indicating a weak correlation. These findings suggest that magnetic anisotropy alone is not a critical factor governing the ANE, and that the ANE remains robust in voltage-tuned devices.},

  abstract     = {Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and nonvolatile memory with great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge devices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical properties, such as the effective anisotropy field ( H k,eff , related to magnetic stability) and damping ( α , a key factor in device energy efficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for designing and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced metrology techniques, time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) stands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing traditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance. However, the full potential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully fledged due to the lack of systematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we address this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for optimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetic anisotropy. While Co 20 Fe 60 B 20 thin films are used for experimental validation, this optimization framework can be readily extended to a variety of materials such as L 1 0 -FePd with easy-axis dispersion. Our work identifies the optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal amplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to H k,eff and α . By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting sensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract magnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization framework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics, paving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine the landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.},

In this work, we show that the magnetization relaxation in asymmetric Permalloy disks evolves along a pitchfork bifurcation, with both bifurcation paths leading to the formation of magnetic vortices with the same chirality. In the bifurcation, one formation path is always chosen under weak in-plane magnetic fields, ultimately determining the final magnetic vortex state. By delaying the in-plane magnetic field, we quantitatively investigate when the final vortex state is determined and find that it is closely associated with the initial conditions rather than the bifurcation point itself.

Here, we report the observation of anomalous SOT switching in CoO/Pt bilayers. We demonstrate that perpendicular magnetic moments at the CoO/Pt interface can be deterministically switched by an applied current, exhibiting an opposite switching polarity compared to Co/Pt. With alloying effects excluded, the tunability of switching polarity via annealing implies that the phenomenon stems from changes in the interfacial Rashba or built-in electric fields.

Subsequently, we break the space inversion symmetry while preserving the mirror symmetry via an electric field or Janus engineering, thereby inducing altermagnetism with the symmetry of i -wave spin-splitting. The computational results suggest that CrCl 3 can be readily tuned to exhibit altermagnetism through an external field in an experiment, thanks to its low strain threshold for magnetic phase transition.

The research focuses on the performance degradation and underlying mechanisms of β -Ga 2 O 3 SBDs under Kr ion irradiation (LET = 37.9 MeV·mg −1 ·cm 2 ). A detailed analysis of the reasons for the changes in device properties before and after irradiation was conducted. After irradiation, the forward turn-on voltage ( V on ) of the β -Ga 2 O 3 SBDs remains stable at approximately 0.78 V, the ideality factor ( n ) increases from 1.59 to 1.68, and the Schottky barrier height ( Φ b ) decreases from 0.83 to 0.80 eV. The forward characteristics of the β -Ga 2 O 3 SBDs exhibit minimal change, while the reverse leakage current rises significantly. Deep-level transient spectroscopy analysis reveals a marked increase in trap concentration at E C -0.50–0.53 eV and E C -0.65–0.693 eV. Moreover, after irradiation, a new energy level trap at E C -0.724 eV emerges with a concentration of 1.42 × 10 15 cm −3 , most likely associated with V Ga and O Ga . Energy band diagram studies further indicate that the increase in reverse leakage is correlated with the elevated trap density. In addition, the annealing experiments were performed to investigate the annealing behavior of Ga 2 O 3 SBD. These results reveal the effects of heavy-ion irradiation on the performance of β -Ga 2 O 3 SBDs and provide a theoretical basis for their subsequent application in harsh radiation environments.},

  abstract     = {High-voltage GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have recently reached the 10 kV milestone; however, prior reports relied on unconventional epitaxial structures—such as multi-channel, Si delta-doping, or unintentional p-GaN doping—which pose challenges in the realization of enhancement-mode (E-mode) gate control. Here, we demonstrate a 10 kV E-mode GaN HEMT with a standard highly doped p-GaN gate. This p-GaN layer also forms a reduced-surface-field (RESURF) structure. By analyzing devices with varying RESURF thickness ( t R ), we identify the key physical mechanism that enables the breakdown voltage ( BV ) upscaling with device length. We find the BV upscaling is only viable when t R is below 21 nm and reaches peak effectiveness at a t R of 17 nm—deviating from predictions based on ideal polarization superjunction theory. This suggests the presence of donor trap states that balance the acceptors in p-GaN. Additionally, the low Mg doping near the p-GaN/AlGaN interface, naturally formed in epitaxial growth, relaxes the precision required for t R control to maintain charge balance. Under the optimal t R , we demonstrate a 10 kV GaN E-mode HEMT with a specific on-resistance ( R ON,SP ) of 69 mΩ cm 2 , which is lower than the R ON,SP of 10 kV SiC MOSFETs. We also test a 5 kV device under prolonged high-temperature reverse bias stress at 3 kV and 150 °C. The device shows minimal parametric shifts, manifesting electrical and thermal reliability of the underlying charge modulation. The findings offer valuable guidance for the design of multi-kilovolt GaN power HEMTs using industry-standard wafers.},

  abstract     = {Silver-bismuth iodide (ABI) ternary semiconductors, such as AgBi 2 I 7 , AgBiI 4 , Ag 2 BiI 5 , and Ag 3 BiI 6 , have emerged as promising lead-free light absorbers for photovoltaic applications due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. Despite recent advances that have improved power conversion efficiencies from ∼1% to over 5%, ABI-based solar cells still show substantial open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) losses of up to ∼1 V, which significantly hinder the device performance. These losses have been experimentally attributed to the non-radiative recombination originating from intrinsic defects, however, theoretical understanding of these defect mechanisms remains limited. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the defect properties of AgBiI 4 . We identify the dominant intrinsic defects as acceptor-like Ag vacancies (V Ag ) and Ag Bi antisites, as well as donor-like Ag interstitials (Ag i ) and Bi Ag antisites. Among these defects, V Ag and Ag Bi are shallow defects, while Ag i and Bi Ag create deep trap states. Our calculations reveal that I-rich synthesis conditions with a carefully balanced Ag/Bi ratio are essential to suppressing the formation of deep defects and mitigating non-radiative recombinations. These insights provide theoretical guidance for defect modulation in ABI compounds and highlight AgBiI 4 as a model system for understanding defect physics in ABI photovoltaic materials.},

  abstract     = {Metacomposites exhibiting ε′ -negative ( ε′ < 0) responses have introduced composite design concepts and processing methods into the field of advanced electromagnetic (EM) devices. However, the percolation theory and its underlying microscopic mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. In this work, a co-continuous phase structure was fabricated by in situ constructing a three-dimensional silver (Ag) network within a magnetic Bi 25 FeO 40 matrix, thereby realizing magnetic/dielectric dual percolation behavior. Magnetic percolation was confirmed by abrupt changes in saturation magnetic induction, coercivity, and remanence with increasing Ag content. Concurrently, during the evolution of the percolation structure, Ag/Bi 25 FeO 40 metacomposites exhibited three distinct dielectric response mechanisms—interface polarization, dielectric resonance, and plasmonic oscillation—reflected in the enhancement of positive permittivity ( ε′ > 0), a resonance peak near 400 MHz, and an ε′ -negative response spanning the 100 MHz–1 GHz range. Using first-principles calculations, we analyzed the differential charge density, density of states, and Fermi level of Ag@Bi 25 FeO 40 heterostructures to elucidate the transition of electric dipole states from static alignment to rotation and finally to collective oscillation. Owing to the effective blocking effect of Bi 25 FeO 40 cuboid building blocks on the Ag network, a broadband weak ε′ -negative response (300 MHz–1 GHz, 0 < | ε′ | < 1000) was achieved. Its inductive characteristics and potential for EM shielding were further clarified through equivalent circuit analysis and EM simulation.},

  abstract     = {The control of electromagnetic waves has garnered significant attention across various scientific and engineering disciplines. While spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) have enabled field confinement and effective wave manipulation at microwave and terahertz frequencies, they suffer from limitations such as high insertion loss, reduced cutoff frequency, and bulky transition structures. To address these challenges, we propose a backward effective spoof surface plasmon polariton (BESSPP) mode, supported by an array of dielectric posts within a parallel-plate waveguide (PPW). The BESSPP mode exhibits characteristics similar to natural SPPs in the optical regime, achieving strong field confinement with an ultra-narrow line depth while maintaining a broad operational bandwidth. Unlike conventional SSPPs, the BESSPP mode allows independent control of lower and upper cutoff frequencies, facilitating the design of flexible bandpass filters. Furthermore, it presents backward wave behavior and eliminates radiation losses even in non-enclosed structures, significantly reducing insertion loss in millimeter-wave applications. The BESSPP mode also removes the need for large transition structures, enabling compact circuit designs. Experimental results confirm the BESSPP spectrum and validate its excitation method, demonstrating its potential for high-speed and high-density integrated circuits.},

High-power microwaves with a power of 495 MW, a pulse width of 61 ns, and a frequency of 1.393 GHz were generated, achieving an efficiency of 25.5%. Measurements of the microwave radiation pattern, spectrum, and neon lamp glow pattern confirmed that the output microwave was predominantly in the TM 01 mode. These results validate the miniaturization potential of the metamaterial structure and the reliability of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for experimental guidance. The stable pulse width and operating frequency demonstrate the stability of the device in mode selection and control. Discrepancies were observed in center frequency and efficiency between simulation and experiment, which may be partly due to differences in the power supply system compared to the ideal input in the PIC simulation. Further experiments and simulation refinements will address these discrepancies.},

This study presents a biomimetic architecture inspired by the hierarchical morphology of mace weapons, featuring silver handles (AgH) decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) separated by precisely tunable nanogaps. The fabrication process leverages atomic layer deposition (ALD) to create nanometer Al 2 O 3 spacer layers, which are subsequently etched to expose high-density nanogaps. This AuNPs-nanogaps-AgH structure exhibits exceptional plasmonic coupling, generating intense electromagnetic hotspots that significantly enhance Raman signals. Theoretical COMSOL simulations confirm that the nanogap regions exhibit enhanced electric fields, with the enhancement increasing as the gap size decreases. Experimental validation using Rhodamine 6G as a probe molecule reveals a detection limit as low as 10 −11 M, with excellent linearity and signal uniformity. The substrate's practical applicability was further demonstrated through the detection of thiram at a concentration as low as 0.02 ppm. Moreover, the AuNPs-nanogaps-AgH can effectively detect 2 ppm thiram in orange, lemon, and grapefruit juices. Compared with traditional fabrication techniques such as focused ion beam or electron beam lithography, ALD not only offers superior precision control but also demonstrates relatively low cost and mass production capabilities. These advantages make ALD a highly promising approach for fabricating nanogap structures, enabling ultrasensitive SERS-based detection in real-world applications.},

We employ a circular transfer length model (c-TLM) and find the room temperature ρ c to be ∼ 4.67 × 10 − 5 Ω cm 2 ⁠ , which is among the lowest reported value for n -UNCD films. High temperature vacuum annealing conducted at 700 and 800 ° C results in an initial improvement, followed by a minor degradation in ρ c values, respectively. The electrical contacts remain highly Ohmic for all measurements. Furthermore, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy analysis suggests formation of conductive titanium carbide layer with no significant inter metallic diffusion. Overall, the electrical contacts demonstrate robust thermal stability, both of which are critical for attaining high-performance nanocrystalline diamond-based electronic devices.},

Results show that band edge lasers and random lasers coexist in a single sample based on dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystals. The emission characteristics of both types of lasers are temperature-dependent. By introducing titanium nitride nanoparticles into the dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystals, the wavelength of the band edge lasers becomes temperature-stable. Meanwhile, the variation in emission intensity of the random lasers is reduced with temperature changes, reflecting the inherent randomness of random lasers. Additionally, the random laser exhibits lower temporal coherence, while the band edge laser shows higher spatial coherence, resulting in distinct imaging characteristics. Random laser imaging is inherently speckle-free but suffers from low image contrast, whereas band edge laser imaging offers high contrast at the cost of severe speckle artifacts. Coupling the two types of lasers reduces the speckle and enhances the image quality. Compared to using band edge lasers and random lasers separately, the combined light source improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 2.29 times and 1.69 times, respectively. This work presents a strategy for stable laser imaging with high contrast and speckle-free performance, offering significant potential for applications in speckle-free imaging, bioimaging, and free-space optical communication.},

Window coatings may be designed to maximize transmitted signal and minimize thermal self-emission noise toward the detector at a given temperature, but the performance of such coatings deteriorates rapidly with increasing temperature. Using a new figure of merit for hot window performance, we assess the effectiveness and limits of window treatments designed to make objects beyond the window clearly observable over a wide range of temperatures. As an illustration, we explore requirements for simple one-dimensional (1D) coating stacks applied to both sides of the window and assess their advantages over an uncoated window operating in the mid-IR range ( ⁠ 2 – 5 μ m). An anti-reflection coating is found to maximize transmission through the object-facing side of the window, while a filter coating is best on the detector-facing side, with the latter offering a much larger performance enhancement. To assess how close practical window coatings can come to achieving the desired behaviors of high transmission, low self-emission noise, and large bandwidth at a given temperature, inverse design techniques are applied to optimize 1D stacks of layered IR materials. For windows that must operate over a range of temperatures, this analysis reveals that the best strategy is to design coatings for the highest expected operating temperature.},

Notably, gap plasmon structures with asymmetric geometries exhibit a remarkable degree of directional coupling. However, due to divergence loss in dielectric waveguides, achieving long-distance directional light transmission remains challenging. In this work, we have fabricated gold helices with sharp tips and spiral grooves, forming a gap plasmon nanostructure incorporating a gold helix. Then, through Raman spectroscopy and finite-difference time-domain method, we have systematically investigated the asymmetric directional propagation of chiral light in this nanostructure. The gold helices exhibit a pronounced Raman scattering signal, resulting in the augmented optical signal enhancement effect. Moreover, the gap plasmon nanostructure significantly enhances the emission intensity and the transmission distance of light, which enables precise control over the directional propagation of chiral light. These findings hold significant potential for improving the emission intensity of chiral light, which is crucial for information transmission and chip-based information processing.},

  abstract     = {Optical tweezer arrays, known for their ability to manipulate microscopic entities in parallel, are widely used to assemble and organize multiple particles or cells. Conventional arrays, constrained by fully coherent beams, suffer from interference between adjacent spots and limited structural flexibility. This study introduces a flexible approach for trapping and manipulating multiple particles using a Laguerre–Gaussian correlated Schell-model beam array, enhanced through spatial coherence array engineering. By precisely tailoring the spatial coherence structure, we achieve highly uniform optical arrays with controllable and adaptable configurations. This method leverages the anti-interference characteristics of partially coherent beams to reduce inter-spot interference, enabling better control over spot spacing and improving precision in particle trapping. The approach is applicable to particles with varying refractive indices under diverse coherence conditions, ensuring reliable control over trapping sites. It also supports parallel manipulation by tuning the spacing of the incoherent source array. Additionally, modulating the radial index further improves configurational flexibility. Notably, the gradient force remains constant during manipulation, ensuring stable particle attachment and preventing trap drift. This stability is attributed to a manipulation strategy that adjusts spot spacing in the spatial coherence array while maintaining constant intensity. Finally, we examine trapping stability and efficiency as functions of coherence width and particle radius and provide preliminary insights into inter-particle interactions. The findings highlight a practical strategy with potential applications in quantum operations, biological systems, and nanomaterial design.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ranging from smart sensors to wearable electronics, has intensified the demand for sustainable energy solutions capable of powering low-power electronics under indoor illumination. In this context, indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) emerge as a promising technology to enable continuous electricity supply for autonomous IoT systems. To maximize energy harvesting efficiency under indoor conditions, IPV absorbers require an optimal bandgap of 1.7–1.9 eV to match the spectral characteristics of indoor environments as well as high defect tolerance to minimize the defect-induced recombination. These requirements position all-inorganic perovskites (AIPs), particularly CsPbI 3 and CsPbI 2 Br, as superior candidates for IPVs compared to conventional silicon absorbers. This review summarizes recent advancements on AIP-based IPVs, which lead to indoor efficiency exceeding 40%, far surpassing conventional silicon cells. This review also examines a series of synergistic efforts toward the AIP-based IPVs with high performance, further discusses the existing challenges and provides multiple perspectives regarding the future optimization of AIP-based IPVs for practical applications.},

This property finds diverse applications in nanoscale systems, including mass transport and ionic current generation. This study explores the adsorption characteristics of NH 3 and H 2 S molecules on graphene surfaces and the accompanying electromigration forces. Using the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function calculations, we demonstrate that under applied gate voltages, a distinct threshold behavior in electromigration forces emerges, dominated by electron wind forces. This effect activates significant electron wind forces only when the orbital energies of the adsorbate align closer to the bias window, in contrast to the inherent alignment seen in resonant adsorbates. The findings elucidate the critical role of orbital energy alignment and electron scattering forces in governing electromigration, offering insights into the adsorbate–electron coupling at interfaces.},

Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) offer fast, long-range channels for thermal transport. Dual Reststrahlen band materials such as SrTiO 3 provide a broader SPhPs-supporting frequency range (Δ ω ) and greater potential for enhancing SPhPs-mediated thermal conductivity ( κ ), yet their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we analytically solve the SPhPs dispersion relations to investigate the influence of dual Reststrahlen bands on κ of SrTiO 3 , considering the effects of dielectric asymmetry (Δ ε ) between the top and bottom surfaces of the membrane, temperature, and doping. We find that the low-frequency Reststrahlen band contributes more than two orders of magnitude higher κ than that outside the bands. Moreover, elevated temperatures and heavy doping reduce κ due to increased optical losses and diminished lattice polarization, particularly within the low-frequency Reststrahlen band. These findings complement the current understanding of SPhPs-mediated heat transport and suggest an alternative strategy for thermal management in nanoscale systems.},

  abstract     = {Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential to form high-quality, stable films, which can significantly enhance the efficiency of silicon-based tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the performance of these devices is hindered by poor crystallization, a high intrinsic trap density in the WBG perovskite film, and nonradiative recombination, primarily due to bulk defects. In response to these challenges, we introduce 3-pyridinylmethylammonium iodide (3-PyAI) as an additive to passivate intrinsic defects within the bulk of the perovskite film. The addition of 3-PyAI significantly lowers defect induced nonradiative recombination by developing interactions with uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions and FA + cations. The resulting 3-PyAI-modified perovskite film significantly improves crystallinity, enlarges grain size, enhances bulk quality, and minimizes nonradiative recombination defects. Consequently, the methylammonium-free Cs 0.22 FA 0.78 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 PSCs demonstrate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.75%, much higher than that of the control device at 19.60%. Building on this advance, we integrated a silicon bottom solar cell, developing a four-terminal (4T) TSC that achieved a champion PCE of 30.52%. This work addresses the critical performance bottlenecks in WBG-PSCs and establishes a robust framework for realizing high-efficiency TSCs, representing a significant step toward the practical implementation of next-generation photovoltaic technologies.},

These Cu-BTC@Co-Se x:1 MOFs are functionalized with mono-target (Anti-Met-Enk or Anti-Leu-Enk) and/or dual-target (Anti-Met-Enk/Leu-Enk) antibodies for the selective and simultaneous recognition of Met-Enkephalin (Met-Enk) and Leu-Enkephalin (Leu-Enk).

Among various MOF configurations, the Cu-BTC@Co-Se 3:1 MOFs-based biosensing platform exhibits a broad detection range, 1.0–200.0 pg/mL for Met-Enk and 5.0–300.0 pg/mL for Leu-Enk covering physiological concentration ranges, with limits of detection of 0.81 and 3.64 pg/mL, respectively (S/N = 3). These performance characteristics are primarily attributed to the following: (i) a noticeable difference in isoelectric points between Cu-BTC@Co-Se 3:1 MOFs (≥8.61) and Anti-Met-Enk-Abs (∼4.94), which facilitates electrostatic interactions for effective antibody incorporation; (ii) the distribution of Co-Se 2 nanoparticles within the MOF porous cavities and on the surface, providing a high active surface area (57.4 and 51.6 m 2 /g), which enables the efficient Anti-Met-Enk-Abs antibody immobilization; and (iii) ester-like bridging between antibody carboxyl groups and metal centers (Cu, Co, and Se) through chemical adsorption interactions.

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of cellular images plays an indispensable role in early cancer diagnosis. Based on signal enhancement, harmonic atomic force microscopy (AFM), distinguished by its high resolution, demonstrates unique advantages in rapid acquisition and analysis of cellular images. Traditional harmonic probes are generally designed without sufficient consideration of environmental and sample-induced interference on probe vibration. However, in cellular imaging, environmental perturbations and heterogeneous mechanical properties of samples can significantly compromise imaging quality. To address the challenge of precision imaging in multi-environment cellular studies, we have developed an adaptive harmonic atomic force microscopy (A-HAFM) probe capable of generating stable harmonic signals in both atmospheric and liquid environments, enabling high-resolution cellular imaging and precise cell classification. Experimental studies involving 3600 samples of human cervical epithelial cells and human cervical cancer cells with varying invasiveness (HeLa and SiHa) demonstrated that the A-HAFM probe achieved 52.17% improvement in amplitude response sensitivity compared to conventional AFM, along with 60% enhancement in imaging clarity, with classification accuracy for normal vs cancer cells improved by 7.97% and between cancer subtypes (HeLa/SiHa) increased by 12.73%. By precisely characterizing cellular substructures and identifying physiological signatures, this technology establishes a promising platform for cellular-level diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumors, and other critical illnesses.},

  abstract     = {Self-rectifying memristors, which integrate diode-like behavior to suppress sneak currents in crossbar arrays, are promising for high-density neuromorphic systems. However, conventional designs often suffer from nonlinear weight updates and stochastic switching due to filamentary or Schottky-based mechanisms. Here, we present a NiO x /HfO 2−x :Al bilayer memristor utilizing ferroelectric polarization to actively direct oxygen vacancy migration, thereby enhancing self-rectification. The polarization-induced internal field drives oxygen vacancy migration and synergizes with oxygen ion migration to modulate the interface barrier, yielding ∼3.5× larger rectification ratio than a non-ferroelectric control device. This ferroelectric–ionic coupling also achieves highly linear analog conductance updates (R 2 ≈ 0.99, nonlinearity factor α ≈ 0.02). Our work reveals a ferroelectric–ionotronic mechanism that enables deterministic memristor switching, contributing to the evolving framework of neuromorphic device physics.},

In this work, we demonstrate widely tunable GaSb-silicon hybrid lasers that employ a single ultra-compact silicon microring resonator with a 5 μ m radius as the wavelength-selective element. The microring exhibits a tuning range exceeding 34 nm in the 2 μ m waveband. By integrating three different gain chips, we achieve hybrid lasers with wavelength tuning ranges of 22, 22, and 17 nm centered at 1.95, 2.11, and 2.37 μ m, respectively. The lasers demonstrate a side-mode suppression ratio greater than 50 dB, ensuring high spectral purity. This ultra-compact design, combined with a straightforward tuning mechanism, makes the proposed laser highly suitable for practical applications in spectroscopy and detection.},

However, achieving higher responsivity and potentially streamlining the fabrication process remain research goals. Herein, we present a PdSe 2 /Bi 2 O 2 Se heterostructure detector that synergistically utilizes the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and photogating effect to achieve breakthrough performance in SWIR. A high responsivity of 21 A/W, an external quantum efficiency of 1680%, and a specific detectivity of 5.7 × 10 9 Jones at 1550 nm were demonstrated.

Cd 3 As 2 films were grown coherently on Al 1− x In x Sb buffer layers with varying degrees of lattice mismatch to Cd 3 As 2 , producing in-plane stresses that ranged from compressive to tensile. Using magneto-transport measurements of the Landau levels of the lowest subbands, we show that films under compression remain in the two-dimensional topological insulator state, while a sufficiently large tensile stress induces a transition to a topologically trivial phase. These results qualitatively agree with expectations from theoretical models for these films. At the topological transition, the gap avoids completely closing, and we discuss possible origins.},

Current research primarily emphasizes the observation of intrinsic NLHE in various materials or the induction of NLHE responses through the artificial construction of twisted two-dimensional material systems. A key focus has been the modulation of NLHE signal strength, which is crucial for device performance. Theoretical predictions suggest that an applied electric field can enhance NLHE by modulating the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). Here, we report effective modulation of both the magnitude and sign of the NLHE in the type- II semimetal TaIrTe 4 by applying additional constant electric fields of varying directions and magnitudes. Notably, the NLHE response strength is enhanced by 168 times compared to the intrinsic one at 4 K when a constant electric field of −0.5 kV/cm is applied along the b -axis of TaIrTe 4 . Scaling law analysis suggests that the enhancement results from the combined effects of the electric field on the intrinsic BCD and disorder scattering effect in TaIrTe 4 . This work not only provides insights into the properties of TaIrTe 4 but also serves as a valuable reference for the development of electronic devices.},

However, the electron–phonon coupling central to understanding the fundamental properties remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the tell-tale signature of electron–phonon coupling in the type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe 4 employing temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Our results reveal that the temperature-dependent energy and lifetime of A 1 phonon mode at ∼172 cm −1 diverge from the anharmonic model, evidencing the dominated role of phonon–electron rather than phonon–phonon scattering in phonon decay. The theoretically calculated electron–phonon coupling matrix element of the A 1 mode is 0.39 eV, indicating substantial coupling to the electronic state. Our findings provide meaningful insights into understanding the fascinating physical properties and quantum phenomena of Weyl semimetal TaIrTe 4 .},

Our analysis includes physical and compositional examinations of the damaged regions using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. These techniques are complemented by in situ SEM current-voltage (I–V) measurements performed under vacuum conditions. In particular, we explored the connection of the applied voltage polarity with the damage onset. We show that high negative voltages applied to the TiN top electrode typically result in worm-like damage patterns. This specific type of damage, along with more severe stages of degradation such as disconnection and melting, is exclusively observed for negative biases and does not occur under vacuum conditions. Conversely, under positive voltage stress, no damage is detected in the top electrode of the devices irrespective of the external conditions. These results highlight the critical role of vacuum in controlling redox-driven compositional changes and preventing catastrophic damage. By systematically analyzing the effects of voltage polarity and ambient conditions, this study provides key insights into damage generation mechanisms.

Analysis of magnetic hysteresis loops and magnetic force microscopy images reveals that the nanocap topography plays a crucial role in shaping domain configurations, leading to the stabilization of single skyrmions per nanocap. Skyrmion arrays are nucleated with relatively small out-of-plane magnetic fields, particularly in nanocaps with smaller diameters. By tuning the nanocap diameter, the number of stabilized skyrmions can be controlled. Additionally, a reduction in the skyrmion switching fields is observed as the nanocap diameter decreases, which is attributed to an increase in effective magnetic anisotropy. Micromagnetic simulations further confirm the formation of magnetic skyrmions and demonstrate that geometric modifications can influence skyrmion stability.

By designing three distinct spin symmetry prototypes: rotational-mirror (RM), RM-glide mirror, and two-dimensional structure with RM (2D-RM) symmetric structures, we demonstrate that non-collinear spins break glide mirror symmetry, leading to the emergence of odd-wave magnetism. Moreover, such odd-wave magnetism can occur even in 2D systems that retain out-of-plane mirror symmetry. Furthermore, we achieve the tunability of non-collinear-driven spin splitting via introducing lattice strain. The magnitude of spin splitting changes with the direction of the applied strain. Our work reveals that symmetry-breaking mechanisms inherent to non-collinear spin structures give rise to odd-wave magnetism, thereby facilitating the discovery of additional non-collinear odd-wave magnetism materials.},

  abstract     = {The 5d transition metal Pt is widely recognized as a spin Hall material for generating spin–orbit torques (SOTs) in Pt/ferromagnetic (FM) heterostructures. Despite its low resistivity, it exhibits a damping-like SOT efficiency ( ξ DL ) significantly lower than other well-studied SOT materials, such as W and Ta, limiting its practical applications. In this study, systematic investigations are conducted on the incorporation of various insertion layers, including oxides (NiO, MgO), transition metals (Ta, W, Nb), and FM materials (Co, CoFeB), to enhance ξ DL without the need for co-sputtered alloy engineering. Notably, MgO insertion exhibits the most pronounced impact, offering a broad tuning window for the spin current source resistivity ( ρ SCS ) ranging from 49.7 to 215.4 μ Ω cm. An optimized ξ DL of approximately 0.52 is achieved in the [Pt(0.6)/MgO(0.4)] 5 /Pt/Co/Pt configuration. Utilizing tilted anisotropy as a field-free solution, this multilayer design demonstrates a significantly reduced zero-thermal critical switching current density ( J c0 = 4.28 × 10 10 A/m 2 ) compared to pure Pt ( J c0 = 6.20 × 10 11 A/m 2 ), underscoring its potential for practical applications. The combination of high ξ DL , moderate ρ SCS , and low J c0 collectively enhances energy efficiency and performance in SOT magnetic random-access memory and next-generation spintronic applications.},

In this Letter, we explore E control of the TMR effect in magnetic tunnel junction devices with a Co 2 FeSi/V/PMN-PT multiferroic heterostructure. By controlling the polarity of the applied E to the multiferroic heterostructure, a repeatable and nonvolatile change in the TMR effect is achieved. The change in the TMR effect is strongly influenced by the microscopic domain structures in the Co 2 FeSi layer after the application of a certain E .

Here, we demonstrate a breakthrough in magnetically controlled THz modulation using a CoFe 2 O 4 /MgO/F-Mica composite structure. The tunable optical response and dielectric properties of the composite under varying magnetic fields were systematically investigated via THz time-domain spectroscopy. Experimental results revealed a magnetic field-dependent THz transmission attenuation, with systematic suppression of transmission spectra proportional to the applied magnetic field intensity. A theoretical model accounting for external magnetic field variations was proposed, which agrees well with the experimental results regarding the imaginary component. Remarkably, the composite material realizes phase modulation simultaneously under magnetic field. This exceptional magnetic responsiveness significantly broadens the application potential of ferrites in the THz regime. These findings provide critical insights for designing tunable multifunctional THz magnetic devices in 6G communications, medical diagnostics, and nondestructive testing applications.},

This improvement positions these compounds as promising candidates for hydrogen liquefaction applications.

However, the close proximity between the turn-on threshold voltage (V th ) of p - n heterostructures and the phase change voltage (V pc ) results in a critically narrow operational voltage window, significantly limiting device reliability. In this study, we present a breakthrough in epitaxial p -GeFeTe/ n -Si heterojunction engineering through magnetic field-mediated control of V th . The p -GeFeTe/ n -Si heterojunction exhibits exponential current density–voltage (J–V) behavior with a V th of 0.95 V. Analysis of the semilogarithmic ln(J)–V curve reveals three distinct linear regions, each characterized by a different ideality factor ( η d1 , η d2 , and η d3 ). As the magnetic field strength (H) increases, the differences among these ideality factors diminish, ultimately converging into a single linear region at H = 45 kOe. Under this magnetic field, an ultralow V th of 0.27 V is achieved—representing a 72% reduction compared to operation without a magnetic field. This magneto-responsive J–V behavior is attributed to spin-split band structures that induce a field-modulated semiconductor-to-half-metal phase transition, as explained by a band alignment model. These findings offer a viable strategy for widening the operational voltage window of PCRAM and pave the way for multifunctional PCM-based devices.},

  abstract     = {GaN on GaN vertical power devices are promising for high voltage applications beyond Si and SiC. Developing GaN substrates with low defect densities for high-quality epitaxial growth has been an ongoing challenge. Consequently, extended defects are a concern for high power device performance and reliability and must be mitigated. In particular, newer ammonothermally grown GaN substrates with lower extended defect densities have not yet been evaluated as extensively as hydride vapor phase epitaxy GaN. Here, we identify different electrically active defects on epitaxial p-GaN layers grown on strain-patterned (dot-core) and ammonothermal GaN substrates. On dot-core substrates, “star” defects were observed that consist of pits and cracks, have an increased hole carrier density, display occupied bandgap states, and show reduced and variable forward bias currents. In contrast, on ammonothermal substrates, triangular patches were found on certain rough epitaxy ridges and show increased gap states along with a lower carrier density and reduced conductivity. The star and triangular defects likely correspond to threading dislocations and stacking faults, respectively, and may act as killer defects. As a result, p–i–n diode devices on ammonothermal substrates frequently exhibited poor reverse and forward bias behavior due to the random extended defect distribution that cannot be intentionally avoided as in patterned dot-core substrates, as well as different impurity defects in the epitaxy. Therefore, we have found that ammonothermal GaN substrates require tighter control over both point and extended defect distributions in order to achieve reliable high power electronic devices.},

However, the intrinsic bandgap (1.34 eV) restricts photoresponse, especially in the long-wavelength near-infrared region. This study developed a super-bandgap photodetector based on a nanocavity-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) graphene/InP Schottky heterojunction via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The high conductivity and nanocavity structure of 3D-graphene enhance light trapping and interfacial carrier modulation. Benefiting from broad-spectrum absorption by 3D-graphene and the built-in electric field within InP, the detection range extends from the intrinsic limit of 920–1550 nm, surpassing the conventional bandgap constraint. Under 1550 nm illumination, the photodetector demonstrates self-powered operation, a responsivity of 12.2 A/W, specific detectivity of 2.1 × 10 10 Jones, and fast photoresponse with rise and fall times of 510 and 319 μ s, respectively. The −3 dB bandwidth reaches 400 Hz. Additionally, the device exhibits excellent stability over 200 switching cycles and 3 months of storage. The photodetectors are applied to secure information encryption in the near-infrared field.

We observe a room temperature saturation velocity of ( 2.1 ± 0.2 ) × 10 6 cm/s and associated mobility of ∼ 7–12 cm 2 /V s for a hole density of 4 × 10 13 cm −2 , which increases to ( 4.4 ± 0.4 ) × 10 6 cm/s at 4.2 K, with an associated mobility of ∼ 25–50 cm 2 /V s. The measured ensemble hole saturation velocity in this geometry, which is suitable for field-effect transistor channels, is lower than that of holes measured in lightly-doped n-type 3D bulk GaN (6.63 × 10 6 cm/s), owing to the 2D geometry and high carrier density of the two-dimensional hole gas, and degraded hole mobility from recess etching. Measured velocity-field contours are corroborated against bulk density functional theory and two-dimensional full-band real-space cellular Monte Carlo simulations under different surface boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {III-Nitride high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on AlN substrates offer significant advantages for high-power, high-frequency applications due to AlN high thermal conductivity and ultra-wide bandgap. However, achieving high-quality thin GaN channel layers on AlN is challenging because of lattice mismatch, which leads to columnar growth. In this work, we present the development of a two-step growth process with controlled carbon incorporation that enables fully coalesced 150 and 50-nm-thick GaN channel layers on AlN substrates by hot-wall metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. We demonstrate HEMTs with state-of-the-art two-dimensional electron gas mobility values of 1805 and 1100 cm 2 /V s for the 150-nm-thick and the 50-nm-tick channels, respectively. Thermal transport analysis, incorporating experimentally measured thermal conductivities of the individual HEMT components and electro-thermal simulations via Technology Computer-Aided Design, reveals a 19% reduction in surface temperature for devices on AlN substrates compared to similar HEMTs on SiC. This result highlights the thermal management benefits of homoepitaxy on AlN.},

  abstract     = {This work investigated impedance-dependent degradation mechanisms in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) under high-voltage radio frequency (RF) stress, focusing on electro-thermal coupling and trap evolution. In devices with matched impedance, slight degradation in output power (P out ), saturated drain current (I dss ), and transconductance (G M ) is observed after RF stress. This is attributed to an increase in trap density within the AlGaN layer and at the AlGaN/GaN interface, as evidenced by low-frequency noise results. In contrast, severe degradation in P out , I dss , G M , and gate leakage current (I G ) occurs in those devices with the 50-Ω mismatched impedance condition. Anyway, these more severe degradation effects result not only from the increased trap density after RF stress, but also primarily from the temperature rise caused by reflected power-induced Joule heating, as validated by infrared thermography. Electro-thermal simulations reveal dual lateral electric field peaks near gate edges in 50-Ω mismatched devices, redistributing peak temperature toward the source–gate region and intensifying localized Joule heating, thereby accelerating degradation. These findings highlight the critical role of impedance matching in GaN HEMT reliability, offering guidelines for designing robust power amplifiers in microwave systems.},

It is shown that the thickness of MoS 2 ultrathin films can be fairly controlled over the (1.3–12.6) nm range by simply adjusting the number of incident laser ablation pulses (N LP ). Noteworthy, the electrical conductivity of the MoS 2 ultrathin films was found to change by more than 6 orders of magnitude, abruptly switching from semiconducting to conductive behavior, upon increasing the thickness in the nm range. Raman analyses revealed that our ultrathin films comprise both 2H and 1T phases with a clear tendency for the metallic 1T phase to increase at the expense of its 2H phase counterpart, as the film thickness is increased from 1.3 to ∼13 nm. Concomitantly, their density of defects also increases with N. Our results highlight the significant structural and electrical changes that occur in MoS 2 ultrathin films as their thickness is barely increased from a few to only several layers. A direct relationship between the conductivity of the pulsed laser deposition (PLD)-MoS 2 ultrathin films and their structural characteristics (both 1T-MoS 2 phase content and density of defects) is established. Finally, this work paves the way for the PLD as an effective synthesis route for the controlled growth of hybrid 2H-/1T-MoS 2 ultrathin films with the possibility of wafer scaling.},

Here, we report a study of quasiparticle (QP) electronic structure and optical excitons in NaBiS 2 using the GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) approach within the ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Through calculations of phonon dispersion with self-consistent phonon theory and elastic constants, we reveal that cubic NaBiS 2 is stable dynamically and mechanically at elevated temperatures. Our calculations of QP band structure using the G 0 W 0 + BSE approach demonstrate its direct bandgap of 1.41 eV in agreement with the experiment, allowing dipole transition and inhibiting formation of trapped excitons with their small binding energy of 13 meV. Furthermore, we find strong optical absorption with a steep absorption onset and large absorption coefficients exceeding 1 μ m −1 , which enable high theoretical spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency over 26%. Finally, mobilities of charge carriers are found to become very high, 19.18 and 55.87 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for electrons and holes at a carrier concentration of 10 16 cm −3 , ensuring high photovoltaic performance.

This transport is immune to defects and perturbations, enabling the separation of acoustic/elastic waves with different frequency components at distinct interface positions. However, most existing studies have focused on structures with fixed operating frequencies and spatial positions for rainbow trapping, leaving the realization of a tunable topological rainbow trapping effect as an ongoing challenge. This work introduces magnetorheological elastomers into two-dimensional elastic topological phononic crystals. By optimizing design parameters using a genetic algorithm, the width of the topological bandgap is broadened. Applying a magnetic field allows active adaptation to different operating frequencies, achieving efficient edge state transport. Furthermore, by controlling the magnetic field strength in different regions, the proposed structure enables topological rainbow trapping functionality across different frequency ranges, spatial positions, and transmission paths.

It is shown that the friction force, temperature, and velocity follow the linear correlation of ( F c − F ) 3 / 2 / T vs ln ( v / T ) ⁠ , which intriguingly aligns well with the thermally activated Prandtl–Tomlinson model associated with single asperity contacts. Moreover, when the velocity is lower than 2500 nm/s and the friction force approaches zero, the adhesive force increases with velocity and decreases with increasing temperature, indicating a thermally activated exfoliation process. Our results demonstrate that in cases where the interface is constrained to be atomically flat, mesoscale contacts can manifest single asperity force characteristics, where the sliding interface is collectively affected by thermal energy.},

Herein, an economical ammonium sulfamate (AS) with the desired NH4+ and -S=O groups has been developed to manage surface defects on the perovskite films effectively. Due to the synergistic effect of these two functional groups in AS, the effective removal of excess iodide ions (I − ) from the film surface, the suppression of metallic lead (Pb 0 ) formation by binding with uncoordinated lead ions (Pb 2+ ), and the optimization of interfacial energy level alignment are all achieved simultaneously. As a result, the average PCE of the AS-treated PSCs increased from the initial 21.03% to 23.21%, with a champion efficiency of 24.05% achieved. Moreover, the optimized devices with AS post-treatment also exhibited significantly enhanced storage stability and continuous light stability. This study lays the foundation for further developing low-cost and multifunctional surface modification strategies to achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaic devices.},

  abstract     = {Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) have shown great potential for applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties. However, the highly dynamic binding of conventional oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) ligands to the surface of PeQDs significantly compromises their photoelectric properties and stability, which adversely affects the electroluminescence (EL) performance. Here, dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS12), a ligand that can strongly bind to the PeQD surface, is introduced to stabilize the dynamic surface and passivate the surface defects of PeQDs. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that BS12 treatment can partially replace the dynamically bound OA/OAm ligands due to strong binding ability, significantly reducing surface defects in solution status and thus leading to more than a twofold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield. Furthermore, BS12 treatment enables improved film-forming ability, carrier transporting capacity, lower trap density, and enhanced film stability. Consequently, the EL performance of PeQD LEDs is markedly improved, especially with a 720% increase in operational lifetime. This work presents a promising strategy for synthesizing high-performance PeQDs.},

This study systematically investigates the three-dimensional rotational dynamics of hexagonal gold nanoprisms in spatially modulated optical fields with controlled fluidic environments. Through quantitative analysis of particle trajectories under varying optical modulation periods, we demonstrated that by adjusting the modulation period the particle motion can be controlled across three distinct rotation modes: nutation-dominated motion, multi-mode stochastic motion, and constrained planar rotation. Crucially, the range of periodic nutation angles exhibits a dependence on modulation period in constrained planar rotation, enabling precise mode control. The demonstrated multi-mode control paradigm advances nanoparticle manipulation techniques, particularly for developing orientation-programmable nanomotors and adaptive micro-fluidic systems.},

We systematically investigate the intrinsic carrier mobility discrepancy of diverse materials and validate the significant electrical anisotropy of PdTe 2 through deformation potential theory. Additionally, polarized Raman spectroscopy reveals distinct vibrational modes in PdTe 2 along the a- and b-axes, underscoring its remarkable optical anisotropy. The synergistic electrical and optical anisotropies within the PdTe 2 /GaN heterostructure result in an impressive dichroic ratio of 37.23 for the photodetector under 365 nm polarized light, far exceeding previously reported results in UV polarization detection.

  abstract     = {Over the past few years, the demand for high-performance optoelectronic devices has intensified, and the limitations of silicon have become a critical bottleneck. To overcome these constraints while ensuring compatibility with existing CMOS technology, the search for alternative materials has become imperative. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising materials for advanced optoelectronic systems but suffer from inherently low light absorption, impeding their widespread commercial adoption. In this context, enhancing light–matter interaction in TMDs is not merely beneficial but essential for faster, more efficient, and multifunctional optoelectronic systems. This study systematically investigates and compares Si/SiO 2 and distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) as substrate platforms to enhance TMDs-based photodetection, focusing on responsivity improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that DBRs enable a ∼9× enhancement in the Raman signal of layered WSe 2 and a 20× increase in photoluminescence at 633 nm excitation. Moreover, the fabricated WSe 2 and MoSe 2 two-terminal devices on DBR exhibit a 5× and 10× boost in responsivity at 660 nm wavelength, respectively. A peak responsivity of 200 mA/W is achieved using DBR substrates, matching or surpassing values reported in previous studies. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations provide critical insights into the mechanisms driving these enhancements, highlighting the role of optical interference and field confinement. These findings establish DBRs as scalable, high-performance substrates for integrating TMDs into next-generation photodetectors, paving the way for significant advancements in light harvesting and optoelectronic performance.},

Previous studies on polarization conversion in time-varying media have achieved line-to-line polarization conversion, altering the direction of EM wave vibration. This paper proposes a dual-channel linear-to-circular polarization conversion (DLCPC) that transforms linear polarization waves into circular polarization waves in both the forward and backward directions. Additionally, it is shown that DLCPC can be achieved within the bandgaps of both s -waves and p -waves, enabling a controlled wave amplification effect. The theoretical results, calculated using the transmission matrix method, are compared with numerical verifications based on the finite-difference time-domain method, confirming the validity of the findings. This study expands the research scope in the field of photonic time crystals (PTCs), demonstrating the use of PTCs for DLCPC, and establishes a relationship between this conversion and the wave amplification effect of the PTCs. The controlled wave amplification effect is achieved without impacting the DLCPC.},

  abstract     = {The geometric phase (GP), arising from the evolution of states like polarization on the Poincaré sphere, is conventionally measured using interferometry. However, the interferometric techniques often suffer from instability, causing GP to be masked by dynamic phase contributions. Here, we propose a non-interferometric approach based on stimulated second harmonic generation (S-SHG) for GP measurement. Using a continuous-wave pump and two-stage SHG, we achieved S-SHG in the second crystal using the seed SHG and undepleted pump of the first crystal. By exploiting the phase-sensitive nature of the S-SHG, we mapped the GP, arising from the rotation of the half-waveplate, placed between two suitably oriented quarter-waveplates, onto the S-SHG power to measure GP with a sensitivity better than 26 μ W/mrad. The measured GP value agrees with Jones' calculus and interferometric measurement. Furthermore, we found that the sensitivity of GP measurement is high for phase-modulation to pump beam and a high S-SHG amplification at low seed power, establishing the suitability of the S-SHG scheme for imaging biological samples with low illumination, avoiding thermal damage. Such a generic scheme can be implemented using any nonlinear crystal and laser (cw to ultrafast), establishing its potential for various applications.},

While there are methods for measuring some of these properties at a range of frequencies, there are few metrologies for measuring the relationships between nonlinear electric and acoustic properties, as given by the mixing products. Here, we test a method for extracting the properties of lead zirconium titanate by measuring the nonlinear mixing of electric and acoustic waves. Our experiment used a block of lead zirconium titanate mounted on top of a coplanar waveguide that was connected to a vector network analyzer. A piezoelectric transducer acoustically actuated the sample from above, which modulated the electrical signal in the coplanar waveguide. A vector network analyzer in frequency offset mode measured the modulation as second-order mixing products. Vector network analyzer-based measurements are particularly well suited for these nonlinear measurements due to their wide dynamic range and ability to capture frequency dependence of mixing products. The proof-of-concept results show many coupled electric–acoustic modes that are significant relative to the noise floor of the vector network analyzer. Broader impacts of the research could be the development of new metrologies for measuring nonlinear susceptibilities.},

This diagnostic technique enables high temporal resolution measurements at a relevant timescale, which are essential for capturing the dynamic plasma response during bias modulation. Upon the initiation of bias pulse, a transient drop in electron density—referred to as electron suction—is observed, resulting from the rapid rise in bias voltage outpacing the measured plasma response. Notably, this behavior appears in both E-mode and H-mode conditions of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) discharges, indicating that it is independent of the specific discharge mode. Furthermore, a significant electron suction is observed as the time-averaged electron density decreases. This electron suction induced by the RF pulse can be interpreted through its correlation with plasma and sheath formation.

Results showed that benign serous effusions exhibit similar dielectric behavior to sucrose-added pure water. The malignant serous effusions showed a different characteristic, especially in the 10 4 –10 5 rad/s angular frequency region. The observed relaxation behaviors were attributed to the polarization of macromolecule and protein contents at frequencies over 10 5 rad/s. The relaxations under the angular frequency of 10 4 rad/s were attributed to macromolecule- and proteins-bound water, etc. In light of these results, it was thought that dielectric spectroscopy, which is an efficient characterization technique for such solids as inorganic and polymeric materials to analyze their capacitive and structural behaviors, may be suggested as a rapid in vitro diagnostic method in determining the distinction between benign and malignant serous effusions.},

This study focuses on silicon vacancy defects in 4H-SiC, integrated into nanopillar arrays fabricated via ion implantation, e-beam lithography, and reactive ion etching. SiC nanopillars with a height of 1.4 μ m are formed and arrays with varying pillar diameters and spacings are obtained. Cathodoluminescence measurements at 80 K reveal a two to four times improvement in light collection efficiency from the defects compared to unstructured SiC. The cathodoluminescence intensity increases with a smaller pillar spacing and a larger diameter. These findings demonstrate the potential of SiC nanopillar arrays as scalable platforms for enhancing quantum photonic device performance.},

This makes up for the shortcomings of measurements based on the Stark effect, which suffer from quadratic field dependence (limiting sensitivity in weak field regimes), rendering it incapable of distinguishing the DC electric field direction. Furthermore, this method extends naturally to power-frequency (PF) electric field measurement by exploiting the quasi-static approximation—valid given the PF field's characteristic timescale ( ⁠ ∼ 10 − 2 s) vastly exceeds the interferometric measurement duration ( ⁠ 10 − 6 − 10 − 3 s). Crucially, our protocol provides instantaneous PF electric field reconstruction, providing comprehensive information, including amplitude, frequency, and phase. These advancements have direct implications for traceable DC electric field measurement and noninvasive characterization of PF electric fields near high-voltage infrastructure.},

A deep understanding of the V B − (electron): hBN (nuclear) spin systems is crucial for realizing these potentials. In this article, we employ electron nuclear double resonance to demonstrate the sensing of distant nuclear spins via the V B − electron spin. We identify the nature and localization of the probed nuclear magnetic moments as 14 N spins localized ≈ 0.4 nm away from the vacancy and resolve the energies of the corresponding interactions. Density functional theory calculations further confirm these findings, providing a detailed description of the interactions between the V B − electron spin and surrounding nitrogen atoms in different shells. The results establish the V B − electron spin as a promising tool for developing van der Waals material-based nuclear magnetic resonance probes, advancing the understanding of spin physics in hBN, and unlocking its potential to study distant nuclear spin interactions in the host.},

  abstract     = {Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) have garnered considerable attention owing to their distinctive chemical structure and tunable luminescence. Although numerous studies have established the pressure-tunable luminescence properties of CDs, a systematic investigation of ethanol effects on their pressure-induced emission changes has yet to be conducted. In this study, the pressure-responsive behavior of red-emitting carbon dots (R-CDs) dispersed in ethanol as a model system was investigated. We undertake a study on pressure regulation of R-CDs dispersed in ethanol. The current results indicate that across the 0.11–3.05 GPa pressure range where ethanol maintains its liquid phase, R-CDs display opposing pressure responses: carbon core fluorescence enhancement accompanied by surface state emission quenching. When the pressure exceeds 3.05 GPa, ethanol begins to crystallize, leading to aggregation-induced quenching of the overall fluorescence of R-CDs; within the pressure range of 3.05–9.60 GPa, the further compression of ethanol polycrystals results in a significant increase in the aggregation degree of R-CDs, thereby causing a more pronounced quenching effect on their overall fluorescence. This study provides critical insights for optimizing the optical characteristics of CDs and broadening their functional applications.},

In contrast, solar cells utilizing SnO 2 ETM passivated with amino-based compounds exhibited stable performance under continuous 1 Sun illumination during 2300 h in an inert atmosphere and under indoor lighting in ambient conditions.

  abstract     = {Semiconductor photocatalysis holds great promise for energy conversion and environmental remediation, but its efficiency is often limited by the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. To overcome this issue, we engineered a ZnO nanowire photoanode by embedding platinum quantum dots (Pt QDs) at the base of the nanowires between the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and the ZnO layer. Unlike conventional surface-decoration approaches, the photoanode's ability to collect photogenerated carriers is enhanced due to the excellent electrical conductivity of Pt, facilitating efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons. Additionally, the introduction of Pt QDs increases the roughness of the FTO substrate, resulting in a vertically uneven ZnO nanowire morphology that enhances light scattering and absorption. The optimized ZnO/Pt QDs photoanode exhibited a significantly improved photocurrent density of 0.23 mA/cm 2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), representing a 35.3% enhancement over pristine ZnO. This dual-function design provides a promising strategy for developing high-performance photoanodes for photocatalytic applications.},

The system utilizes mutually exclusive magnets to generate positive stiffness and flexible bending beams to offer negative stiffness, which counterbalances each other to realize quasi-zero stiffness. Physical prototypes were fabricated, and their vibration isolation and energy harvesting performance were assessed under various magnet distances and excitation conditions. Experimental results validate that the proposed system achieves both vibration isolation and energy harvesting. It exhibits outstanding vibration isolation performance when the frequency exceeds 5 Hz. Notably, the magnet distance significantly affects the energy harvesting performance: compared to the 37 mm configuration, adjusting the magnet distance to 41 and 39 mm increased the power output by 54.9% and 31.7%, respectively.

One-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were interspersed with two-dimensional MXene nanosheets to establish a porous network structure for fast charge transfer and efficient active site exposure. Meanwhile, the introduction of catalytically active zero-dimensional nickel oxide can catalyze the creation of more active sites, which can further inhibit the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics. The hosts of MXene/CNTs-Ni with a unique 3D porous structure of point-line-sheet interconnection shape not only improve the sulfur loading and slow down the volume expansion of cathodes but also effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides through the synergistic effect of physical confinement and chemical adsorption.

Through combined computational and experimental methods, we investigated the influence of hemispherical microsphere orientation and CSL thickness on imaging performance. Results indicate that for a CSL incorporating 12.5- μ m-radius hemispherical microspheres, optimal imaging performance is achieved with a face-down hemispherical microsphere configuration and a 7- μ m-thick photoresist slab, enabling a lateral resolution of approximately 130 nm.},

  abstract     = {The intrinsically low tunnel barriers of conventional phosphorus-donors in bulk silicon preclude the observation of single-electron tunneling at practical temperatures. However, scaling devices to the nanometer dimensions introduces pronounced quantum and dielectric confinement effects, leading to elevated tunnel barriers. Here, we experimentally demonstrated strong confinement effects on three isolated donors located extremely close to the buried-oxide layer within a silicon-on-insulator nano-transistor channel region. Consequently, increased ionization-energies exceeding 100 meV are observed, which suggest confined donor potential with increased charging-energies, consistent with observed high-temperature Coulomb-oscillations. Such enhanced energy scales of isolated donors facilitate the room-temperature operation, even with a conventional donor such as phosphorus, which is corroborated by Coulomb-blockade simulations. These findings will boost up the advancement of the development of single-donor-based single-electron devices, bringing them closer to practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The characteristics of the interface between DNA and metallic carbon nanotube (CNT) in supramolecular assemblies are important to understand for electronic and sensing applications. We study the mechanical stability and electronic properties of these interfaces with amino and ester linkers using computational experiments. Our study demonstrates that both linkers significantly enhance the mechanical stability of DNA–CNT systems, with the DNA adopting a stable and lower energy perpendicular orientation relative to the CNT as opposed to a conventional parallel arrangement. This lower energy configuration is driven by nonbonded interactions between the DNA base and the CNT surface. Our calculations also reveal that interface resistance is primarily governed by DNA–CNT interactions with negligible contribution from the linkers. In the case of the amino linker, we predict a 100-fold transmission ratio between parallel and perpendicular configurations of DNA relative to CNT. This observation can be used to build an electromechanical switch with fast switching times (30 ns). The ester linker, on the contrary, enables a better electronic coupling between the DNA and CNT even when strained.},

Light sensing measurements indicate that the device shows a self-powered photoresponse behavior and a persistent photoconductive effect upon exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet light. Furthermore, reconfigurable “OR” and “NIMP” logic operations under both light and electrical stimulation are implemented. Temperature dependent analysis of resistance reveals that the charge transport follows the space-charge-limited current mechanism in both high and low resistance states.

The improvement is attributed to Be-induced deep acceptor traps, which compensate for donor-like traps likely associated with scandium and nitrogen-related defects, as confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These Be-related acceptor traps can capture electrons during the off-state, thereby suppressing gate leakage, and release the trapped electrons under thermal stress, effectively mitigating current collapse induced by donor traps in the on-state.

While forming such HOEPs traditionally requires hyper-dimensional parameter tuning, we theoretically demonstrate that real-valued gain can effectively substitute conventional nonlinear gain in reducing the dimensionality of HOEP formation. Specifically, under an anti-parity-time symmetric framework, we achieve coalescence of a single-EP2 and two paired-EP2s to form EP4 within only a three-dimensional parameter space. Experimentally implemented in a wireless sensing circuit with triple inductively coupled resonators, the frequency shift response to loss perturbations follows the predicted fourth-root dependence, as measured through zero-crossing analysis of the input impedance's imaginary part using impedance analyzer characterization. Notably, we observe convergent Petermann factors near this HOEP, signifying suppressed noise amplification despite eigenstate coalescence. This study establishes a dimensionality-reduction paradigm for engineering high-order non-Hermitian singularities with practical implications for ultrasensitive sensors and noise-resilient photonic/electronic systems.},

Recently, the Al x In 1– x As y Sb 1–y digital alloy system has emerged as a promising material for next-generation APDs, offering a broadly tunable bandgap, high avalanche gain, and low excess noise. However, surface oxidation and defect formation on the etched Al 0.7 InAsSb sidewalls of mesa-structure devices can significantly increase device dark currents, degrade the signal-to-noise ratio, and limit device reliability. Effective surface passivation is thus essential for suppressing dark current and enhancing device performance. In this study, we systematically compare the impact of different passivation techniques, including SU-8 polymer, atomic layer deposition (ALD)-HfO 2 , and ALD-Al 2 O 3 , deposited at various temperatures, on the performance of Al 0.7 InAsSb p–i–n APDs grown on InP substrates. Our results demonstrate that ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation at 150 °C achieves the most substantial reduction in dark current, increased breakdown voltage, and better thermal stability during heat exposure.

  abstract     = {Indoor photovoltaics (IPV) is a key technology for powering low-energy electronics, particularly Internet of Things devices, where wired power or frequent battery replacements are impractical. IPV cells convert artificial indoor light into electrical energy, enabling autonomous operation in environments with continuous illumination. While various tunable bandgap technologies have achieved high conversion efficiencies, many lack long-term stability. In contrast, III–V compound photovoltaics meet industrial standards, offering 25+ years of durability. Among them, Ga 0.51 In 0.49 P (GaInP) exhibits an almost optimal bandgap of 1.9 eV for indoor applications, achieving very high efficiencies even at 100 lx. This study investigates charge carrier dynamics in low-injection regimes for both p- and n-type GaInP. The effective radiative recombination coefficient ( B rad,eff ) and effective radiative efficiency were determined to measure non-radiative charge carrier lifetimes. The results explain the performance differences between homojunction (mainly p-type absorber) and rear-heterojunction (only n-type absorber) photovoltaic cells. The n-type material exhibits minority charge carrier lifetimes two orders of magnitude higher under low-light conditions due to a significant reduction in non-radiative recombination. Consequently, the rear-heterojunction design maintained higher excess charge carrier densities, leading to superior fill factor and open-circuit voltage compared to the homojunction. These findings highlight the potential of n-type GaInP for high-efficiency indoor energy harvesting.},

The spherical Ag NP arrays are initially fabricated beneath the surface of SiO 2 substrates via 160 keV Ag + ion implantation. Following this, the swift heavy-ion irradiation (SHII) at an energy of 200 MeV is applied to irradiate the embedded spherical Ag NPs in SiO 2 at a 45° angle relative to the surface normal. Under SHII, the Ag NPs are elongated along the Xe 14+ ion trajectory and form rod-like structures with a uniform orientation across centimeter-scale areas, leading to varied interparticle distances along the x - and y -directions. As a consequence, the engineered Ag NP arrays exhibit polarization-sensitive plasmonic optical responses across both the visible and near-infrared spectra, demonstrating a distinct dipole-like, polarization-dependent SHG response with an impressive anisotropy ratio of up to 25 (SHG intensity maxima under x -polarized laser excitations and minima under y -polarized laser excitations). Notably, the SHG intensity from the tailored Ag NP arrays is comparable to that of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.

Flexoelectricity—an electromechanical coupling inherent in all types of crystals—offers a solution by leveraging strain gradient-induced polarization to modulate electronic behavior. In this study, silicon microfabrication techniques are integrated with flexoelectricity to realize tunable Schottky diodes. Microstructure arrays fabricated on p-type silicon generate substantial strain gradients under macroscopic compression without relying on nanoscale probes. The strain gradients induce polarization at the metal–semiconductor interface, modulating the Schottky barrier height and thereby enabling mechanical tuning of the diode's electrical properties. The results herein demonstrate that macroscopic loading can effectively regulate the current–voltage ( I–V ) characteristics.

  abstract     = {The practical application of ferroelectric ceramics is limited by their inherent electromechanical property constraints. Superelasticity, characterized by considerable recoverable strain and piezoelectric coefficient in ferroelectrics, offers a promising solution for advanced actuators and sensors. However, the complex electromechanical coupling effects caused by different oriented grains pose challenges for implementing superelasticity in ferroelectric ceramics. This paper elucidates that superelasticity is prominently exhibited within small orientation regimes but becomes suppressed as the orientation increases. Grain orientation affects electromechanical properties: Young's modulus abruptly drops from 91 to 3 GPa near the superelastic transition at the orientation angle of 0 ° ⁠ , while it stabilizes around the intrinsic modulus at 45 ° ⁠ . The peak piezoelectric coefficient reaches 5000 pC / N near the transition at 0 ° ⁠ , exceeding the previously reported values by an order of magnitude. The proposed grain orientation-centered mechanism of superelasticity offers valuable theoretical support for designing ferroelectric devices with grain distributions, particularly in textured ceramics.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies have demonstrated the switching of the octupole moment in Mn 3 Sn driven by spin–orbit torque (SOT). However, they did not account for the polycrystalline nature of the sample when explaining the switching mechanism. In this work, we use samples with various atomic orientations to capture this polycrystalline nature. The samples are classified into three different configurations based on the relative alignment between the Kagome plane, the spin polarization, and the external magnetic field. We thoroughly investigate their SOT-induced spin dynamics and demonstrate that different configurations lead to distinct outcomes. Our findings reveal that the configuration where the Kagome plane is perpendicular to the spin polarization exhibits robust switching with stable polarity, whereas the signals from the configuration where the Kagome plane is parallel to the spin polarization will cancel each other out. By comparing our findings with experimental results, we pinpoint the primary sources contributing to the measured anomalous Hall effect signals. Additionally, we establish a dynamic balance model that incorporates the unique properties of Mn 3 Sn to elucidate these observations. Our study highlights the essential role of the polycrystalline nature in understanding SOT switching. By clarifying the underlying physical mechanisms, our work resolves the long-standing puzzle regarding the robust SOT switching observed in Mn 3 Sn.},

  abstract     = {Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has been explored in thin-film materials to discover fundamental phenomena and to investigate their physical properties. It is used to excite and manipulate quasiparticles such as phonons or magnons and can dynamically modulate the properties of the materials. In the field, SAWs are typically excited by a continuous wave at a resonant frequency. Recently, generation of a single-cycle SAW pulse has been demonstrated on GaAs substrate. Such a SAW pulse provides a potential to access a single quasiparticle excitation and to investigate its dynamics by time-resolved measurements. On the other hand, to modulate and control the properties of thin-film materials, it is generally required to generate high-intensity SAWs. In this work, we demonstrate the efficient generation of a SAW pulse using a chirp interdigital transducer (IDT) on LiNbO 3 substrate. We have fabricated chirp IDT devices with bandwidths from 0.5 GHz to 5.5 GHz. We also confirmed the generation of a SAW pulse with 0.3 ns full width at half maximum by performing time-resolved measurements. The conversion efficiency between input power and SAW on LiNbO 3 substrate is approximately 45 times larger than that on GaAs substrate. This enables us to generate a high-intensity SAW pulse, meeting the requirement for the modulation of thin films. Our results will expand the research in the field, such as spintronics and magnonics, and lead to their further advancements.},

  abstract     = {The enhanced terahertz (THz) emission in the spintronics based emitter is of extreme significance for the realization of THz probing and imaging. The THz emitter based on three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), (Bi 1–x Sb x ) 2 Te 3 (BST) with spin-momentum-locked Dirac surface states, is expected to exhibit strong THz emission efficiency due to the high spin-to-charge current conversion efficiency. In this study, by tuning the Fermi level close to the Dirac point through adjusting the Sb composition to 0.95, (Bi 0.05 Sb 0.95 ) 2 Te 3 /Co exhibits more pronounced THz pulse emission due to the unique topological surface states. The THz emission could be further enhanced by optimizing the thickness of the BST and Co layers. In addition, by inserting an Au layer between Co and BST, a Rashba-mediated Dirac surface state is formed due to the interaction between the Au film and the topological surface states of BST, which significantly enhances the emission efficiency—reaching 127% of the original signal when the Au thickness is 2 nm. Furthermore, in the BST/Co/Ta heterostructure, THz emission is further boosted due to the combined contributions of the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect and the inverse spin Hall effect, achieving an intensity of 143% of that in the BST/Co heterostructure. These findings highlight the potential of TI-based heterostructures as high-performance, room-temperature THz sources, with broad applications in ultrafast spectroscopy, imaging, and next-generation communication technologies.},

  abstract     = {The control of interfacial oxygen vacancy provides additional functional tunability to correlated oxide heterostructures. Here, we studied the role of amorphous capping layers, such as LaAlO 3 and LaMnO 3 , in controlling magnetic properties of (La,Sr)MnO 3 //SrTiO 3 heterostructures. When (La,Sr)MnO 3 layers are thin (∼4 nm), the amorphous LaAlO 3 capping layer significantly suppresses the ferromagnetic interaction, denoted by a decreased Curie temperature T C (Δ T C over −300 K) and saturated moment M S (Δ M S at −2.9 μ B /Mn) compared to the uncapped counterparts, irrespective of epitaxial orientations. This ferromagnetic suppression is attributed to the creation of interfacial oxygen vacancies, as evidenced by the recovery of ferromagnetism upon ex situ annealing (1 h at 625 °C in air). Moreover, when replacing LaAlO 3 with LaMnO 3 , the reduction of oxygen affinity in the capping layer results in less pronounced magnetic modulations with Δ T C at −100 K and Δ M S at −1.1 μ B /Mn. Also, the increase in (La,Sr)MnO 3 layer thickness dilutes the capping-layer effect, leading to negligible changes on T C and M S in the LaAlO 3 -capped 40-nm-thick (La,Sr)MnO 3 //SrTiO 3 samples. Our results not only shed some light on understanding the capping-layer effect in manganite-based heterostructures but also offer a feasible strategy for functional modulations at other oxide interfaces.},

The results demonstrate that the ThMn 12 -type structure is co-stabilized by substituting Zr for Sm at the 2 a site and M for Fe at the 8 i site. The effect of M substitution on the electronic band structure can be explained by the rigid band model, where the d – d electron-orbital hybridization between M and Fe leads to a negative effect on the Fe local magnetic moment. Besides, M changes the magnetic anisotropy by altering the electronic density surrounding Sm. Both the compounds exhibit higher Curie temperatures and magnetocrystalline anisotropy fields compared to the well-known Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnet, with T c and μ 0 H a reaching 819.3 K and 9.23 T for M = Ti, and 820.0 K and 8.41 T for M = Mo, respectively.

To address these challenges, spin caloritronics offer a promising pathway for thermoelectric conversion based on the spin degree of freedom, which has attracted considerable interest because of its low energy consumption and high response speed. In this study, we systematically investigates the gate-voltage-tunable spin caloritronic properties of transition metal (Fe/Cr)-doped Janus MoSeTe nanoribbons through combined non-equilibrium Green's function and density functional theory. These results reveal that Cr-doped Janus MoSeTe devices demonstrate a perfect spin Seebeck effect with pure spin current under specific gate voltages. The Fe-doped system exhibits two negative differential thermal resistance peaks and achieves 100% thermal-driven spin polarization through effective spin filtering. Notably, both the magnitude and polarity of these negative differential thermal resistance peaks can be controlled via gate voltage, which is attributed to the fact that the gate voltage can modulate the spin-resolved transmission spectrum. Furthermore, these devices demonstrate a significant spin figure of merit ( ZT sp, max ∼ 42) near the Fermi level at T = 300 K. These findings highlight the potential for developing high-efficiency spin caloritronic devices and thermal management applications utilizing Fe/Cr-doped MoSeTe nanoribbons under a specific gate voltage.},

  abstract     = {The electron accumulation layer at the semiconductor nanowire surface can lead to intriguing transport phenomena and novel electronic applications. While much progress has been made in uncovering the effect of electron–phonon interactions on phonon transport in heavily doped semiconductors, the roles of the surface charge accumulation layer on thermal transport remain elusive. In this work, through measuring electrical and thermal conductivities of InAs nanowires of various diameters, we report a remarkable suppression of lattice thermal conductivity due to surface electron–phonon coupling. Contrary to the classical size effect due to electron-boundary scattering, the measured electrical conductivity of InAs nanowires increases as the diameter decreases. This observation stems from the enhanced contribution of surface electrons in smaller-diameter nanowires, which also renders a comparable electronic contribution to thermal conductivity alongside phonons. The extracted lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is reduced by ∼73% compared to previously reported values and those predicted by first-principles calculations for intrinsic InAs nanowires. This discrepancy is well explained by the transport models incorporating both surface electron–phonon coupling and phonon-boundary scattering at the nanowire surface. These findings not only provide direct experimental data for quantifying the impact of surface electron–phonon interactions on lattice thermal conductivity but also highlight the potential of surface-state engineering as a viable strategy for tailoring thermal transport in semiconductors for thermoelectric and nanoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the pressure-dependent structural evolution and optoelectronic behavior of MoO 3 under high pressure to 37.8 GPa, combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photocurrents, electrical conductivity, and theoretical calculations. Two distinct phase transitions in α-MoO 3 were observed: first to the MoO 3 -II phase at about 10.1 GPa, followed by conversion to the high-pressure MoO 3 -III phase at about 25.3 GPa. This structural evolution correlated with exceptional optoelectronic enhancement, demonstrating a 434-fold increase in the photocurrent density (from 0.0628 to 29.10 mA cm −2 ) and the corresponding responsivity (from 1.366 to 632.7 mA W −1 ) under 365 nm illumination at 37.8 GPa, relative to the corresponding values at 1.2 GPa. These enhancements arise from pressure-induced increases in electrical conductivity, bandgap narrowing, and improved light absorption. Notably, the high-pressure MoO 3 -II and MoO 3 -III phases exhibit photodetection extending into the near-infrared band (980 nm). These anomalous phenomena can be attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which introduce in-gap states positioned below the conduction band minimum, thereby facilitating efficient carrier excitation across both visible and infrared spectral regions. The findings highlight high-pressure engineering as an effective approach to optimize the optoelectronic performance of MoO 3 , advancing its potential utility in photodetector systems.},

  abstract     = {SnSe, a type of class IV-metal monochalcogenide, exhibits good electrical and optoelectronic properties in the near-infrared band. Due to the low symmetry of the lattice structure, two-dimensional SnSe is expected to show significant anisotropic electric and optoelectric properties. However, this anisotropy has not been fully studied until now because of the difficulty of obtaining high quality single-crystalline SnSe nanosheets. In this manuscript, single-crystalline SnSe nanosheets with thicknesses varying from 7 to 100 nm and a lateral size of 10 μ m were deposited via a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition method. The high quality of pure α-SnSe single-crystalline nanosheets was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the anisotropic electric transport properties of SnSe were investigated. Higher conductance along the zigzag direction was observed under all gate biases. The anisotropic ratio of conductance is as high as 2.1 under zero gate bias. Finally, the anisotropic photoelectric properties were characterized with the 532 and 808 nm lasers, respectively. A higher photocurrent and responsivity were obtained along the zigzag direction, which may be a result of higher conductance along the specific direction. More importantly, the photoresponsivity of 132 A/W with a specific detectivity of 2.75 × 10 8 was achieved with an 808 nm laser, which rivals the performance of current commercial infrared photodetectors used at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of electronic industry, there is an increasing demand for electro-ceramics with enhanced performances. Two-dimensional materials typically exhibit unique physicochemical properties, making them promising candidates for ceramic-based composites. Herein, one-step cold sintering process is proposed to tailor the microstructures and performances of Na 2 Mo 2 O 7 ceramics through the incorporation of Ti 3 C 2 T x (MXene) material. Using de-ionized water as a transient liquid phase, (1 − γ)Na 2 Mo 2 O 7 –γTi 3 C 2 T x (NMOM) composites are densified at 120 °C. The MXene nanosheets are uniformly distributed along the grain boundaries, forming continuous conductive networks, which significantly enhance the overall electrical conductivity and transform Na 2 Mo 2 O 7 from dielectric to semiconductor. The negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior and material constant of the composites are manipulated by tuning the MXene content. A high material constant of 7324 K and temperature coefficient of resistivity of −7.0% K −1 are achieved, with the conduction mechanism dominated by small polaron hopping and an activation energy of 0.63 eV. These findings highlight the potential of NMOM composites for NTC thermistor applications and demonstrate cold sintering process as an effective route for the design of high-performance semiconducting ceramics with MXenes.},

  abstract     = {Thermally induced martensitic phase transitions are broadly divided into two classes—isothermal and athermal. While the isothermal transformations correspond to the diffusive nucleation-and-growth phenomenon associated with the first-order phase transitions, the athermal transformations are characterized by absence of diffusion. Here, the phase evolution at fixed temperature is arrested. The phase transformation in real martensites of course only approximates the two extreme scenarios. It has been recently argued [Mukhuti et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 076901 (2025)] that this athermal character combined with the return point memory property of the hysteresis loops opens up the possibility of the use of such athermal martensites as thermal-breach memory where a small and reversible temperature perturbation can be inferred from the irreversible phase evolution of the material. In this Letter, we examine the possibility of the use of vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) films, which show a hysteretic metal–insulator transition above room temperature for such applications. We find that the metastable states show a temporal evolution of less than 2% at constant temperature over a period of 15 h and during this period a thermal perturbation of 1 K experienced by the sample in a suitably prepared metastable state can be inferred from irreversible change in its resistance. Apart from usage in thermal analogs of logic units in neuromorphic computational devices, the highly sensitive and stable behavior of these athermal states of VO 2 establishes the viability of thermal-breach memory near room temperature.},

Leveraging the inherent oxygen vacancy-mediated trapping mechanism, ferroelectric BiFeO 3 (BFO) enables a tunable charge confinement. Herein, through an improved sol-gel method, the preparation protocol of BFO was rigorously engineered, enabling realization of centimeter-scale crystalline films on SiO 2 /Si substrates. Integrating BFO with two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor MoS 2 , we constructed a heterostructure-based charge-trapping memory featuring enhanced retention and scalable integration. The device exhibits a maximum memory window of ∼90 V, an ON/OFF current ratio of ∼10 5 , and a write–erase current ratio of ∼10 3 . With a saturation storage capacity of up to 10 13 cm −2 and the well-defined charge retention mechanism, the MoS 2 /BFO heterostructure also mimics biological synaptic behaviors, offering alternative prospects for BFO-based memories and neuromorphic computing.},

The near-field thermal radiation is measured using a custom-fabricated micro-thermocouple with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. The key results reveal the substantial RHT enhancement at subwavelength gaps (<100 nm), driven by surface phonon polariton excitation in the structured silica medium. Theoretical analysis shows that while the effective medium theory qualitatively captures the fundamental coupling mechanisms, it systematically overestimates the heat flux in the deep near-field regime (<50 nm)—highlighting the limitations of homogenization approaches in resolving the nanoscale structural effects. This work underscores the critical roles of nanostructure geometry and material phonon dispersion in regulating the near-field heat flux, providing critical insights for establishing the design principles for next-generation thermal management devices based on phonon-polariton materials.},

  abstract     = {Dielectric metasurfaces supporting bound states in the continuum (BICs) exhibit exceptional capabilities for capturing optical fields and are thus widely utilized to enhance light–matter interactions at nanoscales, such as nonlinear optical effects and chiroptic effects. However, it remains a considerable challenge to simultaneously realize significant high-order nonlinear circular dichroism (CD) and strong high-order nonlinear responses. In this work, we theoretically propose high-efficiency third harmonic generation (THG), direct fifth harmonic generation (dFHG), cascaded fifth harmonic generation (cFHG), and corresponding high-order nonlinear chiroptic effects in a Si-based metasurface based on the accidental BICs (A-BICs). Strong THG, dFHG, and cFHG signals, respectively, with high conversion efficiencies of 1.1%, 1.31 × 10 −9 , and 8.77 × 10 −6 are achieved under the fundamental pump intensity of 1 MW/cm 2 and the efficiency of dFHG is boosted by three orders of magnitude by the cascaded approach based on the degenerate four-wave mixing. Importantly, the generated FHG signals are located in the deep ultraviolet region with the full width at half maximum less than 0.15 nm, significantly contributing to the development of deep ultraviolet lasers. Furthermore, strong linear CD, THG CD, dFHG CD, and cFHG CD are also achieved with the maximum values approaching 1. Our findings provide a feasible approach for developing high-efficiency high-order nonlinearity and near-perfect high-order chiral nonlinear optical devices.},

However, the current techniques for designing a metalens are limited to obtain polarization-dependent or polarization-independent focal points, preventing its versatile applications in modern optics. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach that can focus the left-handed circularly polarized and/or right-handed circularly polarized components of terahertz (THz) waves to simultaneously generate polarization-dependent and polarization-independent focal points. First, a metalens is designed to obtain two focal points where the intensity of one focal point can be controlled by controlling polarization of incident THz waves, while the intensity of another focal point is fixed under the illumination of THz waves with arbitrary polarization. Second, a metalens with intensity-tunable multiple focal points and an intensity-fixed focal point is experimentally demonstrated. Third, the single to multifocal imaging (i.e., reconfigurable imaging) can be realized using the designed metalens without the aid of reconfigurable materials. In addition, a framework for mimicking logic gates is designed based on the proposed metalens. This robust approach for designing metalens with reconfigurable focal points may open a window in developing multifunctional devices with potential applications in imaging, sensing, and communications.},

Red InGaN QWs are grown on GaN on sapphire (0001) substrates with off-angles of 0.3° or 1.0° toward the [1 1 ¯ 00] direction using metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The GaN underlayer on the 0.3°-off substrate exhibits a smooth surface, whereas that on the 1.0°-off substrate exhibits step bunching, resulting in micrometer-scale spatial variations in local off-angles. Surface defects of small V-pits, large V-pits surrounded by anomalous growth islands, and trench defects are densely distributed across the entire area of the InGaN QWs grown on the 0.3°-off templates. In contrast, the QWs on the 1.0°-off templates exhibit reduced densities of both anomalous growth islands and trench defects in regions with local off-angles exceeding ∼ 1°. These results indicate that preferential step-flow growth on vicinal surfaces with high step densities, which inherit the atomic ordering of the underlayers, suppresses the formation of basal stacking faults associated with trench defects and of anomalous growth islands. A part of the defect-reduced regions on the 1.0°-off templates exhibit enhanced red-emission intensities compared with the QWs on the 0.3°-off templates with high defect densities. This partial improvement indicates the presence of nonradiative recombination centers related to the surface defects and other defects such as edge dislocations or point defects.},

  abstract     = {Very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR, 14–30 μ m) detection is crucial for observing low-temperature objects, such as those in infrared astronomy and Earth remote sensing, where focal plane arrays (FPAs) with ultra-low dark current and broadband spectral response are essential. Silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) photodetectors are promising candidates due to their intrinsically low dark current and sensitivity in the VLWIR range. However, simultaneously achieving a broad spectral response from 14 to 30 μ m and high pixel-to-pixel uniformity remains a significant challenge. In this work, we report a broadband VLWIR FPA based on phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P) BIB photodetectors. We designed a Si:P BIB architecture and a readout integrated circuit optimized for deep cryogenic operation. As a result, we developed a 16 × 16 prototype FPA with a 50% cutoff wavelength extended to 32.2 μ m. Operating at 4 K, the array exhibits a peak detectivity of ∼1 × 10 11 cm Hz 1/2 ·W −1 and a dark current below 40 fA. This work provides a solution for future broadband VLWIR detection on both space-based and ground-based platforms.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric semiconductors hold significant scientific and technological value, with extensive applications in thermoelectric power generation, infrared detection, and heat management. The thermal radiation absorption of thermoelectric semiconductors is crucial to their thermal-to-electrical conversion efficiency. However, high thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) lead-based chalcogenides (e.g., PbS) exhibit absorption limited to the short-wave infrared range. This limitation arises from their direct interband transition, which lead to significant energy loss in the long-wave radiation region. Herein, we designed a SrTiO 3 /PbSe heterostructure with interfacial strong longitudinal acoustic phonon interactions. This design extends the response spectrum of PbSe from mid-wave infrared (<4.5 μ m) to long-wave infrared (>8 μ m) using the long-wave infrared phonon-absorbing material SrTiO 3 . The SrTiO 3 /PbSe heterostructure demonstrates high sensitivity to long-wave blackbody radiation (8–14 μ m) at room temperature, achieving a blackbody responsivity of 1.62 × 10 4 V W −1 and a detectivity of 1.75 × 10 8 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 . Our work provides a unique physical model to enhance optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency in thermoelectric semiconductors by means of phonon-mediated spectral broadening, with promising applications in long-wave infrared detection and thermoelectric generators.},

Here, we propose an adjustable weak measurement differential microscopy that integrates a flat differentiator with weak measurement to achieve flexible, high-precision phase imaging. By modulating the orientation and incident angle of a uniaxial crystal, we demonstrate tunable spatial differentiation in both strength and direction, enabling isotropic edge detection and phase mining. Furthermore, the system enables rapid switching between optical spatial differentiation and differential interference contrast imaging modes via post-selection state adjustments to accommodate different application scenarios. The results demonstrate this miniaturized, modular approach enables breakthrough capabilities in automated sensing, label-free microscopy, and optical computing systems.},

Significantly, the photogenerated carrier dynamics in PM6 can be modulated and elucidated through interactions with ionic liquids, thereby enhancing the device performance. This device mimics biological synaptic plasticity and demonstrates significant potential for image preprocessing, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.6% after denoising.

  abstract     = {Graphene films are composed of graphene layers that exhibit high levels of order, thereby enabling their use as aligned emission arrays. However, the limitations of the film are attributable to its electric field shielding effect, which is a consequence of the severe π–π stacking. In this study, the stacking was mitigated by incorporating graphene oxide, thereby enhancing the field emission performance of graphene composite films. Graphene oxide has the capacity to modify the interlayer spacing of the film, as well as the morphology of its cross section, when subjected to heat treatment. The combination of these two factors results in a reduction of the electric field shielding effect and an enhancement of the field emission performance. The efficacy of this method is substantiated by a reduction in turn-on and threshold field strengths from 2.34 and 3.35 V/ μ m to 1.27 and 2.43 V/ μ m, respectively. Additionally, an enhancement in the field enhancement factor from 4306 to 11 396 has been observed. The slope of the linear fit voltage over time for films has been determined to be 0.001 kV/h at 3 mA@50 kA/cm 2 .

By systematically tuning the MoO 3 thickness, we achieve a maximum output power of 56.1 pW at a temperature gradient of 3 K using a 4 nm MoO 3 interlayer, which surpasses the performance of conventional OTE devices employing Au electrodes by 45%. Comprehensive electrical characterizations, including the transmission line method-based contact resistance analysis and temperature-dependent conductivity measurements, reveal that the optimized interfacial energy barrier of ∼0.10 eV facilitates efficient energy filtering, enhancing the Seebeck coefficient without degrading bulk transport properties.

  abstract     = {Different from traditional imaging methods that rely on plane array detectors, single-pixel imaging (SPI) utilizes a single detector without spatial resolution to acquire images. However, achieving high-resolution reconstruction with SPI typically requires a large number of measurements, which limits the development of SPI. To achieve a balance between high resolution and frame rate, an SPI method based on optical encoding and multiplexing is proposed and demonstrated. In this method, the beam modulated by illumination patterns is subjected to orthogonal space-time encoding to achieve the redistribution of sampling density across different sub-regions of the target. After optical multiplexing, the combined light intensity is collected by a single-pixel detector and decoded to reconstruct each sub-region. Consequently, sub-regions assigned higher sampling densities exhibit improved detail resolution, more closely matching human visual perception compared to those with lower sampling. This work overcomes the limitation of traditional SPI approaches that impose uniform resolution across the entire field of view. With the introduction of space-time encoding, sampling density can be flexibly allocated among various regions. This enables the reconstruction of large-scale scenes at a low overall sampling rate while still achieving higher resolution in selected regions of interest. Moreover, the proposed method can be integrated with various reconstruction algorithms to further reduce computational costs and acquisition time.},

Specifically, the device demonstrates improved endurance, with the number of switching cycles increasing from 122 to 2791, and a higher switching resistance ratio, with the maximum on/off ratio rising from 10 5 to 10 8 .

  abstract     = {Brain-inspired neuromorphic computing has been widely considered a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional von Neumann architecture in the current computer system. As an essential component of the neuromorphic system, the artificial synaptic device exhibits great potential in adaptive learning. Due to their controllable channel conductance and CMOS compatibility, solid electrolyte-gated synaptic transistors (EGSTs) have garnered significant interest as next-generation neuromorphic devices. However, most of the existing EGSTs suffer from rapid self-diffusion of the ions, making it difficult to maintain the stable channel conductance states. In this work, the synaptic transistors were fabricated with indium–gallium–zinc oxide as the channel layer, Al 2 O 3 as the charge trapping layer, and ZrO 2 as the solid electrolyte layer. The self-diffusion of the hydrogen ions can be suppressed by the positive charges trapped in the Al 2 O 3 layer, which significantly improves the long-term plasticity (LTP) of the devices. By adjusting the presynaptic spike scheme, the typical synaptic behaviors, including excitatory postsynaptic current, paired-pulse facilitation, and the transition from short-term memory to long-term memory, were simulated. Based on the conductance modulation properties of the channel in the synaptic transistor, an artificial neural network was constructed for pattern recognition, and a high accuracy of 95.4% was obtained. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for the enhancement of the LTP of the synaptic transistor.},

  abstract     = {The presence of unscreened polarization at the surface of ferroelectric thin films can impair their functional response. One recently proposed way to improve screening is by using “molecular electrodes”: molecules with chemically resonant bonds (i.e., energy-equivalent internal distributions of chemical bonds), such that their internal charge distribution can adapt to different depolarizing fields. However, while molecular electrodes can provide for a good electrostatic screening, we do not know what their dynamic response is, and in particular, whether they allow for agile switching of ferroelectric polarization. Here, we compare the switching dynamics of BaTiO 3 (BTO) epitaxial thin films with and without a surface layer of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a molecular electrode with a bipolar screening capacity. We test the domain-writing dynamics by running the biased tip of a piezoresponse force microscope across the surface of the ferroelectric films at increasing scanning speeds and studying the continuity and width of the written domains. Our results reveal orders-of-magnitude enhancement of the writing speed when the BTO surface is functionalized. pABA molecules thus emerge as a useful paradigm in electrodes, providing superior screening and localized writing capability of chemisorbed charge, but with much faster dynamics.},

Nevertheless, their practical deployment in harsh operating environments, particularly in electric vehicles and aerospace power electronics, remains challenging due to the inherent thermal instability of conventional polymer dielectrics. Herein, we report an all-polymer dielectric composite (APDC) material fabricated from partially miscible polyetherimide (PEI)/polyamide-imide (PAI) blends that exhibits significantly improved high-temperature capacitive energy storage properties, including breakdown strength ( E b ), discharge energy density ( U d ), and charge–discharge efficiency ( η ). The performance enhancement stems from the self-assembled nanoscale interfacial architectures comprising uniformly dispersed PAI domains within the PEI matrix, coupled with the intrinsic energy band structure mismatch between PEI and PAI (notably in electron affinity). These structural characteristics effectively create deep charge traps, resulting in a substantial reduction of leakage current density by more than one order of magnitude compared to pristine PEI under elevated temperatures and high-electric fields. Notably, the developed APDC materials feature a straightforward, efficient, and cost-effective fabrication process, rendering them highly promising for scalable production of high-performance dielectric films for high-temperature capacitors.},

The effectiveness of this strategy is substantiated through the creation of a ScCrCO 2 monolayer, where deliberate polarization modulation induces a reversible switching of the easy magnetization axis between in-plane and out-of-plane configurations. This transition stems from dynamic changes in the crystal field splitting of Cr ions. Using atomically resolved and orbital-decomposed magnetic anisotropy energy calculations, we uncover the microscopic origin of polarization-driven magnetic anisotropy in ScCrCO 2 . Moreover, an accompanying electronic phase transition from a half-metallic to semiconducting state is observed. Our results not only demonstrate a pathway for nonvolatile electrical control of 2D ferromagnets but also advance fundamental understanding and practical applications in magnetoelectric coupling.},

The DCP + ACP method promotes polarization rotation, resulting in a net macroscopic polarization that exceeds that of crystals processed by conventional DCP alone.

The separation of spin injection and spin detection in the LSV makes it a useful platform for studying fundamental physics (e.g., spin relaxation) and building nanoscale devices (spin transistors, magnetic sensors, etc.). To drive many LSV-based prototypes closer to production, there is a need to evaluate the LSV performance under high-frequency (e.g., gigahertz) operations, especially with information spectra rather than single tones. Here we calculate gigahertz spin transport in a nonmagnetic channel of the LSV using a pseudo-random binary sequence as an input signal to mimic information. We solved the time-dependent spin drift-diffusion equation and provide an integral solution for the transmitted spin polarization. A frequency-dependent spin transport length is found that shows high-frequency spin signals transmit much less efficiently than low-frequency spin signals. An applied electric field consistent with the high resistance of thin films is shown to improve transmission. The transmitted signal strength and its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are analyzed with respect to the transmission distance, the diffusion coefficient, and an applied electric field along the channel; these effects can be explained in the frequency domain. Finally, we calculated gigahertz spin transport in a thin aluminum channel and obtained an SNR > 20 dB ⁠ , which is a value that exceeds the SNR of the input signal. This demonstrates the great potential of LSV-based miniaturized spintronic devices to transmit information in high-frequency regimes.},

  abstract     = {The capability of the spin–orbit torque (SOT) generated via phenomena such as the spin Hall effect in heavy metals, in switching the magnetization of an adjacent magnetic material, has been studied extensively over the last decade. The efficiency of SOT generation is commonly quantified in terms of the spin Hall angle (SHA). In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that implanting platinum (Pt) with phosphorus (P), resulting in Pt (P) with different implantation doses, increases SHA by a factor of 7, from 0.06 (dose of zero) to 0.43 (dose of 10 × 10 16 ions/cm 2 ). The enhanced SHA, along with factors such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and resistivity, leads to reduction of the critical current density for switching the perpendicular magnetization of ferrimagnetic rare earth-transition metal alloy Gd 26 Fe 74 , by a factor of nearly 27, from 4.0 × 10 11 A/m 2 (zero) to 1.5 × 10 10 A/m 2 (10 × 10 16 ions/cm 2 ). Furthermore, the switching current density at zero thermal fluctuations and thermal stability factor were evaluated and found to be 2.0 × 10 10 A/m 2 and 61.4 (10 × 10 16 ions/cm 2 ), with the latter being sufficiently above the required threshold for commercial memory applications. Our results suggest that Pt (P) could be a strong candidate in realizing efficient SOT driven magnetization switching, leading to the development of improved memory and logic devices in the future.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets and devices have garnered significant attention owing to the stabilization of long-range magnetic order down to atomic limit, and the prospect for quantum devices with unique functionalities. To achieve this objective, clarification of magnetotransport properties and understanding of the relevant interactions with lowering of dimensions are of extreme importance. Here, the magnetotransport properties of few atomic layer Fe 3 GeTe 2 and (Co 0.25 Fe 0.75 ) 3 GeTe 2 nanoflake devices have been investigated. Magnetotransport investigations with applied magnetic field along the easy-axis show anomalous Hall effect, while that for applied magnetic field along the hard-axis reveal an unusual behavior. Atomistic calculations considering the presence of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and local symmetry-breaking interactions reveal the critical role of magnetic frustration effect assisted by thermal fluctuations, leading to a non-zero scalar spin chirality manifesting in an unconventional Hall effect. The present result clarifies the underlying interactions in few-layer 2D vdW ferromagnetic material system, important for the understanding of non-collinear spin configurations in vdW magnets for 2D spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {We studied the magnetic properties of a Pt/Co bilayer sample with an ultrathin cobalt layer deposited as a wedge with a thickness between 0.7 and 1.4 nm. After exposure to air, the top 0.5 nm of Co oxidizes, leading to a 0.9 nm-thick CoO surface layer. The residual metallic cobalt is still ferromagnetic at room temperature, with a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy even down to ≈ 0.2–0.3 nm thickness. These properties are conserved for several months after deposition. Anomalous Hall effect measurements show the presence of an exchange bias field and a blocking temperature between 120 and 150 K, indicating that despite being ultrathin, the CoO layer acquires antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. We attribute the large exchange bias field (up to 0.9 T at 4 K) to the ultralow thickness of the ferromagnetic Co layer. These results show that simply exposing an ultrathin Co layer to air in order to form a native CoO oxide layer allows obtaining functional properties competing with the best reported so far for optimized Co/CoO layers and core-shell nanoparticles.},

The field-dependent frequencies were also measured using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and corroborated by micromagnetic simulations for different in-plane directions of an external magnetic field. We find that the acoustic and magnonic excitations can be tuned in frequency and magnetic field by adjusting the array periodicity, filling ratio, as well as the orientation of the nanostripes relative to the external field. Additionally, we discuss the presence of features in the signal intensity at the magnon–phonon crossings, introduced by dynamical phase effects due to the impulsive coherent excitation.},

In this family of compounds, Mn 3 SnC has a concurrent ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state below T ∼ 285 K, along with the Berry curvature-driven anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Here, we present AHE in Ge- and Zn-doped Mn 3 SnC compounds: Mn 3 Sn 0.5 Ge 0.5 C (MSGC) and Mn 3 Sn 0.5 Zn 0.5 C (MSZC). MSGC undergoes paramagnetic (PM) to a concurrent AFM/FM transition at T C ∼ 300 K, whereas MSZC exhibits a PM to FM transition at T C ∼ 240 K, followed by an FM to ferrimagnetic transition at T N ∼ 170 K. The electronic transport in these compounds is influenced by the electron–phonon and electron–magnon scatterings and exhibits anomalous Hall resistivity ( ⁠ ρ x y A ⁠ ). Our study suggests that AHE in these compounds arises due to skew scattering and intrinsic Berry curvature mechanisms, and electron–phonon and electron–magnon scattering play an important role in skew scattering at high temperature. The doping of Mn 3 SnC with Ge and Zn atoms notably enhances the value of its anomalous Hall conductivity.},

However, its limited propagation length and low generation efficiency hinder further technological progress. As an alternative, orbital current—arising from electron orbital angular momentum—shows considerable promise, especially in metals with large orbital Hall conductivity. Moreover, orbital current in light metals can travel farther than spin current, underscoring its potential for next-generation spin-orbitronic devices. Despite these prospects, direct experimental verification of orbital currents has remained elusive. Here, we report the electrical detection of orbital-charge conversion, known as the inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE), by performing dynamical spin injection experiments on CoFeB/Cr/(Pt, Ta, W) multilayer structures. Our results provide a direct observation of IOHE, paving the way for advanced spin-orbitronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Many modern spintronic devices are based on large arrays of magnetic elements, where the interaction between them and their magnetic textures is often a key part of their performance. The experimental characterization of such arrays is challenging because it involves the knowledge of the magnetization process of millions of single elements over areas as large as several square millimeters. When the magnetic textures within the nanoelements interact between them, a characterization over the entire array can be complicated. Here, we show how the interaction between vortex textures in adjacent ferromagnetic dots can be read in a First Order Reversal Curve (FORC) diagram. Using a 9 mm 2 array of ferromagnetic nanodots, we show how the shape and position of the prominent features in the FORC diagram (FD) describe the vortex nucleation and annihilation process. The intensity of these peaks gives information on how smooth the mobility of the vortex within the nanodot is. Also, by comparing the intensity of the main features, the FD is particularly sensitive to when the vortices start interacting strongly with neighboring vortices. Micromagnetic simulations and measurements in arrays of different materials confirm our interpretation. With this work, we show the potential of the FD for disentangling the average magnetization process and the complex interactions between the different elements in a large array of nanostructures.},

In this study, the spin reorientation temperature of Tb-doped SmFeO 3 (Sm 0.7 Tb 0.3 FeO 3 ) single crystal is lowered to approximately 350 K, making it more suitable for room-temperature applications. Notably, the magnetic compensation point is absent at low temperatures, and both R 3+ and Fe 3+ ion moments can be fully saturated under high magnetic fields, suggesting that Tb 3+ doping drives the R 3+ and Fe 3+ sublattices toward ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the hysteresis loop along the a -axis transitions from a double triangle shape below the spin reorientation temperature to a rectangular shape above the spin reorientation temperature, and the nucleation field exhibits a strong dependence on both the measurement temperature and the maximum applied magnetic field. The above results can be explained by a modified two-domain model with mean field correction. The results of magnetic domain measurements indicate that the emergence of the double-triangular hysteresis loop is jointly determined by domain wall motion and the nonlinear response of the parasitic magnetic moment along the a -axis. These findings provide valuable insights and material for advancing the use of R FeO 3 compounds in room-temperature spintronics.},

The few previous works on this type of magnetic levitation all required magnets rotating on the order of 200 Hz. Here, we investigate the influence of applying a static magnetic field on the rotation axis and show that this can lower the needed rotation frequency to below 50 Hz. We explain this by a detailed analysis of the force producing levitation, which is a superposition of a repelling force caused by the off-axis (rotating) magnetic field and an attractive force due to the on-axis field. We study this force and resulting levitation experimentally, analytically, and numerically for three different rotor magnet configurations, showing that trends in the levitation distance and frequency range can be accurately predicted from both the numerical and analytical models.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectric resonators are a common building block for signal processing because of their miniature size, low insertion loss, and high quality factor. As consumer electronics push to millimeter wave frequencies, designers must increase the operating frequency of the resonator. The current state-of-the-art approach to increase the operating frequency is to decrease the thickness of the piezoelectric film to shorten the acoustic wavelength or to use higher order modes. Unfortunately, maintaining high quality factors typically requires thicker piezoelectric layers. Thinner individual layers suffer from higher defect densities and increased relative losses from surface related damping, which degrade the electromechanical coupling and quality factor. While acoustic high order modes can also increase operating frequency, the electromechanical coupling rapidly decreases with increasing mode number. Here, we overcome these limitations by utilizing a piezoelectric stack of three layers of lithium niobate with alternating crystallographic orientations to preferentially support higher order modes and thereby enhance the electromechanical coupling without degrading the quality factor. Our approach improves the figure of merit of millimeter wave acoustic resonators by roughly an order of magnitude greater compared to state-of-the-art piezoelectric resonators above 60 GHz. This concept of alternating crystallographic orientations facilitates a path to develop millimeter wave resonators with high figures of merit, low insertion loss, and miniature footprints, enabling applications in millimeter wave signal processing and computing.},

Near-field (NF) signals were measured on gold UTMFs with thicknesses ranging from 5.6 to 69.4 nm. A sharp drop in the NF signal intensity was observed near the critical thickness ( d c = 9.2 nm), marking the metal-to-insulator transition. This decline was linked to reduced free electron density N , caused by structural changes like island formation, cracks, and reduced film thickness. These constraints confined electron motion, lowering the plasma frequency ( ω p ), as described by a thickness-dependent Drude model. Additionally, measurements of NF signal decay length revealed the thermal interaction range of evanescent fields, providing insights into near-field heat transfer. Supported by the local density of states theory, the findings emphasize the role of electron density beneath the probe tip in NF signals. These insights into film structure, electron dynamics, and NF thermal radiation, have applications in nanoscale thermal management and infrared sensing technologies.},

The resonance frequency was measured using an all-optical experimental system integrating a pump, a probe, and heating beams at several time instants, which enabled the simultaneous evaluation of the temperature-dependent coefficients of Young's modulus and shear modulus.

These are significantly lower than those of conventional MO semiconductors, which can be attributed to the localized phonon modes in SOD-MO. Further analysis demonstrates that the intensity of 4ph scattering in SOD-MO is notably stronger than that of 3ph scattering, due to the interaction between the lone-pair electrons and the bonding electrons. This anomalous phenomenon, not reported in conventional materials, indicates that SOD-MO exhibits unique thermal transport properties.

  abstract     = {Investigation of the growth and properties of binary ScN can aid in the understanding of its ferroelectric ternary alloys with GaN and AlN, but there are no existing data for ScN grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In this work, ScN growth by MOCVD was demonstrated using the Sc precursor (EtCp) 2 Sc(dbt). A broad range of growth temperatures, pressures, and V/III ratios were tested to investigate the impact of growth parameters on the properties of MOCVD-grown ScN. Approximately 100 nm-thick ScN films with growth rates from 0.06 to 0.20 Å/s were deposited on c -sapphire, (0001) GaN, Si-face 4H-SiC, and (001) Si. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that ScN films were solely (111)-oriented on both sapphire and GaN. Hall effect measurements revealed very high n-type electrical charge in the samples. The carrier concentrations of ScN on sapphire ranged from 2.1 × 10 20 to 7.2 × 10 20 cm −3 , with electron mobilities in the range of 20–7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . ScN films on GaN exhibited carrier concentrations from 9.6 × 10 19 to 2.5 × 10 20 cm −3 and electron mobilities from 42 to 8.5 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The lowest sheet resistance of 45 Ω/□ (resistivity of 5.2 × 10 −4 Ω-cm) was achieved for an ScN on sapphire film. These results indicate the potential for integrating ScN into the next generation of nitride electronics through MOCVD growth.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the enhancement of the electrical performance in vertical β -Ga 2 O 3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) through proton irradiation followed by annealing processes, along with the underlying physical mechanisms. Initially, the rectification behavior of these SBDs is significantly degraded following 5 MeV proton irradiation. However, for the device treated post annealing, following irradiation (D1-A500), the carrier concentration ( N D ) decreases by 72.1%, while the breakdown voltage ( BV ) increases by 124.5%. Deep level transient spectroscopy analysis reveals an increase in the concentration of acceptor traps, E 2 * ( E C -0.74 eV), and the appearance of a new defect peak, E 2 ( E C -0.86 eV), attributed to proton irradiation and subsequent annealing. E 2 is possibly associated with oxygen antisites ( O GaII ). Further simulations using technology computer aided design further verify that a reduction in N D improves the BV. Therefore, these findings elucidate the effect of proton irradiation on vertical β -Ga 2 O 3 SBDs and emphasize the recovery of the devices by post-annealing treatment, providing valuable insights for application in radiation environments.},

  abstract     = {Single-crystal tin selenide (SnSe) is a promising thermoelectric material with the current record figure of merit at 923 K. To improve the thermoelectric performance of SnSe at ambient conditions, manipulating the charge-carrier transition process has attracted great interest recently. Here, different from static strategies of carrier doping or band engineering, we propose and report a nonequilibrium and complete switching of charge-carrier transitions in SnSe between the interband process and the intraband process. In a broad range of 420–520 nm, the transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy confirms the intraband/interband transition switching with an ultrafast picosecond optical modulation speed and a near-unity degree of completeness, achieved solely by changing the probe pulse polarization. The theoretical analysis of transition dipole moments and transition selection rules links this nonequilibrium-controlled carrier transition with the anisotropic electronic structure and glide-mirror symmetry of SnSe. These results offer insights and raise attractive possibilities to enhance the power factor by exploiting the dynamical electronic anisotropy of thermoelectric materials.},

Notably, the β phase remains metastable at ambient temperature and pressure after the HPT load is released.

  abstract     = {Recently, altermagnets demonstrate numerous unique physical phenomena due to their inherent antiferromagnetic coupling and spontaneous spin splitting, which are anticipated to enable innovative spintronic devices. However, the rare two-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet the requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the growth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti 2 Se 2 S with out-of-plane altermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic properties of altermagnet Ti 2 Se 2 S are highly dependent on the onsite electron correlation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y points are protected by the mirror M xy symmetry rather than the time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and piezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley splitting of monolayer Ti 2 Se 2 S can be as high as ∼ 500 meV. More interestingly, the direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial strain; based on this, we have defined logical 0, +1, and −1 states for data transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic diagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in the experiment. Our findings have enriched the candidate materials of two-dimensional altermagnet for the ultra-fast and low power consumption device applications.},

In this work, we systematically investigated the molecular beam epitaxy growth of CdTe films on graphene/Ge substrates. The effects of graphene defects on the nucleation behavior and crystal structure of CdTe grains were elucidated, and epitaxial models for CdTe on three types of graphene/Ge surfaces were proposed. Furthermore, we evaluated the crystal quality of CdTe films grown on different graphene/Ge substrates and found that the quality of the epitaxial films is strongly correlated with the defects in graphene.},

However, the relatively low switching efficiency (<60%) in spin–orbit torque (SOT) systems has limited the development of low-power spin devices based on 2D heterostructures. In this study, we synthesize 2D quasi-layered Cr 3 Te 4 ferromagnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy via chemical vapor deposition method and investigate the SOT effect in WTe 2 /Cr 3 Te 4 heterostructure through harmonic Hall measurements and current-induced magnetization switching. The heterostructure demonstrates a substantial damping-like effective field, reaching 800 Oe per 10 6 A cm −2 for spin-up and −480 Oe per 10 6 A cm −2 for spin-down configurations. Remarkably, current-induced magnetization reversal measurement reveals an unprecedented switching ratio of ∼90% with a low critical current density of 1.85 × 10 6 A cm −2 , surpassing previously reported values in other 2D heterostructures. These findings not only deepen our understanding of efficient SOT switching mechanisms but also provide a critical step toward the realization of next-generation low-power spintronic devices.},

This alloy has a columnar grain structure with preferential grain orientation along the [001] A -direction. Microalloying with 0.3% boron leads to the formation of a multiphase structure consisting of austenite with a B2/L2 1 -structure, as well as borides and γ -phase particles primarily located along grain boundaries. After aging at 873 K for 1 h, austenite with an ordered L2 1 -structure forms, and γ ′-phase particles (up to 400 nm in size) precipitate inside the grains. The preferential orientation of grains along the [001] A -direction and the multiphase structure formed by boron microalloying result in high strength with significant plasticity. The as-cast and aged alloys demonstrate the elastocaloric effect with stable adiabatic temperature change, ΔT ad , over a wide temperature range: ΔT EC = 125 K and ΔT EC = 90 K, respectively. The ΔT ad reaches (9.4 ± 0.5) K in the as-cast alloy and (8.3 ± 0.5) K in the aged alloy and corresponds to the experimental values of ΔT ad = 9–11 K for [001] A -oriented NiFeGa(Co) single crystals.

It involves a membrane with periodic holes in a square pattern, with carbon iron powder as the absorbent material and silicone as the matrix. Radar cross section measurements confirm the PhC absorber's performance, with maximum absorption of 53 dB and a considerably large effective bandwidth. The PhC absorber exhibits magnetic tunability, and a magnetic field shifts the maximum absorption position to higher frequencies and widens the effective bandwidth. Increasing the number of absorber layers in the stackable PhC configuration lowers the resonant frequency and widens the relative bandwidth. With its superior absorption capability, tunability, stackability, flexibility, and feasible fabrication process, the PhC absorber demonstrates considerable potential for various absorbing meta-devices.},

  abstract     = {Molybdenum oxide films offer a rich variety of properties for diverse applications, but exclusive synthesis of desired phases is a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen flow ratio f O 2 = [O 2 ]/[Ar + O 2 ] is crucial not only for phase selection of non-layered monoclinic MoO 2 and layered orthorhombic α-MoO 3 but also for controlling grain size and preferred orientation. Both mica and sapphire support exclusive MoO 2 formation for 0.15 ≤ f O 2 ≤ 0.25 at deposition temperatures T dep = 400 and 500 °C, while α-MoO 3 forms only at T dep = 400 °C for 0.35 ≤ f O 2 ≤ 0.5. Within the f O 2 windows favoring each phase, high f O 2 fosters large grains with out-of-plane 0k0 texture, except for MoO 2 on c-sapphire at T dep = 500 °C, where no f O 2 -texture correlation is discernible. These findings provide a framework for rational synthesis of single-phase monoclinic MoO 2 and orthorhombic MoO 3 with control over texture and microstructure to access desired properties.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor grafting is pivotal for the heterogeneous integration of materials in electronics and optoelectronics, offering isolation of crystal growth from the substrate and enabling combinations of semiconductor heterojunctions with large lattice mismatches. The ultrathin dielectric layer at the heterojunction interface plays a pivotal role in addressing the interface dangling bonds and surface states, essential for effective semiconductor grafting. This study evaluates the effects of ultrathin SiN x , Al 2 O 3 , and SiO 2 passivation layers, deposited via atomic layer deposition, on GaN substrates. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that Al 2 O 3 passivation significantly improves carrier lifetimes, reduces surface recombination velocity, and enhances radiative efficiency. The normalized photoluminescence excitation spectra and calculated density of states confirm that Al 2 O 3 passivation enhances band edge sharpness, reduces defect-related states, and suppresses undesirable electronic transitions. In addition, the PL peak and full width at half maximum were observed for all passivation materials, demonstrating peak broadening after the deposition. This study highlights the potential of ultrathin surface passivation layers in enhancing GaN-based electronic and optoelectronic device performance, offering insights into the passivation mechanisms and their impact on charge carrier dynamics, which is crucial for developing future high-performance heterojunction devices.},

In this paper, we report theoretical and experimental investigations of optical refrigeration in thulium (Tm 3+ ) doped indium fluoride glass (Tm 3+ :InF 3 ) from room temperature. Comprehensive spectroscopic studies of Tm 3+ :InF 3 were conducted, and its cooling with 1875, 1900, and 1950 nm pump lasers at different power levels has been measured. Maximum cooling of 2.4 K was achieved with 4.4 W from a 1900 nm laser. The experimental results agree with our theoretical expectations. Our experiment has demonstrated that Tm 3+ :InF 3 has better cooling efficiency than Tm 3+ doped ZrF 4 -BaF 2 -LaF 3 -AlF 3 -NaF glass due to Tm 3+ :InF 3 's lower maximum phonon energy, which reduces non-radiative decay.},

The InGaBiAs is a highly mismatched semiconductor alloy, where small concentrations of Bi incorporation alter the electronic band structure due to the valence band anti-crossing interaction between Bi states and host InGaAs material, resulting in a decrease in the bandgap energy. In this work, photodetectors based on InGaBiAs alloys lattice matched to InP demonstrate an extension of the cutoff wavelength beyond 2 μ m. Dark current density, minority carrier lifetime, and responsivity strongly depend on group-V arsenic overpressure during epitaxial growth. Photodetectors grown under high arsenic flux pressure show low dark current values at room temperature (1.0 × 10 −3 A/cm 2 at 100 mV reverse bias), an order of magnitude lower than stoichiometric and low As flux grown devices, and correspondingly higher lifetime and responsivity. Two distinct activation energies were identified for each growth condition based on temperature-dependent dark current analysis, with trap-assisted generation-recombination in the depletion region and shallow defect recombination as the dark current-limiting factors in all devices.},

Through strategic integration of size-controlled platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) that induce localized surface plasmon resonances enhancement, the optimized device achieves remarkable performance metrics at zero bias: a photoresponsivity of 200 mA/W, a specific detectivity of 1.65 × 10 12 Jones as well as ultrafast response speed with rise/fall times of 400/540 μ s under 254 nm illumination, surpassing the majority of its competitors.

In this study, we employed in situ x-ray diffraction to investigate the crystal structures of tin along the Hugoniot. Our results demonstrate that the bct–bcc phase boundary shifts to a higher pressure under shock compression compared to static compression. This shift addresses the observed discontinuity in the relationship between shear strength and shock pressure, anchoring the dynamic bct–bcc phase boundary at 34.7 ± 2.5 GPa. To elucidate the mechanisms behind the shift, we propose a nucleation model that emphasizes the roles of surface free energy and chemical potential difference in determining the energy barrier for nucleation and the kinetics of phase transformation. This straightforward yet generalized model accounts for hysteresis effects during compression and decompression, particularly when the chemical potential differences approach zero. Additionally, it explains how phase boundaries shift under shock compression, considering competition among various phase transformation pathways. These results underscore the critical role of phase transformation kinetics in interpreting the dynamic properties of materials under shock compression, providing insights that go beyond traditional static phase diagrams.},

  abstract     = {Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential for maintaining human health, and their morphological abnormalities serve as critical diagnostic indicators for various blood disorders. To predict RBC morphology accurately and efficiently, we develop a deep learning model that solves the inverse problem of inferring RBC shapes from their geometric properties. The model utilizes spherical harmonics to reconstruct the RBC surface, thereby reducing the degrees of freedom and enabling efficient prediction. It is applied to predict the stomatocyte–discocyte–echinocyte (SDE) transformation of RBCs, with results strongly correlating with experimental observations and numerical simulations, thereby validating the model's accuracy. Additionally, the model demonstrates robustness with low sensitivity to structural parameters, such as dataset size and hidden layer depth. Even with a small dataset and shallow hidden layers, it remains effective, with training completed in 0.25 h on a standard laptop. Furthermore, we generate a phase diagram of SDE transformation under varying area differences, which further emphasizes the model's accuracy and computational efficiency. This work contributes to a deep learning approach for predicting RBC morphology transformations, offering a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to traditional methods. The model's ability to reproduce RBC morphology by controlling geometric features holds significant implications for understanding and diagnosing blood disorders.},

This study introduces an intelligent sports interactive monitoring system that utilizes triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology, combining real-time motion tracking with AR-driven interactivity to achieve fitness objectives through gamified training. The system features four key components: TENG-based motion-sensing modules with Ecoflex/polytetrafluoroethylene triboelectric layers on 3D-printed polylactic acid substrates embedded in shoe soles and simulated gun barrels, wireless data transmitters, a cloud analytics platform, and an AR user interface.

Simultaneously, firearm-mounted sensors capture trigger actions to coordinate virtual shooting sequences, integrating foot movement data for full-body avatar control in AR environments. This dual-input design enables users to navigate virtual challenges through coordinated physical maneuvers, transforming routine exercises into narrative-driven missions.

Microwave-induced thermoacoustic (TA) tomography (MTAT) provides an effective combination of high spatiotemporal resolution, useful contrast, and deep tissue imaging capabilities. However, MTAT currently encounters challenges in visualizing sub-organ features within biological tissues. To address this issue, we propose electric vector-adapted thermoacoustic computed tomography (EV-TACT). EV-TACT takes into account the propagation of incident waves through biological tissues, employing microwave illumination with various polarizations to enhance energy coupling to specific sub-organ features. This method enhances the effective excitation of TA signals within the target tissue, improves the signal-to-noise ratio, and reveals structures that were previously not visible with conventional MTAT. The performance of EV-TACT has been evaluated through imaging the abdomen and brain in live mice, enabling the capture of the structure of nerve fiber bundles in the brain and the movement characteristics of the abdominal aorta. EV-TACT relies on tissue orientation information, and we also provide methods for resolving tissue orientation on arbitrary imaging cross sections to increase the universality of EV-TACT. These findings suggest that EV-TACT is a promising method for high-contrast, dynamic, and label-free imaging of target structures in deep tissues.},

This significance has driven bio-engineers and medical researchers to concentrate on understanding the dynamics of blood flow within the circulatory system. In this context, we examined the Hall and ion slip effects on non-Newtonian Casson blood flow in arterioles, driven by a radial magnetic field. Additionally, this study explores the momentum and heat transfer characteristics of non-Newtonian blood infused with hybrid magnetic and semiconductor nanoparticles, accounting for the impacts of viscous dissipation and Joule heating phenomena. The current model of blood flow with hybrid nanoparticles through an arteriole is represented mathematically by a system of partial differential equations, which was transformed into dimensionless form and solved using two distinct numerical techniques to ensure the reliability of the results. The main outcomes of this study indicate that as the Hall parameter increased from m = 0.2 to m = 1.0 ⁠ , the axial velocity and temperature at the center of blood arterioles significantly improved by 37.98% and 75.31%, respectively. Moreover, hybrid nanoparticles are more effective at regulating blood flow and temperature compared to mono nanoparticles, which further enhancement possible by increasing the concentration of magnetite nanoparticles in the mixture. Additionally, higher values of the Casson fluid parameter enhanced the velocity and temperature of hybrid nanoblood. The findings of this research present significant potential for applications in targeted drug delivery, magnetic therapy, therapeutic hyperthermia treatments, thermal energy transfer, and biomedical sensors.},

  abstract     = {The deformability of red blood cells (RBCs) is a critical factor in understanding cardiovascular diseases and serves as a key determinant of RBC lifespan. Abnormal RBC deformability can lead to impaired blood flow and an increased risk of thrombosis. Although various methods exist to measure RBC deformability, they often involve complex procedures and require expensive equipment. In both our experiments and existing literature, it has been observed that RBCs with varying deformabilities exhibit significant differences in their morphological characteristics. To further investigate this relationship, we proposed a deep learning-based approach to explore the correlation between RBC deformability and their morphological features. We utilized a dielectrophoretic microfluidic method to assess deformability and capture microscopic images of RBCs. These images were then categorized according to the deformability of the cells. A convolutional neural network model was trained on this dataset for cell classification. Additionally, we validated the efficacy of deep learning methods for image dataset augmentation. The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 90%, with an average accuracy of 82% in practical blood tests. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between RBC morphological characteristics and deformability, suggesting that cell images can reliably indicate deformability. This approach has the potential to significantly simplify the study of RBC mechanical properties, with important implications for RBC classification, theoretical research, disease screening, etc.},

This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under suitable configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, resulting in NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations that allow for the unambiguous discrimination of this effect. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges.

Single UCNP-based studies are important for highly sensitive biosensing and bioimaging. To enhance the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of UCNPs, various plasmonic nanostructures have been investigated in addition to engineering the elements and structures of UCNPs themselves. However, it is crucial but challenging to precisely control the position of a single UCNP relative to plasmonic nanostructures. Herein, gold nanorod dimers (GNRDs) are used to enhance the PL intensity of single UCNPs selectively captured in the gaps of GNRDs. The dimensions of GNRDs are designed with the assistance of COMSOL Multiphysics simulation to have a plasmonic resonance peak around the excitation wavelength for the UCNPs. After lithography-based fabrication of GNRDs and surface passivation, electron-beam induced deposition is used to selectively create carbon nanodomains (CNDs) in the gaps of GNRDs. The CNDs capture UCNPs by benefiting from the strong affinity between streptavidin and biotin. About 12% of the CNDs capture single UCNPs. Photoluminescence imaging shows an overall intensity enhancement by threefold for single UCNPs by GNRDs of 100 nm gap at 4 × 10 6 W / cm 2 power density.

On the other hand, with traditional vision sensors it is difficult to obtain clear images in very bright or dark conditions. In this paper, we propose a bionic vision sensor based on a back-to-back structure, which realizes efficient optical information processing by simulating the adaptive mechanism of biological vision system. The device combines the carrier trapping property of polymethyl methacrylate with heterogeneous interface and the photosensitive property of quantum dots to simulate the biological synaptic behaviors, such as excitatory postsynaptic current, paired pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity. Under dynamic light intensities (198.6 μ W cm −2 to 8.32 mW cm −2 ), the device exhibits remarkable visual adaptive behaviors: enhancement of the current response by carrier accumulation in low light, and desensitization by inhibition of carrier migration through the interfacial electric field in strong light, with an adaptation rate (<40 s) significantly better than that of biological systems (2–30 min). The device array further enhances the contrast of its images in extreme light and the recognition accuracy in combination with artificial neural network is improved to 73.7% (dark-adapted) and 87.5% (light-adapted). The device provides a prospective strategy for the development of next generation of bionic vision devices, which have great potential for applications in fields such as smart driving and brain-like computing.},

The inorganic electron transport layers (ETLs) using tin oxide (SnO 2 ) can replace the organic n -type materials to further enhance the device performance and operational stability. The SnO 2 nanocrystals were prepared using perchloric acid and dispersed with organic solvents to form the Cl-bonded SnO 2 solution. The coupling effect between the Cl-bonded SnO 2 film and the Cl-containing perovskite precursor will form a coherent interlayer. This upper coherent interlayer will distinctly suppress charge non-radiative recombination and promote carrier extraction. The high crystallinity of the Cl-bonded SnO 2 can also enhance fusion between grains, reduce grain boundaries, and improve the film conductivity. Here, the IPVSCs using all-metal-oxide charge transport materials (CTMs) have achieved the optimal performance with a power conversion efficiency of 23.26% (a V OC of 1.158 V, a J SC of 24.29 mA cm −2 , and an FF of 0.827).

  abstract     = {All-inorganic CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals (CNCs) show great potential in backlight WLEDs and anti-counterfeiting. In this study, structural and compositional analyses including x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm that Mn 2+ substitutes Pb 2+ and K + replaces Cs + within the lattice, optimizing energy level alignment and carrier distribution while maintaining the cubic perovskite phase. Density functional theory calculations reveal that K + incorporation does not introduce defect states, whereas Mn 2+ introduces shallow defect levels. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate that co-doping with K + and Mn 2+ synergistically improves carrier lifetime by reducing nonradiative recombination. The co-doped CNCs exhibit a significant enhancement in the external quantum efficiency, increasing from 32.47% (pristine) to 52.47% under 365 nm excitation. When integrated into a backlight white LED, combining K + /Mn 2+ -doped CNCs with commercial KSF red phosphors on a 445–450 nm blue LED chip, the device achieves a wide color gamut covering 131.9% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) and 98.5% of the Rec.2020 standards—outperforming conventional phosphor-based systems. Additionally, the co-doped CNCs embedded in PVC-based inks generate high-resolution fluorescent anti-counterfeiting patterns that retain optical clarity after 288 h of UV aging. This work demonstrates that rational ion substitution via co-doping is an effective strategy to enhance both the optoelectronic performance and long-term stability of CNCs, advancing their integration into the next-generation display and security technologies.},

However, the extremely low working temperature in most QAH candidates significantly limits the experimental realization. Herein, we designed a series of transition metal chalcogenide VX 2 (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers using first-principles calculations and investigated their electronic and topological properties. The results indicate that all these materials are dynamically stable FM 2D materials. Notably, VTe 2 is identified as an intrinsic room-temperature QAH insulator with the Chern number of C = 1 and a sizable bandgap of 0.14 eV. This large bandgap arises from the band inversion between the spin-up bands contributed by the p x and p y orbitals of Te atoms. Additionally, VTe 2 exhibits a Curie temperature of 444 K, exceeding the room temperature. VS 2 and VSe 2 monolayers are FM semiconductors whose electronic properties can be turned by applying external strains. Among them, the VSe 2 monolayer becomes a QAH insulator with C = 1 under suitable biaxial compressive strains. This study introduces a category of QAH candidates that show significant promise for implementation in spintronic devices.},

However, because of the non-negligible spin–orbit coupling effect on the electronic band structures, the coexistence of electronic and phononic type-II HWNRs, which are jointly protected by a single-valued 2D irreducible representation and the nonsymmorphic symmetry, has been rarely explored in realistic 2D materials. In this work, based on first-principles calculations, we propose the MgBCl monolayer, an ultralight crystal material with high thermodynamic stability, as the first realistic material that hosts type-II HWNRs in electronic and phononic systems. Moreover, we further employ symmetry analysis to confirm the coexisting type-II HWNRs and show their clear edge states. Our work not only provides an effective platform for the experimental detection of the coexisting type-II HWNRs in spinless systems but also offers realistic materials for investigating the interplay between topological electronic and phononic states.},

Due to the rhombohedral structure of Fe 5 GeTe 2 , the Fe atoms occupy three different sites, resulting in complex magnetic properties. As the electronic structure changes with decreasing temperature in Fe 5− x GeTe 2 , the magnetic anisotropy is affected and results in a spin-flop transition from an out-of-plane orientation to a canted orientation. At low temperatures, the angle-dependent magnetoresistance shows a dramatic change, indicating anisotropic magnetoresistance in different crystallographic axis. The presence of room-temperature magnetism and giant anisotropic magnetoresistance suggests promising potential for Fe 5− x GeTe 2 in spintronic applications.},

The thickness of the coating layer was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methods, with an average value of approximately 50 nm.

In a Co/MgO structure with Pt and Au underlayers, H 2 -annealing restores the magnetization of deeply oxidized Co layers only in Pt underlayer samples, while no restoration occurs in Au underlayer samples. XPS measurements clarify that the chemical state of the Co layer is significantly altered in the Pt-sample after H 2 -annealing, indicating that the reduction of oxidized Co is caused by the strong catalytic action of Pt. Furthermore, we found that the H 2 -induced restoration of the FM state occurs even at room temperature, and it is more pronounced when the sample size is reduced. These findings not only highlight the significant role of the catalytic effects in the hydrogen-induced modulation of magnetic properties but also provide the possibility of exploring the mechanism of the catalytic effect using spintronics devices.},

  abstract     = {Perpendicular magnetization switching induced by spin–orbit torque (SOT) in spin source metals/ferromagnetic material heterostructures is of fundamental interest for developing next-generation magnetic random-access memory with nonvolatility, high-density, and low-power consumption. Nonetheless, obtaining perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layers based on spin source materials with non-5 d heavy elements continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we grew the Ti/CoFeB/MgO heterostructure with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and low spin–orbit coupling. Compared with traditional 5 d heavy metals, lower Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) constants and at least two orders of magnitude lower SOT efficiency were observed in Ti/CoFeB/MgO heterostructures. In the heavy metals (Ta or Pt)/Ti/CoFeB/MgO heterostructure, the spin current generated by the heavy metal can effectively penetrate through the Ti spacer, while the SOT efficiency gradually decreases with increase in Ti thickness, which obeys the bulk spin diffusion model. The SOT efficiency of spin source (heavy metal)/Ti/CoFeB/MgO heterostructure remains almost unchanged by introducing thin Ti spacer when thickness is less than 2 nm, thereby demonstrating efficient spin transition through the Ti layer. Furthermore, the Ti spacer can weaken the DMI between the spin sources and the ferromagnetic layer, thereby reducing the in-plane assistance magnetic field and enabling a lower critical current density for SOT-induced deterministic magnetization switching. These results suggest that the Ti/CoFeB/MgO heterostructure with PMA holds promise as a potential candidate for the development of SOT-based spintronic devices.},

We propose a transducer with an elliptical reflector to excite a thin waveguide at multiple frequencies within the megahertz range. The elliptical reflector transforms a plane dilatational wave from the piezoelectric elements into a transverse wave, focused on the thin waveguide using mode conversion. The use of transverse waves reduces energy loss during the reflection process and achieves a smaller focal diameter. Finite element analysis verified wave focusing with the elliptical reflector and the thin waveguide excitation. The fabricated prototype achieved high vibration velocities at the central tip of the waveguide, including 6.7 m/s at 1.767 MHz and 12.8 m/s at 0.411 MHz. At 1.767 MHz, the vibration velocity increased linearly with increasing applied voltage, suggesting the potential for achieving even higher velocities with greater energy input. At 0.411 MHz, the stress within the thin waveguide was expected to exceed the material's tensile strength, indicating that the design maximized the material's performance limits.},

  abstract     = {Antiperovskites have emerged as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices due to their remarkable structural tunability and diverse physicochemical properties. Carrier transport characteristics are critical to the performance of these devices, yet the specific transport mechanisms in antiperovskite X 3 NA (X 2+ = Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ ; A 3− = P 3− , As 3− , Sb 3− , Bi 3− ) remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the carrier transport properties of antiperovskite X 3 NA using first-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation. Our results reveal that the carrier mobility of X 3 NA is primarily limited by Fröhlich-type polar optical phonon scattering. The moderate Fröhlich coupling constants (0.26 ≤ α ≤ 1.66) suggest weak electron-phonon coupling in X 3 NA, resulting in high mobility up to 461.4 cm 2 /Vs, surpassing that of prototypical halide perovskites (∼ 80.0 cm 2 /Vs). These findings indicate that the carrier transport in X 3 NA is governed by large polarons. Finally, we show that the strain can modulate the effective mass and electron-phonon coupling strength, thereby enabling tunable carrier mobility in Mg 3 NSb. This work highlights the exceptional intrinsic carrier transport properties and strain tunability of X 3 NA, making them promising candidates for the future development of high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Interface passivation is currently one of the most widely studied approaches to improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most reported approaches overemphasize defect passivation of the upper interface but neglect the defects of the non-exposed buried interface of the perovskite/charge transfer layer, especially for those of the buried SnO 2 /perovskite interface, which affects charge transfer/extraction and perovskite crystallization. In this work, three polythiourea compounds with varied alkyl chain lengths [polyethylthiourea (PTU-2C), polybutylthiourea (PTU-4C), and polyoctylthiourea (PTU-8C)] were synthesized to act as buried interface passivators in SnO 2 based PSCs. The structure–property relationship of polythiourea was investigated to reveal how alkyl chain length influences interface contact and passivation capability on the SnO 2 /perovskite interface. The relevant studies have revealed that the shorter the alkyl chain, the greater the hydrophilic SnO 2 surface area and the more conducive to producing high-quality perovskite film with enlarged grain size. Meanwhile, PTU-2C, with the shortest alkyl chain, can form the strongest chelation with various types of defect sites on the buried SnO 2 /perovskite interface, thus accelerating charge transfer/extraction and inhibiting nonradiative recombination. Consequently, PSCs with PTU-2C modification achieve synchronous improvement in device efficiency and stability, indicating the effectiveness of the polythiourea passivation strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, the impacts of the GaN cap on the gate leakage mechanisms have been investigated in the recessed-gate AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors. The recessed gate with GaN cap removal under the gate can be a way to shrink the gate-to-channel distance, therefore improving the current density and the transconductance without sacrificing the interface properties, which play an important role in current collapse. The investigation of gate leakage current, as a reliability issue, on the recessed gate with GaN cap removal is, therefore, important. From the I gs –V gs measurements at different temperature and stress conditions, it is found that the leakage mechanisms of the recessed-gate devices with cap removal are identical to those of the standard devices. However, the trap energy level is higher when extracted from the two-step trap-assisted tunneling mechanism at high reverse gate bias, resulting in higher leakage current for the recessed-gate device. Besides, stress measurements on the device reveal that the leakage mechanism at low reverse gate bias changes from temperature-independent before stress to temperature-dependent after stress. It is also found that a recoverable trap with a new energy level is generated after stress based on temperature-sensitive characteristics, which corresponds to the Poole–Frenkel emission mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Achieving optimal performance in any optoelectronic device requires precise control of charge carrier generation and their efficient transport with minimal energy losses. In this Letter, we study the dependence of luminescence properties and interfacial charge transfer (CT) kinetics on Mn 2+ -doped CsPb(Br/Cl) 3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with varying dopant concentrations. Increased dopant content leads to an efficient CT with p-benzoquinone (BQ), as demonstrated by the spectroscopic analysis and energy band alignment. The electrical and electrochemical measurements further reveal an improved conductance and reduced resistance across the sample–electrode interface for higher-doped samples. The alteration in the dopant concentration not only influences the energy transfer to the dopants but also tempers the degree of current conduction through the perovskites. The presence of BQ again modulates the optoelectronic properties of the Mn 2+ -doped samples and also changes the nature of tunneling from a combined direct and Fowler–Northeim type to only direct tunneling across the junction interface. These findings decipher that regulated carrier transfer and transport in anion-exchanged PQDs can be structured with doping, making them promising candidates for highly efficient optoelectronic device applications.},

At a detection efficiency of 20.1%, the dark count rate achieved was 6.82 kHz, with an afterpulse probability of 0.15% and a timing jitter of 120 ps under gated operation. This is the lowest dark count rate reported to date for a 1550 nm single-photon detector operating at room temperature. Furthermore, in a purely passive quenching mode, we obtained a dark count rate of 32.6 kHz with a detection efficiency of 10.3% at room temperature by integrating a SiO 2 /Cr film resistor through a sputtering process into the detector. Our scheme provides an alternative choice for room-temperature single-photon detectors and should significantly advance their application in compact, low-power devices.},

Stoichiometric CsSnI 3 has high-density defects and structural imperfections affecting device performance. In this work, we made an investigation on A-site cation engineering to evaluate the correlation between structural and transport parameters for effective operation in rectifying devices. Here, we analyzed CsSnI 3 thin films modified with methylamine (MA), formamidine (FA), guanidine (GuA), and 5-ammonium valeric acid (AVA) cations, correlating structural parameters obtained by Rietveld refinement with their optoelectronic and diode characteristics. MA-, FA-, and GuA-substituted films exhibited low sheet resistance (∼450–2200 Ω/sq); however, strain-induced lattice distortions and accumulated defects in GuA-substituted films significantly hindered effective charge collection and increased recombination losses. AVA substitution formed low-conductivity 2D interlayers, increasing resistance (>10 5 Ω/sq) and altering transient response characteristics, yet provided minimal reverse switching losses (∼100 μ W/cm 2 ), beneficial for high-frequency applications. FA substitution emerged as optimal, balancing structural stability, conductivity, minimal defects, and relevant diode properties. The obtained results highlight that targeted lattice modifications strongly influence the practical performance of rectifying p–i–n diodes based on CsSnI 3 .},

However, it is still a big challenge to make GeSn QDs because of the low solubility of Sn in Ge and too thick coherently strained GeSn layer grown on Ge or Si substrates at low temperature. In this Letter, van der Waals epitaxy of GeSn QDs with high Sn content of 9.2% on oxygen-plasma modified two-dimensional MoS 2 on SiO 2 /Si substrate is demonstrated using magnetron sputtering. The growth kinetics is proposed, in which oxygen-plasma modification introduces sulfur vacancies on the MoS 2 surface, mediating an Sn wetting layer to promote Ge nucleation to form GeSn QDs. The transitions between GeSn QDs and thin films and the precise control over quantum dot density and morphology are performed by simply tuning the sputtering power and durations. As a result, GeSn QDs with high aspect ratio of 1.2 are achieved with excellent crystalline quality. This work provides an intriguing way to construct GeSn QDs on 2D materials for optoelectronic device applications.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have garnered considerable interest for next-generation optoelectronic applications. However, the atomically thin properties of TMDCs make them highly sensitive to the environment. Therefore, the substrate becomes a key ingredient that affects the film growth and properties. In this work, we investigate the interactions between metal organic chemical vapor deposition-grown monolayer MoSe 2 and substrates by spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations. It is shown that, during the growth process, there is an ∼1% tensile strain between MoSe 2 and the substrate owing to the thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch, which leads to a redshift of peak positions in both photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectra. Furthermore, after transferring monolayer MoSe 2 films to sapphire and SiO 2 /Si substrates, we found that the strong substrate-dependent charge transfer results in different ratios of various excitonic emission intensities by analyzing the temperature-dependent PL spectra and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our findings reveal strong surface-dependent interactions between TMDC films and their substrates that affect the growth and optical properties of the films, which shed light on the selection of substrates during atomically thin TMDC film growth.},

The off-diagonal thermoelectric voltage corresponds to the anisotropy of the Seebeck coefficient and is proportional to the sample length perpendicular to the temperature gradient, reaching ∼ 90 μ V / K in our sample. Also, we investigated the effect of electric-double-layer doping on the off-diagonal thermoelectric effect. Under hole doping, while the resistance significantly decreases, the off-diagonal Seebeck coefficient does not decrease probably because of pseudogap formation. As a result, hole doping increases the off-diagonal power factor by up to a factor of approximately 15 at the doped surface.},

By integrating liquid-based reconfigurable metasurfaces with programmable metasurfaces, our approach leverages liquid metals such as EGaIn (eutectic gallium–indium) to achieve real-time, reconfigurable beam steering with enhanced adaptability. This method offers key advantages, including cost-effectiveness, ease of shaping, and tunability. Notably, the proposed system maintains consistent performance across two distinct frequency regions, enabling simultaneous dual-band operation. In addition, the programmed beam-form, under normal incidence conditions, rotates in close accordance with the conventional law of reflection when subjected to oblique incidence, for angles up to around 40 ° ⁠ . This key result not only validates the metasurface's capability to direct signals to specific areas or users but also unlocks possibilities for real-time beam control. Crucially, the proposed device can be fabricated using a combination of standard printed circuit board manufacturing techniques and conventional microfluidic channel fabrication methods, ensuring scalability and practicality for large-scale deployment.},

The heterostructure is formed by two distinct photonic crystals, which have angle-independent photonic bandgaps through phase variation control. By analyzing the Zak phases of the upper and lower bands, we find that these two photonic bandgaps exhibit opposite topological characteristics, leading to the emergence of an angle-independent topological interface state. The metal layer at the bottom of the photonic crystal enables the excitation of Tamm plasmon polaritons; strong coupling with topological interface states is achieved, resulting in a dual-mode, wide-angle, polarization-dependent absorber with two distinct regions.

  abstract     = {Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has promising applications in chemical reactions, molecular spectroscopy, and biochemical sensing. VSC can be achieved using plasma nanostructures. However, effective coupling between plasma nanostructures and molecules is often hindered by the metal materials used. Dielectric metasurfaces offer significant advantages and can effectively excite VSC, but the implementation of VSC through dielectric metasurfaces has not been widely investigated. Here, a mid-infrared all-dielectric metasurface to realize strong coupling control driven by quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBIC) is proposed. By coupling with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) molecules, a significant spectral splitting occurred. A 50-nm-thick PMMA layer increases the molecular signal amplification factor to 91%. Adjusting structural asymmetry parameters and utilizing the high Q factor of the QBIC mode allows flexible modulation of the coupling state. A strong coupling phenomenon is also observed with an oscillator absorption strength (Δ ε ) 0.02 and a 5 nm PMMA thickness. Refractive index sensing analysis indicates a sensitivity of 2118 nm RIU −1 , with a maximum figure of merit of 4089 RIU −1 .

This functionality is realized through the modulation of variable capacitances embedded in specially designed dual split-ring resonators. We explore various combinations of the pump and incident wave frequencies and investigate different operational regimes of the proposed parametric system. Our theoretical analysis reveals high upconversion efficiency, with amplification levels exceeding 20 dB through a cascaded process, surpassing the limits set by the Manley–Rowe relations. Moreover, precise control over the phase of the upconverted waves is achieved by tuning the pump phase, paving the way for advanced manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This approach is applicable in the microwave and subterahertz ranges, with potential scalability to higher frequencies through ultrafast modulation techniques.},

  abstract     = {One of the primary objectives in the realm of light manipulation is the flexible and active control of polarization, which constitutes an essential degree of freedom of photons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the polarization conversion is related to the parity-time ( PT ) symmetry in metasurfaces. Here, we propose a scheme for achieving near-perfect polarization conversions under unilateral linear polarized excitation, based on passive metasurfaces with an effective PT phase transition. The conversion from linear to circular polarization occurs at the exceptional point (EP), with the transmission polarization revealing the missing dimension of EP. To enhance linear polarization conversion efficiency, equivalent coherent excitation is induced, enabling near-perfect cross-polarization conversion. This effective manipulation also provides additional control over PT phase transitions and allows PT symmetry breaking at different coupling strengths. Experimental validation at microwave frequencies confirms the feasibility of this method, with potential extensions to terahertz and near-infrared bands. These findings not only introduce a PT -symmetric metasurface-inspired approach for exploring a wider range of phenomena in non-Hermitian physics but also hold great potential for scalable polarization and phase controlling, imaging, and other related areas based on a single-port configuration.},

To address these challenges, the MoSe 2 -CuO nanocomposite has been prepared as an excellent electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation, leveraging the synergistic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides and metal oxides. The MoSe 2 -CuO heterostructures show enhanced electrochemical response due to strong interfacial coupling, improved electron transport, and abundant active sites for glucose adsorption and oxidation.

Furthermore, the composite electrode demonstrates excellent selectivity against common interfering species and exhibits long-term stability, ensuring reliability for real-world applications. The practical applicability of the proposed sensor is also validated through glucose detection in a fruit juice sample.

One of the main challenges is increasing the maximum proton energy. Here, we demonstrate a 70% increase in the maximum energy of laser-driven protons by optimizing the wavefront of the intense laser using machine learning: This was accomplished through adaptive control of a deformable mirror (DM) using a multi-step Random Forest surrogate-assisted Bayesian optimization approach. Starting from zeroed DM actuator voltages, our method identified an optimal configuration using 20 out of 48 actuators, requiring fewer than 150 experimental data samples. Our method surpassed conventional wavefront correction by 24%, which typically minimizes aberrations to converge toward a flat wavefront by leveraging real-time feedback from a wavefront sensor. This data-driven method integrating advanced wavefront control challenges the preference for correcting aberrations to achieve a flatter wavefront in laser-driven ion acceleration. We also propose a strategy for optimizing short focal length ion accelerators at facilities where measuring the wavefront at nominal full laser power is not implemented.},

  abstract     = {Intense light sources hold significant scientific and technological importance owing to their broad applicability in advanced lighting, biomedical systems, and optoelectronic devices. This study investigates a phenomenon of intense white light emission resulting from the coupling of gas discharge plasma with metal oxide particles under atmospheric pressure. By placing different metal oxide particles, such as Al 2 O 3 , on the cathode and conducting discharge experiments in various gas environments, we observed that light emission is not solely driven by temperature but is also influenced by the gas type, the ionic structure of the materials, and the interaction between electrons and vacancies. The results show that molecular gases (e.g., N 2 , O 2 , and CO 2 ) significantly enhance the light emission intensity compared to atomic gases (e.g., He and Ar), and the emission intensity of metal oxide materials is closely related to their anionic properties. The study further examines the effects of material defects, gas composition, and discharge current on the luminescent properties, and simultaneously analyzes the cathode-fall voltage to identify a mode transition, thereby proposing a preliminary mechanism based on electron–vacancy interactions. These findings provide insights for the development of high-power light sources and potential applications in photocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {The recent pandemic has underscored the need for better ways for surface disinfection of pathogens. Given the effectiveness of both plasma-activated water and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for bacterial inactivation, we demonstrate in this work the production of stable plasma-activated CNT nanofluids using ultrasound—at relatively low power (70 W), short sonication time (6 min), and without requiring surfactants—to generate plasma-activated CNT nanofluids, which we subsequently aerosolize using a nozzle-free surface acoustic wave nebulizer. Besides providing better and more uniform surface coverage, such aerosolized delivery also allows for bacterial contact on uneven or hard-to-reach surfaces. For plasma-activated water with an electrical conductivity of 0.1 mS/cm, stable CNT nanofluids (lasting > 72 h) are achievable by increasing the multi-walled carbon nanotube concentration to 0.006%. The effectiveness of the synergistic combination of plasma-activated water and CNT bacterial inactivation in an aerosolized delivery modality can be seen from the enhancement in bacterial colony count reduction—up to Δ η e ≈ 189%—when plasma-activated CNT nanofluid aerosols are sprayed onto E. coli plated agar plates, compared to that obtained with plasma-activated aerosols alone.},

The gliding arc acts as an igniter for generating and maintaining the microwave plasma at atmospheric pressure, while the microwave has a certain effect on expanding the gliding arc plasma. The increase in voltage and power observed in the microwave-enhanced gliding arc discharge indicates expansion of length and bulk of the plasma flame, which has a positive effect on the residence time and immersion of reactants in the plasma.

  abstract     = {The measurement of a superconducting qubit is implemented by coupling it to a resonator. The common choice is transverse coupling, which, in the dispersive approximation, introduces an interaction term that enables the measurement. This cross-Kerr term provides a qubit-state dependent dispersive shift in the resonator frequency with the device parameters chosen carefully to get sufficient signal while minimizing Purcell decay of the qubit. We introduce a two-mode circuit, nicknamed quantromon, with two orthogonal modes implementing a qubit and a resonator. Unlike before, where the coupling term emerges as a perturbative expansion, the quantromon has intrinsic cross-Kerr coupling by design. Our experiments implemented in a hybrid 2D–3D circuit QED architecture demonstrate some unique features of the quantromon like weak dependence of the dispersive shift on the qubit-resonator detuning and intrinsic Purcell protection. In a tunable qubit-frequency device, we show that the dispersive shift ( ⁠ 2 χ / 2 π ⁠ ) changes by only 0.8 MHz, while the qubit-resonator detuning ( ⁠ Δ / 2 π ⁠ ) is varied between 0.398 and 3.288 GHz. We also demonstrate Purcell protection in a second device where we tune the orthogonality between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate a single-shot readout fidelity of 98.3%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art measurements without the use of a parametric amplifier and suggests a potential simplification of the measurement circuitry for scaling up quantum processors.},

However, among the previously reported nonreciprocal thermal radiators, research on dual-polarized multi-band systems remains relatively scarce and is limited to large incidence angles, which limits the practical application of nonreciprocal thermal radiators. To address these challenges, we propose a six-band, dual-polarized strong nonreciprocal thermal radiator comprising a silicon-based void ring cylinder periodic array, a magneto-optical material layer (InAs), and a silver (Ag) metal reflector. When the applied magnetic field strength is 2.5 T and the incidence angle is 5.9°, six strong nonreciprocal peaks can be shown with nonreciprocity of more than 80% under transverse electric (TE) polarization and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Through the study of coupled mode theory and electromagnetic field distribution, the physical mechanism of the strong nonreciprocity of the device structure in this work is revealed. It is believed that this study of six-band, dual-polarized strong nonreciprocal thermal radiation at small angles of incidence has the practicability of energy harvesting control and thermal radiation.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention, but several obstacles associated with zinc anodes impede the advancement of AZIBs. Constructing protective coatings on Zn anodes is a promising strategy to curb zinc dendrite growth and side reactions, yet current techniques remain complex and inefficient. Herein, the in situ alloyed method is employed to generate a CuZn protective interface for a highly reversible Zn metal anode (60CuZn@Zn). Systematic characterization and theoretical calculations have elucidated that the protective layer is likely to effectively suppress the proliferation of zinc dendrites, accelerate the migration of zinc ions, and ameliorate interfacial side reactions. In addition, the optimized coating effectively modulates the interfacial electric field distribution, facilitates uniform nucleation of zinc crystals, and reduces the charge transfer resistance, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of the AZIBs. Consequently, the 60CuZn@Zn anode demonstrates an extended cycling life of over 2800 h at 1 mA cm −2 /1 mAh cm −2 and maintains prolonged stability exceeding 1200 h even at a high current density of 10 mA cm −2 /1 mAh cm −2 .

This material's unique sp 2 /sp 3 -hybridized bonding network simultaneously establishes uniformly distributed ultramicroporous channels (5.43 Å pore diameter, effectively preventing solvent co-intercalation) and manifests highly conductive nodal-line semimetallic properties. Theoretical simulations reveal exceptional Li/Na storage characteristics in bulk C 32 , including high theoretical capacities (837 mAh/g for Li, 558 mAh/g for Na), low diffusion barriers (0.22 eV for Li, 0.60 eV for Na), and moderate open-circuit voltages (0.26 V for Li, 0.33 V for Na). Notably, it has significantly lower volumetric expansion compared to conventional graphite during Li + /Na + intercalation.

  abstract     = {Wavefront single-pixel imaging (WSPI) can efficiently capture the amplitude and phase information of an unknown field using a single-pixel detector. However, as the imaging resolution increases, more modulation patterns are required, restricting the imaging speed. Here, we propose a parallel wavefront single-pixel imaging (PWSPI) technique, leveraging grating arrangement and multiplex to establish parallel common-path interferometric detections, for obtaining different parts of the target wavefront simultaneously. Such an approach reduces the number of modulation patterns required and accelerates the imaging speed. Simulations and experimental results show that using four parallel interferometric detections elaborately designed can achieve a fourfold enhancement in the imaging speed while maintaining the imaging quality. We further validate the performance of PWSPI by reconstructing the wavefront of a dragonfly wing, confirming its effectiveness in the application of biological sample imaging. It provides a promising WSPI scheme for a faster acquisition of amplitude and phase information.},

Here, we introduce an approach using x-ray-induced acoustic computed tomography (XACT) to concurrently assess the elastic and viscous properties of rheumatic tissues. We explored how these properties modulate x-ray-induced acoustic (XA) signals and used simulated XACT imaging to visualize rheumatic and healthy bone tissues. Viscoelastic properties were quantified by analyzing the rise and decay times of XA displacement. The resulting XACT images showed high concordance with conventional CT scans, and extensive analysis revealed distinct differences between rheumatic and normal bone tissues. This method expands the applications of XACT and holds significant promise for clinical diagnostics in bone pathologies.},

The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Q m ⁠ . Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high- Q m single or multiple localized phononic defect modes at MHz frequencies. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high- Q m localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Q m × f m -product of 1.5 × 10 13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for direct coupling to qubits or in situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits or low-noise sensors.},

When the Te atomic layer of WSeTe or MoSeTe contacts with 1T-MoTe 2 (known as type-A heterojunction), the contact interface exhibits significant Fermi level pinning (FLP), resulting in a larger Schottky barrier height (SBH). Through interlayer flipping, the Se atomic layer of WSeTe or MoSeTe comes into contact with 1T-MoTe 2 (known as type-B heterojunction), FLP at the contact interface will be significantly suppressed, resulting in obvious reduction of the SBH. Therefore, Schottky diodes based on type-B heterojunction exhibit superior performances with higher rectification ratio and larger photocurrent compared to Schottky diodes based on type-A heterojunction.},

In ceramics-based thermoelectric materials, the key challenge lies in achieving a sufficiently high dislocation density to effectively scatter phonons, as the typical dislocation density in ceramics after bulk deformation is constrained to ∼10 12 m −2 . In this work, we adopted the mechanical imprinting method and achieved a dislocation density of ∼10 15 m −2 in single-crystal SrTiO 3 , which is known for its room-temperature plasticity and acts as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Using the time-domain thermoreflectance method, we measured a ∼50% reduction in thermal conductivity over a broad temperature range (80–400 K) with the engineered high-density dislocations. These results suggest that tuning dislocations could offer an alternative path to minimizing thermal conductivity for engineering thermoelectric materials.},

Intriguingly, the shift current σ yyy could be further enhanced by employing external strain to tune the breathing-kagome Nb-trimer network, while a concurrent decrease in the bandgap occurred under biaxial compressive strain.

However, distinct conclusions regarding magnetic phase transitions at different doping concentrations have emerged, alongside controversial interpretations of ferromagnetic origin. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the evolution of magnetism in Sb-doped MnBi 4 Te 7 is not only attributed to Mn–Bi/Sb antisite defects, as observed in some experiments, but is also significantly influenced by strain effects. Furthermore, our results reveal that magnetic phase transition is accompanied by a change from n-type to p-type charge carriers at Sb doping concentrations exceeding 30%, in excellent agreement with experimental observation. Moreover, Sb substitution leads to an obvious difference in the effective mass of charge carriers, which qualitatively coincides with experimentally measured carrier mobility. Additionally, Sb doping results in more delocalized charge carriers due to the relatively weaker Sb–Te bonding. Based on these findings, we further discuss how the enhanced carrier delocalization influences interlayer magnetic coupling, leading to a nonmonotonic evolution of long-range magnetism from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic and back to antiferromagnetic phases with increased Sb concentration.},

It was found that the thinner films displayed improved on/off current ratio, I on / I off , and MOSFETs with 2.1-nm-thick channels had I on / I off = 16.7 compared to only 6.8 for 3.4-nm-thick channels. Devices with 1.4-nm-thick WS 2 channels were also fabricated by incorporating a 1.6-nm capping layer of Nb x W 1− x S y , where Nb x W 1− x S y provided a heavily doped layer underneath the metal contact and was oxidized in the region between source and drain contacts using low-temperature O 2 annealing. These devices had I on / I off as high as 28 at room temperature, a substantial improvement to the WS 2 -only devices. Measurement at 77 K showed I on / I off values as high as 260, and extraction of the contact barrier height using temperature-dependent measurements showed that a small energy barrier still exists between the Nb x W 1− x S y and the WS 2 .},

For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin–orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of (Bi 1−x Sb x ) 2 Te 3−y Se y (BSTS, x = 0.58, y = 1) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity shows that bulk transport is suppressed as the temperature is decreased, and at low temperature, surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (spin Hall angle, θ S H ∼ 1 ⁠ ) and spin diffusion over several micrometers. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5–25 μ m, corresponding to frequencies of 12–120 THz or photon energies of 50–500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of these thin films, we used the Drude–Lorentz oscillator model to represent their dielectric functions and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit the oscillator parameters by minimizing the error between the measured and simulated FTIR spectra. We performed Monte Carlo simulations in the optimization routine to estimate error ranges in the extracted refractive indices resulting from multiple sources of measurement uncertainty. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive indices extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. We validated the applicability of the extracted mid-infrared refractive indices of NbN and MoSi at temperatures below their critical temperatures by comparing them with the Mattis–Bardeen model. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 μ m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.},

Based on first-principles calculations, taking 3R-type stacking GdBrI bilayer (3R-GdBrI) as an example, we demonstrate that the LP-VHE can be generated in a polar ferrovalley bilayer. In homoatomic interfacial 3R-GdBrI, the LP-VHE is spontaneously realized by combining electric polarization and magnetization. In hetero-atomic interfacial 3R-GdBrI, the LP-VHE can be achieved by applying an out-of-plane electric field (E gate ). The E gate induces transition from anomalous valley Hall effect to LP-VHE by decreasing the asymmetric distribution of the charge density. Further calculations prove that the same effects can also be observed in ferromagnetic 3R-ScClBr bilayers. Our work provides an alternative way to construct a bilayered LP-VHE system.},

The superconducting quantum interference device tests on NiFe/Pt 1− x (GdO y ) x ( x ≥ 0.30) structures reveal that the magnetization in Pt 1− x (GdO y ) x is antiparallel to that of NiFe, forming an antiferromagnetically coupled configuration at the NiFe/Pt 1− x (GdO y ) x interface.

Initial theoretical investigations indicate that doping with rare earth elements may result in promising alterations to the magnetic properties of the FePt thin films, with Er doping in particular offering a promising avenue for further study. Experimental synthesis via a combinatorial high-throughput sputtering system, which enables precise control over the composition of FePt thin films, achieves the desired magnetic properties. Small quantities of dopants, specifically 0.35 at. % Er, substantially enhance the key magnetic properties of saturation magnetization ( ⁠ μ 0 M s ⁠ ), anisotropy constant ( ⁠ K u ⁠ ) at room temperature, and the Curie temperature ( ⁠ T C ⁠ ). Precise microstructural observations of a sample show that Er segregates at grain boundaries, voids, and the substrate/FePt interface, where Er preferentially replaces Fe sites. In other regions of the FePt grains, Er is not solid-soluble, and pure FePt and FePtEr form a composite material in the order of tens of nm. The incorporation of Er also influences the damping constant α ⁠ . The findings of this study substantiate the intrinsic characteristics of Er-doped films, particularly the enhanced μ 0 M s ⁠ , K u ⁠ , and T C attainable with nominal dopant concentrations, and facilitate the realization of ultimate magnetic recording densities anticipated for future data storage technologies.},

While substantial research efforts have been predominantly concentrated on d -orbital systems, its realization in p -orbital platforms is rarely investigated. Here, taking monolayer XN (X = Ge and Sn) as prototypical systems, we demonstrate the existence of AVHE in two-dimensional p -orbital systems through first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis. Monolayer XN is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with a pair of valleys in the valence bands. The synergistic breaking of both inversion and time-reversal symmetries enables spin–orbit coupling to intrinsically lift the valley degeneracy, yielding spontaneous valley polarizations. Moreover, the emergent valley-contrasting Berry curvatures directly manifest measurable AVHE responses under in-plane electric fields. Crucially, we systematically elucidate the microscopic origin of these polarization phenomena, uncovering the essential role of in-plane p x/y orbital contribution. These findings significantly expand the candidate materials for valleytronic research.},

  abstract     = {Skyrmion bags are stable spin textured topologies with arbitrary topological charges, and have the potential to become new carriers in racetrack memory. After the discovery of skyrmion bags, the injection and driving methods of a single skyrmion are gradually applied to the manipulation of skyrmion bags. However, traditional methods, including spin current, magnetic anisotropic gradient, and spin waves generated by microwave fields, inevitably bring problems of high energy consumption and difficulty in miniaturization. With the development of strain electronics, acoustic waves have been widely used to manipulate magnetic topologies. Here, we numerically investigate the dynamical characteristic of skyrmion bags driven by surface acoustic waves. The results show that material damping and acoustic wave amplitude and frequency have a great influence on the skyrmion bag. With decrease in damping, the skyrmion bags move gradually faster. Also, increase in amplitude or frequency can generate similar effect on the velocity of skyrmion bags. Unlike acoustic wave-driven single skyrmions, the strong magnetoelastic coupling effect in the ferromagnetic film and the rich spin texture of skyrmion bags induce deformation in the skyrmion, along with a 38% increase in its velocity. Further, the deformation of the skyrmion is a combined effect of in situ rotation and breath caused by surface acoustic waves. This work demonstrates that the surface acoustic wave can be used to drive skyrmion bags, which offers potential applications for diverse storage of information based on the skyrmion bags in the future.},

Here, we show using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that Mn 3 Ge is highly prone to oxidation during conventional radio frequency (RF) MgO deposition. Mn oxidation leads to reduction in tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). The use of high off-axis angle during RF MgO deposition prevents Mn oxidation resulting in higher TMR. We also show that RF MgO growth on conventional CoFeB based electrodes does not need such high deposition angles. A significant enhancement in TMR is observed after thermal anneal of the Heusler layer. Thermal annealing improves ordering within the Mn 3 Ge layer as the Mn to Ge ratio is unchanged but leads to some interdiffusion along grain boundaries.},

It can help us develop thermoelectric materials and study the charge–phonon interaction and energy conversion laws at heterointerfaces. However, direct measurement results for Peltier heat are scarce, mainly because existing electrical or thermal imaging measurement methods find it difficult to accurately measure the heat flow through samples. Furthermore, the Peltier effect in thermoelectric elements occurs simultaneously with several heat generation and heat transfer processes, adding further complexity to the measurement. In this study, we proposed a Peltier effect characterization method based on infrared thermography and accurately characterized the Peltier heat of the Bi 2 Te 3 and Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 PN junction heterointerface using a steady-state and direct experimental system. The measurement results can form a good mutual verification with the Kelvin relationship and the Onsager reciprocal relationship. Compared with other existing measurement techniques, our method quantitatively analyzes the value of radiation heat, eliminates its influence by bidirectional current method, and can directly obtain the value of heat flux. This measurement method can achieve a temperature resolution of 50 mK and a heat flux resolution of 0.1 mW, which not only presents an effective means of accurately measuring small heat flux but also provides guidance for the development of thermoelectric theory and thermoelectric devices.},

In this study, we employed a combination of group theory analysis and first-principles calculations and carried out comprehensive angle-resolved polarization-dependent and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy measurements on CrSBr single crystals. The abnormal shifts in phonon frequency and linewidth were observed below the Néel temperature, and the underlying spin–phonon coupling within CrSBr was unveiled. Additionally, phonon softening with increasing temperature was indicated by Raman spectroscopy, mainly due to phonon anharmonicity. Phonon scattering rates also increased with temperature due to enhanced phonon–phonon interactions, supporting the prediction of low thermal conductivity in CrSBr.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that metallization emerges in the high-pressure cubic phase and further suggest that a reduction in the density of states near the Fermi level is likely responsible for the increased resistivity at higher pressures. This study reveals the role of Sb valence states in governing phase stability and metallization in mixed-valent halides, providing insights into the design of related inorganic halide perovskites with intriguing correlated electronic states.},

  abstract     = {The bandgap engineering in graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) has attracted much attention in the aim to optimize its photoelectric properties. Amorphization shows potential advantages in modulating the bandgap of various semiconductors. In this report, we propose a collaborative strategy that combines pressure treatment and introducing vacancies to fabricate amorphized g-C 3 N 4 with tunable photoluminescence (PL) wavelength. An irreversible pressure-induced amorphization occurs at ∼25 GPa for pristine g-C 3 N 4 , which retains upon decompression to ambient conditions. Through increasing amount of N vacancy, the transition pressure of amorphization decreases accompanied by tunable PL central wavelength from 581 to 640 nm at ambient conditions, while introducing N vacancies alone shifts the PL only from 560 to 619 nm. The collaborative method of pressure technology and introducing vacancies can manually prepare various amorphized materials and enhance the visible-light absorption ability.},

A phase diagram was established based on experimental results, demonstrating the occurrence of a crossover from martensitic state to STG state in Ni 49.4 Ti 50.6− x Sn x alloys, with transition temperature depending on the Sn content. For an Sn content x < 2.5, the Ni 49.4 Ti 50.6− x Sn x alloys underwent conventional B2 → B19′ martensitic transformation, and the transformation temperatures decreased with increasing the Sn content. When x ≥ 2.5, the STG transition appeared. Additionally, the shape memory effect (SME) and wide-temperature-range superelasticity (SE) were found in the NiTiSn STG alloy at sub-room temperatures.

It is fulfilled by two separated circularly polarized (CP) feeds on both sides and the arrangement of dual-mode wideband meta-atoms that utilize CP selective property. High isolation between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) ports of the system is realized by polarization mismatch between the Tx's CP feed and the CP selective metasurface. A wider operating bandwidth is realized by the compound geometric phase responses for both the Rx and Tx subsystems. To validate the proposed concept, a STAR metasurface system prototype to generate directional beams for a millimeter-wave communication system is designed and implemented in Ka -band. The measured port isolation is greater than 33 dB over the system operating bandwidth from 25.5 to 40 GHz (44.3%). The system prototype realizes excellent radiation performance of a joint 3-dB gain/axial-ratio bandwidth of 30.9% and 36.9%.

  abstract     = {In optical applications, optical resonators with high quality (Q) factors are crucial for enhancing light–matter interactions. However, achieving high Q factors in terahertz (THz) devices is often challenging. The unique properties of bound states in the continuum (BICs) enable the excitation of optical resonances with high Q factors in low loss dielectric structures. Here, we present a cross-shaped all-dielectric metasurface (MS) that can generate symmetry-protected BIC in the transverse electric mode. It is demonstrated that the BICs are protected by topological vortices of polarization vector. When the symmetry of the MS is disrupted, the BIC transforms into quasi-BIC (QBIC) with finite Q factors. Furthermore, as the degree of asymmetry increases, the Q factors obey inverse-square law with the asymmetric parameter. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated the existence of QBIC with ultra-high Q factor resonances in the THz range by fabricating a series of symmetry-broken MS samples and measuring their transmission spectra, with the maximum Q factors reaching 102. Our results not only provide valuable insights for achieving optical resonance modes with high Q factors but also promote the development of efficient THz optoelectronic devices and components across a wide range of applications.},

We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to design metasurfaces that can be used to achieve complex acoustic wave fields. This includes the design of a single metasurface that produces acoustic wave fields mimicking two different Morse code patterns upon stimulation with two orthogonal polarization states of light.

A prototype operating in the Ku-band (14–18 GHz) demonstrates effective performance, delivering a peak gain of 16.5 dBi and a wide 100° field of view.

The IB is engineered by a dual-port opening MPP–cavity–MPP sandwich structure, exhibiting sound impedance significantly lower than that of a rigid wall, as well as considerable sound absorption across the entire audible spectrum. To further enhance absorption, a hybridized system integrating over-damped resonators with the IB is proposed, giving rise to a composite impedance boundary resonator absorber. Conceptually, we have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated an ultralow-frequency absorber, which achieves average absorptance of 82% within the frequency ranges of 50–150 Hz. The total structural thickness is only 176 mm, which corresponds to 1/39 of the wavelength at 50 Hz. Our strategy leverages the synergistic effect between the IB and over-damped meta-atoms, which may enable efficient broadband absorption at extremely low frequencies.},

We synthesized Au@CeO x core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO x shells and different Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO x nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce 4+ -to-Ce 3+ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au/CeO x interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce 4+ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ states is retained in the Au@CeO x nanoparticles.

It uses a wide-aperture silicon SI lens and a pair of photoconductive antennas (PCAs—i.e., an emitter and a detector of broadband THz pulses) to perform superresolution THz spectral imaging. By raster scanning of a sample, the 3D image is collected that can be represented in the time or frequency domains, with diverse opportunities for the THz signal analysis. The microscope resolution δ depends on the THz data presentation. When analyzed in the time domain, the resolution is 0.136 λ c – 0.20 λ c (the wavelength λ c ≈ 360 μ m corresponds to the carrier frequency ν c ≈ 0.83 THz). In the spectral domain (the 0.5–1.7 THz frequency range), it is 0.147 λ – 0.304 λ and 0.047 λ – 0.156 λ in the amplitude and phase detection modes, respectively. The superior phase-domain resolution is attributed to the nonlinearity of the phase image formation procedure. The ability of THz pulsed SI microscopy to resolve subwavelength features of an object and collect the related local spectral data makes it suitable for various applications where THz spectral imaging on the ∼ 10 –100 μ m scale is required.},

The velocity and intensity of ionization wave in terms of plasma bullet is enhanced by reducing the amplitude of auxiliary pulse voltage. The uniformly distributed electron and ion density are obtained by raising the amplitude of auxiliary pulse voltage. By reducing the amplitude of auxiliary pulse voltage, the ion and electron density are concentrated in the ionization wave front, which improves the radial electric field and expands the radial size of plasma bullet. It shows that the electric field, the ion and electron density, and the electron temperature can be enhanced by elevating the amplitude difference between the internal and the applied auxiliary electrical potential.},

The Bi doped sample shows an increased electrical resistivity of 3.30 Ωcm and a positive thermopower of 442 μ VK −1 due to the increased crystal field splitting energy and stabilization of LS Co 3+ ions. The calculated weighted mobility μ W of 2.24 to 2.74 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and weighted carrier concentration n W of 8.44 × 10 17 to 3.87 × 10 20 cm −3 align well with the increased electrical resistivity.

  abstract     = {A magneto-optical trap of cesium atoms was generated by applying a circularly polarized cooling laser beam onto a reflective two-dimensional diffraction grating with an aperture and by retroreflecting the incident beam passing through the aperture while reversing the circular polarization. The cooling laser beams comprised the incident, retroreflected, and four diagonally diffracted beams at an angle of 50° with respect to the normal direction of the grating surface. The intensity of the retroreflected beam was carefully adjusted to balance the radiation forces acting on the atoms. A significant number of cold atoms (7.0 × 10 6 ) were captured, in spite of the difficulty in a magneto-optical trap of cesium atoms, using nonorthogonal cooling beams owing to the high nuclear spin. The significance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process was highlighted when the intensity of the retroreflected beam was reduced, resulting in the absence of trapped atoms. Notably, the cold atom cloud was generated near the edge of the region, where all the cooling beams were overlapped. The phenomenon is explained by the numerical calculations of the radiation forces considering all the Zeeman sublevels in the cooling transition and the Gaussian intensity profile of the incident beam.},

  abstract     = {Since nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as crucial quantum sensors in physics and biology, the massive preparation of high-quality and high-concentration shallow NV center samples has become urgent and demanding. As NV centers approach the surface and their concentration increases, charge state instability can degrade coherence and introduce additional noise. This problem is further complicated in high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds due to the presence of unclear impurities and inhomogeneous strain. Through optically detected magnetic resonance testing on various implanted samples, we analyzed the spin and charge state properties of shallow NV center ensembles. Our results reveal that the doping dose significantly influences the quantity of NV − , charge, and charge stability. Our findings indicate that over-implanting nitrogen as electron donors before starting graphitization helps stabilize the charge environment of the shallow NV center ensembles. By controlling the nitrogen ion implantation dose, we optimized charge state stability under photoionization and prepared high-quality NV center ensemble samples in HPHT diamonds at the optimal implantation dose range of 2 × 10 13 – 8 × 10 13 ions/cm 2 . This method, which relies solely on nitrogen ion implantation and annealing on HPHT diamond, significantly reduces the cost of sensor samples, greatly benefiting the promotion of quantum sensing.},

  abstract     = {Compact cesium beam clocks are widely utilized in various applications. In contemporary commercial cesium clocks, two primary approaches are employed: the magnetically selected state scheme and the optical pumping scheme. Here, we propose a magneto-optically pumped cesium beam clock with a frequency stability of 2.3 × 10 − 12 τ − 1 / 2 ⁠ . In this scheme, the pumping light and state selection magnet are both used for the preparation of atomic states. In the magnetic field of the state selection magnet, the relationship between pumping efficiency and laser frequency, laser power, and laser position has been investigated. Eventually, we find a position that allows the laser to resonate with cyclic transition line | F = 3 ⟩ − | F ′ = 2 ⟩ to pump almost all of the atoms | F = 3 ⟩ to state | F = 4 ⟩ ⁠ . Therefore, we can pump and detect atoms without the use of an AOM. This approach not only combines the advantage of low atomic velocity from the magnetically selected state scheme and the high atomic utilization efficiency from the optical pumping scheme but also simplifies the scheme of optically pumped cesium beam clock. In addition, this physical system can also facilitate the investigation of the shift in cesium atomic energy levels under strong magnetic fields.},

We demonstrate that in the case of the transport of magnetic atoms, the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport, therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling.

Bonded heterostructures offer distinct advantages over conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayers by synergistically stabilizing lattice frameworks through interfacial interactions. 2D hybrid lattices composed of honeycomb and kagome structures have garnered significant attention due to their unique geometries and tailored electronic states. Herein, via first-principles calculations, we propose a strongly bonded β 12 -borophene ( β 12 -B)/hybrid honeycomb–kagome silicene (hhk-Si) heterostructure as a high-performance anode for lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). This bonded configuration exhibits superior structural stability compared to van der Waals counterparts, as evidenced by machine learning-accelerated ab initio molecular dynamics simulations spanning an extended 100 ps timeframe. The heterostructure demonstrates intrinsic structural robustness during multi-ion intercalation, coupled with stable adsorption sites featuring ultralow diffusion barriers (Li: 0.35 eV; Na: 0.20 eV). Notably, the predicted maximum sodium storage capacity reaches 1823 mAh/g, outperforming both monolayers and most 2D heterostructures. These findings suggest that the proposed β 12 -B/hhk-Si is a promising anode for SIBs and paves the way for kagome–honeycomb hybrid lattices in energy storage applications.},

However, these devices encounter challenges arising from defects within the perovskite lattice and at interfaces, which lead to non-radiative recombination and voltage losses. To address these issues, we have developed a synergistic approach that combines bulk passivation using l -cystine dihydrochloride as an additive with subsequent surface passivation treatments. This compound effectively passivates Pb 2+ and halide defects through its carbonyl and amine functional groups. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that l -cystine dihydrochloride effectively reduces trap states, retards nucleation kinetics, promotes grain growth, and enhances crystallinity. Consequently, the device [FA 0.8 Cs 0.2 Pb(I 0.6 Br 0.4 ) 3 , energy gap: 1.77 eV] incorporating l -cystine dihydrochloride achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 16.00%, which was further increased to 17.03% with an additional octylammonium iodide surface passivation. Expanding our approach, we have fabricated the wide bandgap semitransparent device, yielding a PCE of 15.62%. When integrated with narrow-bandgap organic solar cells in four-terminal (4T) perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, a remarkable efficiency of 23.14% was attained. This strategy effectively improves the performance of wide bandgap PSCs, which exhibit great potential in advancing perovskite/organic photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a multi-modal bidirectional galloping energy harvester, enabled by mode transition mechanism (MBEH-MT), to address the wind direction limitation of conventional galloping-based piezoelectric wind energy harvesters. The MBEH-MT features a three-bluff-body configuration connected by symmetric cantilever beams, allowing energy harvesting in both positive and negative wind directions. A continuous coupled mathematical model is developed based on Hamilton's principle and Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, with modal reduction via the Galerkin method. The first three modes are investigated through the analysis of mode shapes and natural frequencies. The theoretical results are validated through a series of wind tunnel tests, which demonstrates that the third mode is dominant under the positive wind direction, whereas mode transition phenomenon from the first mode to the second mode occurs under the negative wind direction. The results imply that the mode transition characteristics are beneficial for significantly enhancing energy harvesting efficiency through the adaptation of vibration modes under alternating negative wind speeds. The experimental results indicate that the MBEH-MT is feasible for achieving bidirectional wind energy harvesting. Moreover, a 112.4% increase in output power is achieved, compared to the conventional galloping energy harvester constructed with a single cantilever beam, reaching an overall average output power of 19.72 μ W. The outstanding performance and bidirectional wind adaptability of the proposed system highlight its potential for powering low-consumption devices under alternating wind directions, such as tunnel entrances and exhaust ducts.},

  abstract     = {Many materials with novel or exotic properties are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as air, solvents, and heat, which complicate device fabrication and limit their potential applications. Here, we present a universal sub-micrometer fabrication method for mesoscopic devices using a dry-transfer technique, tailored specifically for sensitive materials. This approach utilizes PMMA masks, combined with a water-dissoluble coating as a sacrificial layer, to ensure that sensitive materials are processed without exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The entire fabrication process is carried out in a glovebox, employing dry techniques that avoid air, solvents, and heat exposure, culminating in an encapsulation step. We demonstrate the utility of this method by fabricating and characterizing K 2 Cr 3 As 3 and WTe 2 devices, a one- and two-dimensional material, respectively. The results show that our technique preserves the integrity of the materials, provides excellent contact interfaces, and is broadly applicable to a range of sensitive materials.},

  abstract     = {All-electric-controlled nonvolatile spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) based on 2D multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures hold significant promise for spintronics. However, their performance is constrained by the limited availability of 2D magnetic materials capable of switching between metallic and semiconducting states, with tunable bandgaps controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Most research focuses on modifying semiconducting materials to achieve metallic behavior. We propose an approach that utilizes interface effects to convert metallic 2D magnetic materials into half-metals and induce half-semiconducting behavior via ferroelectric polarization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the CrPS 3 /Sc 2 CO 2 heterostructure show that Sc 2 CO 2 polarization can modulate the electronic structure of CrPS 3 , switching it from half-metallic to half-semiconducting. Using this approach, we designed an SFET, and Nonequilibrium Green's function combined with DFT (NEGF-DFT) analysis revealed an on/off current ratio greater than 5.43 × 10 6 %, with nearly 100% spin-polarized current at 6500 μ A/ μ m and a bias voltage below 0.2 V. This method paves the way for high-performance SFETs that exceed the capabilities of current 2D materials.},

This InGaN spacer significantly enhanced the resonant tunneling current compared to conventional GaN-only spacers, achieving a peak current density of up to 622 kA/cm 2 , peak-to-valley current ratio of 1.56, and a maximum negative differential conductance of 7.1 mS/ μ m 2 . The oscillator structure featured split-ring resonators integrated with bow-tie antennas, which improved the radiation efficiency on the low-frequency side, facilitating effective electromagnetic wave emission at an intended oscillation frequency. The fabricated AlN/GaN-RTD oscillators exhibited sub-terahertz oscillations in the 88–104 GHz frequency range.

  abstract     = {The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer–Büttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives that electron–electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the current flows inside the incompressible strips. Because the latter gradually shifts from the sample edges into the bulk as the magnetic field is increased, it suggests a transition from edge- to bulk-current. We present direct experimental proof of this transition. Our results support the screening theory.},

Both the ferroelectric orthorhombic and paraelectric monoclinic phases were found to coexist in the 30 nm thick film, and the fraction of the former phase increased with the decrease in thickness down to 5 nm. Although the effective EO coefficient, r eff , remained almost unchanged down to 10 nm and decreased with a further decrease in thickness, the evident EO response was observed down to 3 nm, which agrees with the fact that HZO films can maintain ferroelectric properties down to a few monolayers in thickness. The small r eff in the HZO films with thickness below 5 nm was attributed to the stabilization of the ferroelectric rhombohedral-like phase.},

Control experiments on light metal bilayers with NiFe (permalloy) as ferromagnet and a single layer of Ni show absence of torque and suppression of UOMR, corroborating the role of Ni as an efficient converter of orbital to spin current and role of light metals as source of orbital current.

  abstract     = {Synthesized AgVP 2 Se 6 , an intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductor with van der Waals layered structure, has opened possibilities for investigating two-dimensional magnetism and spintronic device applications. Magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) defines the stability of magnetization in a specific direction with respect to the crystal lattice and is an important parameter for nanoscale applications. Here, we systematically study the MAE of AgVP 2 Se 6 monolayers using carrier doping and biaxial strain, through first-principles calculations. Our computational analysis reveals that carrier doping amplifies the MAE to 0.33 meV/atom. Subsequent synergistic application with biaxial strain further elevates the MAE to 1.72 meV/atom. Orbital-resolved analysis identifies the enhancement mechanism through distinct contributions from V and Ag atoms: ⟨ d xy | L z | d x 2 −y 2 ⟩ and ⟨ d yz | L x | d z 2 ⟩ orbitals in V atoms cooperate with ⟨ d yz | L z | d xz ⟩ and ⟨ d yz | L x | d z 2 ⟩ components from Ag atoms. Additionally, the magnetic exchange interaction is also enhanced under modulation of carrier doping and biaxial strain, the nearest-neighbor exchange constant increases to 1.85 meV. By carrying out Monte Carlo simulations, we predict the Curie temperature ( T C ) enhanced up to ∼100 K. This work establishes an effective strategy for improving the MAE of AgVP 2 Se 6 and significantly advances its potential for spintronic applications at low temperatures.},

Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of the Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the steady propagation of 180-degree domain walls (180DWs) of Néel vectors in thin antiferromagnetic strips under vertically injected spin currents with various polarization orientations. Our results show that only spin currents polarized parallel to the hard axis guarantee a quick and steady rigid flow of 180DWs, thus realize a fast reversal of Néel vectors in antiferromagnets (AFMs). Different from the common “current-in-plane” geometry, which is feasible only for metallic AFMs, our “current-out-of-plane” layout under investigation can further apply to insulating or semiconducting AFMs (which are more common in real applications) via quantum tunneling effect. The results from this work pave the way for fine control of Néel vectors in strip-shaped AFMs and further development of magnetic nanodevices based on them.},

  abstract     = {The planar Hall effect (PHE) has attracted significant attention due to its low thermal drift and high signal-to-noise ratio, which provide distinct advantages in characterizing the intrinsic properties of materials and in the applications of spintronic devices. Previous studies focused on only one measurement mode: rotating the magnetic field in the in-plane direction. This implies that the use of PHE to study the properties of a sample has significant limitations, that is, it can only be used to analyze the in-plane properties of a sample. Here, we define PHE, which was previously measured by rotating the magnetic field in a plane, as in-plane PHE and introduce the concept of out-of-plane PHE and its corresponding test method. Subsequently, we investigated the in-plane and out-of-plane PHE of Sb 2 Te 3 as a case study, confirming the soundness and reliability of the in-plane and out-of-plane PHE concepts proposed in this paper, along with the corresponding testing methods. Out-of-plane PHE was proposed to address the limitations of using PHE to explore relevant properties in materials. For example, it is now possible to explore the anisotropic transport properties of materials in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions using PHE. Furthermore, we propose a design idea for a PHE-based four-state logic cell that combines in-plane and out-of-plane PHE. Overall, our study introduces the concept of out-of-plane PHE and its corresponding testing method, thereby solving a problem in current PHE research, paving the way for better understanding of PHE, and opening additional opportunities for PHE applications.},

By stacking multiple GR symmetric PC interfaces, the coupled edge states (CES) are found, which originate from the coupling between the adjacent interfaces. The multi-mode interference (MMI) effects of CESs were predicted based on finite element method simulation and confirmed by an acoustic experiment. In a further way, a topological edge state frequency splitter based on MMI effects was designed and demonstrated by both numerical simulations and experiments.

  abstract     = {We have developed a technological process for obtaining compacted multi-graphene structures (CMGSs) with the thermal conductivity of 500 W/(m×K). We propose the “Soft” regime of graphite intercalation procedure, which yields conglomerates with alternating stacks of five graphene layers, while the “Standard” regime is characterized by the formation of alternating stacks of three graphene layers. X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy studies of Soft and Standard CMGS have shown that the thermal conductivity of these materials is limited by defect density, size distribution, and misorientation of nanocrystallites. The effect of micro-deformations and residual macro-stresses on thermal conductivity of CMGS is discussed. The Soft method facilitated the formation of CMGSs with a less disrupted internal structure, characterized by increased nanocrystallites and reduced misorientation angles relative to the Standard approach, resulting in a 38% enhancement in thermal conductivity. A refined model is proposed that incorporates these key structural factors governing heat transport in CMGSs. The proposed method made possible the preparation of CMGS-based material with a thermal conductivity 25% higher and with a density five times lower than those of copper. Our findings demonstrate that precise regulation of the intermolecular explosion parameters enables the design of lightweight, flexible carbon-based materials with engineered thermal conductivity characteristics for advanced thermal-management applications.},

Argon was used as a quasi-hydrostatic pressure-transmitting medium. The phase transition from low-density β-Ga 2 O 3 to high-density α-Ga 2 O 3 was observed, beginning at approximately 20.57 GPa and completing in the pressure range of 39.70–42.29 GPa. The α-Ga 2 O 3 phase remains stable up to approximately 80 GPa at ambient temperature, and the β-to-α phase transition is an irreversible reconstructive phase transition. A third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fit to the unit-cell volume as a function of pressure yielded a zero-pressure bulk modulus B 0 of 200.2(22) GPa for β-Ga 2 O 3 , with a pressure derivative B 0 ′ of 3.0(11) GPa. For α-Ga 2 O 3 , the fit gave B 0 = 354.8(43) GPa and B 0 ′ = 2.2(8) GPa. When B 0 ′ was fixed at 4, a re-fit of the experimental data provided B 0 = 267.9(7) GPa for the α-phase, which is higher than B 0 = 182.6(7) GPa for the β-phase, indicating that α-Ga 2 O 3 exhibits greater resistance to compression. Based on high-pressure experimental results for β-Ga 2 O 3 at different temperatures, the phase boundary for the β-to-α transition, exhibiting a negative Clapeyron slope, is presented in this study. With increasing temperature, the onset pressure of the β-to-α transition gradually decreases, and the phase transition hysteresis effect weakens.},

However, for semiconductors without surface insulating layers, either native oxides or intentionally fabricated ones, conventional conductive tips are unsuitable because direct tip–sample contact induces charge injection, hampering the imaging of intrinsic semiconductor properties, particularly dominant carrier concentration distributions. To address this limitation, we propose an insulating tip, prepared by depositing a thin insulating layer on a conductive tip. We demonstrate that this insulating tip enables the imaging of intrinsic semiconductor properties while preventing charge injection. Our approach can be extended to other SNMM techniques, thereby broadening their applications in semiconductor material and device characterization.},

In this study, a strain reconfiguration strategy utilizing a medium-temperature AlN (MT-AlN) interlayer is proposed. By optimizing the MT-AlN thickness at 1000 °C, tensile strain originating from the GaN template is systematically released through interfacial relaxation and lattice redistribution within the interlayer. Additionally, the engineered configuration also establishes a coherent crystalline template with programmable strain states for subsequent epitaxial growth. With a 25-nm optimized interlayer, crack-free Al 0.35 ∼ 0 GaN multiple heterojunctions are epitaxially grown on the GaN template with slight compressive strain and nearly no additional dislocations. The resultant high-crystallinity AlGaN heterostructures enable the UV photodetector to achieve high responsivity (maximum 1.4 × 10 3 A/W), ultrafast response speed (0.6/25.4 ns rise/fall time), and remarkable operational stability simultaneously. All these collectively validate the MT-AlN strain reconfiguration as a viable pathway for the advancement of AlGaN-based optoelectronic devices.},

Experimental results reveal significant responses in the absorption peaks of both intra- and interlayer excitons following Li + intercalation. Specifically, the energy difference between A and B excitons decreased, and the oscillator strength of interlayer excitons diminished. The deduced interlayer distance expanded from 0.60 to 0.62 nm, confirming the intercalation of Li + . The electrical measurements and differential reflectance spectra demonstrated the reversibility of this intercalation process.

AFM images reveal the presence of threading-dislocation (TD)-related V-pits and shallow trench defects. The trench defects are classified into three categories on the basis of their height relative to a flat QW: lowered-, level-, and raised-center trench defects. SNOM-PL images demonstrate that TDs and all types of shallow trench defects exhibit a low emission intensity, indicating that they act as non-radiative recombination centers. Unlike previous studies on low-In content samples, all the trench defects exhibit a low emission intensity in our high-In content sample because of In segregation. Given the correlation of dark emission positions between the blue and red emissions, as well as the lower screw-type TD density at the surface than at the n-GaN layer, screw-type TDs should be one of the triggers in the formation of shallow trench defects. Therefore, to enhance the external quantum efficiency of hybrid InGaN red LEDs, it is crucial to suppress In segregation within shallow trench defects and decrease screw-type TD density.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the single-event burnout (SEB) effect of β -Ga 2 O 3 Schottky barrier diode (SBD) under atmospheric neutron irradiation, including the degradation modes and physical mechanisms. The experimental results indicate that the reverse bias voltage ( U R ) is a critical factor influencing SEB failure of β -Ga 2 O 3 SBD devices. When U R reaches 600 V, SEB failure occurs, characterized as a sudden loss of voltage-blocking capability during atmospheric neutron irradiation. The Emission Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis reveal that SEB events occur at the edge of the Schottky junction, with the damaged area forming an approximately elliptical molten “void.” Geant 4 and TCAD simulation results show that the incidence of secondary ions, such as Cr, causes a rise in the lattice temperature inside the device, with the maximum lattice temperature increasing as U R increases. When U R is sufficiently high, the local lattice temperature reaches the melting point of the Ga 2 O 3 material, ultimately leading to SEB failure. This study provides valuable theoretical support for Ga 2 O 3 -based power devices in aerospace applications.},

Light-emitting diodes with mesa sizes as small as 250 × 250 nm 2 show ideal forward voltage and low leakage current density. It is observed that sidewall treatment and passivation methods used in micro-light-emitting diodes (2–20 μ m) do not lead to the same level of sidewall recombination suppression for submicron ones (<1 μ m), as evidenced by a ∼70% decrease in peak external quantum efficiencies when mesa sizes are scaled from 2 μ m down to 250 nm. This is attributed to the lateral carrier diffusion being comparable to the mesa size, regardless of the sidewall passivation and recovery. The results call for rethinking the impact of sidewalls in emerging top-down fabricated (sub)micrometer-light-emitting diodes.},

Based on the temperature-dependent dielectric, ferroelectricity, x-ray diffraction, and piezoresponse domain image analysis, the ferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transition is suggested to play a dominant role, with the ferroelectric state to relaxor state transition providing an auxiliary enhancement.

We find that oxygen vacancies are preferentially located around In atoms in as-grown crystals, which are filled out by post-annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. We also find the presence of intrinsic hydroxy bonds, which persists even after oxygen annealing. The subgap states near the conduction-band minimum were clearly observed only in the as-grown crystals, while the subgap states near the valence-band maximum (VBM) were much weaker than those in the previous study even without oxygen annealing. The absence of the near-VBM subgap states in our single crystals suggests that in addition to oxygen vacancies, the loss of crystallinity is also relevant to the formation of the near-VBM subgap states.},

Currently, the chiral response is fundamentally constrained by the rapid decay of quality ( Q -) factors with symmetry breaking, making the robustness of higher- Q particularly crucial. In this paper, we propose the metasurfaces composed of the double-skeleton-fan unit cells with sixfold rotational symmetry. Moreover, by introducing gap perturbation and scale perturbation, the guided modes originally below the light cone are folded above the light cone through Brillouin zone folding (BZF), enabling the q-BZF-BICs with enhanced Q -factors ( Q > 10 6 ). Furthermore, by tuning the tilted extrusion parameters, near-perfect circularly polarized light (ellipticity χ = 0.99) is achieved in the parameter space. Notably, the extrinsic (circular dichroism CD = 0.98) and intrinsic chirality (CD = 0.97) are realized through simultaneous breaking of in-plane and out-of-plane symmetries. Chiral metasurfaces enable sensing, lasing, and pharmaceutical applications.},

Herein, four CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS)/MoTe 2 heterostructures with three band alignment transitions are obtained by controlling polarization direction and interface mismatch. To study the influence of polarization reversal and the different band alignments on transport properties, an analytical model is established to clarify the interface charge separation and recombination induced by built-in electric fields in type-II and Z-scheme heterostructures. The results show that polarization reversal can enhance the interface electron mobility by more than two orders of magnitude, and interface Auger recombination can greatly enhance the lifetime of photogenerated carriers at relatively higher bands. Moreover, by involving the energy loss induced by the interface electric field scattering rate and Auger recombination rate, we find that the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of CIPS/MoTe 2 with Z-scheme heterostructure is much larger than that of type-II heterostructures. Our prediction provides a quantitative approach to deal with the photocatalytic properties from interface transport under various band alignments and may offer guidance to pursue multifunctional applications in 2D ferroelectric materials.},

However, extending their performance to longer wavelengths remains a challenge, as the carrier transport properties tend to degrade with the increasing superlattices period required to achieve such wavelengths. Consequently, a detailed investigation of the temperature dependence of carrier transport properties as a function of cutoff wavelength is critical for addressing the forthcoming challenges. In this study, we investigated the carrier transport properties of a large set of InAs/InAsSb type-II superlattices samples, with cutoff wavelength spanning from MWIR to very-long wave infrared (VLWIR). The temperature dependence of the minority carrier lifetime was examined and compared across samples. We also analyzed the temperature dependence of hole diffusion length and mobility using a quantum efficiency model. The mobility of the MWIR samples ( ⁠ ≈ 1.6 cm 2 / V s ⁠ ) was approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the samples with longer cutoff wavelengths. Further, we extended our analysis by extracting minority transport properties from simulations of dark current density. Our results show that mobility increases with cutoff wavelength, ranging from ≈ 1.6 cm 2 / V s for MWIR samples, to ≈ 27 cm 2 / V s for LWIR, and up to ≈ 200 cm 2 / V s for VLWIR.},

Moreover, when an additional microparticle is introduced into the gradient light pattern, particle interactions lead to the other equilibrium state.

  abstract     = {Creating nonreciprocal optical components is important for applications such as optical communication, quantum networks, and emerging applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In particular, ring cavities with nonreciprocal clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) modes play essential roles in quantum nonreciprocity, sensing, and in-memory photonic computing cells. Here, we propose a scheme to realize magnetic-free nonreciprocal cavity modes in a stationary cavity by using the natural chiral broadening hiding in the thermal atomic ensemble. The chiral broadening causes different phase delays for the CW and CCW modes, resulting in a difference in their resonant frequencies, which supports the breaking of their degeneracy. It is found that this difference is proportional to atomic density and interaction length. We experimentally demonstrate such a nonreciprocal cavity and get higher than 98% isolation contrast as an isolator. Since the difference required for these two cavity modes to be completely separated depends on the cavity linewidth, the requirement of atomic density and interaction length in our scheme can be dramatically reduced by increasing the finesse of the cavity, which paves the way for miniaturization and integration of such a nonreciprocal component. Moreover, nonreciprocal cavity modes serve as a chiral reservoir, enabling the exploration of physics driven by this chirality.},

Multi-field-induced ion migration has led to the identification of reconfigurable heterojunction devices as potential candidates for next-generation information devices due to their rich physical property modulation capabilities, which exceed those of conventional devices. This Perspective will discuss multi-field-induced ionic and electronic processes, including ion migration, charge trapping, and spin polarization in heterojunction devices with reconfigurable conductance. Applications such as ultrahigh-density memory, in-memory computing, encryption, neuromorphic computing, and perception are also summarized.

In this Letter, we systematically investigate the chronic degradation mechanism of the NbO x threshold switching (TS) device in integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons by sustained operations. The SVS of the device is solidly verified and attributed to the changes of the TS region. Particularly, the biased evolution of the TS region diameter during operation dominates the different SVS in the reverse response. This reveals the irreversible degradation of the devices and neurons and further demonstrates their limited self-repair ability by implementing symmetric pulse stimulation. This work clarifies the SVS mechanism of NbO x -based TS devices in LIF neurons, providing support for extending neuronal lifespan and developing reliable neuron-based hardware.},

As a result, it facilitates functions such as high-pass filtering, Morse coding, information decryption, and sensory memory temporariness.

While the optical cycle is well understood, a comprehensive energetic analysis of higher-lying states has received less attention until recently. In this joint experimental theoretical study, we identify and characterize five high-energy states beyond those involved in the optical cycle. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determine their transition energies and relative oscillator strengths. Additionally, we perform two independent numerical studies employing two state-of-the-art post-density functional theory methods to support the experimental findings and assign energy levels.

The passivation layers were fabricated via a scalable doctor-blading technique under ambient conditions, achieving power conversion efficiencies exceeding 16% over a large active area of 64.624 cm 2 . PEACl and PDADI together reduced surface defects, suppressed 2D-phase formation, and increased grain size from 450 to 850 nm. Moreover, the defect density at the perovskite/electron transport layer interface decreased by approximately 27%, leading to a notable enhancement in device efficiency from ∼15% up to a maximum of 16.05%. These results demonstrate that the developed dual-passivation method effectively addresses both photovoltaic performance and phase stability issues, providing a scalable and industrially viable approach toward the fabrication of high-efficiency wide-bandgap perovskite solar modules.},

It is well accepted that the higher surface area of carbon will enable a higher capacity of energy storage. An interesting question is what could happen if the half channel size is less than the Stern layer spacing. In this study, we grew CNTs into carbonized basswood for EDLCs, in which the CNT density varied in bass carbon sheets with different thicknesses, eventually giving various pore/channel sizes. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the bass carbon with a higher CNT density exhibits inferior performance compared to specimens with lower CNT densities. Further investigation through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggests that such anomalous behavior in energy storage is attributed to the restricted ion diffusion within the densely packed CNTs in bass carbon channels.},

This study introduces a microwave power reception (MPR) metasurface array based on a gradient-index design. Operating at a center frequency of 5.8 GHz, the array enables efficient conversion and concentration of incident plane waves (PWs) into surface waves (SWs) through cosine-modulated gradient-index units, with a modulation center strategically placed along the array boundary. A key innovation lies in the direct integration of a standard SubMiniature Version A (SMA) connector at the modulation center to collect the concentrated surface wave energy, significantly simplifying the receiving structure and eliminating the need for multiple rectifiers or complex feed networks commonly used in traditional MPR systems. Compared with conventional rectenna arrays, the proposed design achieves a PW-SW conversion efficiency of 68.42%. Simulations, accounting for impedance mismatch at the SMA port, yield an energy collection efficiency of 46.71%, while experimental measurements confirm a peak efficiency of 39.24% at 5.8 GHz. Moreover, the overall system complexity is reduced by over 60%. Although the direct-feed approach introduces impedance mismatch that constrains further performance enhancement, the proposed method offers a low-cost, easily integrable MPR solution that maintains reasonable reception efficiency and simplifies both the design and fabrication processes for specific application scenarios.},

The resulting CoSe x O y -200 exhibited enhanced catalytic kinetics toward ethanol oxidation reaction, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a low potential of 1.34 V. The improved catalytic performance is attributed to a topochemical transition-induced spin reconstruction, optimizing the adsorption of reaction intermediates. Building on these findings, the catalyst was further applied to a zinc–ethanol–air battery, leading to a decrease in charging voltage and a narrowed charge–discharge voltage window, which is less than 650 mV.

Here, the resonant Raman scattering will be utilized to study an exciton–phonon interaction in GaN nanocrystals, further enhanced by the underlying graphene. Raman spectroscopy using various excitation energies shows how the exciton–phonon interaction behaves, unveiling the scattering strength. The origin of the interaction is in the condition of resonance, which is directly observed in the temperature resolved spectra. Most importantly, the underlying graphene strongly enhances the coupling of phonons and excitons. Consequently, an enhanced resonant Raman spectrum of GaN nanocrystals possessing clearly observable phonon overtones up to the fourth order has been obtained. It has been demonstrated that the responsible effect is the electron transfer between nanocrystals and the underlying graphene. The utilization of such an increased coupling effect can be beneficial for a study of the charge carrier scattering in semiconducting nanomaterials, analysis of their crystal quality, improvement of sensor sensitivity, and in the subsequent development of new-generation optoelectronic devices.},

The performance is further enhanced by ICs cascading FERs, showing a proportional enhancement of sensitivity vs the number of cascaded FERs ( N FER ) and leading to a sensitivity as high as 11.76 mV/°C.

  abstract     = {The Lamb wave filter (LWF) has a moderate bandwidth, and the conventional temperature compensation method with one layer of SiO 2 on the Lamb wave resonator (LWR) will significantly reduce its effective electromechanical coupling coefficient. This, in turn, narrows the bandwidth of the LWF and limits its application range. This paper achieves high temperature stability for both the LWR and LWF by employing a strategy that combines a double-layer SiO 2 and a groove structure based on a Sc 0.2 Al 0.8 N film. Finite element analysis is employed to investigate the effect of adding single or double layers of SiO 2 films on the temperature stability of the Sc 0.2 Al 0.8 N LWR. The simulation results show that applying SiO 2 to both the top and bottom of the Sc 0.2 Al 0.8 N film can mitigate the reduction in k 2 while enhancing temperature stability. The groove structure in the piezoelectric layer can simultaneously improve the temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) and k 2 by altering the electric field distribution and boundary conditions. Measurement results show that the double-layer SiO 2 improves the TCF of the LWR to approximately –10 ppm/°C. The grooves can further improve the TCF toward 0 ppm/°C and increase the k 2 of LWR.},

  abstract     = {Among the most classical two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures, graphene stands out to exhibit unique electronic properties through manipulations of stacking layers, twist angles, strain, and external electric and magnetic fields. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of twisted trilayer graphene ( t TLG) using first-principles calculations, considering various twist angles θ 12 ⁠ , which is the angle between the bottom and middle layers, and θ 23 ⁠ , which is the angle between the top and middle layers. For trilayer configurations AÃA, where θ 23 = θ 12 ⁠ , and AÃÃ′, where θ 23 ≠ θ 12 ⁠ , supercells as large as containing 23 338 atoms are built to capture the impact of twist angles on the electronic properties in t TLG using RESCU+. We discover that flatbands (with bandwidths less than 100 meV) can emerge when the twist angles approach certain magic angles while θ 12 ⋅ θ 23 > 0. The bandwidth minimizes near these magic angles and varies smoothly with the twist angle, exhibiting no abrupt changes. Despite the symmetry being affected by the shift of the bottom and top layers leading to the changes in the Dirac cones, the flatbands exhibit remarkable robustness and retain their distinct properties. Our findings explain why the correlated states can also exist at twist angles slightly away from the exact magic angles.},

  abstract     = {High-quality hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a reliable dielectric material for two-dimensional (2D) electronic devices because of its atomic flatness, ultrahigh optical transparency, wide energy bandgap, and high dielectric breakdown field. Traditionally, the best-quality hBN is mostly synthesized under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). Because the HPHT method requires complex apparatus and limits the size of hBN crystals, it is desirable to grow large-area and high-quality hBN single crystals by a simpler method such as the synthesis under atmospheric pressure and high temperature (APHT). However, the comprehensive characterizations of APHT grown single crystals, particularly the dielectric breakdown information required for electronic applications, are still lacking. Here, we fabricate more than 30 graphite/hBN/graphite devices to systematically characterize the dielectric breakdown behaviors of APHT grown hBN crystals, along with other hBN crystals grown by different methods or vendors for direct comparison. The field values of dielectric breakdown, defined by the onset of leakage current, monotonically increase with the decrease in hBN thickness. Below the thickness of 10 nm, the field value reaches above 8 MV/cm. The dielectric breakdown behavior is comparable to that grown by HPHT. Our statistic results, along with the characterizations of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and optical second harmonic generation microscopy, show that the hBN crystal under APHT is an ideal substitute for designing and fabricating the best-quality 2D electronic devices.},

Previous studies have already measured the planar Hall effect (PHE) and in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of t-PtBi 2 . We noticed that their experimental results exhibited high-order features in both the PHE and AMR, yet these features were not systematically investigated. In our work, we conducted more systematic measurements and analyses of the PHE and AMR in t-PtBi 2 . Both PHE and AMR show high-order features under low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, and these features share a similar temperature and magnetic field dependence with the “turn-on” behavior of resistance and temperature curves, indicating a common physical origin for them. We further summarize the critical conditions for the emergence of high-order PHE in t-PtBi 2 , which will help to understand the origin of high-order features. In addition, we performed computational simulations on the AMR of t-PtBi 2 , and the results were consistent with the experiments, indicating the high-order features are the result of the combined contribution of the Fermi surface anisotropy and the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the origins of high-order features in non-magnetic topological materials.},

It has been demonstrated that the high values are mostly contributed by the surface piezoelectric response of spontaneously polarized surface layers, and their proportion even exceeds 99%. Herein, we introduced polymorph phase boundary (PPB) into the polarized surface layers of BaHf 0.01 Ti 0.99 O 3 ceramics in order to enhance the surface piezoelectric response. Ultimately, an ultrahigh effective flexoelectric coefficient ( μ ρ ) of ∼ 550 μ C/m was obtained in the BaHf 0.01 Ti 0.99 O 3 ceramics at room temperature, the maximum μ ρ reaching 910 μ C/m at the Curie temperature ( T C ), which is more than that of other BaHf x Ti 1− x O 3 ceramics. The large surface piezoelectric response of BaHf 0.01 Ti 0.99 O 3 ceramics can persist up to T C , which should be attributed to the biaxial stress clamping PPB in the polarized surface layers, allowing the high μ ρ to be maintained close to the T C . Our study not only provides a strategy to enhance the flexoelectric coefficients in ferroelectric ceramics but also aids in a deeper understanding of the significant contribution of the polarized surface layers to the flexoelectric coefficients.},

  abstract     = {The electrocaloric effect enables solid-state refrigeration technology with high energy efficiency and zero global warming potential. Normal displacive ferroelectric materials exhibit the highest electrocaloric effect just above their Curie point. The freezing temperature ( T f ) of a relaxor ferroelectric material functions as a Curie point in displacive ferroelectrics, suggesting that the highest electrocaloric effect for a relaxor ferroelectric material is near its T f . However, relaxor ferroelectrics often exhibit significant hysteresis around T f , making them unsuitable for electrocaloric applications. In this work, we show that the highest electrocaloric effect in lead-free Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 -SrTiO 3 -based relaxor ferroelectric ceramics occurs at temperatures a few degrees above the temperature with their maximum permittivity ( T m ) and is far above their T f . Moreover, the A-site vacancy design can be used to effectively increase the electrocaloric effect and broaden the working temperature range, which is due to the increase in field-induced polarization and strong relaxation achieved via point defect engineering. This Letter reveals the appropriate temperature window for the high electrocaloric effect in relaxor ferroelectrics and shows that the A-site vacancy design can further enhance electrocaloric properties and extend the working temperature range for electrocaloric applications.},

As a result of the resonance of Josephson oscillations with oscillations in the circuit, a time-independent superconducting current arises in the junction. Due to the coupling of the Josephson phase and the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, the resulting superconducting current leads to a deviation of the easy axis from its initial position and to a precession of the magnetization around the tilted axis. We show that the tilt value increases with increasing spin–orbit interaction and the Josephson to magnetic energy ratio. An analytical expression for the magnetization tilt is obtained, which agrees well with the results of numerical calculations.

In particular, the suppression of the critical current as a function of the gate voltage has been widely investigated. However, time domain studies are discussed only in a few cases. In this paper, we present a microwave characterization of a gate-controlled Al-capped InAs nanowire embedded in a λ / 4 coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a shift in the resonator frequency and an increase in its internal losses as a function of the gate voltage, which we relate to a change in the imaginary and real components of the nanowire impedance, respectively. We demonstrate that these changes are described by the Mattis–Bardeen model with an effective temperature. We further study the resonator response to fast-varying gate signals and measure characteristic response times of the order of 40 ns, both in time domain and parametric modulation experiments. Our study elucidates the impact of the gate on the complex impedance of the nanowire in the superconducting state, as well as its dynamic performance, providing a foundation for the design of gate-controlled superconducting devices.},

Here, we report an incoherent superconducting nanowire phonon detector to convert the phase transitions induced by out-of-equilibrium phonons into electric pulse signals, enabling discrete-time measurements. The statistical properties of the gate-induced signals reveal the Poisson properties of phonon injection and the thermalization dynamics of hot electrons in the GCS on the α-Si substrate. These mechanisms are further evidenced by applying opposite gate voltages on two remote gates, in which only phonons play a role. The proposed detector not only is a candidate for constructing phonon-based solid quantum devices based on the GCS but also contributes to research on the out-of-equilibrium phenomena in superconducting nanodevices.},

  abstract     = {Spin superfluidity, a phenomenon enabling low-dissipative spin transport, has remained a theoretical concept. To realize spin superfluidity in an antiferromagnet, it is necessary to excite a Néel vector rotation within the magnetic easy-plane, which has been elusive so far due to the large magnetocrystalline anisotropy of antiferromagnets. In this study, we demonstrated spin–orbit torque-driven Néel vector rotation in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo. A pseudo-magnetic easy-plane is formed in a spin-flop state under an external magnetic field in the vicinity of the magnetization compensation temperature, and we observed stochastic binary switching in the anomalous Hall resistance, directly attributed to Néel vector rotation. Furthermore, homodyne detection confirmed rotation frequencies in the GHz range as expected from atomic spin simulations, providing evidence of dynamic Néel vector behavior. These findings demonstrate the continuous rotation of Néel vector driven by spin–orbit torque.},

  abstract     = {Spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) has emerged as a promising candidate for cryogenic data storage, owing to its nonvolatility, high density, low power consumption, and especially its nanosecond writing speed. However, the temperature dependence of the dynamics of its writing process remains unclear, hindering further optimization. Here, we investigate nanosecond STT switching dynamics in perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions using time-resolved measurements from room temperature down to 10 K. We find that both the incubation time and the transition time exhibit certain temperature dependence, indicating that thermal effects influence not only the nucleation process preceding reversal but also the subsequent domain wall motion. Especially, the incubation time exhibits strong temperature dependence in the thermally activated regime, consistent with enhanced thermal assistance for nucleation at higher temperatures. In contrast, the incubation time becomes less temperature dependent in the precessional regime, reflecting a transition to a more deterministic switching behavior. These findings offer valuable insight into the switching dynamics and benefit the optimization of STT-MRAM performance in cryogenic memory applications.},

Recently, advancements have shown that magnetic parameters, such as the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI), can be estimated from a magnetic domain image using machine learning (ML). This development suggests a potential shift in how magnetic parameters are determined, moving away from traditional measurement techniques to more innovative methods involving image-based inputs processed by ML. In previous studies, the test images used for estimation always matched the training images in size. However, since the image size is contingent on the microscopy technique used, the ability to accurately estimate parameters from images of varying sizes is essential. Here, we investigated the feasibility of estimating the DMI constant and saturation magnetization from magnetic domain images of different sizes using ML. We demonstrated that it is possible to estimate these parameters even when the imaging sizes differ between training and test datasets. Additionally, our comparison of the estimation accuracy for the DMI constant and saturation magnetization revealed that the tolerance for differences in the image size varies depending on the specific parameter being estimated. These findings could have a significant impact on the future methods of determining magnetic parameters.},

In this study, we investigate the multiple magnetic couplings in F4GT single crystals using electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. ESR lines associated with the change from perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to easy plane anisotropy are observed, indicating strong anisotropic responses to the microwaves. As the temperature increases, the resonance lines for H ∥ a b shift toward higher fields, while those for H ∥ c move toward lower fields. These opposite behaviors are attributed to the competition between the inner magnetic field and the demagnetization effect. In addition, the angle-dependent ESR spectra of F4GT single crystal exhibit a [3 cos 2 ( π 2 − φ ) − 1 ] 2 -like behavior, which indicates a characteristic of 2D magnetic coupling attributed to the dominant effects of q → 0 mode.

The bunched steps lower the electron mobility in the quantum wells considerably when the GaAs substrates are used instead of InP substrates due to their pronounced presence resulting from the larger lattice mismatch. The enhancement of the surface migration of adatoms in growth interruptions is shown to annihilate the steps, giving rise to an improvement of the mobility due to the suppression of the interface roughness scattering.

In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the SS in thin-film transistors with an amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) channel at temperatures from 300 K down to 4 K is presented. Main observations include the following: (1) at room temperature (300 K), the devices exhibit a SS of 61 mV/dec and a low interface trap density of <10 11 cm −2 . (2) A SS saturation around 40 mV/dec is observed between 200 and 100 K. It is well explained by the electron transport via band tail states with exponential decay ( W t ) of 17 meV. (3) At deep cryogenic temperatures, the SS increases significantly, exceeding 200 mV/dec at 4 K. Such high SS values are actually limited by the measurement current range, confirmed by I d − V g simulations based on the variable range hopping model.

Using first-principles calculations, sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated for the ZrX 2 (X = Cl, Br, I) bilayers. The moderate electric polarization (0.24–0.5 pC/m) and sliding energy barrier (11–18.8 meV/f.u.) values of ZrX 2 bilayers indicate their suitability for low energy cost and high-speed data writing devices based on sliding ferroelectricity. With the effect of spin–orbit coupling, spin splitting occurs at the T-symmetry-connected valleys of the valence band, generating Berry curvature in the ZrX 2 bilayer. When combined with sliding ferroelectricity, this effect leads to significant layer polarization with the layer splittings of 19, 23.5, and 46.7 meV for AB-stacked ZrCl 2 , ZrBr 2 , and ZrI 2 bilayers, respectively. The coupling between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and electronic structure induces a layer-locked Berry curvature, giving rise to the layer-polarized spin Hall effect (LP-SHE) in bilayers. This LP-SHE is intimately linked to sliding ferroelectricity, allowing for reversible control through ferroelectric switching, making it an ideal candidate for 2D spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {N-polar AlGaN films have the potential to improve the performance of optoelectronic and electronic devices, owing to their reversed polarization electric field orientation when compared with their metal-polar counterparts. However, the inferior surface morphology and electrical properties of these films have hindered the performance of N-polar devices, falling behind their metal-polar counterparts. This study develops an epitaxial strategy for fabricating AlGaN:Si films with a step-and-terrace surface morphology, achieved through the utilization of high growth temperature in conjunction with a substantial off-cut angle. The N-polar Al 0.36 Ga 0.64 N:Si film exhibits an electron mobility of 74.8 cm 2 /Vs at a free electron concentration of 3.7 × 10 19 cm −3 , surpassing previously reported values in the literature. Temperature-dependent mobility analysis confirms that ionized impurity scattering is the dominant factor influencing electron mobility in the degenerate N-polar AlGaN:Si films. Enhanced threading dislocation scattering is observed to cause an anomalous reduction in mobility at lower temperatures. A comparison of experimental and theoretical mobilities across the full range of Al content highlights that the decline in mobility for high Al-content AlGaN:Si is due to compensation defects.

Compared to conventional rapid thermal annealing, MWA-treated SL-HZO-based MFM capacitors exhibit excellent dielectric properties (κ = 51) at reduced processing temperatures. These devices also demonstrate improved reliability, including lower leakage current, higher breakdown strength, and an operational lifetime exceeding 10 years at voltages up to 2.54 V. This approach mitigates thermal budget limitations in back-end-of-line processes while enhancing device performance, offering a promising solution for advanced integrated circuit applications.},

Further, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and charging effects, which may lead not only to improved performances but also to devices with novel functionalities. Here, we investigate the electronic transport of CQDs embedded on epoxy polymer. Our samples are coupled to interdigitated electrodes with individually addressable microelectrodes. Remarkably, the current–voltage characteristics show strongly nonlinear regimes at room temperature, ranging from Schottky diode to Coulomb blockade and even negative differential conductance (NDC) behavior. We propose a master equation theoretical framework which allows us to compute current curves that agree well with the observations. This model emphasizes the importance of interacting dots and electron traps in generating a cohesive picture that encompasses all transport regimes. Overall, our results suggest that CQDs constitute a versatile materials platform for 3D integrated electronic purposes.},

In order to evaluate the sheet resistance ρ s ⁠ , the sheet electron concentration n s ⁠ , and the electron mobility μ s of the AlGaN/GaN under the Ohmic-metals, we fabricated and characterized multi-probe Hall devices.

The specific contact resistivity weakly depends on both n s and the measurement temperature, being well explained by direct tunneling between the formed 2DEG and the Ohmic-metal. Furthermore, it is found that the sheet resistance after Ohmic-metal removal returns to the initial value of ∼ 10 12 Ω / □ ⁠ .

The initial leakage current is dominated by thermionic emission, when the anode is biased at a small voltage. With the increase in anode voltage, electrons in the GaN channel are partly depleted, and two-dimensional variable-range hopping, through high-density trap states in the GaN-based material, dominates the total leakage current. When the anode reverse bias is large enough to fully deplete electrons in channel, the temperature-dependent leakage current shows little dependence on the applied anode voltage, and the trap-assisted tunneling model satisfies.},

In this work, we obtained the 200-period Si/Si 0.8 Ge 0.2 SL structure through multiple-epitaxial processes. The experimental results show that the crystal quality of the SL structure is satisfactory, exhibiting slight strain relaxation. The thickness uniformity in the SL structure is well maintained from bottom to top (36.7 ± 2.1 nm, σ thickness = 0.77 nm). Furthermore, Ge segregation at the bottom of the SL structure was observed, resulting in a slight upward trend in the Ge concentration from bottom to top and a broadening of the bottom interface. This work demonstrates the feasibility of epitaxial growth of ultra-multilayer Si/SiGe SL structure and provides a process solution for the development of advanced VS DRAM devices.},

By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed the template effect of WSe 2 lattices on NaCl epitaxy, with the edge of NaCl islands extending along three highly symmetric orientations of WSe 2 . NaCl islands also exhibited lower apparent height compared to WSe 2 monolayers at various biases, which could be attributed to the almost unaffected electrostatic screening of NaCl within the weak interfacial coupling regime. Thermal stability experiments showed that the coupling strength of the NaCl/WSe 2 interface is stronger than that of NaCl on Au(111) due to the extra quasi-bonding. Density functional theory calculations further verified the experimental observations and unveiled that the fundamental nature of interfacial coupling could arise from weak covalent-like quasi-bonding between Na + ions and Se atoms accompanied by electron accumulation.},

Corresponding to the defect structure of Σ3{112} ITB step, this pure step is composed of multiple Shockley partial dislocations with a net zero Burgers vector. It is generally believed that such pure steps do not move under mechanical loading because of the zero Peach–Koehler force. Here, we demonstrate the migration of pure steps by atomistic simulations under uniaxial tension and reveal the driving force associated with elastic anisotropy, i.e., the driving force originates from an imbalance in the elastic strain energy density across the TBs. Therefore, we introduce a compliance anisotropy factor, calculated by density functional theory, to characterize the migration capability of the Σ3{112} ITB step in FCC metals.},

  abstract     = {Diamond has emerged as a leading material for solid-state spin quantum systems and extreme environment electronics. However, a major limitation is that most diamond devices and structures are fabricated using bulk diamond plates. The absence of a suitable diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate hinders the advanced nanofabrication of diamond quantum and electronic devices, posing a significant roadblock to large-scale, on-chip diamond quantum photonics and electronics systems. In this work, we demonstrate the direct bonding of (100) single-crystal diamond plates to PECVD-grown SiO 2 /Si substrates at low temperatures and atmospheric conditions. The surfaces of the SiO 2 and diamond plates are then activated using oxygen plasma and Piranha solution, respectively. Bonding occurs when the substrates are brought into contact with water in between and annealed at 200 °C under atmospheric conditions, resulting in a DOI substrate. We systematically studied the influence of Piranha solution treatment time and diamond surface roughness on the shear strength of the bonded substrate, devising an optimal bonding process that achieves a high yield rate of 90% and a maximum shear strength of 9.6 MPa. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used for quantitative analysis of the surface chemicals at the bonding interface. It appears that the amount of –OH bindings increases with the initial roughness of the diamond, facilitating the strong bonding with SiO 2 . This direct bonding method will pave the way for scalable manufacturing of diamond nanophotonic devices and enable large-scale integration of diamond quantum and electronic systems.},

The proposed structure enables distinct angle-selective transmission at two frequency bands while maintaining polarization insensitivity for both TE and TM modes. Specifically, at 8.5 GHz, electromagnetic waves incident within the angular range of 0°–9° exhibit excellent transmission performance ( ⁠ S 21 > −1 dB), whereas at 9.6 GHz, the transmission angle is confined to angles between 30° and 31°. Furthermore, the unit cell size and overall thickness of the structure remain relatively compact. To provide theoretical insight, an equivalent circuit model is employed for analysis, and a prototype is fabricated for experimental validation. The measured results demonstrate strong agreement with the simulated results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed design.

  abstract     = {β-Ga 2 O 3 is a wide bandgap semiconductor with potential for surpassing current-generation high-power device performance and cost-effectiveness, due to its unique properties and availability of large high-quality substrates. However, β-Ga 2 O 3 power electronics are still relatively immature, and commercial realization of reliable high-power devices will require intimate knowledge of performance-limiting extended defects. While several defects have been characterized in bulk substrates, less attention has been given to defects in homoepitaxially grown β-Ga 2 O 3 , despite its importance in producing high quality active layers for power devices. In this work, we characterize the bulk electronic properties and extended structural defects in (010) β-Ga 2 O 3 homoepitaxially grown via hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) using photoemission, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and complementary spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. We observe two types of linear, surface defects aligned along the [001] crystal axis. One defect consists of a micrometer-sized particle and a tail of protruding material, while the other is a groove in the surface. The large particle is a Ga-rich phase that is likely present early in the HVPE growth that disrupts the surface, while the groove defect appears purely structural in nature. Defect etching and TEM analysis reveal that the linear defects are associated with different dislocation structures, which can explain the different local conductivity measured at each. Our results emphasize that proper surface processing of the bulk substrate is still necessary for obtaining higher quality epitaxial growth for large area power devices.},

  abstract     = {The morphology of evaporating menisci near the three-phase contact line region—whether characterized by a truncated adsorbed liquid film or an extended adsorbed liquid film—has been the subject of long-standing debate. In this Letter, we present a unified mesoscopic approach for predicting both the morphological evolution and heat transfer characteristics of evaporating menisci. This methodology provides a comprehensive framework capable of simultaneously characterizing the truncated-adsorbed liquid film regime, the extended-adsorbed liquid film regime, and their transitional behavior. We explain the stability mechanism and evaporation heat transfer characteristics of nanoscale liquid films, as well as the self-regulation mechanism governing the evaporating meniscus between the extended-adsorbed film regime and the truncated-adsorbed film regime. This unified framework provides a useful tool for investigating the nanoscale evaporation heat transfer characteristics and mechanisms in liquid–vapor phase change processes.},

However, a microscopic analytical theory for calculating the current maps of moiré superlattices is still missing. Here, we have developed a unique theory to calculate the current maps of moiré superlattices, which is based on the optical method. The theoretical results can well reproduce the fundamental characteristics of the experiments. Furthermore, the theoretical results predict that there may exist finer structure in the current map of twisted bilayer graphene. In addition, one existing viewpoint of twisted mono-bilayer graphene, i.e., the higher-current domains correspond to ABA stacking, is challenged by the present theoretical results. The present work establishes an integral theoretical framework to calculate the current maps of moiré superlattices and provides insight into the underlying physics.},

  abstract     = {Droplets are highly mobile on lubricant-infused surfaces when droplet−lubricant phases are immiscible, and lubricant layer is stable. Recent studies have shown that the high droplet mobility is due to the absence of three-phase contact line friction by oleoplaning of the droplets on the lubricant layer. In this state, dynamic friction arises primarily from viscous dissipation in the lubricant around the droplet. Classical Landau–Levich–Derjaguin (LLD) law suggests that the friction force is proportional to the two-thirds power of the capillary number, and the lubricant thickness effect is not included. Here, we discovered that increased lubricant thickness enhances the droplet's mobility on lubricant-infused surfaces. This finding is unexpected, as a thicker lubricant layer would typically increase the potential volume for viscous dissipation. We formed stable lubricant layers of varying thicknesses ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers on a “nanometrically smooth” base layer to remove the influence of surface texture. The droplet friction force on the different lubricant thickness surfaces is measured using the cantilever method. While all surfaces follow the LLD law, the friction force significantly decreases with increasing the lubricant thicknesses. The possible reason is the decrement of the energy dissipation at the lubricant ridge with the thickness. We propose a modified friction model incorporating the thickness dependence with the classical law, offering deeper insight into droplet friction dynamics on the lubricant-infused surfaces. In practical terms, reducing droplet friction enhances transport efficiency, contributing to advancements in fluidic systems and liquid-repellent applications.},

  abstract     = {We develop compressively-strained epitaxial Ge 1−x Sn x films with large x (>0.1) on Si substrates. Therein, large x and compressive biaxial strain cause a band convergence by movement of Γ valley down to L valleys near the Fermi level, which leads to high Seebeck coefficient while increasing alloy phonon scattering rate related to a low thermal conductivity. Furthermore, a higher electron mobility is also realized due to the reduction of the conductivity effective mass coming from the large contribution of small effective mass of Γ valley. Further increase in x of Ge 1−x Sn x films decreases thermal conductivities. As a result, the doped compressively-strained epitaxial Ge 0.88 Sn 0.12 films on Si substrates exhibit two times higher thermoelectric power factor (∼15 μ W cm −1 K −2 ) at room temperature than the previously-reported Ge 1−x Sn x films at almost the same thermal conductivity. This highlights that the application of compressive in-plane strain in Ge 1−x Sn x films with large x is a promising approach for enhancing a thermoelectric performance.},

In this study, we systematically optimized the material thickness and employed an interdigitated electrode structure to enhance light absorption and carrier collection. The resulting photodetector exhibits a broad spectral response from 254 nm (deep ultraviolet) to 980 nm (near infrared), with a rapid response time of 0.6 ms. Notably, the responsivity and detectivity were significantly enhanced by more than 100 times through the electrode design. Moreover, backgate regulation enhanced the responsivity by up to one order of magnitude. The optimized device demonstrated outstanding photodetection performance with a responsivity of 210 A/W and a specific detectivity of 3.5 × 10 11 Jones at 638 nm, enabling high-resolution multi-wavelength imaging.

The photonic crystal, made of silicon nitride, is fabricated on a SiO 2 /Si substrate. The holes of the photonic crystal are filled with spin-on-glass, and an organic emissive layer is deposited on top. Despite the narrowing of the photonic bandgap due to the planarization, a sharp emission peak with a quality factor of approximately 400 is observed in micro-photoluminescence measurements, attributed to the careful design of nanocavities. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of a nearby nanocavity through simulations and experiments. It is observed that two cavities can operate independently, even at smaller inter-cavity distances, by detuning their resonant wavelengths.

However, these methods often come with off-target effects, tissue damage, and high energy demands. Optostimulation presents a promising alternative, offering highly precise and minimally invasive control with significantly fewer side effects. In this Perspective, we explore current light-based technologies designed to modulate cardiac bioelectricity, with a particular focus on an innovative approach based on sarcolemma-targeted photoswitches.

Our research shows that in the aqueous phase, objects whose dimensions exceed the wavelength scale (∼1λ), with impedances greater than 6 MRayl, can modulate the angular threshold of the acoustic standing wave pattern formation maximum to 55°. This method enables controlled particle and cell patterning with spacing variation conforming to a secant relationship d = λ sec θ ⁠ .

As a stable and aromatic SMM, the inverse-sandwiched Ir 2 B 8 carries a magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of 93.43 meV. By taking the advantage of Ir 2 symmetrically locked on two sides B 8 ring and the lowest energy in the inverse sandwich structure of Ir 2 B 8 , the high MAE can be maintained at high temperature as 700 K. In contrast to the reported Ir 2 loaded on one side of a two-dimensional molecule/material, the direction of Ir 2 is prone to be tilted with physical perturbation and the MAE could not be well preserved. Furthermore, when Ir 2 B 8 is encapsulated in two different carbon nanotubes, the high MAE could be well preserved (97.10 meV) or even enlarged (145.50 meV).

  abstract     = {Chip-scale atomic clocks are critical for applications requiring compact, energy-efficient, and highly stable timing, such as GPS receivers and communication systems. Coherent population trapping (CPT)-based atomic clocks, which commonly use vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), have enabled significant miniaturization. However, their precision is limited by the broad linewidth of VCSELs. Alternative laser technologies, such as distributed Bragg reflector lasers, distributed feedback lasers, and external cavity diode lasers (ECDLs), offer potential improvements but face challenges in achieving compact size and adequate modulation bandwidth. This study presents a 795 nm chip-ECDL with a direct modulation bandwidth up to 4 GHz, specifically designed for CPT chip-scale atomic clocks. Based on the chip-ECDL, a CPT atomic clock with a compact volume of 19.4 ml and power consumption of 1.5 W has been developed. Under identical operating conditions, the CPT signal produced by the chip-ECDL exhibits a 34% reduction in linewidth and a 1.14-fold increase in contrast compared to a VCSEL-based clock. Demonstrating short-term stability better than 5 × 10 − 11 τ − 1 / 2 ( 1 s < τ < 2000 s ) and reaching a best stability of 6.6 × 10 − 13 at 2000 s ⁠ , this work represents the application of an ECDL in a CPT chip-scale clock, advancing the development of next-generation, high-performance chip-scale atomic clocks.},

High-speed temperature fluctuations of a platinum wire are measured along the pool boiling curve for a range of test conditions that yield critical heat flux values varying by a factor of five.

Despite its potential, the reproducible synthesis of high-conductivity LIC remains challenging due to the unknown effect of native defects on ionic conductivity. We investigate native defects and explore the impact of defects on the ion conductivity of LIC using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that, on the one hand, the high conductivity in experimental LIC benefits from the dominant defects of Li vacancies (V Li ) and interstitials (Li i ), on the other hand, the conductivity induced by the two major defects is nearly an order magnitude higher than the experimental values, indicating the cooperative effect of minor defects. Following this, a mixed-defect system with the coexistence of V Li , Li i as well as minor defects Cl vacancies (V Cl ) and antisites (In Li ) is proposed, which presents an activation energy of 0.31 eV and ionic conductivity of 1.8 mS/cm (300 K), well explaining the experimental results. These findings provide important insight into understanding the effect of native defects on ionic transport in LIC and offer synthesis principles for the reproducibility of LIC-type solid electrolytes with high conductivity.},

The power measurement range of such detectors has been checked by a 940 nm laser with low power (31–186 mW) and a 1080 nm laser with high power (25–150 W). It is shown that the detectors can operate in a wide range of laser powers, with a minimum power threshold of 31 mW and a maximum detection capability of 150 W. The sensitivity in such a wide power range is almost a constant of around 7.53 μ V/W, within the consideration of the absorption coefficient difference between 940 and 1080 nm. This also indicates that such detectors can work in a wide range of IR wavelengths by normalizing the absorption coefficient. In addition, these 4H-SiC detectors demonstrate remarkable stability under thermal cycling tests between cryogenic (−197 °C) and extreme high-temperature (1000 °C) conditions. These findings may provide an effective solution for fabricating IR laser detectors capable of operating across 5 orders of magnitude (milliwatts to hundreds of watts) while withstanding harsh environments.},

  abstract     = {Fiber supercapacitors (FSCs) have attracted extensive research interest in the field of flexible electronics and wearable devices. This paper presents integrated FSC coils capable of inducing charging current between two electrodes in an alternating magnetic field, where FSC serves both as energy storage part and as an inductive coil, and rectifier diodes regulate charging current direction and maintain direct current bias of FSC. Using FSC as inductive coils leads to a concurrent increase in both energy storage capacity and energy harvesting ability as the device scale expands. This enables the aggregation of the total charging power when multiple coils are used for charging simultaneously. The charging principles reveal that the charging current is only induced and circulated inside the coil, ensuring each individual coil maintains its independence during multi-module charging and preventing the risk caused by the accumulation of large currents. The charging power of the device can be quantitively reflected by the pulse height ( ⁠ Δ U pulse ⁠ ) between two electrodes and voltage drop ( ⁠ U drop ⁠ ) in one electrode, and analyzing these parameters enables rapid assessment of device performance. The integrated FSC coils also show compatibility with commercial wireless charging pads, expanding potential applications. In addition, the devices naturally function as LC oscillators, with resonant frequency tunable through the coil structure design. Replacing diodes with varactor diodes allows direct conversion of charging voltage into resonance frequency, permitting wireless readout. Such capability facilitates rapid identification and passive voltage monitoring across individual components during multi-module charging, presenting a viable approach for maintaining and managing large-scale, multi-coil systems.},

However, the current end-to-end reconstruction networks predominantly process time-domain signals while overlooking the critical influence of sensor–tissue spatial relationships on feature extraction, which may degrade imaging fidelity. To address this, we propose a complex-valued neural network architecture for quantitative reconstruction of microwave thermoacoustic conductivity. The proposed framework incorporates two essential components: a 2D Fourier transform operator that converts sensor signals into spatial-frequency representations and complex-valued matrix operations that synergistically optimize amplitude-phase feature learning. Comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments validate that our method achieves higher indicators compared to conventional algorithms and real-valued networks, establishing a state-of-the-art framework in conductivity map reconstruction.},

However, their performance has been severely constrained by substantial carrier losses caused by small polaron hopping mechanisms. Understanding and mitigating these losses is critical for advancing the efficiency of optoelectronic technologies. In this work, we integrate an optical transfer matrix model with quantum efficiency measurements to analyze minority carrier dynamics in p-type CuBi 2 O 4 (CBO) photocathodes. This approach reveals significant bulk recombination losses, and improvements were achieved through a textured film approach using rapid thermal annealing. Consequently, the textured CBO photocathodes with oriented grains achieved a notable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance, reaching a photocurrent density of 1.96 mA cm −2 . Carrier loss analysis within the film indicates that the textured films significantly increase the electrons' collection length to 83 nm and reduce the bulk loss from 80% to 70%. This work provides a quantitative analysis and collection remediations of photocarriers in photoelectronic thin films.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in ultrafast light polarization modulation and electrical control of polarization have increased the demand for polarization-sensitive photodetectors to enable polarization-based optical communication systems. The conduction electron population of dilute nitride GaNAs changes with excitation light polarization owing to the spin-dependent recombination of conduction electrons via the dynamic polarization of defect electron spins. However, polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize this property are limited to photoconductive devices with a long response time. In this study, we developed a polarization-sensitive near-infrared photodiode based on GaNAs. The influence of light power and bias voltage on the discrimination efficiency between circularly and linearly polarized light was investigated using coupled rate equation analysis for polarization-dependent photocurrent characteristics. At −2.0 V, where the discrimination efficiency reached 1%, the extraction time of the conduction electrons to the electrode was estimated to be 34 ps. This result suggests that the developed polarization-sensitive photodiode can operate at 10 GHz. The discrimination efficiency increased with light power because of the activated spin-selective capture of conduction electrons by spin-polarized defect states for circularly polarized light, whereas it decreased with increasing reverse bias voltage. This low performance originates from suppressed spin-selective capture, which is due to the combination of electric-field-induced spin relaxation and a decrease in the capture efficiency of conduction electrons. This study provides valuable insights into the influence of the bias voltage on the polarization-dependent photocurrent, which is a key challenge to the realization of practical polarization-sensitive photodiodes based on the spin-dependent recombination effect of conduction electrons.},

  abstract     = {The graphene–hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures represent a pivotal platform for the exploration of dynamic characteristics of nanoelectromechanical systems, unconventional quantum Hall effects, and related phenomena. However, the inevitable formation of interfacial bubbles during the stacking process of these heterostructures significantly compromise device performance. Consequently, it is imperative to attain a more profound comprehension of the electromechanical properties under the conditions of bubble interfaces in the h-BN/graphene system. Beyond conventional quasi-static methodologies (e.g., STEM imaging, AFM-based techniques, blister tests), initiating from the resonant response of nanoelectromechanical systems offers a dynamic approach to probe interfacial interactions. Herein, we have utilized the pickup technique with h-BN to accomplish the stacking of h-BN/graphene heterostructures and the assembly of dual-clamped resonators in a single step. At conditions of 5 K, we analyzed its unique resonant dynamical response, which is attributed to the domination of interlayer frozen bubbles. We discovered that these “frozen bubbles” consistently maintain the coupling effect between the two layers of materials, even when the heterostructure exhibits independent vibrational modes due to significant gate-induced electrostatic pulling. Simultaneously, the thicker layer of h-BN masks the influence of graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient, dominating the temperature response of the heterostructure's resonance, thus providing a possible means for localized modulation of interfaces. Our work furnishes further insights into comprehending the impact of interlayer bubbles on the electromechanical response within van der Waals heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures.},

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed that films deposited at 250 °C predominantly crystallized into the brookite phase, while lower temperatures led to monoclinic-phase VO 2 , which undergoes SMT behavior. Electrical measurements showed that films deposited at 250 °C demonstrated superior bolometric properties with a stable temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and minimal 1/f noise, even after thermal stress testing. In contrast, films with higher monoclinic-phase content exhibited significant SMT behavior and degraded performance. These results suggest that brookite-phase VO 2 films, free from SMT behavior, are promising candidates for high-performance microbolometer applications.},

  abstract     = {All-solution processed inverted quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) have shown great promise for applications in lighting and display technologies. However, the practical deployment of eco-friendly blue inverted QLEDs remains a significant challenge, particularly in enhancing their luminous efficiency and operational stability. Herein, we report an eco-friendly, all-solution processed inverted blue QLEDs based on ZnSeTe quantum-dots, incorporating a ZnO interlayer within the electron transport layer to establish a stepwise double-layer electron transport structure. The ZnO interlayer effectively reduces the electron injection barrier between ITO and ZnMgO layers, thereby enhancing electron injection efficiency, promoting carrier recombination, and ultimately improving device performance. The experimental results reveal that ZnSeTe-based all-solution inverted blue QLEDs with the ZnO interlayer achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.1%, a peak brightness of 1862 cd m −2 , and a T 50 lifetime of 6.7 h at 1000 cd m −2 . This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ZnO interlayer in improving the performance of eco-friendly all-solution inverted QLEDs and provides valuable insights for advancing eco-friendly QLED technology.},

Their complicated morphologies feature an abundance of folds, creases, and wrinkles that make each crumpled membrane unique. Here, we prepare five nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled membranes of few-layer graphene and measure their static response and the resonant frequencies of their dynamic response. We tune both responses with a dc voltage applied between the membrane and an underlying gate electrode. Surprisingly, we find that all the resonators exhibit hysteretic responses as the gate voltage is increased and then decreased. Concomitant discontinuities in the static response and in the vibrational resonant frequencies indicate a sudden change in the shape and in the tensile strain of the membranes, accompanied by a change in elastic energy that we estimate. We find that the hystereses can be removed and regular responses can be restored by annealing the resonators.},

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are versatile and easy to process, making them highly attractive for customized optoelectronic devices. Herein, a self-powered bidirectional photocurrent perovskite photodetector (BPPD) has been developed based on a vertical three-dimensional (3D)/quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D)/3D perovskite multilayer junction. This BPPD shows positive photocurrent under short-wavelength light (300–524 nm) and negative photocurrent under long-wavelength light (524–800 nm), thereby delivering modulable photoresponse under multiple-light-beam conditions. The BPPD exhibits large linear dynamic ranges of over 100 dB for both positive and negative photocurrent conditions, with noise equivalent powers as low as 0.1 nW cm −2 . By modulating the photocurrent with intensities and wavelengths of incident lights, five basic optical-modulated logic operations (“OR,” “AND,” “NOR,” “NOT,” and “NAND”) have been demonstrated with a single BPPD. Moreover, a dual-channel image transmission system featuring encrypted optical communication is realized using a single BPPD.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenides are attractive channel materials for an aggressive dimension scaling of double-gated field-effect transistors. Some challenges, however, remain nowadays, including finding a suitable top high- κ dielectric and a way to deposit it. Recently, an amorphous Ta 2 O 5 interface layer grown on top of MoS 2 has been shown to improve the device's electrical performance compared to a deposited amorphous Al 2 O 3 film. In this work, we investigate the origin of such an improvement, combining experimental and first-principles approaches. The former suggests a comparable n-type doping of the 2D material for the Al 2 O 3 and Ta 2 O 5 interface layer based on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Within the first-principles approach, we construct several amorphous Ta 2 O 5 atomistic models and their interfaces with a MoS 2 or WS 2 monolayer. We demonstrate that a clean interface can in principle be achieved between the 2D material and Ta 2 O 5 with a proper surface passivation, with a defect-free electronic bandgap a potential fluctuation within the 2D material under control. Little differences are found between MoS 2 and WS 2 in the corresponding interface at the theoretical level. The electronic properties are found to strongly depend on the coordination of the metal atoms at the oxide surface. Combining these analyses, we conclude that a higher interface quality for the Ta 2 O 5 layer with MoS 2 than for the Al 2 O 3 one is a plausible explanation for the improved performances.},

Here, a high-performance (Ni 55.5 Mn 23.5 Ga 21 ) 99.65 B 0.3 Ce 0.05 HTSMA microwire has been developed. Owing to the oligocrystalline structure and favorable orientation, the microwire shows huge superelasticity from 623 to 783 K, with a maximum recoverable strain up to 16.2% and recoverable strains above 14.0% in the whole temperature range. Meanwhile, the irrecoverable strains of the microwire were less than 0.24% during unloading in the temperature range from 673 to 783 K. These properties are in sharp contrast to the typical HTSMAs that display rapid increase in the irrecoverable strains and fast degradation of the recoverable strains above 673 K. Noticeably, all the irrecoverable strains reduced to zero, and complete strains recovery were achieved, after heating to higher temperature. Combined with the advantages of high-temperature superelasticity and complete strains recovery above 773 K, small size, low cost, and easy fabrication, the microwire shows a great potential in small-scale high-temperature intelligent devices.},

In this study, we explore the limits of diameter control during the catalytic growth of SiNWs by using an in-plane solid–liquid–solid (IPSLS) mechanism, where SiNWs are guided and confined within narrow sidewall grooves. To achieve tighter growth confinement, a selective etching strategy was developed to produce stable and significantly finer guiding grooves, with heights, depths, and pitches of 15, 16, and 10 nm, respectively. Notably, this innovative groove design enables the production of parallel arrays of ultrathin, monocrystalline-like SiNWs, achieving critical cross-sectional dimensions smaller than 6 nm in one direction or less than 10 nm in both directions. Additionally, we propose a driving-energy-parity model that establishes a lower-bound diameter limit for IPSLS-grown SiNWs at approximately 2.5–4.2 nm. This finding indicates that further dimensional scaling remains feasible by employing even finer sidewall grooves. These results underscore the potential for scaling down ultrathin SiNWs, which is vital for exploring high-performance microelectronics based on a catalytic growth integration strategy.},

Here, a family of ternary transition metal chalcogenide, Mn 2 XSe 4 (X = Al, Ga, In) monolayers, are proposed to be stable QAH insulators with large QAH gaps (larger than 0.2 eV) combining the first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis. It is found that the Mn- d xy orbitals in the majority channel form a quadratic non-Dirac point near the Fermi level. Interestingly, a large bandgap is caused by including a spin–orbital coupling effect, and one chiral edge state connecting conduction and valence bands appears, forming a Chern insulator with C = 1. Moreover, the magnetic and topological properties of the Mn 2 XSe 4 monolayers can be adjusted by biaxial strains. Our work suggests that the Mn 2 XSe 4 monolayers can serve as candidates for exploring the QAH effect and spintronic devices.},

Atomic force microscopy scans revealed smooth surfaces for both the films with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.3 nm. Phase purity of these films was determined by x-ray diffraction. The Raman spectrum of the phase-pure δ -TaN and γ -Ta 2 N obtained will serve as a future reference to determine phase purity of tantalum nitride films. Furthermore, the room temperature and low-temperature electronic transport measurements indicated that both of these phases are metallic at room temperature with resistivities of 586.2 μ Ω · cm for the 30 nm δ -TaN film and 75.5 μ Ω · cm for the 38 nm γ -Ta 2 N film and become superconducting below 3.6 and 0.48 K, respectively. The superconducting transition temperature reduces with applied magnetic field as expected. Ginzburg–Landau fitting revealed a 0 K critical magnetic field and coherence length of 18 T and 4.2 nm for the 30 nm δ -TaN film and 96 mT and 59 nm for the 38 nm γ -Ta 2 N film. These tantalum nitride films are of high interest for superconducting resonators and qubits.},

  abstract     = {The deposition process of the IrMn 3 /Co 70 Fe 30 bilayer of antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (AF/FM) type was modified by introducing a nitrogen additive in argon plasma during the magnetron sputtering of the Co 70 Fe 30 layer. This slight modification significantly enhanced the exchange bias energy density and reduced coercivity of an AF/FM bilayer for the AF IrMn layer thickness ranging from 20 to 50 Å. Calculations indicate that the boost in exchange bias energy density and the reduction in coercivity can be attributed to the increased anisotropy energy of the AF layer, resulting in more effective pinning of the FM layer by AF grains. The increase in anisotropy is caused by the diffusion of nitrogen from the FM into the AF layer, as established by x-ray diffraction, neutron reflectometry, and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. Our research allows us to improve magnetic characteristics of exchange-coupled FM/AF structures through minor modifications in the sputtering process and/or save up to 20% of the costly IrMn 3 target by reducing the thickness of the AF layer.},

Unlike these conventional methods, we study quantized spin wave modes that satisfy the standing wave conditions across the nano-constriction in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). We perform power spectral density measurements under various magnetic field conditions using Pt (6 nm)/Co 89.4 Gd 10.6 (7 nm) SHNOs with constriction widths of 100 and 150 nm. In the SHNO with a constriction width of 150 nm, which is half of the wavelength of the spin wave, we observe two distinct spin wave modes: a propagating mode and a first-order quantized spin wave mode, the latter satisfying the standing wave confinement within the nano-constriction. Both modes are consistent with the Damon–Eshbach theory. Our findings demonstrate that geometric optimization enables the excitation of higher-order quantized modes at frequencies above the propagating mode, facilitating microwave signal generation at higher frequencies in SHNOs.},

Coexistence of vacancy-induced ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) matrix phases is demonstrated in these compounds, with a low-temperature spin glass-like (SG-like) phase further identified. It is established that the magnetic ground state transitioned from strong AFM/weak SG to moderate AFM/SG and eventually to FM/SG with increasing Fe vacancies. Along with this transition, we observe a small exchange bias (EB) in δ = 0.01 and 0.02 ( H EB = 0.074 and 0.13 T at 2 K), a giant one in δ = 0.05 ( H EB = 1.04 T at 2 K), and a nearly negligible one in δ = 0.09. Our results prove the indispensable role of SG and AFM phases in engendering large EB effect in van der Waals two-dimensional magnets. This study can provide valuable insights into the exchange bias mechanism of two-dimensional bulk materials and offer efficient strategies for achieving substantial exchange bias fields.},

  abstract     = {In epitaxially grown spinel thin films, the anti-phase boundaries (APBs) are formed due to cationic rearrangements within the spinels on the lattice-mismatched substrates. We demonstrate that such an APB formation could significantly influence the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and suggest a model on how to avoid their formation and detrimental effects on MCE. We fabricate the geometrically frustrated epitaxial MnCr 2 O 4 on SrTiO 3 substrate with two different concentrations of APBs. The film with largely dense APB shows an entropy change, − Δ S M of ∼ 1.3 J/Kg-K, whereas the film with reduced APB shows a value of − Δ S M ∼ 5.2 J/Kg-K for a change of field of 50 kOe. Furthermore, density functional theoretical calculations show that if there are more Jahn–Teller active A-site ions compared to B-site in an AB 2 O 4 spinel, then such an APB formation is more probable. Hence, by creating a comparable fraction of Jahn–Teller active B-site cations, such an APB formation can be reduced. Moreover, avoiding the formation of APB and, thus, unwanted antiferromagnetic coupling at the boundaries could intrigue the future scientific community to design highly efficient magnetocaloric cooling devices using geometrically frustrated spinel systems.},

The MTJ with a monolayer InSe barrier demonstrates nearly 100% spin filtering and a large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of 7.48 × 10 5 %, where the resistance changes nearly 10 000% as the magnetization alignment of the electrodes transitions from parallel (P) to antiparallel. When the barrier layer increases from monolayer InSe to bilayer InSe, the TMR ratio (3.64 × 10 7 %) is significantly enhanced. The large TMR originates from the high spin polarization of the magnetic electrodes, Fe 3 GaTe 2 . Our results highlight that room-temperature vdW MTJs pave the way for potential applications of nonvolatile spintronic devices.},

We find that micromagnetic simulations significantly deviate from the experimental findings due to inherent limitations of the method.

Herein, we achieved a significant enhancement of NTE in the phase-transition-type NTE material LiYO 2 . LiYO 2 possesses a smaller unit cell volume in its high temperature phase than that in the low temperature phase, resulting in the intrinsic volume contraction (0.88%) before the phase transition completed. The volume contraction of the bulk sample reaches 3.66% from −100 to 50 °C, which is 4.16 times that of the powder sample. The results show that LiYO 2 is sensitive to pressure, and the internal stress in the bulk sample facilitates the phase transition process. The anisotropy of LiYO 2 and the pores in the bulk sample induce a microstructural effect. This work makes LiYO 2 a promising material for NTE applications.},

Prior x-ray pump, x-ray probe studies reported coherent longitudinal acoustic phonon generation in insulating oxides like strontium titanate and potassium tantalate. In contrast, such signals were not observed in semiconductors likely due to limited signal-to-noise ratio. Now, with an improved experimental setup, we observe a phonon response in single-crystal germanium. Utilizing x-ray split-delay optics with enhanced stability, we extract the phonon dispersion relation, which shows strong agreement with the calculated transverse acoustic phonon mode. Our results reveal that responses to x-ray excitations in semiconductors are of a similar nature to optical excitations. This suggests that the initial response to x-ray core–hole excitations rapidly diffuses to a non-local excitation, similar to what is observed with optical laser valence excitation on a femtosecond timescale.},

The ON–OFF ratio of the devices increases from 2.2 × 10 3 to 3.2 × 10 3 and the maximum transconductance also increases after hydrogen treatment, while the threshold voltage remains almost unchanged. The gate-lag characteristics of the devices after hydrogen treatment have been improved by comparing with the fresh ones. The internal defects density for the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs after hydrogen treatment is found to show more obvious decrease compared to that of the fresh ones through the characterization method of low-frequency noise. This mechanism could be attributed to the passivation of defects in the SiN x layer and at the SiNx/AlGaN interface between drain and gate electrodes by H atoms due to the forming bonds, such as N–H and Si–H.

  abstract     = {The realization of vision-based neuromorphic computing relies significantly on advancements in optoelectronic synaptic chip technology. Currently, the development of optoelectronic devices is mainly limited by high power consumption due to high bias voltage and low recognition rates caused by the background noise. A low-power deep-ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse device is developed by doping Mg into zinc oxide to modulate oxygen-vacancy defects. Specifically, the synaptic behavior still has excellent persistent photoconductivity response at 12 mV bias, and the low single synaptic energy consumption is 2.34 pJ. Meanwhile, the artificial neural network of the device is constructed according to the excitation and inhibition characteristics, and the recognition rate of handwritten digits is as high as 95.41%. In addition, on the basis of demonstrating ultraviolet image visual learning and memory, the device provides an encryption algorithm verification array integrating sensing and storage with energy consumption as low as 20 nJ. This low-power and strong anti-interference deep-ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse device supports the development of high-performance visual neural-state computing.},

The results reveal that at a neutron fluence of 7.4 × 10 12 n/cm 2 , there is a notable increase in the saturation drain current, a negative shift in threshold voltage, and an enhancement in peak transconductance. As the fluence continues to increase, the electrical characteristics of the device begin to deteriorate. However, at a fluence of 1.0 × 10 14 n/cm 2 , the electrical performance is still better than that before irradiation. The defect evolution induced by neutron irradiation is studied by utilizing low-frequency noise (LFN) and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) techniques. LFN analysis shows only slight changes in interface state density, while DLTS results reveal a significant reduction in deep-level defects after irradiation. We speculate that bulk defects in the GaN or AlGaN layers predominantly influence device performance variations. Neutron irradiation facilitates the recombination of original defects, thereby decreasing the concentration of deep-level defects in the device. This decrease in deep-level defects alleviates carrier trapping by defects, resulting in an increased carrier concentration and improved electrical performance of the device.},

The hydrogen-terminated diamond surface has attracted extensive attention due to its unique p-type surface conductivity. However, the fundamental nature of this p-type conductivity remains incompletely understood using existing surface analysis techniques. In this study, we investigate the dynamic thermal desorption of surface adsorbates on hydrogen-terminated diamond using single-crystal diamond microelectromechanical systems resonators, avoiding charging-related issues. By analyzing variations in resonance performance and surface conductivity, we uncover several key findings: (i) The desorption of surface adsorbates reaches saturation at approximately 873 K. (ii) The desorbed mass per unit area is around 2.3 fg/ μ m 2 , corresponding to an equivalent thickness of approximately 1 nm. (iii) The surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond can be fully restored even after annealing at 873 K, indicating the thermal stability of C–H bonds. This work offers an alternative insight into the surface properties of hydrogen-terminated diamond, accelerating the development of highly reliable diamond-based electronic devices.},

The experimental results show that the metasurface significantly improves the chiral signal detection sensitivity (4.57 GHz / ( μ g / cm 2 ) ⁠ ), and its figure of merit (0.0354 cm 2 / μ g ⁠ ) is superior to previous ring structure sensors. Further analysis shows the polarization ellipse angle and polarization rotation angle of different chiral molecules (D/L-proline) exhibit differentiated characteristics.

Our simulations reveal a large complete k -gap whose width remains nearly unchanged as the resonance frequency ω 0 increases. Numerical analyses further indicate that the k -gap emerges when the modulation frequency Ω approaches the magnitude of unmodulated plasma frequency ω p 0 ⁠ . This large k -gap, in contrast to those in previous studies on Floquet systems, suggests potential applications for the developments in non-Hermitian physics or gain mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Modelocked lasers operating in the 2–3 μ m wavelength region are interesting for various spectroscopic applications. To this end, GaSb-based semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs) are developing fast as a practical technology for passive modelocking. Yet, such SESAMs suffer from either too high two-photon absorption or slow absorption recovery dynamics. This study introduces GaSbBi quantum wells (QWs) as a platform to ensure a larger material selection for engineering GaSb-based SESAMs with decreased two-photon absorption and ultrafast absorption recovery time. Three GaSbBi QW SESAM designs were fabricated to compare their performance against conventional GaInSb QW SESAMs. The first structure makes use of typical GaSb barriers and exhibits comparable characteristics to the conventional design, including a saturation fluence of 1.09 μ J cm −2 , a modulation depth of 1.41%, and a fast interband recovery time of 6.03 ps. The second design incorporated AlAs 0.08 Sb 0.92 barriers, achieving a reduced two-photon absorption, though at the cost of higher nonsaturable losses due to unintended Bi droplet formation during the growth of the AlAs 0.08 Sb 0.92 /GaSbBi QW heterostructure. Importantly, it maintained a fast interband recovery time (30 ps), overcoming the slow recovery dynamics exhibited by standard GaInSb QW SESAMs with AlAs 0.08 Sb 0.92 barriers. The third design explored GaSbBi QWs with higher Bi content targeted for longer wavelength operation at 2.3 μ m, which exhibited fast recovery times and good nonlinear reflectivity characteristics. However, the higher Bi content resulted in elevated nonsaturable losses. These results highlight the potential of GaSbBi QWs for short-wave infrared (SWIR) SESAMs, opening the path for further epitaxial optimization to enhance their performance.},

A notable red shift of the exciton emission peak was observed, increasing by ∼41 meV/%, up to a maximum strain of 2.5%. The combination of ion-gel and strain effectively modulated the radiative recombination, leading to a significant enhancement of the trion peak, with I X T / I X 0 rising from 0.95 to 13.12 under 1.21% strain and 6.8 × 10 12 cm −2 electron concentration. This enhancement is attributed to strain-induced changes in scattering channels between valleys and indirect bandgap excitation processes.

  abstract     = {Coherent beam combining (CBC) has offered an unparalleled approach in achieving high-capacity and high-bandwidth free-space optical (FSO) communication due to its versatile integration functionality and advanced synthetic ability. However, the existing CBC technologies focus primarily on the phase engineering, where crosstalk between different modes is easily involved, thus leading to nontrivial crosstalk in FSO links based on current coherent laser arrays (CLAs). To address this challenge, we propose an encoding method that enables crosstalk reduction via nonorthogonal polarization multiplexing. This is achieved by leveraging concentrically arranged high-order perfect vector beams (PVBs) via well-designed structure of the CLAs. Moreover, the achievable arbitrary high-order PVBs could strongly support the establishment of high-dimensional encoding paradigm. As a conceptual demonstration, we illustrate information transfer case of “NUDT” with zero bit error rate, indicating that the polarization controlled CLA is advantageous in suppressive crosstalk between multi-channels. Compared to phase coupling appearing in coaxial transmitting vortex beams, the observed PVBs display completely independent stable transmitting paths. Therefore, the manipulation of high-order vector beams within the CLA system is hopefully continuously improving the performances of optical links.},

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this Perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.},

  abstract     = {As a typical nonlinear device, Josephson junction (JJ) can be either served as a microwave device to scatter the traveling microwave or embedded in a transmission line (TL) resonator to modify the mode structure. However, two mutually exclusive circuit models have been proposed to describe the JJ embedded in a TL: one is the series embed model [see, e.g., Zueco et al. , Phys. Rev. B 86 , 024503 (2012)] and another is the parallel embedded one [see, e.g., Yamamoto et al. , Appl. Phys. Lett. 93 , 042510 (2008)]. Here, beginning with the comparison of the theoretical predictions of these two models, we fabricate the JJ-embedded TL device and measure its microwave scattering parameters at 50-mK low temperature. The experimental results support the parallel embedded model, thus rule out the series embedded one. The present work might lay the physical foundation for the designs of various microwave JJ devices, such as the microwave photonic crystals, superconducting qubits, also the Josephson parameter amplifiers, etc., by embedding the JJs into the superconducting TLs.},

  abstract     = {High-precision small-angle measurement holds critical significance in advanced manufacturing and scientific research. Optical methods are highly favored for their non-contact characteristic, high accuracy, and exceptional sensitivity, yet traditional optical methods have limitations in measurement range and resolution. Since frequency is the most precise physical quantity, the resolution of angle measurement can be greatly improved by converting it into frequency measurement. In this paper, we propose a quantum frequency goniometer (QFG), wherein angular displacement is converted into frequency shifts, enabling exceptionally high resolution due to the precise measurement of frequency. The QFG involves the interference filter (IF) for frequency selection and the corner cube array (CCA) for frequency continuous tuning compensation. Based on the sensitivity of laser frequency to changes in cavity length and the incident angle of the IF, the QFG can accurately detect minute angular rotations. Numerical calculations indicate that the QFG achieves a resolution of 10 − 4 arcsecond, with a measurable range extending beyond 5°. This resolution surpasses that of existing methods by an order of magnitude. Moreover, we conducted a preliminary experiment to evaluate the continuous oscillation characteristics of an IF-based external cavity diode laser in conjunction with the CCA-based resonator. The experimental results confirmed the ability of the QFG to output stable wavelengths with the rotation angle from −20° to 20°, thereby validating the feasibility of this innovative approach.},

  abstract     = {p -type PbTe is long recognized as an outstanding thermoelectric material in the moderate temperature range, while its n -type counterpart shows relatively poor performance. To address this issue and enhance the thermoelectric properties of n -type PbTe, indium (In) was selected as the dopant to synthesize a series of Pb 1− x In x Te (0.03 ≤ x ≤ 0.038) compounds, aiming to regulate the electron concentration and transport characteristics due to the simultaneous increase in electron concentration and mobility, which could be ascribed to the lattice regularization and the reduction of Pb vacancies induced by In doping. As a result, the In-doped compound Pb 0.966 In 0.034 Te demonstrated superior thermoelectric performance. Subsequently, Pb 0.966 In 0.034 Te/ f -CdSe composites were fabricated, and their thermoelectric properties were systematically investigated. The results revealed that In doping significantly increased the electrical conductivity of the materials importantly, and in situ reactions between CdSe and the Pb 0.966 In 0.034 Te matrix led to the formation of coherent CdIn 2 Te 4 nanoparticles. The presence of these nanoparticles further enhanced the power factor of the composites across the entire investigated temperature range. Moreover, the lattice thermal conductivity of the composites decreased significantly due to the effective scattering of heat-carrying phonons by point defects and nano-interfaces. Consequently, the sample Pb 0.966 In 0.034 Te + 0.7 wt. % CdSe exhibited the optimal thermoelectric performance. At 703 K, its figure of merit ( ZT ) reached 1.3, representing a 34% increase compared to Pb 0.966 In 0.034 Te, and the average ZT reached 0.75. These findings indicate that incorporating CdSe into Pb 0.966 In 0.034 Te is an effective strategy to improve the thermoelectric performance of n -type PbTe.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal catalysts have promising applications as potential alternatives to platinum-based catalysts in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and fine-tuning their local electronic structure is an essential strategy to boost the intrinsic activity. Herein, a Zr–Cu heterojunction catalyst was synthesized by combining ZrO 2 /C and Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 /C using a simple sol-gel synthesis method. The Zr–Cu heterojunction synergistically achieved high ORR performance with a noticeable half-wave potential of 0.827 V, comparable to commercial Pt/C, along with superior stability and methanol tolerance in alkaline solution. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) demonstrated that the interfacial electronic interaction between Zr and Cu species in Zr–Cu heterojunction was enhanced, leading to the enhanced ORR activity. Combined with density functional theory calculations, the Cu atoms located at the interface of Zr–Cu heterojunction were identified as the ORR active sites, while the Zr atoms served as an electronic regulator to induce the electron redistribution by facilitating electron transfer from Zr species and Cu active sites. Therefore, the engineering of Zr–Cu heterojunction catalyst greatly optimized the adsorption strength of O 2 as well as reduced the energy barrier of * O 2 → * OOH intermediate, ultimately resulting in the promoted ORR performance. The findings of this study suggest a valuable strategy for manipulating heterojunction to optimize the electronic structure of catalytic active sites and improve electrocatalytic reactions.},

In this work, we studied the thermoelectric transport properties of Sb-doped MnBi 4 Te 7 crystals, which contain the Bi 2 Te 3 layers for charge transport and MnTe layers for spins. We observed abnormally low thermopower in the crystals with Sb doping ratios of 0.25 and 0.35, and the sign of thermopower is contradictory to the Hall coefficient. Further experiments evidenced magnetic field-enhanced thermopower and electrical resistivity over a wide temperature range, which support a spin-driven thermoelectric mechanism.

  abstract     = {As a solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries, Ga/Ta co-doped LLZO has garnered significant interest because of its high conductivity and dense microstructure. However, its conductivity is still lower than that of liquid organic electrolytes. In this work, Li 6.4 Ga 0.2 La 3 Zr 1.75 Ta 0.25 O 12 (Ga/Ta-LLZO) was synthesized by solid-state reaction, and the combined effects of elevated temperature and pressure on the electrical transport and dielectric properties of Ga/Ta-LLZO were systematically investigated over the temperature range of 24–150 °C and the pressure range of 3.3–30.2 GPa. The findings indicate that grain boundary resistance is the main contributor affecting the total resistance. Under a given pressure, as the temperature increases from 24 to 150 °C, the grain conductivity, grain boundary conductivity, and total conductivity of Ga/Ta-LLZO increase by about two orders of magnitude. At room temperature, when the pressure increases from 3.3 to 30.2 GPa, the grain conductivity, grain boundary conductivity, and total conductivity all increase by approximately one order of magnitude. The dielectric loss of Ga/Ta-LLZO decreases with the increase in temperature and pressure. In addition, this paper reveals the dielectric relaxation behavior of Ga/Ta-LLZO under high temperature and high pressure. At low frequencies, a dielectric relaxation with a giant dielectric constant is observed, which is associated with the relaxation of dipole formation due to the spatial charge polarization of lithium ions.},

Various morphologies of photocatalytic materials have been explored for high-efficiency H 2 production, for instance, quasi-1D nanoscroll structures that provide a larger surface-to-volume ratio. Recently, we predicted layer-by-layer formation of stable oxide nanoscrolls directly from dichalcogenide precursors, eliminating the need for costly formation of two-dimensional oxides for a roll-up synthesis of nanoscrolls. In this study, we evaluate the suitability of those oxide nanoscroll materials—MoO 3 , WO 3 , PdO 2 , HfO 2 , and GeO 2 —for solar-driven photocatalytic H 2 production and storage. Using excited state theory coupled with Bethe–Salpeter equation simulations, we discern their electronic and optical properties as a function of interlayer scroll spacing and find them to be highly conducive for solar-driven photocatalysis. Additionally, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we show that they are also suitable for H 2 storage as the nanoscrolls exhibit an effective trapping of hydrogen, even in the presence of defects and vacancies in the oxides. This work thus demonstrates the discovery of robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls as materials for advancing solar-driven hydrogen technologies.},

However, current studies primarily focus on the linear opto-magnetic response of MNPs. In this study, we explore the nonlinear opto-magnetic response of MNPs induced in a sufficiently strong alternating-current (AC) magnetic field (≥3 mT) and under laser light, referred to as opto-magnetic particle spectroscopy (optoMPS). The underlying mechanism of the optoMPS signal is attributed to physical rotation of MNPs in an AC magnetic field and under laser light. Fokker–Planck equation is numerically solved to calculate the optoMPS signal while an optoMPS system is built for measurements. Experimental results show that the harmonic vs excitation frequency curve shifts to lower frequencies as the harmonic index increases. In addition, the optoMPS signal of MNP samples with different iron concentrations is measured to investigate the signal-to-noise ratio in AC magnetic fields with amplitudes ranging from 3 to 9 mT. Notably, the 2nd and 4th harmonics in an AC magnetic field with 9 mT allow for a limit-of-detection of 25 ng in terms of iron, paving the way for highly sensitive detection of MNPs with the optoMPS signal.},

The ferromagnetic resonance of ferromagnetic materials under the combined action of alternating magnetic field and biased static magnetic field can enhance microwave absorption and further produce stronger TA signal. The results demonstrated that the conversion of strong and weak TA signals of ferromagnetic materials can be realized by controlling the switch of biased static magnetic field, so as to achieve high-contrast and background-free TA differential imaging. This technology provides a potential approach for high-contrast and background-free microwave-induced TA imaging in complex biological tissues.},

  abstract     = {Planar perovskite solar cells face a fundamental compromise between optical management and electronic optimization in conventional electron transport layers (ETLs). Here, we propose an approach through dielectric engineering by embedding high dielectric constant ( ε r = 8.5) ZnO nanoparticles within SnO 2 ETLs to create a bifunctional nanocomposite that simultaneously harnesses Mie resonance-enhanced light trapping and work function-tuned charge extraction. Finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal near-field intensity amplification at the ETL/perovskite interface. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy confirms a 0.31 eV reduction in the conduction band minimum. These findings synergistically boost photon harvesting and carrier injection. The optimized CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 21.1%, representing a 9.9% relative efficiency gain over SnO 2 -based controls (19.2%). This dielectric nanocomposite strategy establishes a viable framework for decoupling photonic and electronic optimization in solution-processed perovskite photovoltaics devices.},

In this study, a transparent multifunctional memristor with both volatile and nonvolatile properties is developed using amorphous InAlZnO (a-IAZO). The device's ability to transition between volatile and nonvolatile states effectively mimics biological synaptic behaviors, enabling the simulation of both short-term memory and long-term potentiation/inhibition processes. As a volatile memristor, the device exhibits key nociceptor characteristics, including “no adaptation,” “relaxation,” “threshold firing,” and “sensitization of allodynia/hyperalgesia.” By integrating the a-IAZO memristor with an electrical pressure sensor system, we demonstrated a bionic sensing system capable of pressure detection and voltage-based signal processing. These findings offer promising applications in neuromorphic computing and bionic robotics, advancing the development of artificial sensory systems that more closely approximate biological functions.},

Compared to the control sample with only an SiN x gate dielectric, the proposed device exhibited significant improvements: (1) enhanced thermally induced V TH stability, (2) a flat transconductance ( g m ) curve indicating improved linearity, and (3) lower and stable drain-to-source saturation voltage ( V DS,sat ). Notably, the Δ V TH shift for D-mode MIS-HEMT with NiO x was effectively reduced to ∼+0.4 V, compared to ∼−1.4 V in the control sample, over a temperature range from 25 to 400 °C. This improvement is attributed to hole carrier generation in the NiO x layer, which increases the depletion region and stabilizes the stored charge underneath the gate at high temperatures. This work demonstrates that the NiO x gate oxide layer significantly enhances V TH stability and linearity in GaN MIS-HEMT, ensuring reliable and stable device operation at high temperatures.},

Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulations confirmed the device's high sensitivity to changes in external charges. For oxide with an effective positive charge density (N eff ) exceeding 2.8 × 10 11 cm −2 , a small variation of 5 × 10 9 cm −2 could influence a lot in the capacitance value of the device in the inversion region. This sensitivity enabled multi-state capacitance modulation by adjusting the number of pulses and operating voltages. Additionally, the scalability of the device was validated through simulations. The on/off ratio could be further improved by substituting the gate dielectric material. Overall, the lateral coupling effect not only enhances the performance of charge-trapping-based devices but also provides a viable strategy for expanding memory windows across various types of capacitive memory technologies.},

The unique one-dimensional layered architecture enables dual electromagnetic wave selectivity in both frequency and spatial angle domains within specific spectral ranges. The structure contains graphene layers as the tunable dielectric for the LM. By controlling the chemical potential of graphene, the incidence angle, and the phase difference of the coherent light, the coherent absorptivity of the LM can be changed accordingly. By establishing logic-level definitions for input/output signals, two distinct operational conditions that define logical relationships between inputs and outputs are derived. Under these dual operational modes, the LM achieves data registration across eight discrete addresses. The system employs clock signal synchronization to correlate outputs from both states with one serving as a block register that identifies the data block location and the other functioning as a data register outputting actual content. The combined output from both registers generates the complete physical address of stored data. This architectural design enables simultaneous 128-bit data registration (8 × 2 × 8), demonstrating the potential for high-density optical information processing applications.},

However, the combination of the stable ferroelectricity of CIPS and the high current characteristics of Te, which both electrical and optical stimuli can modulate, offers great potential for addressing complex application scenarios, yet this type of 2D van der Waals (vdW) device has been largely unexplored. In this study, we developed an optoelectronic neuromorphic device based on CIPS and Te, which exhibits fundamental synaptic behaviors in response to electrical stimulation and demonstrates different current responses under light of varying wavelengths. Additionally, we constructed an RC system based on this device to address the problem of traffic light recognition. In this system, the ferroelectric modulation of CIPS by voltage enables short-term depression (STD) to simulate human braking behavior in response to dangerous signals. This approach effectively enhances the response capabilities of intelligent traffic systems to traffic signals, offering significant application potential.},

Beyond the highly sought-after two-dimensional materials, the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials have attracted increasing attention due to the further reduced dimensionality and the resultant more pronounced quantum confinement effect. In the present Letter, we systematically explore the stability, mechanical properties, electronic structure, and optical properties of the 1D single-chain ternary bismuth subhalides Bi 4 RuX 2 (X = I, Br) by first-principles calculations. 1D Bi 4 RuX 2 exhibit good dynamical, thermal, and mechanical stability. Along with the dimensionality reduction from three-dimensional bulk to 1D single-chain, Bi 4 RuX 2 undergo a transition from the indirect bandgap semiconductor to direct bandgap semiconductor, and their bandgap values increase from 1.028 and 1.151 eV to 1.224 and 1.263 eV, respectively. More importantly, 1D Bi 4 RuI 2 and Bi 4 RuBr 2 possess very high electron mobilities of 416.25 and 277.17 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which far outperform the hole mobilities of 0.95 and 1.35 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . In addition, the bandgap values and band edge positions can be effectively modulated by the tensile strains, which meet the conditions for photocatalytic water splitting during a wide strain range. Furthermore, the 1D Bi 4 RuX 2 exhibit an excellent light absorption ability of ∼10 5 cm −1 , which can be regulated by the tensile strain for the highly efficient utilization of solar energy. The excellent electronic and optical properties indicate 1D Bi 4 RuX 2 are promising materials for potential applications in high-performance nanoelectronic, optoelectronic devices, photocatalytic water splitting, and solar energy conversion.},

However, the recently identified Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Bias (DMB) offers an alternative to dipolar and exchange bias. A key advantage of DMB is its occurrence in a single uniform physical component, without the need for multiple layers and interfaces required by other mechanisms. It applies to thin in-plane magnetic slabs with bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. An important advantage of these systems is that an external magnetic field can control the magnitude of the loop shift. Here, we present a general theoretical framework for the conditions to obtain DMB, which also clarifies the underlying principles of the effect. Our results suggest that this mechanism opens several possibilities in developing innovative applications.},

  abstract     = {The unconventional spin-valley states in the collinear-antiferromagnetic (AFM) Janus Re 2 X 3 Y 3 (X, Y = I, Br, Cl; X ≠ Y) monolayers are predicted using effective k · p and tight binding models, which are few reports on two-dimensional AFM systems. The Janus Re 2 X 3 Y 3 systems with built-in electric fields along the axis of rotation do not lack PT symmetry. Considering spin–orbit coupling, non-highly spin degenerate valleys will spontaneously polarize. The valley polarization of the collinear-AFM hexagonal lattice is effectively adjusted through strain engineering, achieving strong correlations between strain and valley physics in 2D antiferromagnets. However, an interesting single valley state is also observed in the Janus Re 2 X 3 Y 3 monolayers, which is due to the fact that high tensile strain alters the next-nearest neighbor hopping of Re atoms, resulting in an increase in AFM interaction. In addition, the unique symmetry of the dimer sublattice leads to unusual band structures, further triggering interesting Berry curvature distributions (zero at the K/K′ point), breaking the previous understanding that only exists in bilayer systems. These physical properties of collinear-AFM Janus Re 2 X 3 Y 3 systems can be expected to replace ferromagnets as the material foundation of spintronics.},

  abstract     = {Because of their unique crystal structure and peculiar physical properties, RE CrGe 3 ( RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) have attracted considerable research attention. Different to most of RE CrGe 3 crystals, usually showing a single phase transition, NdCrGe 3 undergoes two distinct types of magnetic transitions from paramagnetic state to ferromagnetic (FM) and then to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state with lowering temperature. Here, we grew Nd 1−x La x CrGe 3 ( x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9) samples and studied the structure and magnetic properties in detail. As the concentration of La increases, the AFM phase region of Nd 1−x La x CrGe 3 ( x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9) show a dome-shaped evolution behavior. LaCrGe 3 has been known to only display a low-temperature FM phase, which is attributed to the Cr magnetic moments. These current experimental results reveal a competition between the FM and AFM phases in this system and indicate that the Nd magnetic moments might play a key role in the AFM phase of NdCrGe 3 .},

We find the Curie temperature T c is significantly suppressed from 78 K for undoped sample to 57 K for x = 0.6 sample, and the magnetization and magnetic anisotropy are also suppressed upon Cr doping, respectively. However, for the electrical transport properties, the resistivity is increased monotonously upon Cr doping and the CMR is enhanced for low doped samples, which can be attributed to the strengthened coupling and doping-induced broadening of the activation energy gap. Our work reveals the ferrimagnetism and CMR in Mn 3 Si 2 Te 6 can be effectively tuned by Cr doping, establishing a tunable knob for designing and modulating desired quantum phases in this layered topological magnet.},

In the absence of an external magnetic field, the bottom and top CoFeB layers exhibit opposite switching behavior during current scanning, resulting in a current-dependent giant magnetoresistance (GMR) curve that is inverted relative to the conventional field-driven PSV-GMR curve. The OT-induced field-like effective field, evaluated through the horizontal shift of the conventional GMR curve under different currents, is comparable to those of the heavy metal-based structures Pt/CoFeB and Ta/CoFeB.

  abstract     = {Perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) actuated by nanosecond pulses are emerging as promising devices for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic behavior and high throughput. In this work, we demonstrate the tunability and quality of random number distributions generated by pMTJs operating at a frequency of 104 MHz. First, changing the pulse amplitude is used to systematically vary the probability bias. The variance of the resulting bitstreams closely matches the expected binomial distribution, demonstrating consistency with an underlying sequence of Bernoulli trials. Second, the quality of uniform distributions of 8-bit random numbers generated with a probability bias of 0.5 is considered. A reduced chi-square analysis of these data shows that only two XOR operations are sufficient to achieve this distribution with p-values greater than 0.05. Finally, we show that there is a correlation between long-term probability bias variations and pMTJ resistance. These findings suggest that variations in the characteristics of the pMTJ underlie the observed variation of probability bias. Our results highlight the potential of stochastically actuated pMTJs for high-speed, tunable TRNG applications, showing the importance of the stability of pMTJ device characteristics in achieving reliable, long-term performance.},

  abstract     = {Acoustically driven magnetoelectric (ME) antennas present a promising approach for achieving orders-of-magnitude miniaturization. However, conventional resonator-based ME antennas suffer from substantial acoustic energy leakage, which limits the effective utilization of the magneto-acoustic coupling effect in the magnetostrictive (MS) film. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a surface acoustic wave ME antenna based on a piezoelectric-on-insulator substrate. By employing focused interdigital transducers, we spatially confine acoustic waves, significantly enhancing the acoustic energy density within the MS film and thereby improving the efficiency of magneto-acoustic coupling. Experimental results reveal that with MS film loading, the antenna's radiated power increases by a factor of 32.55 compared to an unloaded reference structure, achieving a gain of −26.78 dBi, an electromechanical coupling coefficient ( k 2 ) of 8.79%, a quality factor ( Q ) of 217, and a figure of merit (FoM, k 2 × Q max ) of 19.07. Furthermore, applying an external bias magnetic field of 300 Oe modulates the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, leading to a 1.84% enhancement in the antenna's resonance characteristics and a 7.15% improvement in radiation performance. By varying the magnetic field orientations, we further verify the proposed structure's omnidirectional magneto-acoustic coupling behavior. These findings provide insights into the design of next-generation miniaturized antennas with enhanced performance and tunability.},

Using probabilistic computing to implement invertible logic has emerged as a potential solution, with the primary challenges being the realization of high-quality random sources and efficient circuit mapping schemes. In this work, we propose a reliable design for invertible logic circuits based on stochastic spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) and validate it through SPICE simulations. To achieve this, we develop a physics-driven stochastic MTJ model using Verilog-A, which is then implemented to construct binary stochastic neurons for building restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Using linear programming (LP), the stochastic MTJs are weighted and interconnected to construct elementary RBM-based invertible logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, and NAND gates. Furthermore, through logic synthesis, invertible logic circuits capable of realizing arbitrary logic functions are achieved. RBMs whose weights are determined by LP not only eliminate the need for training but also enhance iteration speed. Finally, we demonstrate how to solve the Boolean satisfiability problem using the proposed invertible logic circuits. Power consumption and area estimations indicate that our design consumes fewer resources compared to pure CMOS implementations.},

It is demonstrated that the loss arises mainly through the non-radiative recombination process, making it unnoticeable under normal operating conditions, e.g., at room temperature. A strategy of DUV-LEDs featuring the active region ending with a well layer is accordingly proposed to propel electron accumulation into the last quantum well. As a consequence, holes can be effectively injected into the wells without parasitic loss, where efficient radiative recombination for deep-ultraviolet emission occurs as hoped. The light output power is then enhanced by 23% at 100 mA in 277 nm DUV-LEDs. Meanwhile, the maximum wall-plug efficiency reaches 9.98% at 10 mA. The strategy in this study is compatible with the present commercial DUV-LED epitaxial structure, enabling it to promote further development of this field.},

  abstract     = {Ultrawide bandgap semiconductors are promising for the next-generation power electronics, largely attributed to their substantial bandgap and exceptional breakdown electric field. Rutile GeO 2 (r-GeO 2 ) emerges as a promising alternative, particularly because of its ambipolar dopability. However, research on r-GeO 2 is still in its infancy, and further investigation into its structural properties is essential for enhancing epilayer quality. In our previous work, we identified distinct surface morphologies—square-patterned and smooth regions—of r-GeO 2 films grown on r-TiO 2 (001) substrates using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. This research employs transmission electron microscopy to investigate the structural characteristics of the material. The findings indicate that the square-patterned regions are crystalline, whereas the smooth regions exhibit amorphous properties. The measured lattice spacing in the (110) plane is 0.324 nm, slightly exceeding the theoretical value of 0.312 nm. This discrepancy suggests the presence of tensile strain in the r-GeO 2 film, resulting from lattice mismatch or thermal expansion differences with the substrate. We also observed a threading dislocation density of 1.83 × 10 9 cm −2 , consisting of 11.76% screw-type, 29.41% edge-type, 55.89% mixed-type dislocations, and 2.94% planar defects.

Detection efficiencies of 0.7% and 0.5% in response to neutrons emitted from bare AmBe and Cf-252 sources, respectively, have been achieved, corresponding to a charge collection efficiency of about 38%. These results mark a significant improvement over our previous single-stack h -BN detectors, which were 90 μ m thick and exhibited a detection efficiency of 0.1%. This enhancement is primarily attributed to the increased thickness of the h -BN layer, leading to a higher intrinsic detection efficiency. We also observed that the carrier mobility-lifetime ( μ τ) product increases as layers of h -BN are successively removed from the top by polishing, indicating that a degradation in h -BN's electronic properties with thickness is now a major limiting factor for achieving high charge collection efficiency. This finding highlights the need for further refinement in HVPE growth processes to produce h -BN wafers with both larger thicknesses and improved electronic properties. Nevertheless, the fabrication of millimeter-thick single-stack h -BN neutron detectors represents a major milestone in the application of h -BN for fast neutron detection.},

Our approach dynamically generates electron–phonon transition rates eliminating the need for parameters fitting. The simulation results reveal a pronounced velocity overshoot at electric field strengths exceeding 100 kV/cm, with a peak drift velocity of 2.5 × 10 7 cm/s observed at 400 kV/cm along the a-axis at room temperature. The analysis underscores the significant contributions of both B u and A g optical phonon scattering in governing the transport phenomena under high electric fields. Moreover, the study identifies intrinsic anisotropy in electron transport characteristics, with distinct behaviors evident between high-field and low-field regimes. These findings provide critical insight into the optimization of β-Ga 2 O 3 -based electronic devices for high-frequency and high-power applications.},

  abstract     = {Strain engineering demonstrates remarkable precision in inducing phase transitions, as well as high orientability, enabling tunable phase transitions with low energy consumption and rapid response. NbOCl 2 , an emerging ferroelectric (FE) layered two-dimensional (2D) material, exhibits pronounced in-plane FE properties and demonstrates a significant anisotropic second harmonic generation response. Here, we demonstrate that the FE phase transition in NbOCl 2 can be modulated by applying strain relative to its intrinsic lattice orientation. It has been discovered that the strain-induced FE phase transition in NbOCl 2 crystals depends on the direction of the polar axis. Specifically, when strain is applied along the polar axis and reaches a minimal threshold of just 0.65%, it induces a transition from the FE phase to the antiferroelectric phase. By releasing the strain, NbOCl 2 reverts to the FE phase, enabling a tunable phase transition along the polar axis. Furthermore, it was discovered that the challenge in inducing phase transition behavior by applying uniaxial strain along the nonpolar axis is due to the difficulty in effectively coupling the strain field to the key atomic interaction system that determines the FE properties. This work not only provides valuable strategies and insights for inducing reversible phase transitions in other 2D materials but also establishes a robust foundation for the development of FE memory devices with enhanced directional controllability.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an oxygen plasma-assisted surface oxidation technique and demonstrates that thermal annealing in an oxygen atmosphere can effectively accelerate the formation of GaON, thereby improving the threshold voltage and gate breakdown voltage of p -GaN HEMT. The effects of annealing temperature in an oxygen environment after plasma treatment on Ga-O bond strength and p -GaN surface leakage characteristics are systematically investigated. The evolution of the valence band maximum during oxidation was systematically analyzed. Experimental results reveal that the oxidized GaN exhibits a valence band offset of 1.4 ± 0.8 eV compared to initial GaN, which effectively impedes carrier transport in p -GaN and suppresses leakage currents. By optimizing the oxidation process, a 5-nm-thick gate oxide layer was formed on the p -GaN surface within a short duration. Consequently, the p -GaN HEMT demonstrated significant performance enhancements: the threshold voltage increased from 2.1 to 4.4 V, the gate breakdown voltage improved from 9 to 24.1 V, and the operational gate voltage range expanded from 6 to 12 V. These findings validate the efficacy of the oxygen plasma and post-annealing assisted surface oxidation technique, highlighting its potential for advancing high-performance GaN power devices.},

  abstract     = {We explored the role of electric-field engineering in controlling filamentary-type conduction in Cu/HfO 2 /Pt memristive devices, utilizing the quantum point-contact (QPC) model for analysis. In a previous study, we reported that devices with a thicker oxide layer stack (20 and 15 nm) statistically exhibit higher resistance values in the high-resistance state (HRS) compared to devices with a thinner oxide layer stack (10 nm). In addition, thicker oxides exhibit higher and more broadly distributed set voltages compared to the more uniform distribution of set voltages occurring in thinner oxide layers. In this work, we thoroughly analyzed the electron transport characteristics of the electroformed devices (Cu conducting filament) using the QPC model, which allows us to infer the main features of the confinement potential barrier at the constriction's bottleneck. The obtained results indicate that the HRS current for the three thicknesses investigated follows a trend consistent with the predictions of the QPC model in terms of the aspect ratio energy barrier thickness/constriction radius ( t B / R ). Notably, the 10 nm samples exhibit a lower aspect ratio ( t B / R < 1: wide nanogap) than the 15 and 20 nm samples ( t B / R > 1: elongated nanogap). It was found that wide nanogaps are associated with lower variance of the HRS current and smaller set voltages. In view of these results, we suggest that optimizing the switching oxide layer thickness, therefore the shape of the filament, may be a suitable way to reduce variability of HRS current and set voltage to improve resistive switching performance.},

The uniformity can be increased by using lateral hole injection through sidewalls of V-defects, which form at threading dislocations. However, the inherent coupling between the V-defects and dislocations might affect efficiency of the hole injection and nonradiative recombination. In this work, we have tested the possible impact of the dislocations on the injection and recombination by means of scanning near-field electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectroscopy on single green-emitting InGaN QW LEDs containing large (∼0.5 μ m) V-defects. The measurements have not provided any evidence of a lower hole injection efficiency or enhanced nonradiative recombination at the dislocations located at the V-defect facets or their apexes. This shows that large V-defects are excellent volumetric injectors for long wavelength InGaN LEDs. Furthermore, it was established that V-defects are preferential hole injectors even in single quantum well devices. Compared to vertical injection, the V-defect injection allows lowering the operating voltage, which should contribute to an enhanced wall plug efficiency.},

The LED internal quantum efficiency with and without thermal effects ( ⁠ IQ E Constant ABC and IQ E Pulsed ABC ⁠ , respectively) is extracted using the modified model.

Pulsed laser deposition combined with a lift-off process offers an effective alternative, addressing the limitations of etching-based methods. In this paper, we present low-loss alumina waveguides in the visible and infrared spectral ranges, characterized using two distinct approaches. By evaluating the propagation losses in alumina thin films deposited under varying conditions and across different waveguide widths, we achieve losses as low as 2.0 dB/cm.

The fiber membranes were delicately prepared by an electrostatic spinning direct-writing technology with controlled dimensions and micrometer spatial resolution. It was observed from the ns images that increasing the layers of fiber membrane would impede plasma penetration, which was further interpreted by 2D plasma fluid modeling that highlighted the effects of microchannels' tortuosity, radius, and porosity. On this basis, a theoretical model derived from electron avalanche theory was proposed to elucidate the dependence of electron multiplication on the tortuosity, radius, and porosity.

  abstract     = {We propose a scheme of heralded storages of single photons via spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) enhanced by a chiral standing-wave cavity, which creates a non-classically correlated pair of a spin wave and a Stokes photon (heralded photon) when a single-photon “write” pulse is applied to an atomic ensemble. In this scheme, to decrease the power of the write pulse for SRS, the write laser and the Stokes fields are aligned to propagate near-collinearly through the atoms. The short storage lifetime remains a challenge in standing-wave cavity-enhanced SRS. To prolong the storage lifetime, we achieve a long-wavelength spin-wave memory by removing the backward-scattering Stokes field from the cavity, which is realized by using non-reciprocal couplings between the Stokes fields and the atoms. In the experiment, the memory lifetime is demonstrated up to ∼100 μ s, which is beyond the limitation (∼350 ns) of the storage in the atomic ensembles coupled to standing-wave cavities. We achieve a spin-wave memory for the write pulse containing a mean photon number of ∼4. The quantum correlation of the Stokes-spin-wave pairs is beyond 2, which gives strong evidence of non-classical behavior.},

Here, we provide an atomistic insight into the enhancement of Na ionic conductivity in mixed halides Na 3 YCl x Br 6− x (NYCB x ) using ab initio calculations and machine-learning interatomic potential-based molecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations reveal that the electronic conductivity decreases as the Cl content increases, while the Na ionic conductivity reaches the highest value in NYCB3 with a middle content. Through analysis of phonon density of states, halogen mixing is found to cause a large distortion of metal–halogen polyhedra and superposition of cation and anion sublattice vibrations, leading to high Na ionic mobility.},

  abstract     = {Engineering Pt-based nanocrystals at the atomic scale holds promise for achieving high-performance electrocatalysts, yet it remains challenging for multimetallic and hierarchical nanostructures. Herein, based on the PtSnBi intermetallic nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt, Sn, and Bi atoms, we present the rational design and synthesis of face-centered cubic ( fcc ) Pt nanoboxes, incorporating dilute Bi atoms within the lattice and SnO 2 adatoms on the surface, to enhance acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis. The prepared SnO 2 @ fcc -Pt 0.9 Bi 0.1 catalyst exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 18.2 and 42.7 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively, accompanied by a favorable Tafel slope of 29.1 mV dec −1 . Furthermore, it exhibits high stability, as evidenced by its well-maintained performance at 100 mA cm −2 for 24 h. Experimental characterization combined with density functional theory calculations indicates that hollow geometric engineering, Bi doping, and SnO 2 surface modification collectively modulate the electronic structure of the active site and optimize the adsorption strength of hydrogen. Additionally, the engineering of Pt nanoboxes also enhances reaction kinetics, improves intrinsic per-site activity, and expands active surface areas. This work develops a strategy for engineering Pt-based catalysts to improve their HER performance.},

  abstract     = {Although hydrogen is an effective alternative energy source to fossil fuels, its storage is a challenge for extensive applications. The hydrogen storage performance and mechanism of the BC 2 N monolayers with and without modulation of strain and charge were investigated using first-principles methods. The pure BC 2 N monolayer achieves a high hydrogen storage gravimetric density (HSGD) of 10.95 wt. %; however, the average adsorption energy ( E ad ) of H 2 molecules is only 0.138 eV, which immensely hinders its practical applications and motivates us to introduce clean modulations for the E ad improvement with maintaining the HSGD. Our results indicate that strain engineering has little effect on enhancing the adsorption strength of H 2 . However, charge engineering can efficiently modulate the interaction between H 2 molecules and BC 2 N. When −5e charges are applied into the monolayer, E ad of H 2 molecules increases to 0.225–0.460 eV. The interaction between charged BC 2 N and H 2 molecules is of electrostatic nature. The desorption temperature of H 2 molecules is between 287 and 383 K at 1 atm. The adsorption condition of 297 K∼30 atm and the desorption condition of 385 K∼1 atm for the reversible charge-modulated BC 2 N monolayer are preferred. Furthermore, the reversible storage/release of H 2 on/from the BC 2 N monolayer can be easily controlled by modulating the charge states of BC 2 N. Combined with the analysis of desorption temperature and occupation number, our findings highlight that the BC 2 N monolayer with charge modulation is an ideal reversible hydrogen storage material with high HSGD and fast-kinetics.},

However, the available motion recognition systems face challenges due to shortcomings including high cost, complex structure, low accuracy, and poor reliability. This work demonstrates a flexible, sensitive, and robust polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite thin-film sensor with enhanced piezoelectric polarization effect for highly efficient human motion recognition. The thin-film sensor presents a high sensitivity of 27.06 KPa −1 and piezoelectric voltage of 8.7 V, together with a broad detection range of 0.01–3 MPa and low attenuation of 5.6% after 30 000 loading cycles, which are superior to those of many of the reported piezoelectric sensors and commercial SDT1-028K sensor. Employing first-principles calculations, we show that doping of Cu in aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) facilitates the transfer of piezoelectrically excited charges and enhances the electron-transferring capacity of the Cu-AZO/PVDF hybrid structure, leading to stronger polarization effect and enhanced piezoelectric properties. A machine learning coupled multi-sensor network is engaged with inputting piezoelectric signals from insoles and knees, exhibiting excellent overall classification rate of 95.54% for six human motions.},

The proposed method utilizes a holding probe to support the cells and an MFS probe for interaction force sensing; the intercellular interactions are quantified through force curve measurements in the approach-retraction process. To demonstrate the versatility of our technique, we measured the cell–substrate, cell–adherent, and cell-suspended interactions using mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells (Neuro2A). We demonstrated the potential of our method for measuring various cellular mechanical forces and revealed an increase in the stiffness of Neuro2A cells during mechanical measurements, which may be associated with cytoskeletal reinforcement in response to mechanical stimuli. The proposed technique has substantial implications for studying receptor-ligand effects on immune cells and intercellular adhesion. This advancement provides a method to enhance the comprehension of cellular mechanics and offers a tool for potential biomedical applications.},

However, it is urgent to solve the accompanying problem of high dark-current, which is mainly caused by interface damage and charge transfer between plasma structure and material. In this work, we designed a plasma structure of Au urchin embedded in the PMMA layer to effectively balance photo-response and dark-current for WS 2 plasmonic photodetectors (PDs). Herein, the non-contact “metal–semiconductor” integration prevents free electron injection and avoids the carrier lifetime extension caused by interfacial defect, which guarantees low dark-current and high carrier mobility of WS 2 . In particular, compared to conventional spherical metal nanoparticles, the multi-tip Au urchin allows better light absorption enhancement and accelerated carrier separation, as confirmed by finite-difference time-domain simulations. As a result, the WS 2 /PMMA@Au urchin plasmonic PD achieves 3.6-fold reduction in dark-current, thus obtaining a high responsivity of 533 A/W, a detectivity of 1.46 × 10 10 Jones, and an ultra-fast response speed of 136 ns. Our proposed plasma structure provides a way for promoting weak-light detection and high-efficiency photoelectric conversion of low-dimensional optoelectronic devices.},

This film modification approach affects the volume density occupation ( D ) of the emitters in the film and allows for control of the layer thickness while keeping surface roughness low and uniformity high. The achieved level of control of the mode confinement factor (Г) and optical gain is promising for better integration with resonators and multilayered structures. Careful accounting of such parameters makes it possible to achieve higher D values and increase the modal gain up to ∼2.39 times in comparison with standard spin-coating films. The modal gain enhancement and the Г factor control allow us to maximize the optical gain in light-emitting devices and facilitate low-threshold lasing.},

Here, we investigate high-quality samples that display metallic-like low-temperature resistivity attributed to surface states, pronounced quantum oscillations observable even at 40 K, and a Fermi level located approximately 100 meV above the Dirac point. In this work, we focus on the quantum oscillations that show an unusual effect: a strong temperature dependence of the oscillation frequency, which decreases by around 10% between 2 and 40 K. This reduction significantly exceeds the known effects of the Sommerfeld and topological corrections for Dirac quasi-particles, which could account for only one-eighth of the observed change. We attribute the observed effect to the temperature-induced renormalization of the bulk bandgap size due to electron–phonon interactions, which in turn affect the position of the surface Dirac point within the gap. Furthermore, we propose that in this compound, surface quantum oscillations can serve as a precise tool for investigating the low-temperature evolution of the bulk bandgap size.},

  abstract     = {One-dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) hold significant promise for graphene-based nanodevices, but their reduced dimensionality leads to enhanced anharmonicity, which strongly impacts their physical properties, such as thermal conductivity. In this work, we demonstrate that the anharmonicity of GNRs can be effectively suppressed when confined within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, we observe a reduced temperature coefficient for the G mode in 7-atom-wide armchair GNRs (7AGNRs) encapsulated within SWNTs, compared to freestanding 7AGNRs, indicating a weakened anharmonic effect, which leads to a remarkable enhancement of over 50% in the thermal conductivity of the confined 7AGNRs. First-principles calculations of charge differential density reveal that host–guest interactions in this 1D vdW heterostructure strengthen the covalent bonds of GNRs through in-plane charge transfer from GNR atoms to their bands, induced by the built-in field of the SWNT. This enhanced bonding suppresses anharmonic effects in the confined GNRs, as further confirmed by the behavior of the CH in-plane bending mode (CH-ipb) and D mode in Raman spectra. Our findings establish a direct structure–thermal property relationship in 1D van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating that nanoconfinement engineering can overcome the inherent anharmonic limitations of low-dimensional nanomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Recently, ultra-large electrostrain exceeding 1% has been observed in various thin ferroelectric ceramics, generating a significant research interest. However, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. In this work, electrostrain, along with the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of {(K 0.2 Na 0.8 ) 0.5 Bi 0.5 } 0.96 Sr 0.04 Sb x Ti 1− x O 3− x /2 ceramics, was investigated, and all of them feature a sample's thickness ( t ) dependence. As t decreased from 0.4 to 0.1 mm, both the permittivity ( ε ′) and loss tangent (tan δ ) diminished, and the maximum polarization ( P max ) decreased, while the electrostrain ( S ) exhibited a significant increase. X-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed structural differences between the bulk and the surface of the ceramics, and surface reconstruction during the poling process. Based on these findings, we propose that the thickness-dependent electric properties are related to hopping oxygen vacancies, which forms an oxygen vacancy-gradient layer on the ceramic surface under the applied electric field. Our work is conducive to understanding the thickness-dependent properties recently discovered in piezoelectric ceramics.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrated that Josephson threshold detectors (JTDs) could be developed to implement the sensitive detection of broadband microwave photons. Beginning with the numerical simulations of the damped dynamics for the macroscopic phase particle generated by a Josephson junction (JJ), we showed that the time-domain threshold voltage state switched measurements of the JJ driven by a low-frequency triangular wave current, which could be utilized to implement the sensitive microwave photons detection. The detectable signal power can be determined by using the Kumar–Caroll index to quantify the distinguishability between two statistical distributions on the measured threshold switched durations of the JJ with and without the signal input. Experimentally, we fabricated the Al/AlOx/Al JJ and measured its threshold responses, at 50 mK temperature, to the input microwave photons at the frequency of ∼ 5 GHz. The experimental results indicated that the weak microwave signals, which are phenomenologically threatened by the additional thermal noise that modifies the damped phase dynamics of the JJ, can be detected by the fabricated JTD. The detectable power of the microwave signals demonstrated here was calibrated as about −92 dBm (corresponding to the photons rate of ∼ 2 × 10 8 photons/ms). Based on the numerical simulations for optimizing the relevant performance indicators of the detectors, we further argue that the JTDs could be utilized to achieve the sensitive detection of broadband microwave photons at the single-photon level.},

The manipulation of spin-splitting and valley polarization is crucial for both spintronic and valleytronic applications. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that the completely spin-polarized bands and intrinsic valley polarization can be realized in the Ca(CoN) 2 altermagnet bilayer by modulating its stackings and magnetic configurations. The Ca(CoN) 2 bilayer preserves AM magnetic configuration for each sublayer and antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling.

In this work, we investigate the influence of nanowire morphology on their dynamic susceptibility and resonant modes using micromagnetic simulations. We analyze cylindrical, capped cylindrical, and ellipsoidal nanowires across a range of aspect ratios to determine how structural variations affect spin-wave excitation and localization. Our results reveal that cylindrical and capped cylindrical nanowires exhibit multiple resonant peaks, corresponding to edge and bulk spin-wave modes, with higher-order bulk modes emerging at larger aspect ratios. In contrast, ellipsoidal nanowires primarily support a single dominant resonance mode, suggesting a suppression of bulk modes due to a more uniform magnetization distribution. The demagnetizing field analysis confirms that this suppression arises from a stronger field concentration at the extremities in ellipsoidal nanowires. Additionally, energy minimization calculations show that ellipsoidal nanowires exhibit more metastable states, highlighting the role of termination geometry in stabilizing different magnetization configurations. These findings provide insights into the design of magnetic nanowires for future technological applications, particularly in magnonic circuits, non-reciprocal microwave components, and next-generation signal processing devices.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal aluminum nitride ( h -AlN), an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor with exceptional thermal conductivity, holds great promise for applications in power electronics and optoelectronics. Prior studies have shown that AlN undergoes a transition from the wurtzite structure ( wz -AlN) to hexagonal magnesium oxide ( h -MgO) structure under pressure. However, a thorough understanding of the thermal transport properties of these two hexagonal phases has yet to be established. Herein, we look into this issue by combining the first-principles calculations with phonon Boltzmann transport theory. With the inclusion of four-phonon scattering and phonon renormalization, we predict that the thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ ⁠ ) of wz -AlN is 291 and 268 W/mK for the in-plane and out-of-plane directions at room temperature, respectively, showing good agreement with experimental measurements. In contrast, the h -MgO phase exhibits a significantly lower thermal conductivity, with the in-plane value of 50 W/mK and the out-of-plane value of 93 W/mK. Through further analysis of modal phonon transport and chemical bonding, we attribute the lower κ of h -MgO-AlN to its stronger anharmonicity resulting from the weaker Al–N bonding. More importantly, we uncover that the h -MgO phase exhibits unusual κ anisotropy with the out-of-plane κ being almost twice as high as the in-plane value, in stark contrast to the common behavior observed in wurtzite crystals. This anomaly is found to arise from the phase transition-induced strengthening of interlayer bonding. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the thermal transport behavior of hexagonal bulk AlN during the structural phase transition.},

Using pump–probe spectroscopy and finite element simulations, we explore the size-dependent vibrational frequencies of the nanohole arrays. The experimental results reveal two distinct vibrational modes: a thickness-dependent out-of-plane breathing mode of the MoS 2 thin films, and a low-frequency mode corresponding to the in-plane periodic deformation of the nanoholes. The study highlights the size-dependent vibrational frequencies of the nanoholes, showing excellent agreement between experiments and simulations.

This limits real-time performance and increases system complexity. Here, we present a compact full-polarization LiDAR, termed VRP-LiDAR, which leverages the spatial polarization modulation capability of a vortex retarder (VR) in conjunction with a polarization camera and a photodetector. This approach enables real-time, single-shot acquisition of both distance information and full-Stokes polarization data without requiring multiple exposures or moving parts.

While ambient-pressure wurtzite BeO plays a crucial role in various applications, its thermal transport properties under pressure remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ the first-principles phonon Boltzmann transport theory to investigate the pressure-dependent thermal transport in BeO. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic pressure dependence of thermal conductivity, characterized by a significant drop upon the wurtzite–rock salt phase transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial role for four-phonon scattering processes, which are typically neglected in conventional calculations. Neglecting four-phonon scattering leads to a substantial overestimation of thermal conductivity. This anomalous dominance of four-phonon scattering can be attributed to the exceptionally large anharmonicity, driven by the strong pressure-dependent repulsive interactions between oxygen atoms, which exhibit a 1 / d 4 dependence on interatomic distance. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering higher-order phonon scattering processes in pressure-dependent systems. These insights have significant implications for understanding and manipulating thermal transport in materials subjected to extreme pressures.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric conversion is a crucial approach to addressing waste heat utilization and energy challenges in the 21st century. Enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) has become a central focus in the research of thermoelectric materials and devices. In this study, using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport method, we systematically investigate the thermoelectric properties of monolayer Janus materials Zn AX Te ( ⁠ A = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se). The lowest conduction band of these materials is found to consist of multiple nearly degenerate valleys, resulting in a power factor significantly higher than that of the widely studied thermoelectric material SnSe. Furthermore, the strong interaction between low-frequency optical phonons and acoustic phonons leads to relatively low lattice thermal conductivity. The synergy of a high power factor and low lattice thermal conductivity enables these materials to achieve remarkably high ZT values. For instance, the ZT values of n -type ZnSnSTe and ZnSnSeTe reach 3.07 and 3.14 at 800 K, respectively, demonstrating excellent high-temperature thermoelectric performance. This study highlights their potential in thermoelectric devices and provides valuable theoretical guidance for the design and development of high-performance thermoelectric materials.},

The present work designs a feasible strategy to achieve the thermal expansion from positive to zero and negative in NASICON structure molybdates by part removing Rb ions in the RbMgInMo 3 O 12 framework. The removal of alkali metal ions Rb + reduces the number of Rb–O bonds that contribute to positive thermal expansion along the c -axis direction and expands the average atomic volume of the framework structure. This structural modification facilitates coupling oscillations between polyhedra, significantly reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion along the c -axis. Meanwhile, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the ab -plane remains essentially unchanged. Consequently, the thermal expansion of Rb x Mg x In 2- x Mo 3 O 12 is effectively modulated from positive ( α v = 3.3 × 10 −6 K −1 ) to zero ( α v = 1.0 × 10 −6 K −1 ) and negative thermal expansion ( α v = −2.7 × 10 −6 K −1 ). This work not only reports the interesting zero and negative thermal expansion functional materials but also gives one way to design more negative thermal expansion materials with the open-framework structure.},

Furthermore, the presence of SRO has been predicted to have profound effects on the electronic and topological properties of group-IV alloys, offering a different direction in designing group-IV materials for photoelectronic and quantum devices. However, due to the limited understanding of the formation mechanisms, developing effective methods to manipulate SRO in epitaxy is still challenging. To address this, we propose a mechanism for the GeSn alloy, revealing that surface diffusion plays a key role in SRO formation. Building on this mechanism, we show that the distinct surface conditions in MBE and CVD lead to the formation of SRO with enhanced Sn–Sn pairing in MBE-grown samples, while CVD-grown samples remain random alloys. Our findings provide an initial understanding of the kinetic process of SRO formation, providing guidance for the design of experiments to manipulate SRO.},

  abstract     = {We propose AlN-based polarization-doped field-effect transistors (PolFETs) with upward-graded Al x Ga 1− x N channel layers combined with downward-graded AlGaN underlayers (ULs). In a structure where the channel layer is directly formed on an AlN buffer layer without a UL, the large polarization charge of the AlN buffer layer depletes the bottom side of the channel layer, resulting in narrow width of three-dimensional electron gas (3DEG) and high resistance in electrical characterization. In contrast, the structures incorporating ULs exhibit wide 3DEG by leveraging polarization engineering. Hall-effect measurements revealed a sheet electron concentration ( ⁠ n sh ⁠ ) of 6.2 × 10 12 cm −2 and electron mobility ( ⁠ μ ⁠ ) of 187 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for a 100-nm-thick upward-graded Al x Ga 1− x N ( ⁠ x : 0.77 → 1 ⁠ ) with an undoped 300-nm-thick downward-graded Al y Ga 1− y N ( ⁠ y : 1 → 0.77 ⁠ ) UL. Silicon doping in the UL compensates for their negative polarization charge, further increasing n sh to 7.2 × 10 12 cm −2 while maintaining μ of 200 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at a Si doping concentration of 3.3 × 10 17 cm −3 . The PolFET with the Si-doped UL exhibits a drain current of 70 mA/mm. The off-state leakage current is as low as 4 × 10 − 10 A/mm, leading to large on/off ratio of 10 8 ⁠ . Thus, the incorporation of downward-graded AlGaN ULs with Si doping concentrations comparable with the negative polarization charge density in the ULs can boost the performance of AlN-based PolFETs.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a notable member of ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, distinguished by its unique layered crystalline structure and exceptional electrical and optical properties. One of the established and important device applications of h-BN lies in solid-state neutron detectors. Achieving high detection efficiency requires thick, high-quality crystals to maximize neutron interactions and charge carrier collection. While hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) excels at growing thick, uniform h-BN films (quasi-bulk wafers), its high growth rate can compromise crystallinity by introducing structural defects. This study investigates the impact of post-growth high-temperature annealing (up to 1900 °C) on 1 mm thick HVPE-grown h-BN. X-ray diffraction confirmed significant improvements in crystallinity with higher annealing temperatures, leading to increased resistivity and an enhanced charge carrier mobility-lifetime product. A detector fabricated from h-BN annealed at 1900 °C demonstrated a 0.7% overall detection efficiency and 37% charge collection efficiency for fast neutrons from an AmBe source. These findings highlight post-growth annealing as a simple yet highly effective method to improve h-BN quality for a wide range of applications, including direct conversion solid-state neutron detectors, which are becoming increasingly vital in various nuclear diagnostic instruments.},

  abstract     = {Charge pumping electrically detected magnetic resonance (CP-EDMR) has previously been demonstrated as a characterization technique for performance-limiting point defects in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs). This Letter demonstrates the much-promised defect selectivity of CP-EDMR in a 4H-SiC n-channel MOSFET, differentiating between two distinct paramagnetic centers based on the kinetic properties, following from variation of the experimental CP parameters. The centers are shown to differ both in their characteristic g -shifts and in hyperfine interactions with surrounding nuclei. In addition, we show that under magnetic resonance conditions these two defects show opposite effects on the CP current, which results in a sign inversion of the CP-EDMR spectrum. For one defect, which only appears under relatively low-frequency CP-excitation, the microwaves induce a decrease in CP-current, while the other defect shows an increase at all applied CP-frequencies. Starting from an empirical CP model, we demonstrate that an enhanced efficiency of carrier capture or emission leads to either an increase or a decrease in the CP current, respectively. Simulations based on this model qualitatively reproduce the observed dependencies of the CP-EDMR signal on CP bias voltage and excitation frequency.},

  abstract     = {The direct in situ measurement of group-III element growth rates in epitaxial methods has been a continuous pursuit. Despite the development of numerous in situ monitoring tools, the accurate measurement of growth rates remains challenging. The calibration of group-III element fluxes, and consequently the associated growth rate, is performed through various methods (such as RHEED oscillations, beam equivalent pressure measurement, optical methods, and quartz crystal microbalance). However, these direct in situ measurements are often valid only under specific conditions and/or involve indirect measurements that require knowledge of additional parameters. In this study, we applied the magnification inferred curvature method (MIC) to directly measure the growth rate of slightly strained AlAs layers grown on GaAs substrates, and thus enabling calibration of the Al effusion cells and controlling the thickness and composition of pseudomorphic Al x Ga 1−x As layers independently of their thickness, and the growth conditions. From MIC measurements, we were able to deduce the elastic parameters at growth temperature, enabling us to achieve a reliable and transferable calibration of the Al incorporation rate under defined experimental conditions. This calibration is mainly applicable to pseudomorphic epitaxial materials with low lattice mismatch, such as several III–V and II–VI alloy systems, provided they remain in the elastic deformation regime. Under these strict pseudomorphic growth conditions, the calibration remains fully transferable from one epitaxy chamber to another.},

Etch pit observations and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed that the propagation of dislocations into the regrown α-Ga 2 O 3 was dramatically reduced by narrowing the window. The overall dislocation density in the coalesced film, including the window region and coalesced boundaries, was as low as 4 × 10 7 cm −2 in the case of the 50-nm window mask.

Meanwhile, the carriers are distributed in different channels, thereby diminishing the inter-carrier scattering effect. The hole mobility of the multi-channel structure remains largely unaffected by the increased sheet hole density. Due to the excellent conductivity, the ohmic contact resistance of the multi-channel structure is as low as 15.9 Ω mm.

From the analysis of both experimental and computational tracer diffusion data, we concluded that the oxygen vacancies present in the LaInO 3 films form in order to charge compensate acceptor-type point defects (most probably, lanthanum vacancies introduced in the MBE growth process). ToF-SIMS profiles also yielded evidence of faster cation (Dy and Sc) diffusion (but not of faster anion diffusion) along dislocations in the LaInO 3 thin films at T = 1173 K ⁠ , behavior consistent with positive dislocation cores surrounded by negative space-charge tubes.},

  abstract     = {Flexible metasurfaces comprising arrays of sub-wavelength thick nanoparticles embedded in soft and transparent substrates have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to generate predictable, tunable, and reversible optical performances. In this work, we employ electron beam lithography combined with wet-etching techniques to fabricate flexible metasurfaces of gold elliptical nanorings arranged in square or triangular arrays on polydimethylsiloxane. Scanning electron microscope tests conducted on the soft substrate demonstrate the feasibility of the pattern transfer technique at the nanoscale, as well as the reliability of the in situ optical characterization. Continuous monitoring of reflectance under strain, complemented by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, reveals intriguing optical behaviors for these metasurfaces, including Fano features in surface lattice resonances, spectral blueshifts in localized surface plasmonic resonances, and color changes from purple to green and orange. By integrating metasurfaces with different characteristics into a chessboard-like pattern, we propose the configuration of a flexible strain map for contactless investigation of localized surface strain, which also provides opportunities for information encryption by encoding the varied resonances under strain.},

As system dimensionality increases, these solutions may become prohibitively complex and expensive, limiting large-scale feasibility. To address this, we investigate a temporally modulated LC-resonator synthesized from self-contained analog circuit. By embedding time-varying resistors into synthetic impedances, continuous harmonic inductances with dynamic reconfigurability are realized. Integrated into local resonators, the proposed circuits open temporal modulation induced sidebands with corresponding wave attenuation zones. Validated through modeling and experimentation, the resulting metasurface is highly scalable and reconfigurable, offering a solution for multi-band vibration control.},

  abstract     = {In optoelectronics and photonics, developing multifunctional light-emitting devices has become a prominent research area. However, achieving integration of polarization control, intensity modulation, and tunability within a single device presents a formidable challenge. Here, we report the design and implementation of a symmetric bound state in the continuum (BIC) realized by a metasurface composed of perovskite nanobars on a silica substrate. Through the incorporation of both in-plane and out-of-plane symmetries, the BIC undergoes a transformation into a chiral quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC). The chiral q-BIC metasurface exhibits an intrinsic chiral response, characterized by nearly perfect circular dichroism of 0.96, a key property for chiral optical applications. Furthermore, the integration of Sb 2 S 3 phase-change materials into the metasurface enables dynamic regulation of resonant circularly polarized emission wavelengths between 760 and 820 nm, with selective enhancement of right circularly polarized emission by 240-fold and suppression of left circularly polarized emission. Our chiral q-BIC metasurface enables single-device multi-function integration, offering a versatile and dynamically tunable platform for enhanced chiral optical responses across optoelectronics and photonics.},

Nevertheless, most previous metasurfaces are realized with limited single functions, as well as complicated structures or low transformation efficiency, leaving the reconfigurable mode-transition reflective metagratings with high efficiency largely uncharted. Here, we propose a distinctly reconfigurable phase-gradient metagrating (PGM) for wave reflection manipulations. We demonstrate that by harnessing only the local phase in the PGM, multi-functionalities can be achieved, including a transition from the perfect retro-reflection to perfect specular reflection. Moreover, we illustrate the robust full-angle incidence response for the reflection conversion enabled by the PGM. These results have been confirmed by the consistent results of theory, simulations, and experiments. The proposed reconfigurable PGM with its simple design, not only broadens the fundamental understanding of diffraction order transitions but also provides an alternative avenue for acoustic applications such as multi-functional information processing.},

By finely tuning the thickness of the photonic crystal, merging bound states in the continuum (BICs) are realized, which have more confined local fields and higher Q factors compared with the sole BICs at the same in-plane wavevector. Efficient SHG in 2D monolayer materials is achieved at relatively low pump intensities, and the conversion efficiency of SHG is several orders of magnitude larger than that on photonic crystals of isolated BICs. For typical transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, such as MoS 2 , the maximum SHG conversion efficiency achieves 1% at a pump intensity of 10 4 kW/cm 2 , which is approximately five orders of magnitude greater than that on a photonic crystal of isolated BICs.

As the asymmetry parameter α increases, the quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BIC) exhibit characteristics of an anapole mode, and switching between anapole and dual-anapole can be accomplished by altering the polarization mode. Alternatively, by incorporating graphene sheet, this functionality can also be realized at very low Fermi energy levels, and even enable anapole mode switching. Furthermore, the effect of the asymmetry parameter α on the sensing and slow-light properties of metamaterials is examined separately. The metamaterials demonstrate group delays of up to 100 ps and a sensitivity of 189 GHz/RIU.

In this study, the impact of lithium (Li) doping on the electronic, optical, and spintronic properties of quasi-2D perovskite structures, including CsPbBr 3 and (PEA) 2 Pb 2 CsBr 7 , was systematically investigated using density functional theory. Our results reveal that Li doping introduces significant changes in spin–orbit coupling-induced band splitting, charge distribution, and spin texture due to asymmetry. The magnitude of these alterations depends on the type of 2D structure and surface termination. Spin texture analysis revealed parallel alignment of spin vectors in the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum for all configurations, enabling spin-allowed transitions. This characteristic, along with the transition from direct to indirect band gaps, reduces charge carrier recombination rates and enhances the material's potential for scintillation applications. These findings underscore the critical role of Li doping in tuning the optoelectronic and spintronic properties of 2D and quasi-2D CsPbBr 3 perovskites, paving the way for their use in radiation detection and energy conversion technologies.},

Patterning the coating into the shape of an annulus increases the threshold modal gain in the periphery of the VCSEL aperture overlapping with the higher-order transverse modes while leaving the central region unaffected. This patterning creates a radially dependent threshold modal gain profile, suppressing higher-order modes and encouraging operation in a single-fundamental mode.

  abstract     = {Optical skyrmions, unlike their magnetic counterpart, can be generated and detected with a wide variety of topological structures, as they are missing constraints due to energy minimization and available material symmetries. Optical skyrmions are most commonly constructed as superpositions of different propagation-invariant modes in orthogonal polarization states. Experimentally this is problematic, especially for higher-order skyrmions, as large sections of the required polarization structure are imprinted at low light intensity, effectively limiting the range of topological structures to those with low skyrmion numbers. Here, we suggest and demonstrate the generation of optical skyrmions as superpositions of perfect vortex beams, leveraging the inherent consistency of their spatial shape. This allows us to generate beams with ring-shaped and skyrmion numbers up to 20. Furthermore, the spatial dimension of our ring-shaped skyrmions can be easily adjusted, offering potential opportunities for optical communication, precision measurement, and light–matter interaction.},

  abstract     = {The quantum efficiency of micro-light emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) is lower than that of large area LEDs. This efficiency reduction is typically attributed to the nonradiative Shockley–Read–Hall recombination at the surface defects and current leakage through the sidewall region without a clear distinction between these effects. In this work, we attempt to find out which of these phenomena is most critical for the reduced efficiency of micro-LEDs. This has been done by mapping electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) and measuring PL dynamics in blue GaN micro-LEDs fabricated by dry etching. It has been found that in the as-etched device, the EL intensity is much lower than in devices with KOH etching and atomic layer deposition of SiO 2 . This effect is especially pronounced close to the sidewalls. On the other hand, PL decay times are similar in as-etched and passivated devices, both in their center and at the sidewalls. This allows concluding that the main mechanism of the reduced efficiency of micro-LEDs fabricated by dry etching is the current leakage in the sidewall region and not the nonradiative recombination. The KOH etching has been found to be the most efficient means to eliminate the current leakage.},

  abstract     = {MXenes have garnered significant attention for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) applications due to their exceptional electronic properties and remarkable hydrophilicity. However, niobium carbide (Nb 2 CT X ), a notable member of the MXene family, has been underexplored for SERS applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of the SERS properties of Nb 2 CT x nanosheets, using methylene blue (MB) and crystal violet (CV) as probe molecules under laser excitations at 532 and 488 nm. The results revealed that the Raman enhancement of dye molecules on the Nb 2 CT x -based SERS substrate was determined by the interplay between laser energy and the probe molecule. The two orders of magnitude higher enhancement factor (EF) for MB (2.12 × 10 6 ) compared to CV (2.65 × 10 4 ) obtained using 532 nm laser excitation was attributed to a light-induced resonance charge transfer transition within the MB-Nb 2 CT X system. The distinctly different EF values for MB and CV suggest that SERS technology based on chemical mechanisms could enable selective molecular detection. Our results provide valuable insights into the SERS mechanism and contribute to the development of cost-effective and 2D MXene-based selective SERS substrates for molecular sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor materials, such as β − G a 2 O 3 (gallium oxide), AlN (aluminum nitride), A l x G a 1 − x N (AlGaN), and diamond, have emerged as essential candidates for components in high-power, high-frequency applications due to their superior electronic properties. However, with the exception of diamond and AlN, these materials present unique thermal management challenges, primarily because of their low thermal conductivities that are incapable of managing the demand for high power densities. Therefore, novel thermal management approaches that feature new device architectures are needed to prevent excessively high peak temperatures in UWBG devices. In parallel, accurate device-level thermal characterization (with high spatial/temporal resolution) is crucial to verify and optimize these designs with an overall goal to improve device performance and reliability. This paper discusses current thermal metrology techniques used for UWBG semiconductor devices covering: optical methods (Raman and thermoreflectance); electrical methods (gate resistance thermometry); and scanning probe methods (scanning thermal microscopy). More specifically, the steady-state and transient capability of each thermal metrology is explored and the limitation of each technique is highlighted. Finally, this perspective outlines potential advances in transient thermoreflectance imaging including a hyperspectral approach for nitride based heterostructures and a sub-bandgap excitation technique for gallium oxide based electronics. Additionally, the development of a future thermoreflectance microscope is presented. This microscope features high optical transmission, in the deep ultra violet wavelength range, for near bandgap thermoreflectance imaging of UWBG devices.},

  abstract     = {The capacity fading mechanism of Cr 8 O 21 remains unclear owing to the lack of reliable evidence. To elucidate the source of capacity loss, we investigated the structures, the structural evolution process, and phase transitions of lithiated Cr 8 O 21 (Li x Cr 8 O 21 ) using first-principles calculations. On the one hand, we found that Li x Cr 8 O 21 adopts a sandwich structure at low Li content but exhibits a rock salt-like structure at high Li content. Compared to the sandwich-like Li x Cr 8 O 21 , the rock salt-like Li x Cr 8 O 21 possesses a reduced volume and, therefore, decreased interstitial Li sites. The rock salt-like Li x Cr 8 O 21 structure can maximally store 14 Li, less than 4 Li compared to the sandwich structure. Therefore, this structural change from sandwich-like into rock salt-like is a reason for the capacity loss in Cr 8 O 21 in the discharge process. On the other hand, the convex hull and phase diagram demonstrate that the rock salt-like Li x Cr 8 O 21 is thermodynamically unstable, and a portion of it transforms into active LiCrO 2 during the first discharge. However, LiCrO 2 is then converted into CrO 2 , rather than Cr 8 O 21 in the subsequent charge process. This irreversible phase transition (Cr 8 O 21 → LiCrO 2 in the discharge process and LiCrO 2 → CrO 2 in the charge process) is another significant cause for the capacity loss in Cr 8 O 21 . This study provides key theoretical evidence for the drastic capacity fading in Cr 8 O 21 and thereby facilitates the future development of high-capacity cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.},

To address this issue, we propose a phosphorization strategy involving the phosphorization of garnet-based solid electrolyte and subsequently the reaction with molten lithium. This lithium-phosphorus reaction markedly enhances the wettability of molten lithium on a copper current collector, enabling the fabrication of a sub-10-µm-thick ultrathin lithium metal anode. As a proof of concept, a 6-µm-thick ultrathin lithium metal anode demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a Coulombic efficiency of over 98.8% at a substantial utilization rate of 83%.

  abstract     = {Normally off beta-phase gallium oxide (β-Ga 2 O 3 ) metal-oxide field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) on GaN-on-Si substrates were fabricated with a threshold voltage (V TH ) of 3 V. β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films were deposited using pulsed laser deposition. The device demonstrated an excellent breakdown voltage of ∼540 V at V GS = 0 V and an extremely low gate leakage current of ∼10 −7 mA/mm. Additionally, it exhibited a low subthreshold swing (SS) of ∼167 mV/dec and a current on/off ratio of ∼10 6 . The growth and fabrication of β-Ga 2 O 3 MOSFETs on GaN-on-Si substrates are significant for high performance and their monolithic integration with GaN devices in future power-integrated circuits.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes a selective polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) doping strategy to enhance the electrical stability of indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). In contrast to conventional single-layer PTFE-doped IGZO TFTs, which increase electrical stability but face a trade-off with reduced mobility due to the uniform distribution of PTFE throughout the layer, this strategy confines PTFE to the back-channel region of the IGZO layer. By preventing PTFE from entering the effective channel where electron transport occurs, mobility loss is minimized, and stability is significantly improved. Compared to conventional IGZO TFTs, the proposed approach reduces threshold voltage shifts under positive bias stress from 4.94 to 2.69 V and under negative bias illumination stress from 16.63 to 10.84 V, all without mobility degradation. The localized PTFE in the back-channel acts as a passivation layer, reducing interactions with oxygen and moisture in the environment. This selective doping approach provides an effective solution for improving the performance and stability of IGZO-based TFTs in advanced display technologies.},

  abstract     = {Ionic migration in Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) films play a crucial role in shaping the ferroelectric (FE) properties of HZO, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We employed in situ extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), a highly challenging technique due to its sensitivity to subtle changes in atomic coordination, to track real-time variations in the local atomic environment of HZO under applied voltage. Despite the inherent complexity of in situ EXAFS, we observed that the migration of oxygen vacancies ( O v ) was a key factor in regulating the FE wake-up effects and phase development during device operation. Complementary hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that non-lattice oxygen states are particularly concentrated at the film interfaces. The differential distribution of these oxygen-related states, whether at the interface or within the bulk, showed distinct influences on the formation of the FE orthorhombic ( O ) - phase ( Pca2 1 ), as well as the non-FE monoclinic ( M ) - phase ( P2 1 /c ) and tetragonal ( T ) - phase ( P4 2 /mnc ), as determined by the x-ray phase mapping technique. The combination of these techniques is crucial in uncovering the intricate interplays between structural, electronic, and phase transitions linked to HZO's FE properties during device operation. Based on these findings, we propose strategically adjusting oxygen levels to enhance FE performance while mitigating the wake-up effect.},

However, their sensitivities are limited by the Boltzmann distribution of electrons. Negative capacitance effect has the potential to address this challenge. Here, we realize two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction negative capacitance field-effect transistors (NCFETs) with MoS 2 channel, CuInP 2 S 6 ferroelectric layer, graphene contacts, hexagonal boron nitride dielectric layer, and graphene top gate. The devices exhibit excellent electrical performance with on–off ratio of 10 6 and subthreshold swing of 26 mV/dec. Due to the ultrasmall subthreshold swing value, the NCFET demonstrates a high pH detection sensitivity (675.8 pH −1 ), significantly outperforming the traditional 2D-material FET biosensors (445.5 pH −1 ). An extended-gate structure with TiN sensing membrane is connected with the MoS 2 NCFET. This structure prevents leakage current between the solution and the gate dielectric, which can improve the stability of the biosensor. This work provides insights into the design of biochemical sensing platform. The observation of the negative capacitance effect in all-2D-material-based biosensor may stimulate further fundamental research and potential applications.},

The optical response of the PST is improved due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies in the CeO x floating gate, and the tunable synaptic characteristics are endowed. Various synaptic behaviors under visible light stimulation have been simulated, including paired-pulse facilitation, high-pass filtering characteristics, the transition from short-term memory to long-term memory, and learning-experience behavior. The multilevel conductance modulation is realized through optical programming and electrical erasing operations. An artificial neural network was constructed based on the long-term plasticity of the PST, and 95.3% accuracy was achieved in image recognition. This work promotes the development of oxide-based PST and provides a candidate for artificial visual bionics inspired by visible light.},

By implementing this framework on a kagome lattice driven by a linearly polarized light in the off-resonant regime, we demonstrate that the hopping strength along specific bonds can be tuned to zero. This control leads to the merging of two inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone, governed by the field parameters. This merging leads to the transition from the kagome quasienergy spectrum to a Lieb-like spectrum with a smaller bandwidth at a specific value of field parameter. In addition, the longitudinal optical conductivity of the driven kagome lattice can be measured to investigate the kagome to Lieb transition and merging of Dirac points, as suggested by our calculation.},

The surface oxide doped the underlying Te layers degenerately due to charge transfer, establishing an Ohmic contact between Pd electrode and Te with negative Schottky barrier under flatband condition. This enables Te field-effect transistor to achieve outstanding electronic performance, including a record-low contact resistance of ∼0.16 kΩ· μ m and a high field-effect mobility of ∼1015 cm 2 V −1 s −1 (∼3002 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) at room temperature (low temperature).

This effectively suppresses irreversible domain wall motion, thereby reducing strain hysteresis. Furthermore, the ceramics maintain an ultrahigh unipolar strain of ≈0.22% and excellent thermal stability within the temperature range of 45–120 °C.

Here, we propose to use defect relaxation energy as a screening criterion to quickly identify the potential co-doping elements. The co-doping at the cation sites employing the donor–acceptor pairs is studied. One hundred and twenty element pairs at nine site combinations are considered. Based on first-principles calculations, our high-throughput screening not only identifies those dopant pairs that have been explored experimentally and demonstrated feasible, but also predicts new candidates. In particular, we experimentally synthesized CaTiSiO 5 with (Nb, Na) co-doping at Ti–Ca sites (Ca 1− x Na x Ti 1− x Nb x SiO 5 ).

To achieve field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization, additional magnetic field, magnetic layer assistance, or artificially designed structural symmetry breaking are usually required, which are not conducive to the high-density integration and application of low-power devices. However, 2D type-II Weyl semimetals with low-symmetry structures have recently been found to generate z -spin-polarized currents, which may induce out-of-plane damping-like torques to their neighboring ferromagnetic layers, and realize deterministic perpendicular magnetization switching at zero magnetic field. In this Letter, we report that current-induced field-free magnetization switching at room temperature can be achieved in a perpendicularly magnetized TaIrTe 4 /Pt/Co/Pt device, and the critical switching current density can be lowered to be about 2.64 × 10 5 A·cm −2 . When the current is applied along the low-symmetry TaIrTe 4 a -axis, the out-of-plane and in-plane spin Hall conductivities are estimated to be 0.61 × 10 5 × ℏ / 2 e ( Ω m ) − 1 and 3.13 × 10 5 × ℏ / 2 e ( Ω m ) − 1 ⁠ , respectively.

The practical application of these response mechanisms in this field is contingent upon their comprehension. In this study, first-principles calculations are implemented to investigate the influence of charge doping on the magnetic properties of Cr 2 TiC 2 O 2 . Cr 2 TiC 2 O 2 prefers a ferromagnetic arrangement in its undoped state. When the electron loss per unit cell is below 0.8, a ferromagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic phase transition occurs and leads to an antiferromagnetic structure. Additionally, the easy magnetization axis switches from [001] to [100]. In addition to elevating the magnetic ordering temperature, electron loss also improves the exchange interaction (J 1 ). Specifically, when the system loses 1.0 electron per unit cell, J 1 increases from 4.19 to 9.73 meV, and the ordering temperature rises from 69 to 146 K. Charge transfer and partial density of states analysis are employed to reveal the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the magnetic phase transition and elevated magnetic ordering temperature. The prevalent surface effects of Cr 2 TiC 2 O 2 make it a promising candidate for applications in magnetic sensing, surface adsorbate detection, and signal control.},

The device exhibits a stochastic switching behavior by utilizing coupled degrees of freedom and dynamic oscillation induced by spin transfer torque in both free magnetic layers. The stochasticity can be effectively modulated by an external magnetic field and bias current. Furthermore, we exploit this stochastic behavior to emulate a sigmoid activation function, which we employ for handwritten digit recognition on the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.14%, comparable to that of conventional activation functions. Our work demonstrates a promising approach for constructing artificial stochastic neurons based on dual-free-layer MTJ, offering richer dynamic properties for neuromorphic computing applications.},

  abstract     = {Heat conduction between air molecules and solid interfaces is substantial for thermal management in nanoelectronics devices. Such a process, governed by collisions between air molecules and the surface, is ascribed to the thermal accommodation coefficient (TAC). However, quantifying the TAC in miniaturized devices remains a significant challenge due to the limitation of measuring at small scales. Here, we characterized the heat conduction between air molecules and few-layer MoS 2 at various temperatures using Raman spectroscopy, revealing several orders of magnitude higher values than bulk surfaces. The equivalent heat convection coefficient decreases from 9.35 × 10 4 to 7.09 × 10 4 W/m 2 K for temperatures ranging from 308 to 345 K. In addition, the TAC values are further determined based on the kinetic theory of air molecules, with the values decreasing from 0.88 to 0.71 as temperature increases. This is attributed to the increased kinetic energy mismatch between air molecules and the solid surface at higher temperatures. These findings deepen our understanding of heat conduction at the air–MoS 2 interface and provide valuable insights for advancing thermal management strategies in nanoscale electronic devices.},

By exploiting the resonant characteristics of graphene plasmons, we demonstrate that strong nonreciprocal radiation can be effectively regulated through adjusting the grating's geometric parameters, while maintaining robustness over a wide range. Notably, substantial dynamic tuning of the resonant wavelength for nonreciprocal radiation is achievable by modulating the Fermi level of graphene.

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), when combined with other physical mechanisms, enables flexible and intriguing manipulation of wave transport. Recent theoretical study demonstrates that a distinctive non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with real eigenvalues can be constructed, enabling the emergence of the selective skin effect. Here, we verify that the selective non-Hermitian skin effect can be induced by cooperative interaction between the skin effect and localization modes, characterized by a reinforced skin state in the zero mode. With delicately designed parameters, we further visualize the selective NHSE via full-wave simulations and experiments in acoustic ring lattices. Our results enrich the perspectives of non-Hermitian effects research and expand the avenues for wave manipulation, offering insights into potential acoustic device applications such as energy harvesting and sensing.},

Using the Callaway model, we analyzed the low-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of the microcrystal and demonstrated that phonon scattering at the sample boundaries is a major contributor to the thermal resistance in this topological material. Furthermore, our study reveals that the temperature dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity exhibits a double-peak structure, suggesting strong phonon–phonon or phonon–defect interactions in this material, characteristic of resonant scattering.

In this work, dilute MnBi 2 Te 4 -alloying is utilized to synergically optimize electrical- and thermal-transport properties of GeTe for thermoelectric performance improvement. It can not only decrease the precipitation of Ge to optimize carrier concentration, but also promote multi-band convergence to enlarge the density of state effective mass. Furthermore, the MnBi 2 Te 4 -alloyed samples also maintain a moderate carrier mobility. In addition, the increased point-defect scattering for phonons leads to the significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. Consequently, a high peak thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) of ∼1.8 at 723 K and a large average ZT of ∼1.0 from 300 to 723 K are achieved in 4% MnBi 2 Te 4 -alloyed GeTe, showing the potential of dilute compound alloying to enhance the thermoelectric performance of GeTe by the concurrent regulation of electrical- and thermal-transport properties.},

Furthermore, the sample was modeled as an RC circuit, and mobility was investigated by three different methods—Nyquist/Cole–Cole plot [−Im( Z ) vs Re( Z )], −Im( Z ) vs Frequency, and phase (Theta) vs Frequency. Then, the conduction mechanism was further investigated, and popular models of transport such as variable range hopping and fluctuation induced tunneling are not applicable. The ln(mobility) is found to be proportional to E − 1 / 4 and T 2 ⁠ , over a wide range of field E and temperature T.

  abstract     = {While HgCdTe remains the workhorse material for high-performance infrared (IR) detectors, there is still an ever-increasing demand for devices with lower costs and minimal defect densities. Epitaxial HgCdTe is typically grown on either low-cost Si substrates utilizing a CdTe virtual substrate with a large lattice mismatch or high-cost bulk CdZnTe substrates. Although high-quality CdTe epilayers can be successfully grown by molecular beam epitaxy on lattice-matched InSb (100) and (211)B substrates, InSb substrates are not used due to In out-diffusion and contamination concerns. This paper reports a comparison study of the different MBE processes of CdTe growth on InSb substrates. A compound CdTe cell and two individual elemental Cd and Te effusion cells were used under different growth conditions, Cd-rich vs Te-rich. CdTe epilayers grown on InSb under Cd-rich conditions using single elemental Cd and Te cells were shown to be of higher quality with significantly reduced In out-diffusion in regard to the standard CdTe growth process under Te-rich conditions using a compound CdTe cell and a Te cell. High-quality CdTe epilayers were achieved with a high-resolution x-ray diffraction FWHM linewidth of 35 arcsec and In concentrations below 10 15 cm −3 determined from secondary ion mass spectrometry. A heavy Cd soak of the InSb surface prior to growth initiation of the CdTe layer may also suppress the out-diffusion of In and the subsequent formation of the In–Te alloy. The increase in CdTe epilayer quality under Cd-rich conditions using elemental Cd and Te cells is found to be consistent for both (100) and (211) orientations.},

Under 405 nm light illumination, a maximum photocurrent density of 7.7 mA/cm 2 is observed, and the on/off ratio reaches 6.31 × 10 4 .

Moreover, under bias voltage, the transistor exhibits dynamic properties similar to the visual synapses including paired-pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, and long-term plasticity by light pulses. Under the 405 nm light irradiation, the power consumption per spike and the energy consumption are as low as 0.31 pW and 7.22 pJ, respectively.

However, this study reveals that microalloying can effectively suppress the formation of ultrastable states in Ce-based bulk metallic glasses. Over a decade of natural aging at room temperature, thermal relaxation was accompanied by the shrinkage of Ce-rich vacancy-sized open spaces driven by transient Ce diffusion. The addition of transition metals (Ni, Fe, and Co) strongly hindered this process because of their strong bonding with Ce atoms. Notably, Fe and Co atoms strongly suppressed the shrinkage of vacancy-sized open spaces by impeding Ce diffusion, preventing the glass from descending into an ultrastable state despite thermal relaxation observable.

The ion conductivity of this solid electrolyte is measured at 1.02 × 10 −3 s/cm at 30 °C, with an activation energy of 0.22 eV. The observed high ion conductivity and low activation energy are attributed to the Li-ion fast transport channels formed by the heterointerfaces between Li 3 ErCl 6 and AlCl 3 . This material exhibits high mechanical ductility and excellent compatibility with high-voltage cathode materials, rendering it highly suitable for the assembly of high-voltage solid-state lithium metal batteries. We believe that this solid electrolyte has potential for further improvement by improving the concentration of heterointerfaces, and this study offers valuable insights for the design of solid-state electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Transparent ferroelectric materials have been attracting enormous attention due to their simultaneously ultrahigh transparency and piezoelectricity, which are highly desirable for electro-optical-mechanical devices. However, it is very challenging to achieve excellent optical transparency in ferroelectric materials because of the severe light scattering of the domain wall. Here, a domain wall scattering model is developed to reveal the mechanism of light scattering caused by domain walls and to quantitatively calculate the scattering of light by different domain walls. The reliability of such a model is verified by the good agreement between theoretical predictions and recent experimental measurements. Based on the model, both domain wall type and orientation are found to greatly determine the transmittance of transparent ferroelectric crystals. The influence of domain size is also investigated. This work provides a theoretical basis for regulating the transmittance of transparent ferroelectric crystals through domain wall engineering.},

  abstract     = {Incident-angle-dependent wavefront manipulation, especially in transmission, is highly desired in the realm of electromagnetic waves. In this work, we demonstrate a unique type of angle-dependent multifunctional metasurfaces (ADMMs) that exhibit distinct wavefront control functionalities under illumination at different incident angles. The ADMMs are composed of two kinds of transmissive meta-atoms, which have identical transmission phases under normal incidence, but π -phase difference under the oblique incidence at 60 ° ⁠ . Such a distinguished transmission phase difference stems from the opposite angular dispersion properties of the two meta-atoms. By arranging these two kinds of meta-atoms randomly, the transmission wavefront can be efficiently diffused under oblique incidence. However, the transmission wavefront is invariant under normal incidence regardless of the arrangement of the meta-atoms. This functionality is verified by both numerical simulations and microwave experiments, which show strong agreement with each other. Our finding paves a road toward incident-angle-dependent wave-diffusing devices, which have potential applications in wireless communications and angular dispersive devices.},

In this study, we introduce a “butterfly” programmable dual-band metasurface, integrated with liquid crystals, designed for efficient terahertz beam steering. By applying bias voltages, the metasurface achieves a phase change of nearly 270° at two distinct frequencies, ∼400 and ∼700 GHz. Our experimental results demonstrate that the butterfly metasurface is compatible with both binary and ternary coding schemes at these frequencies, remarkably enhancing beam-steering performance and expanding spatial coverage. This advancement in dual-band metasurface technology marks a step forward in harnessing the full potential of the terahertz spectrum, opening another pathway for broadband terahertz communication and imaging applications.},

The SMR is formed by overlapping two conventional Mie resonators. By analyzing the complementary waveguide modes between the SMRs and free-space, an acoustic circuit with zero-spacing waveguide arrays is constructed. On this basis, effective control of the acoustic wave transmission path is achieved, leading to the design of acoustic circuits such as sharp bend, routing, and branching. Furthermore, by adding hard-boundary small spheres at the bends of the acoustic circuit, acoustic wave leakage is significantly reduced, and crosstalk between different channels is minimized.

Fano resonance appearing in multilayered nanoparticles (NPs) is particularly intriguing as its sharp and comb-like resonant line shape may enable optical identification at the nanoscale. We herein propose the concept of the optical physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the scattering responses of core–shell (plasmonic-dielectric) NPs. Specifically, the sharp, asymmetric spectral responses near the Fano resonance frequency, which are highly sensitive to perturbations (e.g., nanomanufacturing imperfections), can be exploited as a unique electromagnetic fingerprint for PUF-based identification and anti-counterfeiting applications. Here, we theoretically and statistically demonstrate that scattering from Fano-resonant multilayered NPs can be regarded as a perfect entropy source for the generation of PUF encryption keys, with outstanding performance in terms of uniqueness, randomness, encoding capacity, and NIST randomness test results. The proposed optical PUF opens pathways to implement nano-tags for optical identification, authentication, and anti-counterfeiting applications.},

It can be used in environmental monitoring, real-time industrial process controls, medical diagnosis/therapeutics, and other applications. In this work, we report significant advances in interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with the shortest emission wavelengths among InAs-based ICLs at room temperature (RT). Benefiting from the precise control of the growth parameters in molecular beam epitaxy, ICL structures were epitaxially grown on InAs substrates with high-quality that is validated by a low threshold current density of 1.9 A/cm 2 at 80 K. By minimizing the Urbach tail absorption loss in InAs with excellent material quality, broad-area (BA) devices emitting at 4.02 μ m in pulsed operation are demonstrated at 300 K with a threshold current density of 232 A/cm 2 , which is the lowest among the InAs-based ICLs. These BA devices were able to operate with a maximum voltage efficiency of 89% at temperatures up to 258 K in the continuous wave (cw) mode and to 378 K in the pulsed mode, indicating improved thermal dissipation and a sufficient temperature range for narrow ridge devices to achieve cw operation at RT and above.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising route for clean energy production, yet remains constrained by poor carrier utilization and low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the role of out-of-plane polarization in addressing these limitations by using 1H phase Cr-based Janus monolayers. The out-of-plane polarization optimizes band edges to match water redox potentials at pH = 0, and the out-of-plane piezoelectric electron redistribution via the Poisson effect extends photocatalytic activity to full pH levels. The Janus homojunction constructed from these monolayers inherits the optimized overpotential and naturally forms a type-II band alignment, and dipole-induced electric field further drives the segregated carriers to opposite sides participating in the respective half-reactions, facilitating exciton dissociation. Remarkably, out-of-plane polarization can break traditional bandgap lower limits of 1.23 eV, which enhances light absorption and boosts STH efficiency to 38.1% for the CrSSe homojunction at pH = 0 and 37% for the −2.5% CrSeTe homojunction in the pH range of 7–11. This work highlights the out-of-plane polarization as a powerful strategy to enhance photocatalytic water splitting performance, offering insight for designing high-efficiency photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {While metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) offer high efficiency and potential application in single junction and tandem solar cells, challenges remain in translating solution-based methods to commercial-scale production. Vapor transport deposition (VTD) offers advantages such as precise control over film composition and purity, as well as the possibility of achieving high thin film deposition rates for scale-up. In this work, a numerical model is developed to simulate the deposition process, analyzing the impact of parameters including source material temperature, carrier gas and dilution gas flow rates, and chamber pressure to optimize deposition rates and film uniformity. Geometrical parameters, such as throw distance, are also found to significantly affect rate and uniformity. The modeling results presented here offer valuable insight for improving the scalability of VTD for the processing of metal-halide perovskites.},

The polarization intensity of the films is enhanced by introducing multi-oriented B-site defect ion pairs and increasing local lattice distortion. The relaxor ferroelectric properties are improved by the interaction between defect ions pairs and weakly electronegative ions (Zr 4+ and Mg 2+ ions), which decouples domains and provides a restoring force for field-induced macrodomains. The BMTZ x O ( x = 0.05) film demonstrated superior energy storage performance under low-to-medium electric fields, achieving a recoverable energy storage density of 72.5 J/cm 3 with an efficiency of 70.0%.

Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a promising technique for high-resolution imaging and quantitative assessment of tissue elasticity. However, existing OCE methods often struggle to provide comprehensive viscoelastic measurements of the cornea under varying intraocular pressures (IOPs). In this study, we present a method based on elastic wave dispersion for measuring corneal viscoelasticity using a handheld OCE system integrating non-contact air-puff excitation and a compact probe design. The elastic wave dispersion method, validated through experiments on agar phantoms, enables precise quantification of both elastic and viscous properties of the cornea. The system's effectiveness was further demonstrated by measuring corneal viscoelasticity in ex vivo porcine corneas at different IOPs. Our results show that the elastic wave dispersion method, combined with the handheld OCE system, provides a flexible and effective approach for assessing corneal viscoelasticity, offering valuable insights into corneal biomechanics under clinically relevant conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred growing interest in developing innovative architectures for artificial synapses. Among these, nanowires have emerged as promising candidates for creating lightweight, flexible, and energy-efficient synapses. However, achieving in-plane aligned growth of nanowires on flexible substrates poses a substantial challenge for their integration into bendable synapses. This study introduces a room-temperature solution-phase graphoepitaxial growth technique that facilitates the in-plane aligned growth of nanowires along hydrophilic nanogrooves on flexible polyvinyl alcohol films. This scalable method obviates the need for complex vacuum systems and bypasses the constraints of traditional lattice-matching epitaxy by leveraging surface topography to guide nanowire alignment. Devices incorporating aligned tri-isopropylsilylethynyl pentacene nanowires exhibit a wavelength-sensitive photoresponse and mimic fundamental biological synaptic behaviors, including paired pulse facilitation and spike-number-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, these devices demonstrate exceptional bending stability, maintaining consistent synaptic response even after 2000 bends at a curvature radius of 0.4 cm. The approach's versatility is further highlighted by its applicability to the in-plane aligned growth of diverse organic nanowire arrays. By seamlessly integrating these aligned nanowires into devices without requiring post-growth transfer and assembly, this approach simplifies fabrication processes and improves device durability. This study underscores the transformative potential of solution-phase graphoepitaxial growth as a scalable and efficient strategy for advancing flexible and conformable nanowire-based devices and technologies.},

However, the excitation energy of 2.14 eV on insulating CaRuO 3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane x-ray diffraction on CaRuO 3 films and found a 24.8 Å periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d (004) . We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect.

Experimental results reveal distinct performance variations under different bending conditions. The strain-mediated magnetoelectric coefficient ( ⁠ α E 31 ⁠ ) exhibits a 29% enhancement under compressive stress due to improved mechanical strain transfer. However, in the tensile state, it marginally decreases due to depressed strain transfer. Using stress engineering, we achieve tunable and predictable strain-mediated α E 31 regulation, with strain serving as a key control parameter. Furthermore, the flexible ME device maintains exceptional mechanical stability, with less than 7% variation in α E 31 after 10 000 bending cycles.

In this study, by controlling nitrogen doping, we demonstrate a magnetic phase transition in Fe 3 Ga thin films, shifting from a ferromagnetic insulator Fe 3 Ga with cubic structure to a ferromagnetic metal Fe 3 GaN with anti-perovskite structure. This transformation is likely associated with the lattice expansion induced by nitrogen incorporation and the resulting changes in the electronic structure of Fe atoms, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. With increasing nitrogen content, the valence state of Fe gradually increases, and the formation of Fe-N bonds alters the electronic state structure of Fe ions, leading to changes in both the conductivity and magnetic properties of Fe 3 GaN film. These findings indicate that adjusting the level of nitridation during growth can effectively tune the magnetic and electric properties of Fe 3 Ga epitaxial films, providing approaches for their application in spintronics.},

The incorporation of Ti into heavy metal W leads to a significant reduction in spin pumping damping, particularly for Ti concentrations below 50%. Similarly, the THz emission peak amplitude decreases with increasing Ti concentration. Both effects are attributed primarily to the reduced spin current transmittance at the CoFe/Ti x W 1− x interface, caused by the substantially decreased electrical conductivity of the Ti x W 1− x layer. Interestingly, while spin pumping damping continues to decrease, the THz emission amplitude starts to increase at x = 63%, where the THz signal approaches zero due to the opposite spin Hall angles of W and Ti. This behavior underscores the distinct yet correlated mechanisms governing spin pumping damping and THz emission, reflecting their specific dependences on spin current reflection, propagation, dissipation, and spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnet/nonmagnetic metal bilayer systems. These findings enhance our understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and spin transport properties, offering valuable insights for advancing the development of miniaturized and high-speed spintronic devices.},

Understanding these unique properties is vital for future realization of electrically driven membrane lasers.

We first calculated the critical thickness and band edge emission wavelength of (110)-oriented InGaAs QWs and established a theoretical model for growth of telecom strained (110) QWs.

Finally, we obtained buried compressively strained and tensile-strained InGaAs/InP QWs, with central emission wavelengths at C and O bands.

The diodes demonstrated a forward current (I F ) of 11.2 A at 2 V and an impressive peak surge current of 58 A, with corresponding surge energy and power of 2.24 J and 553 W, respectively. Despite being 44% larger, our SBD exhibited a low reverse recovery time and negligible reverse loss, comparable to commercially available high-specification 30 A SiC diodes. Furthermore, even under stress at −1 kV for 10 3 s, V on shifted only slightly by 0.1 V, and ΔR on,sp increased by just 4.9%. The diode also demonstrated exceptional robustness at elevated temperatures, with an I F decrease in only 24% at 175 °C.

  abstract     = {We investigate how the ferroelectric domains of two single-crystal BaTiO 3 (BTO) substrates, oriented along [001] and [111], influence the Raman response of monolayer graphene at varying temperatures. A Raman band around 1445 cm −1 , close to the G mode and associated with BTO polarization, enables the simultaneous analysis of charge density in graphene and the organization of ferroelectric domains. Raman mapping reveals a periodic modulation in the frequency of graphene's 2D band, correlated with the BTO polarization-related Raman band for both substrate orientations. This effect is more pronounced for BTO (001), which exhibits strong out-of-plane polarization, whereas it is attenuated for BTO (111) due to polarization deviation. The interaction induces spatial charge variations and p–n junction formation in graphene on BTO (001) at room temperature. The periodic modulation effects vanish above the ferroelectric–paraelectric transition (430 K) for both substrates but reappear upon cooling only for graphene on BTO (111). Upon cooling, the BTO [001]-oriented substrate exhibits an emergent distribution of in-plane-oriented ferroelectric domains, eliminating its influence on the Raman mappings of graphene. This emergent distribution is confirmed by Raman mapping of different bands of the BTO [001] single crystal.},

Capacitance–voltage ( C – V ) measurements reveal that both fixed charge density ( N fix ) and the interface trap density ( D it ) in all AlO x N y samples are significantly lower than those in Al 2 O 3 samples.

Among various methods, projection-based ultrafast imaging methods have garnered significant attention due to their ability to acquire multiple frames in a single exposure. However, the reconstruction accuracy of these methods is fundamentally constrained by the limited number of projection directions and partial angular coverage. In this study, we introduce a spectral-temporal ultrafast imaging system based on the round-view projection (RVP), which enables comprehensive data acquisition through multiple quasi-omnidirectional projections, facilitating effective compression and reconstruction of spatiotemporal data cubes. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the RVP achieves superior reconstruction fidelity by capturing quasi-omnidirectional characteristic information. In the experimental works, we captured the dynamics of laser-induced air plasma, such as shockwave propagations and plasma expansion, with 22 frames in a single shot. This work not only presents a robust ultrafast imaging methodology but also provides valuable insight for advancing related ultrafast imaging research.},

However, current research primarily focuses on achieving this through optical pumping, due to the inadequate electrical and optical properties of low-dimensional semiconductors. Herein, a stable room-temperature whispering-gallery-mode microlaser diode driven by electricity is developed, integrating the grown indium-doped ZnO submicrometer-wire (ZnO:In SMW) as the gain medium. Under electrical pumping conditions, the diode enables lasing in the ultraviolet spectral region at ∼ 382.8 nm, accompanied by the effective suppression of spontaneous radiation. Specifically, capitalizing on the exceptional quality laser gain material and well-designed device architecture, it exhibits fascinating characteristics, including a high quality ( Q )-factor ( ⁠ ∼ 2552), a low-threshold current ( ⁠ ∼ 10.5 mA), and robust single-frequency lasing operation.

The influence of SF 6 purity on the resonance frequency, photoacoustic excitation intensity, and cantilever frequency response are theoretically derived, simulated, and experimentally verified. In the range of 80%–100%, there is a linear relationship between the resonance frequency and the SF 6 purity, with a response of 1.923 Hz/% and a minimum purity change detection limit of 0.02%.The FOPAS based on the designed T-type photoacoustic cell achieves a detection limit of 5 ppb for H 2 S, and the normalized noise equivalent absorption coefficient of the FOPAS reaches 4 × 10 −10 cm −1 Hz −1/2 W. Taking SF 6 purity of 97% as an example, the frequency response of FOPAS and the photoacoustic signal are evaluated both before and after correction. By correcting the resonance frequency and photoacoustic signal, the detection accuracy of H 2 S gas is improved by 9%.

  abstract     = {The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV − ) center in diamond has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing and quantum networks. To connect SnV − qubits in large networks, in situ tuning and stabilization of their optical transitions are essential to overcome static and dynamic frequency offsets induced by the local environment. Here, we report on the large-range optical frequency tuning of diamond SnV − centers using micro-electro-mechanically mediated strain control in photonic integrated waveguide devices. We realize a tuning range of >40 GHz, covering a major part of the inhomogeneous distribution. In addition, we employ real-time feedback on the strain environment to stabilize the resonance frequency and mitigate spectral wandering. These results provide a path for on-chip scaling of diamond SnV-based quantum networks.},

However, its limited lithium mobility restricts its practical application. In contrast, BN offers excellent thermal stability and lithium mobility but has poor conductivity. This study combines the strengths of both materials by constructing a C 3 N/BN heterostructure. Calculated results show the heterostructure exhibits excellent mechanical properties, with a Young's modulus of 632.0 N m −1 . Moreover, the adsorption energy of Li in the C 3 N/BN heterostructure (0.98 eV) is greatly enhanced compared to that in monolayer C 3 N (0.54 eV) and BN (0.03 eV), and the capacity can reach 1276.56 mA h g −1 . Due to the influence of BN, Li migration energy barrier is reduced to 0.26 eV, lower than that of monolayer C 3 N (0.34 eV). Besides, the heterostructure also shows favorable wettability in common electrolytes. These results highlight the C 3 N/BN heterostructure as a promising anode candidate for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.},

However, the optoelectronic properties of the device, namely, non-radiative processes such as impact ionization, are also highly temperature dependent. Thus, the optimum temperature for power generation in thermoradiative diodes is governed by the interplay between increasing current from larger temperature differentials and decreased voltage from increasing non-radiative processes. Here, we study the temperature-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE), dynamic resistance, and thermoradiative power generation from a range of commercially available HgCdTe and III-V diodes ranging from nominal bandgaps of 4–10.6 μ m. We conclude that for moderate temperatures and bandgaps, HgCdTe diodes deliver higher power densities than III-V diodes, but only III-V devices can operate at the elevated temperatures that may be required for some applications.},

This not only increases imaging complexity and sample exposure time but also affects imaging consistency. This paper proposes a simultaneous bright-field and dark-field imaging techniques based on the light-field matrix (LFM) model. Using a single light source under weak scattering conditions, the technique constructs a light-field matrix model and employs the optical field decomposition principle from transmission matrix (TM) theory to decompose the light field into three components: bright-field signals corresponding to single-scattered photons, dark-field signals corresponding to multiple-scattered photons, and noise signals. This method enables simultaneous acquisition of bright-field and dark-field images, simplifying the imaging process and reducing noise interference. Additionally, by incorporating low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition techniques, background light field interference is effectively eliminated, resulting in a 1.8-fold improvement in the dark-field imaging contrast. Experimental results demonstrate the broad applicability of this technique to various biological samples, validating its feasibility in the field of biological imaging and providing an innovative and practical solution for efficient and reliable imaging in complex scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive understanding of local contact potential profiles and carrier transport mechanisms in SiC MOSFETs is crucial for optimizing device design and performance. We report the evolution of local contact potential across the cross section of 1200 V SiC MOSFETs under applied external bias using Kelvin probe force microscopy. In the vertical direction of the cross section, notable features in the relative contact potential difference (RCPD) are identified at the interfaces of the P well and N − drift layer, as well as between the N − drift layer and the N + substrate. The RCPD drop-out values at the P well to N − drift layer interface increase from 0.17 to 1.54 V and then to 2.94 V as the external voltage is adjusted, with corresponding values of 2.43 and 3.86 V observed at V GS = V DS of 2 and 4 V, respectively. Conversely, the RCPD drop values at the N − drift layer to N + substrate interface fluctuate between −0.38 and 0.74 V. In the horizontal direction of the cross section, as V GS = V DS increases from 0 to 4 V, the RCPD drop-out values change from 0.14 to 1.33 V, and ultimately reach 2.41 V. These variations are indicative of enhanced energy band bending at the P–N junction due to charge injection, revealing key insights into the electric field distribution within the device. This study elucidates the local contact potential profile evolution in SiC MOSFETs and highlights intrinsic electrical properties essential for advancing SiC-based power devices.},

Graphene, as a p -type material, enhances carrier mobility and reduces recombination, while leveraging the wide bandgap properties of i-GaN and n-GaN for efficient UV absorption. The experimental results show that the graphene/i-GaN/n-GaN photodetector achieves a maximum photoresponsivity of 20.6 A/W, detectivity of 2.0 × 10 12 cm·Hz 1/2 ·W −1 , and external quantum efficiency of 75.25%, indicating efficient light-to-current conversion performance. The integration of graphene in the p-i-n structure significantly reduces the dark current to 2.68 × 10 −13 A, improving both the transient response and the overall efficiency of the device. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the graphene/i-GaN/n-GaN structure in improving UV photodetection performance.

By exploiting the negative thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) of the TiO 2 to counterbalance the positive TOC of Si, the temperature sensitivity of the reference ring was greatly reduced to 4.53 pm/K, while the sensing ring is 75.06 pm/K. As a result, the sensitivity of the CMRR is 70.53 pm/K utilizing the differential sensing method. It is of particular significance that this sensing scheme mitigates the impact of external noises such as laser fluctuations and self-heating noises, enabling the development of a highly stable on-chip temperature sensing device. By immersing the sensor in the triple point of water system with ultra-high stability, the device performs a temperature fluctuation of 15.88 mK, which is an improvement of more than an order of magnitude over microring resonator temperature sensors. Further analysis indicates that the noise derived from the self-heating effects of the device is about 13.76 mK, which represents the primary noise source in CMRR stability.

Our first-principles calculations reveal that monolayer ferromagnetic NiSbO 3 is energetically favored and the Curie temperature is about 291 K. The half-filled state of degenerate d xz / d yz orbitals for the spin-up channel provide a linearly crossing point at the Fermi level, which can be gapped by the spin orbital coupling. Remarkably, the obtained Chern number C is as high as 3. QAHE of C = 6 is obtained in the bilayer, benefiting from interlayer ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, an electric field is applied along the z direction, the easy magnetization axis changes from in-plane to out-of-plane direction. At the same time, the bandgap increases with the electric field, which facilitates the experimental observation of QAHE.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the evidential results of the negative linear temperature coefficient mechanism commonly observed in defect-containing nanocarbon materials. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were annealed at high temperatures ranging from 1200 to 3000 °C. These samples exhibited a general hopping conduction-like behavior between the CNTs in the pristine state. However, the high-temperature annealed samples exhibited a resistance change with a negative temperature coefficient. Recently, we proposed that the origin of this negative linear temperature dependence of resistance behavior is a scattering phenomenon due to Friedel oscillations occurring in a flat graphene sheet containing defects. In fact, from the cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images, we found that the tube structure of the CNTs collapsed and fused with each other in the high-temperature annealed samples, revealing a stacked, flat graphite structure. These results show that the Friedel scattering phenomenon originates from the negative linear temperature coefficient widely observed in defect-containing nanocarbon materials. This negative linear temperature coefficient provides important information on the application of nanocarbon materials to thermistors, which have recently attracted significant attention, and on the optimal design guidelines for such thermistors. Moreover, the nonzero current and nondivergent resistance behavior based on the Friedel scattering phenomenon provide more stable measurement conditions for the quantum research field, including quantum computing, cryptography, and communications.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional (2D) complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor circuits require balanced performance between p-type and n-type devices, but currently, among two-dimensional semiconductor materials, the electrical performance of p-type WSe 2 is significantly inferior to that of n-type MoS 2 . This performance bottleneck is primarily attributed to issues with the growth quality of WSe 2 , interfacial defects, and the influence of charged impurities, which collectively limit the application of WSe 2 in low-power integrated circuits. To address this challenge, we report that the monolayer (1L), bilayer (2L), and trilayer (3L) WSe 2 single crystals can be selectively grown on high-κ SiN x /Si substrate by precisely adjusting the carrier gas direction over time in a reverse-flow chemical vapor deposition system. Using this growth method, Raman/photoluminescence spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and selected-area electron diffraction confirm that the as-grown 1–3L WSe 2 nanosheets are single-crystalline with excellent quality. By employing Pt metallization process to construct optimized metal–semiconductor contacts, the fabricated mono-to bilayer WSe 2 transistors exhibit pronounced p-type characteristics with superior performance. In particular, the 1L WSe 2 transistors with a channel length of 2 μ m display a record-breaking on-state current of ∼500 μ A/ μ m at room temperature. This controllable synthesis strategy demonstrates potential for advancing WSe 2 -based p-type electronics in microelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-two-dimensional (2D) tin-based perovskites are promising photoelectric materials due to their non-toxicity and excellent photoelectric properties. However, the addition of organic ligands leads to an increase in bandgap, which is unfavorable for the application of perovskites in the field of photovoltaics. The bandgap of the two-dimensional tin-based perovskite (BA) 2 (FA)Sn 2 I 7 is reduced to the Shockley–Queisser limit through the application of pressure. Also, the bandgap of (BA) 2 (FA)Sn 2 I 7 decreases by 0.108 eV/GPa within a pressure range of 0.0–4.0 GPa, reaching a value of 1.34 eV at 4.0 GPa, which corresponds to the Shockley–Queisser limit. With further increases in pressure above 4.0 GPa, the bandgap starts to increase and then re-decreases above 15.0 GPa. When released to ambient pressure, the reduced bandgap is still partially preserved due to structural recrystallization. Further analysis indicated that the continuous narrowing of the bandgap within 0.0–4.0 GPa is mainly due to the layer-to-layer compression before the interlayer compression in the sample, which increases the deformation pressure of the [SnI 6 ] 4− octahedra. In addition, high-pressure in situ electrical tests show that (BA) 2 (FA)Sn 2 I 7 exhibits optical response under laser irradiation at 405, 450, 980, and 1532 nm and extends the optical response range to the near-infrared region. In summary, the bandgap of 2D perovskite was reduced by applying pressure, which opened up a potential way to design materials with improved properties.},

  abstract     = {ZnO-based thin films unfold unique potentials for compact and ultrafast electro-optic (EO) modulation with low power consumption, because they show a strong Pockels effect, low loss of light propagation, and moderate permittivity. This work clarifies the distinct roles of Mg and Li incorporation in affecting the effective Pockels EO coefficients ( r c ) of wurtzite ZnO thin films by deeply analyzing the lattice distortion and charge density distributions. Mg incorporation significantly enhances internal parameter u and reduces the anion–cation bond lengths along the c -axis direction. This facilitates Zn displacement along the c -axis direction and increases electric susceptibility, enhancing the ionic contribution to r c . Li incorporation produces slight lattice expansion and increases anion–cation bond lengths along the c -axis direction. First-principle calculations show that Li interstitials in oxygen octahedron markedly change the charge density around the nearest-neighbor O. With the evidence of enhancing the second-order nonlinear susceptibility under the optical frequency electrical field, Li incorporation improves r c by enhancing electronic contribution. The Li incorporated Zn 0.7 Mg 0.3 O thin film, with a thickness of 400 nm and an optical bandgap of 3.99 eV, exhibits a r c of 2.85 ± 0.01 pm/V. These findings uncover the great potential of widegap ZnMgO:Li thin films for electro-optic modulation in ultraviolet band.},

With their typical energy level separation frequency being several GHz, cooling these quantum devices to the ground state requires temperatures below 100 mK. Pushing the operation frequency of superconducting qubits up may allow for operation of superconducting qubits at 1 K and even higher temperatures. Here, we present measurements of the switching currents of niobium/aluminum–aluminum oxide/niobium Josephson junctions in the presence of millimeter-wave radiation at frequencies above 100 GHz. The observed switching current distributions display clear double-peak structures, which result from the resonant escape of the Josephson phase from a stationary state. We show that the data can be well explained by the strong-driving model including the irradiation-induced suppression of the potential barrier. While still being measured in the quasi-classical regime, our results point toward a feasibility of operating phase qubits around 100 GHz.},

Here, we develop a nitrogen-doping strategy to enhance the superconductivity of ultrathin amorphous superconductors for single-photon detection. The interstitial N dopants induce the amorphization of W, resulting in an enhanced superconducting transition temperature of 4.4 K from 0.01 K (α-W). Furthermore, the surface nitroxide passivation layer ensures smooth and homogeneous topography at the wafer scale and provides strong chemical stability for nanodevice fabrication in a 6.0-nm-thick nitrogen-doped amorphous tungsten (NAW) film. Consequently, we achieve NAW-based infrared SNSPDs with saturated quantum efficiency at an operation temperature of >1 K. This doping strategy can be applied to more elemental superconductors and, thus, promote their practical use in electronic devices.},

In this study, we revisit the ferromagnetic MnB alloy, which exhibits a significant axial negative thermal expansion (NTE) during its magnetic transition. By employing isostructural alloying, the Co-doped Mn 1- x Co x B retains the orthorhombic structure, while the NTE gradually weakens, leading to the single-phase ZTE along longitudinal direction with a linear thermal expansion coefficient of −3.9 × 10 −7 K −1 for the Mn 0.6 Co 0.4 B composition. Additionally, the alloy demonstrates an ultrawide ZTE of 8.1 × 10 −7 K −1 along the transverse direction. Direct experimental evidence indicates that the weakening of magnetoelastic coupling and microscopic lattice orientation contribute to the formation of this unique anisotropic ZTE. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation shows that when introducing Co atom, the weak Co–Co interaction and decrease in Mn–Co interaction simultaneously bring about a decrease in the Curie temperature and the correlated working temperature range for thermal expansion.},

Phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their dynamic and thermal stabilities. All TiXY 3 monolayers exhibit ferromagnetic ground states and possess magnetic easy axes along the out-of-plane direction, with the TiGaSe 3 monolayer achieving an magnetic anisotropy energy of 1.574 meV. Notably, these materials have strong magnetic coupling, which is calculated by the first-principles linear response method. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the Curie temperatures ( T C ) of these monolayers are close to or significantly exceed room temperature.

We then apply our approach to magnetotransport measurements of Mn 5 Si 3 thin films, which undergo a transition from non-collinear to an altermagnetic collinear state.

Here, we focus on a two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSX (X = F, Cl, Br, I) to investigate its magnetocaloric properties and thermal transport properties along with the underlying physical mechanisms. It is found that CrSX intrinsically possesses a substantial isothermal entropy change ( ⁠ − Δ S mag max ⁠ ) of 12.3 μ J m −2 K −1 and adiabatic temperature change ( ⁠ Δ T a d max ⁠ ) of 2.3 K during magnetic phase transition. Surprisingly, it exhibits remarkably high thermal conductivity of up to 54.47 W/mK that is attributed to the extended phonon lifetime. Additionally, tensile strain effectively modulates the Curie temperature and refrigerant capacity, with tensile strain weakening direct antiferromagnetic coupling, thus enhancing ferromagnetism. Hole doping efficiently adjusts the magnetic exchange interaction, which enhances the Curie temperature of CrSI to room temperature (305 K) while maintaining a high refrigerant capacity of 180 J/mol under a magnetic field, ascribing to the reduced energy gap between e g orbitals of transition metal cations and p orbitals of nonmagnetic anions. The present work provides insights for understanding the relation between magnetic exchange interactions, thermal transport, and refrigerant performance, offering guidance for designing two-dimensional magnets for magnetocaloric applications.},

The antiferromagnetic CoO layer at the Co/CuO x interface modulated by the gate voltage provides an exchange bias field, enabling field-free current-driven magnetization switching. The field-free switching ratio can be effectively enhanced by applying a negative gate voltage, with the maximum value being 62.7%, which is five times larger than that in the initial state without applying gate voltage. The electric-field driven migration of oxygen ions, causing enhanced/reduced oxidation at the Co/CuO x interface, leads to the reversible tunability of the field-free perpendicular magnetization switching. These results offer an approach to effectively control perpendicular magnetization switching without the need for a magnetic field, holding significant implications for low-power spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Vertical diodes are produced via the nitridation of (-201) β-Ga 2 O 3 and subsequent GaN epitaxy via PAMBE. For undoped films, the mosaic block model parameters are extracted via XRD and used to calculate dislocation densities, where optimization of the nitridation and growth enabled two orders of magnitude reduction in screw dislocation density. These results validate a model relating screw dislocation formation to initial edge dislocation densities. The dislocation densities are compared to device parameters extracted from vertical Schottky barrier diodes on the same samples. The current on/off ratio, ideality, and Schottky barrier height are found to depend on screw dislocation density, edge dislocation density, and surface roughness, respectively. The Mg-dopant activation energy was measured to be 160 meV. Diode on/off ratios range between 10 4 and 10 5 with a differential specific on-resistance of 2.4 m Ω cm 2 and a forward current density >1 kA/cm 2 measured prior to reaching compliance. Temperature dependent I–V measurements are conducted to investigate reverse-bias leakage current, and variable-range hopping is identified as the transport mechanism. The hopping conduction follows a 3D mode at moderate temperatures, but above 100 °C transitions to a 1D mode.},

  abstract     = {Polytype control has long been a critical issue in silicon carbide single crystal growth. Empirically, the competition among different polytypes can be manipulated through temperature, carbon-to-silicon ratio, doping control, etc. However, the underlying physics remains largely elusive. Herein, we reveal that entropy difference, particularly that of the vibrational entropy and configurational entropy, is the thermodynamic origin of these polytype regulation methods. The bulk vibrational entropy difference suppresses the 3C–SiC and favors hexagonal polytypes at a higher temperature. Furthermore, the defect vibrational and configurational entropy difference arising from inequivalent carbon sites further stabilizes n-type 6H–SiC over 4H–SiC in the presence of carbon vacancies and nitrogen substitutions at elevated temperatures. These defects are reduced with high carbon chemical potentials, explaining the preference of 4H–SiC at high C/Si ratios. These entropy analyses suggest that a moderate temperature and C-rich condition are beneficial to the growth of 4H–SiC and provide physical perspectives into the thermodynamic role of phonons and defects in single crystal growth.},

However, the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition for high-quality AlN growth typically requires elevated temperatures. To achieve low-temperature AlN growth, we have developed a method to realize a kind of “self-sustaining step-flow growth” by exploiting the inherent controllability of Al adatoms, benefiting from their limited diffusion capability. A comparative study at a growth temperature of 1050 °C demonstrates that this method helps sustain stable step-flow growth, yielding 3 μ m high-quality Si-doped AlN with a conductivity of 56.1 kΩ −1 cm −1 . The growth temperature can be further reduced to 980 °C, the record-low growth temperature, and the corresponding conductivity is 115 kΩ −1 cm −1 . This advancement offers critical insights into the AlN surface kinetics under doping and paves the way for industrial AlN applications as a semiconductor.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the interaction between perovskites and organic molecules is crucial for optimizing hybrid materials in advanced optoelectronic applications, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic devices. In this study, density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses were employed to investigate the interfacial interactions between perovskites and a series of organic molecules, including 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP), bis(2-methyldibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline)(acetylacetonate) iridium(III) (Ir(MDQ) 2 acac), bis(1-phenylisoquinoline)(acetylacetonate)iridium(III) (Ir(piq) 2 acac), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidin-4-yl-vinyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB), and 2-[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]-10,10-dioxide-9H-thioxanthen-9-one (TXO-TPA). Although considerable binding energies exist between the perovskite and all the organic molecules, the experimental results reveal that not all passivated devices exhibit improved performance. This suggests that other factors, beyond binding energy, play a significant role in determining device performance. Theoretical calculations reveal charge transfer from the perovskite to all the organic molecules exists at the ground state of the perovskite, while experimental tests reveal that charge transfer from the perovskite to organic molecules only occurs in the condition of favored energy level alignment. The exciton lifetime and the photoluminescence intensity of the perovskite are reduced by the organic molecules except CBP, deriving from the charge transfer induced exciton quenching of the perovskite. Moreover, no evident energy transfer from perovskite to organic molecules is observed, despite the obvious spectra overlap between the perovskite emission and the absorption of the organic molecule. This study provides critical insights into the diverse interaction mechanisms between perovskite and organic molecules, highlighting the pivotal role of charge transfer in determining carrier dynamics and luminescence behaviors, while also emphasizing the complexity of factors influencing device performance.},

However, achieving precise shape control during the growth of the low-symmetry 1T′ phase of WTe 2 remains a significant challenge. In this work, we investigate the physical mechanism driving shape evolution in WTe 2 during chemical vapor deposition growth. By utilizing a double-temperature zone to create a W concentration gradient, we observe a systematic evolution of shapes from irregular flakes to ribbons, triangles, hexagons, and snowflakes. This shape evolution is driven by temperature- and concentration-induced growth dynamics, where local concentration gradients and anisotropic growth behavior play a key role in the formation of distinct morphologies. Our experimental observations and density functional theory calculations show that increasing the Te:W ratio enhances the material's thermodynamic stability, with hexagonal flakes exhibiting greater stability than triangular ones. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of shape evolution in low-symmetry 2D materials with controlled morphology, enabling future applications in quantum devices.},

  abstract     = {Here, we propose an etchless bismuth iron garnet layer assisted by a one-dimensional resonant grating waveguide to enhance transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) via the excitation of a quasi-bound state in the continuum. The TMOKE amplitude can be tailored by manipulating the perturbation parameter, and it can reach as high as 1.978, approaching the theoretical maximum value of 2. Additionally, a single-mode temporal coupled-mode theory is employed to further reveal the underlying physical mechanism. It is found that the TMOKE is strongly related to the linewidth of the quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance and local field enhancement, which are pivotal factors in the design and optimization of photonic devices. Our work provides a simple and efficient approach for enhancing TMOKE based on an easy-to-fabricate platform, laying the groundwork for exploring and developing magneto-optical devices such as sensors, magnetic storage devices, and nonreciprocal photonic devices.},

To shed mechanistic insight into their electronic properties and stabilities, we present the first ab initio molecular dynamics study and quantum mechanical analysis of these near-surface NV center configurations. Our ab initio calculations predict that NV centers near the 111 surface are more energetically stable than defects located deeper in the diamond structure. Moreover, our ab initio molecular dynamics calculations indicate that these near-surface NV centers are stable at temperatures as high as 1000 °C. Our results are complemented by Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population analyses and calculations of other low-lying electronic-excited states to quantify the electronic properties and stabilities of these structures that could form the materials used in next-generation quantum sensors.},

  abstract     = {The van der Waals (vdW) integration of two-dimensional (2D) metal and semiconductor materials holds great potential for realizing Ohmic contacts in electronic and optoelectronic devices, owing to the weak Fermi pinning effect resulting from their dangling-bond-free interface. However, the vdW gap leads to an additional tunneling barrier at the interface. The common tunneling barrier-lowering strategies by constructing interfacial covalent bonds may cause the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby impacting the optoelectronic devices performance. Herein, inspired by 2D MSi 2 N 4 (M = Cr, Hf, Mo, Ti, V, and Zr) semiconductors with band edge states being protected by the outlying Si–N sublayer, we construct semimetal/MSi 2 N 4 heterostructure by decorating the surface of MSi 2 N 4 with transition metal single-atoms to form covalent bonds with semimetal. The tunneling barrier is notably reduced, and the corresponding probability can reach up to 23.74%, higher than the 4.19% observed in vdW-type contacts. Meanwhile, for optoelectronic applications, benefitting from the protection of the outlying Si–N sublayer to the MSi 2 N 4 's band edge states, the photogenerated holes can migrate from MSi 2 N 4 to the interfacial channel on a femtosecond timescale, which not only facilitates the trapping of electrons by the electrodes but also observably prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated carriers from 0.99 to 3.74 ns. Our work provides an effective way to advance the high-efficient 2D electronic and photoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Detection of light ellipticity is of crucial importance for target imaging and recognition in complex scenarios. However, it has been challenging to achieve one-shot detection of light ellipticity by a single conventional optoelectronic device, due to coupling between light intensity and polarization. Here, we realize one-shot detection of light ellipticity by using a single four-terminal valley Hall device based on monolayer MoS 2 quantum material. The device can decouple the light intensity and the elliptical polarization and enable simultaneous detection of the light intensity and the elliptical polarization by using photoconduction and valley Hall effects. We show that the light ellipticity can be directly detected by measuring the Hall resistance of the device, which is defined as the ratio between the Hall voltage and the photocurrent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed approach can be used for detecting microplastics present in soil at a higher recognition precision than conventional approaches. Our work highlights the potential of exploiting unique properties of 2D quantum materials for multi-dimensional perception of optical information.},

At such high-repetition rates, the inter-pulse time lies below the time required for the total diffusion of the deposited heat by each laser pulse, leading to cumulative hydrodynamic effects. Here, we present experimental time-resolved measurements of these dynamics in air for laser repetition rates between 1 and 100 kHz. We measure the change in the air refractive index caused by the localized heat deposition and the length of the filament-generated plasma channel, with which we can infer the corresponding change in air density. We observe that at repetition rates above 10 kHz, stationary density depletions with vanishing dynamics emerge. Our findings are of wide relevance for the fields of high-repetition-rate laser filamentation and its applications as well as THz generation from laser-induced plasma sources.},

Micro-photocurrent spectra of THz-QCL devices with cavity lengths of 0.5 and 1 mm are measured at various bias voltages. The results demonstrate that the peak of the photocurrent spectrum exhibits a linear shift with the bias voltage below 10 V, while presenting a sharp redshift as the voltage increases further. Additionally, micro-photocurrent spectra are investigated at multiple locations on the device facet. Further analysis of the temperature effect and quantum confinement Stark effect on the bandgap change reveals the temperature distributions of the THz-QCL. It indicates that at 15 V, the temperature gradient of the active region along the material growth direction is approximately 0.4 K/μm. The proposed method, based on photocurrent spectroscopy, achieves about 3 K resolution for temperature measurement of THz-QCL, facilitating the optimization of device thermal management and failure analysis.},

In narrow-ridge 200 μ m long lasers, pure GS lasing occurs up to a pumping current density that exceeds the threshold value by 17.5 times. A decrease in the optical confinement factor results in lasing via an excited state (ES) at a high pumping current. In the current range corresponding to the GS lasing, the devices operate in the transverse fundamental optical mode, whereas above the ES lasing threshold, they operate in the second order mode.

By adjusting the number or reversing the direction of magnetic rods in the microswimmer, the way to increase the motion velocity is found. When the magnetic field frequency is less than the out-of-step frequency (the maximum frequency at which the model follows the magnetic field changes without hysteresis), increasing the frequency boosts the motion velocity. The out-of-step frequency is increased by adding the number of magnetic rods, whereas it is decreased by reversing the polarity of magnetic rods.

  abstract     = {Recent research into solid-state qubits for quantum information science has focused on optically addressable spin defects such as the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and the neutrally charged divacancy (VV) in 4H-SiC as scalable quantum sensors and networking qubits. Within this context, direct investigations of the structural origin and defect formation dynamics of a sub-set of the VV center in 4H-SiC remain lacking. Here, we take a systematic experimental approach guided by predictions from first-principles simulations to gain a thorough mechanistic understanding of the VV defect formation and control in 4H-SiC. We study the effect of annealing time and temperature on VV formation in high-purity semi-insulating 4H-SiC samples following electron irradiation. Three different temperatures (1123, 1273, and 1473 K) and annealing duration (from 0.5 to 72 h) are chosen to explore VV formation in different regions. We find that samples annealed at 1273 K give the highest VV-related photoluminescence (PL) intensities, in agreement with the prediction from first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the logarithmic dependence of VV-related PL intensities on the annealing duration at 1273 K indicates that 1273 K provides sufficient thermal energy for silicon vacancy migration but not for VV migration. Together, these results suggest that efficient VV formation occurs above the V Si migration temperature and below the VV migration threshold.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted considerable attention for carrier-selective passivation contacts in crystalline silicon (c-Si) heterojunction solar cells. Among them, zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2 ) exhibits outstanding advantages, such as high permittivity, the presence of fixed negative charges, and high thermal stability. However, it is usually considered incapable of being used as passivation contacts due to its ultra-wide (5.8 eV) bandgap and mismatched energy band structure. In this work, we have demonstrated that ZrO 2 films act as hole-selective layers by elaborately regulating oxygen vacancies ( V O ). ZrO 2 films (∼9 nm) prepared by the solution method provide a high surface passivation of p-Si with an effective carrier lifetime of 302 μs. The Al 3+ doping not only increases the V O concentrations in the films but also changes the ratio of different categories of V O defects, significantly improving the hole transport properties, with the contact resistivity reduced from 246 to 52 mΩ·cm 2 . The p-Si/ZrO 2 :Al 3+ /Ag structured solar cell reaches a high conversion efficiency of 19.5%. This work shows that ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor materials have great potential as passivation contact layers by modulating the trap defects.},

The CL-PWEH was characterized by piezoelectric vibrators independent of the main vibration beam, Clivia-leaf-style vibrators, and rigid-flexible contact plucking. The feasibility of the proposed CL-PWEH was demonstrated through the theoretical analysis, fabrication, and wind speed responses experiments. The results showed that the length and thickness of flexible sheets had a strong influence on wind-induced vibration mode, output voltage, effective bandwidth, and cut-in wind speed. The output voltage was enhanced with the rising thickness ratio, and the bandwidth was decreased with the increase in the length ratio. In addition, the maximum output power of 5.82 mW was achieved for the CL-PWEH at α = 1.3, β = 4.5 at the optimum load resistance of 300 kΩ. Meanwhile, the application as a power supply illustrated that the CL-PWEH prototype could light up 200 blue LEDs in series.},

  abstract     = {The primary challenge currently faced by bio-inspired polarized optical compasses lies in their poor environmental adaptability, resulting in low heading angle accuracy under complex weather conditions, such as cloudy and overcast days as well as when obscured by buildings. To enhance environmental adaptability, this paper first theoretically analyzes the impact of major atmospheric interference factors on polarization patterns. An analytical model is established to investigate the influence of multiple scattering on polarization patterns, and simulation data are used to verify the reliability of this model. Based on this model, the causes of errors in existing polarized compasses are analyzed. We propose an iterative symmetric segmentation image processing method that can effectively avoid the aforementioned errors while achieving high-speed computation. Experiments conducted under six different weather conditions, including cloudy days, cirrus, stratus, and building obscuration, demonstrate the high environmental adaptability of the proposed algorithm. The mean error of the heading angle is reduced from 11.7° to 1.4°. Furthermore, compared to more complex algorithms, this algorithm exhibits faster iterative convergence, enabling high-frequency navigation.},

In this study, a homologous series of 1-alcohols is systematically investigated, quantitatively comparing the measured signals obtained using pentapeptide-coated gas sensors and pentapeptide–gas interactions calculated via molecular docking simulations. The pentapeptide-coated gas sensor exhibits a clear odd–even effect in both absorption and desorption processes, demonstrating better discrimination between odd- and even-numbered carbon compounds. The results indicate that the odd–even effect during the absorption process is closely associated with the hydrophobic interaction between a pentapeptide and a gas molecule, while the interactions affecting the desorption phase may vary depending on the pentapeptide properties. The insights into the molecular interactions involved in the odd–even effect will facilitate the development of materials for detecting odd chain metabolites, which can enhance the accuracy of gas-sensing technologies toward health monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-voltage GaN-on-Si power devices is hindered by vertical breakdown of buffer layer. Implementing a floating substrate configuration could improve vertical breakdown voltage. Despite this advantage, devices with a floating substrate exhibit severe dynamic R ON degradation due to the back-gating effect and the consequent severe buffer trapping. In this work, a 900-V GaN-on-Si power device is demonstrated on floating Si substrate using active passivation p-GaN gate HEMT technology (AP-HEMT). As the active passivation is connected to gate, the AP-HEMT facilitates effective hole injection in both p-GaN gate and active passivation, thereby significantly suppressing negative buffer trapping. Additionally, the injected holes contribute to light emission, as evidenced by CCD camera that detect photon generation, which effectively pumps electrons out from buffer traps. Consequently, the AP-HEMT shows a superior dynamic R ON /static R ON ratio of 1.42 after a drain stress of 900 V with a floating substrate. To investigate the effectiveness of hole injection/light pumping effects, positive back-gating sweep is employed to induce buffer trapping to mimic the floating substrate effects. For conventional p-GaN gate HEMT, the drain current is significantly reduced after positive substrate stress. In contrast, for the AP-HEMT with sufficient hole injection ( V GS = 3.5 V), the device presents no drain current reduction. These results prove that the active passivation technology improves stability against floating substrate-induced dynamic degradation, which is advantageous for development of high-voltage GaN-on-Si power devices.},

This study aims to determine whether these defects are the main cause of device breakdown/failure. Laser confocal and scanning electron microscopy techniques were employed to image original defects in the material and the locations of damage induced upon electrical breakdown at 3.8 kV in the devices. Our analysis shows no clear correlation between the defect locations and the breakdown sites. Failure/cracking along the [010] direction appears to be a consequence of thermo-mechanical failure along the (100) cleavage planes due to arcing-induced damage and the instantaneous heat generated during breakdown, rather than the original plate-like nanopipes, at least for the majority of cases observed.},

A higher Q-factor typically translates to narrower resonance peaks, leading to improved sensitivity in sensing applications. Frequency stability, on the contrary, refers to the ability of a resonator to maintain its operating frequency over time and under varying environmental conditions. We explore in this study the feasibility of improving the linewidth and the frequency stability of a microcantilever resonator through resonant excitation. We discover that parametric excitation enables mode coupling between its first torsional mode, f t ⁠ , and the second flexural mode, f 2 , and generates two resolved sidebands. The sidebands exhibit narrow linewidths and improved frequency stability over the two original modes, with tunable frequency capacity that can be achieved by adjusting the excitation voltage.

In this study, we present two stable room-temperature ferromagnetic carbides, namely, M C ( M = Cr, Mn) monolayers, with T c values of 384 and 391 K, respectively, along with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Furthermore, Cr x Mn 8− x C 8 ( ⁠ x = 1 – 7 ⁠ ) alloy monolayers are constructed. We demonstrate that the appropriate incorporation of Cr–Mn atomic pairs substantially enhances the ferromagnetic coupling, which is intimately associated with the interactions between metal atoms and their spatial arrangements within the lattice. In particular, the CrMnC 2 alloy monolayer exhibits a T c of 627 K, markedly exceeding that of the parent monolayer. This elevated T c is attributed to the combined effect of the crystal-field energy difference introduced by the alloying process and the internal stresses arising from the lattice distortion induced by alloying, which jointly enhance ferromagnetic interactions. In addition, CrMnC 2 exhibits robust PMA, in-plane magnetic anisotropy induced by structural asymmetry, and slight ferroelastic behavior. These findings offer insights on the impact of alloy engineering on 2D ferromagnetism and highlight a pathway toward high- T c 2D ferromagnetic materials for practical room-temperature device applications.},

  abstract     = {Twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) has emerged as an ideal model system for investigating novel strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, the experimental construction of tFLG with high structural stability is still challenging. Here, we introduce a highly accessible method for fabricating robust tFLG by polymer micro-tip manipulated origami. Through using a self-prepared polymer micro-tip—which is composed of multiple dimethylpolysiloxane, poly(vinyl chloride), and graphite sheets—to fold graphene layers, we fabricated tFLG with different twist angles (0°–30°) and various layers, including twisted bilayers (1 + 1), twisted double-bilayers (2 + 2), twisted double-trilayers (3 + 3), and thicker layers. Even ABC -stacked tFLG were created, such as twisted ABC/ABC and ABC/ABA graphene coexisting in an ABC - ABA domain wall region. We found that the origami-fabricated tFLG exhibits high stability against thermal and mechanical perturbations including heating and transferring, which could be attributed to its special folding and tearing structures. Moreover, based on the rich types of samples, we revealed twist-angle- and stacking-order-dependent Raman characteristics of tFLG, which are valuable for understanding stacking-modulated phonon spectroscopy. Our experiments provide a simple and efficient approach to construct structurally robust tFLG, paving the way for the study of highly stable twisted van der Waals heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'Z x Z' (4− x ) family derived from two-dimensional MA 2 Z 4 (M = Mg, Ga, Sr; A = Al, Ga; Z = S, Se, Te) monolayers and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin-splitting bands contributed by Se/Te- p z orbitals at conduction band minimum, and the magnitude of the Rashba constant correlates strongly with both the intrinsic electric field and the strength of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'Z x Z' (4− x ) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs, leading to a reopening of the bandgap with nontrivial topological phases. In conjunction with band inversion, p z orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution from topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides significant insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion-asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Strain engineering is a promising strategy for tailoring the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Despite the challenge of interlayer cleavage due to weak van der Waals interactions, by using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that large uniaxial tensile strain can be applied to black phosphorus (BP) not only along the zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) directions but also in the out-of-plane (OP) direction. Notably, the maximum tensile strain along the OP direction reaches 5.0%, comparable to that along ZZ and AC directions. Moreover, a negative Poisson's ratio is directly observed between OP/AC and AC/OP directions, indicating strong elastic coupling originating from interlayer–intralayer electron redistribution under tensile strain. Interestingly, different from tensile strain along ZZ or AC, the bandgap of BP is linearly tunable under OP tensile strain. This work underscores OP tensile strain offering avenues for tuning electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of 2D materials and potential applications in strain electronics and flexible electronics.},

In this study, a multipoint nucleation approach was proposed for achieving controlled phase transitions of MoTe 2 films via space confinement in the CVD growth process. This interstitial environment limited Te evaporation and considerably enhanced the reactant collision probability, leading to a high nucleation density of 2H-MoTe 2 films. Using the proposed approach, large-area 2H-MoTe 2 films were fabricated in ∼30 min.

Owing to the superior mechanical flexibility of InSe, strain has been proposed as an effective way to modulate its electronic and optical properties. Here, we engineer the band structure of few-layer and bulk InSe with the thickness down to trilayers by biaxial compressive strain, enabled through thermal contraction of the substrate. We observe a significant bandgap tunability, with the blueshift rate of the bandgap transition (A transition) in the photoluminescence spectra as large as ∼200 meV per percent strain, almost twice of that obtained in the case of uniaxial straining. The biaxial strain effects show no signs of obvious layer dependence for InSe from trilayers to bulk. Moreover, we are surprised to find that the B transition with a deeper valence band involved is more sensitive to temperature than the A transition. Our results pave the way for atomically thin InSe in the applications of strain tunable optoelectronic devices and sensitive strain sensors.},

In this Letter, we introduce an innovative approach to manipulate TER by altering the interfacial contact barrier through polarization-induced modifications in interface transport properties. A comprehensive analysis of the electronic structures within heterostructures, consisting of a metallic TaSe 2 monolayer and a ferroelectric Sc 2 CO 2 layer, uncovers a dual modulation effect of ferroelectricity on both the Schottky barrier height and the interfacial tunneling barrier. This phenomenon substantiates the influence of polarization on charge carrier transport across the interface. Through calculations employing the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we reveal a significant TER ratio ( ⁠ 2.41 × 10 13 %) in TaSe 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 -based FTJs. Our findings illustrate that distinct tunneling resistance states can be achieved through polarization reversal, as predicted by the proposed mechanism. These insights enhance the understanding of polarization-mediated TER in 2D FTJs and provide a foundation for the design of next-generation electronic devices leveraging 2D ferroelectric materials.},

Among these, the ferroelectric compound CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) has attracted significant attention for its multiple ferroelectric polarization states. However, its structural complexity, particularly its susceptibility to copper deficiency, presents notable challenges for further research. This study investigates copper-deficient CIPS (Cu: CIPS) to explore the structure–property relationship between ferroelectricity and structural composition at macroscopic and microscopic levels. Using spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, copper deficiency is shown to induce phase separation in CIPS, resulting in the coexistence of CIPS ( Cc ), CIPS ( Cc′ ) (where the two layers experience a sliding displacement of 1/6b along the b-axis) and an In 4/3 P 2 S 6 structure containing small amounts of Cu (Cu: IPS) structure. Moreover, the intermediate phase exhibits a lack of ferroelectric switching response in piezoelectric force microscopy measurements. This work elucidates the microstructural evolution of Cu: CIPS, identifies the mechanism underlying the failure of ferroelectric switching in CIPS, and provides valuable insights for advancing CIPS-based ferroelectric memory devices.},

However, understanding how the combination of TM and RE elements influences effective magnetic properties, such as exchange stiffness (A ex ), remains challenging. Magnetic vortices provide a versatile tool for probing these properties in thin film systems. By combining magnetic imaging via soft x-ray microscopy and micromagnetic modeling, we quantify the effective exchange stiffness in PyGd ferrimagnetic disks with varying Gd concentrations. Our results indicate a reduction in A ex to below 3 pJ/m for a 20% Gd concentration when compared to reference Py, and values below 2 pJ/m for 30% Gd, reflecting weak Ni–Gd exchange coupling. These findings highlight the critical role of rare earth content in tuning the exchange stiffness. The reduced exchange stiffness facilitates a linear field response of the magnetization up to the edge of the disk, as well as significant deformations in the vortex core itself when compared to films with larger A ex . Our results are in line with, albeit lower than, recent measurements of the exchange stiffness in intermixed PyGd. This reduced exchange stiffness has implications for the development of spintronic devices based on ferrimagnetic skyrmions.},

Based on recent experimental achievements of the FeS 2 monolayer, we predict two intrinsic multiferroic materials: CuFe 2 S 4 and CuFe 2 Se 4 . Utilizing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate their ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. Our findings indicate that strain can switch the direction of polarization due to the different displacements of the ionic center and the center of electron density. CuFe 2 X 4 (X = S, Se) monolayers are metal with antiferromagnetic coupling in the perpendicular direction under ambient conditions. The spontaneous polarizations for CuFe 2 S 4 and CuFe 2 Se 4 monolayers are 1.73 and 1.42 pC/m, respectively. Applying a compressive strain exceeding 3% can reverse the polarization direction, while a tensile strain of 4% enhances the polarization of CuFe 2 S 4 to 2.65 pC/m. In addition, the strain effectively influences the magnetic ground state, the direction of the easy axis, and the contribution of different orbital hybridization. These findings help us understand the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric mechanisms in the CuFe 2 X 4 monolayers and expand the family of 2D multiferroic materials.},

  abstract     = {The controllability of magnetic order and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnets is crucial for 2D spintronic applications. Based on the recent experimental few-layer FeCl 2 [Zhou et al. , ACS Nano 18 , 10912 (2024) and Jiang et al. , ACS Nano 17 , 1363 (2023)], in this Letter, we use first-principles to systemically explore the effects of electric field and strain on magnetic order, magnetic anisotropy, and electronic structure of bilayer FeCl 2 with different stacking orders. We demonstrate that for both AA- and AB-stacked bilayer FeCl 2 , the perpendicular electric field induces the change in orbital overlap between nearest-neighbor interlayer Fe atoms, resulting in the interesting transition from interlayer antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic coupling, and the critical electric field is only 0.10 V/Å for the AB-stacking order. Simultaneously, the electric field can induce the transition of magnetic easy axis from out-of-plane to in-plane to out-of-plane due to the change in Fe-3d intraorbital hybridizations. In contrast, the in-plane strain does not trigger the phase transitions of magnetic order and magnetic easy axis, but the −5% compressive strain significantly increases the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropic energy by 69% and 124% for AA- and AB-stacking orders, respectively. Additionally, the anomalous Hall effect is predicted in AB-stacked bilayer FeCl 2 without and with electric field. The present work indicates the promising applications for bilayer FeCl 2 in low-energy-consumption spintronic devices such as electrical control magnetic tunnel junctions and magnetic storage devices, and will stimulate broad study on electric field and strain tuned van der Waals magnets.},

  abstract     = {The sensing performance of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) magnetic sensors is investigated in terms of their sensitivity, the power spectrum of their voltage noise, and their detectivity. Special attention is paid to the effect of the second-order anisotropy constant, K 2 ⁠ , on the sensing performance. It is found that the sensitivity is strongly enhanced by tuning the value of K 2 close to the boundary between the in-plane magnetized state and the conically magnetized state. It is also found that the detectivity is almost independent of K 2 as long as the film is in-plane magnetized. These results provide fundamental insights into the design of high-performance AHE sensors.},

As the most common d-electron-free elements, carbon allotropes present many excellent properties. However, pure three-dimensional carbon spintronics material has not been reported so far. Here, we proposed a superhard ( H V = 60 GPa) carbon material named half-metal (HM)-C21, which presents multi-stable magnetic states and unexpected properties, such as those of half-metal, half-semiconductor, bipolar magnetic semiconductor, and asymmetric antiferromagnetic semiconductors. The mechanical, dynamical, and thermodynamical stabilities of HM-C21 are confirmed. Moreover, HM-C21 is considered to be a promising candidate for an unidentified cubic-form carbon reported in previous experiments. Hence, the present work holds great promise for discovering spintronic materials in pure three-dimensional carbon.},

  abstract     = {The modulation of the interfacial chiral magnetic exchange interaction, i.e., Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI), is promising to realize ultralow-power information storage or logic devices. Recently, researchers used Brillouin light scattering to demonstrate that mechanical strain can be used to modulate the DMI in Pt/Co/Pt and switch its sign, i.e., the chirality. Toward practical storage applications, here, we utilize electric field-induced strain to modulate the DMI and measure it through asymmetric bubble expansion. The strain is generated by applying an electrical potential over a ferroelectric substrate PMN-PT [011] and then transferred to the ferromagnetic films above. The measurement results show that DMI in Pt/Co/Pt exhibits a butterfly-shaped curve following the strain variation as expected from PMN-PT [011]. The dependence of DMI on strain can be explained using the triatomic model based on the Fert-Levy theory. We find a significant DMI modulation between 0.09 and 0.29 mJ/m 2 ; indeed, no sign switching is observed in our work, which we attribute to the initial state preparation of the film. This work provides a reference for future electric-field controlled ultralow-power spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Characterizing a material's thermo-optic coefficient lays the foundation for optimizing thermal tuning of photonic integrated devices, a key feature for applications in optical communication, sensing, and signal processing. Unlike traditional bulk measurements, determining the thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) in microscale photonic devices offers significant advantages in data processing and provides more direct relevance to real-world device performance. In this work, we characterize the TOC of gallium phosphide (GaP) films using an air-cladded ring resonator, built on a GaP-on-insulator (GaP-OI) architecture. The resonator is fabricated via an optimized “etch-n-transfer” process, which incorporates silicon dioxide hard masks to enhance the precision of pattern transfer and improve the waveguide surface cleanliness, reducing defects and ensuring better device performance. The fabricated resonator exhibits a loaded quality factor of (2.18 ± 0.1)×10 4 at 1550 nm by using contact lithography, with a waveguide propagation loss of 23.8 ± 0.3 dB/cm. At 780 nm, the propagation loss decreases to 16.7 dB/cm. The resonator also shows a temperature-dependent wavelength shift of 65.8 pm/K, allowing us to extract a TOC of 1.19 × 10 −4 /K for GaP. This high temperature sensitivity empowers the GaP-OI platform particularly well-suited for rapid thermal turning, which is beneficial for a range of applications including optical sensing, optical signal processing, and highly efficient nonlinear conversion.},

The ADL operates at a center frequency ( f c ) of 715 MHz, determined by the lithography of the top electrode. The bottom electrode functions as a resistive structure, enabling localized heating under a DC voltage (V DC ), which induces frequency shifts (Δ f c ) at one or both radio frequency ports. Experimental results show a maximum tuning range of 16 MHz, with a modulation efficiency of 0.2 MHz/mW, accompanied by a 3.7 dB increase in insertion loss (IL). Furthermore, the device exhibits good recovery characteristics, with both IL and 3-dB bandwidth nearly returning to their original values after removal of V DC .

When two structures are brought together, these modes can couple to each other, producing mixed states that have shifted vibrational frequencies. The frequency shifts in different systems have been analyzed using the coupled harmonic oscillator model, as well as by analytical and numerical continuum mechanics calculations. However, the way the lifetimes change with coupling has not been investigated in detail to date. Here, the coupling between the breathing modes of two nanoplates separated by a layer of a different material is investigated by analytical continuum mechanics calculations. The model developed includes damping via the radiation of sound waves and, thus, provides predictions for both the vibrational frequencies and the damping constants of the coupled system. The results show that the damping constants for the coupled states are an average of the damping constants of the uncoupled nanostructures, weighted by the mixing coefficients.},

Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements showed that the net carrier concentration in the lightly doped drift region of β -Ga 2 O 3 decreased from 1.95 × 10 16 to 1.83 × 10 16 and 1.38 × 10 16 cm −3 after proton irradiation. Additionally, C–V measurements at different frequencies reveal that capacitance gradually decreases as proton fluence increases, though the frequency has little effect on capacitance. The effect of proton irradiation on β -Ga 2 O 3 SBDs was also characterized using low-frequency noise and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicated that the voltage noise spectral density ( S v ) gradually increases with proton fluence and bias voltage before and after irradiation due to the introduction of defects.

It is found that 2D RbKNaBi is a Rashba semiconductor with a narrow bandgap of 0.215 eV and a large Rashba constant of 0.263 eVÅ. The p-type doping exhibits a higher power factor than the n-type one due to the Rashba effect and longer relaxation time of the hole. Strong anharmonicity is observed due to the weak chemical bond and heavy atomic mass in RbKNaBi, which leads to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 1.46 (0.87) Wm −1 K −1 at 300 (500) K. Ultimately, a high p-type thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.50 at 500 K is achieved in 2D RbKNaBi, which is rare in narrow-gap semiconductors or at medium temperature.

After the PMA process, the dominant gate conduction mechanism under low forward and reverse bias shifts from the trap-limited space-charge-limited conduction to generation-recombination due to the reduced hole concentration within the p-NiO layer and the improved quality of the p-NiO/AlGaN interface. Additionally, as the reverse bias increases, the trap-assisted tunneling process gradually becomes the dominant gate conduction mechanism, owing to type-II band alignment with a large band offset at the NiO/AlGaN interface and enhanced band bending in the AlGaN layer after the PMA process. Under higher forward bias, the dominant gate conduction mechanism transitions from the Poole–Frenkel emission to Ohmic conduction due to the increased gate voltage drop across the p-NiO layer with a reduced hole concentration after the PMA process. Furthermore, the proposed gate current model shows good agreement with the experimental results for both devices before and after the PMA process across a wide range of gate biases and measurement temperatures.},

Using the first-principles method, the effects of uniaxial and volumetric strain on the formation energies of common defects in γ-CsPbI 3 were investigated. The results reveal that tensile strain enhances the formation energy of vacancy defects, including V I and V Pb , while the larger volumetric compressive strain triggers the spontaneous generation of V Pb and V Cs . Pb–I–Pb bond angles and the tilt of PbI 6 octahedra are closely correlated with the formation energy of defects. An increased octahedral tilt reduces the lattice symmetry, which in turn leads to a decrease in the defect formation energy. In an iodine-rich chemical environment commonly utilized in the perovskite synthesis, defects demonstrate diminished tolerance to strain, leading to a marked change in the formation energy at minimal strain levels. These findings provide a deeper understanding of uniaxial and volumetric strain on perovskites, demonstrating a strain-based strategy to improve the long-term stability and photovoltaic efficiency of perovskite solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Characterizing electric field noise in diamond is crucial for utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers as probes and qubits. However, NV centers under axial magnetic fields are sensitive to magnetic fields and thus are limited in their ability to characterize electric fields directly. In this study, we engineered NV centers exhibiting strong intrinsic effective electric fields through ion implantation into CVD-grown diamond. We selected seven NV centers with splittings in the range of 18–66 MHz as the focus of our research. By virtue of the suppression effect of the strong effective field on the magnetic field, the energy level shift caused by the magnetic field was reduced by two orders of magnitude. Combining spectral decomposition techniques, we extracted the electric noise spectrum in the low-frequency range from the environmental noise. Our results indicate that the near-surface electrical noise of the diamond deviates from the 1 / f noise model, and two characteristic correlation times were observed within the measured frequency range (1–10 MHz).},

  abstract     = {Altermagnetism, a recently identified form of unconventional antiferromagnetism (AFM), enables the removal of spin degeneracy in the absence of net magnetization that provides a platform for the low power consumption and ultra-fast device applications. However, a little attention has been paid to the relationship between stacking, strain, and altermagnet, the multipiezo effect, and the topological state. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize the altermagnet, the multipiezo effect, and the topological state in two-dimensional (2D) materials by the stacking and strain engineering. Based on the analysis of symmetry, we find that the spin splitting feature related to the Ut , PTt , M z U t ⁠ , or M z PTt symmetries in altermagnet multilayers. In addition, we find that the stacking engineering can effectively realize the transform from antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism and semiconductor to metal for the Janus bilayer V 2 SeTeO. More interestingly, the strain not only induces an intriguing multipiezo effect, encompassing the piezovalley, piezomagnetism, and piezoelectric, but also achieves the abundant topological phase. Our findings offer a generalized direction for manipulating the spin splitting, valley polarization, and topological states, promoting practical application of valleytronic and spintronic devices based on two-dimensional altermagnets.},

Conventional wavefront control techniques, such as mechanical beam steering and liquid-crystal-based modulators, are limited by slow response times and bulky configurations, making them unsuitable for high-speed, on-chip applications. In this work, we propose a graphene-based phase-gradient metasurface that leverages hot-electron dynamics for tunable, ultrafast wavefront control in the mid-infrared regime. By precisely modulating the electron temperature in graphene with femtosecond laser pulses, our device achieves real-time beam steering with a maximum reflection angle shift of 21° within 104 fs, as well as dual-focal length switching. The device demonstrates high reflectivity, continuous 2 π phase modulation, and an achromatic response over a substantial bandwidth, making it a robust solution for high-speed optical encoding and adaptive optics. This graphene-based platform provides a compact, reconfigurable solution that overcomes the limitations of traditional and emerging approaches, establishing a foundation for next-generation integrated photonics systems.},

  abstract     = {Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit high oscillator strength and intrinsic losses. This property makes TMD materials favorable for studying light–matter interactions and enhancing light absorption. Here, we propose a strategy to achieve significantly enhanced absorption in a TMD-based metasurface. We demonstrate a nanodisk array composed of bulk TMD materials, enabling the excitation of Mie resonances that couple efficiently to the intrinsic excitons. We show that the coupling of both the magnetic and electric components of the Mie mode to the intrinsic excitons leads to the Kerker effect, resulting in significantly enhanced broadband absorption. Importantly, by introducing an additional metallic back reflector, dual-band perfect absorption can be achieved through suppression of the transmission channel. Unlike previously reported approaches using critical coupling conditions, the present coupling-induced enhancement of absorption can be sustained over a large range of incidence angles. With the help of a metallic back reflector, dual-band perfect absorption can be achieved at the self-hybridized polariton states. Our design is expected to be useful for high-compact polaritonic devices and may pave the way for advanced light-harvesting applications.},

Despite decades of advancement of our fundamental understanding of these materials, they consistently fall short of realizing their promise in functional devices. We identify a significant bottleneck toward device realization to be surface overoxidation. Protective caps can effectively prevent overoxidation, but their interfaces with functional oxides are not well understood. These interfaces are critical for effectively using functional oxides in field-effect devices, where “the interface is the device.” This work addresses the chemistry and physics of the interface between protective caps and the correlated metal SrVO 3 , a model functional oxide. Our comparison of five different cap materials reveals effective protection and similar SrVO 3 surface chemistry in all cases. Systematic comparisons of surface and bulk-sensitive photoelectron spectra reveal that negligible interface redox takes place, elucidating the cap-SrVO 3 interface chemistry. This work demonstrates a robust and simple solution to the surface overoxidation problem in vanadates, paving the way toward effectively using these materials in field-effect devices. Our conclusions are general and can be applied to numerous other systems, thus moving oxide electronics closer to the realization of functional devices.},

  abstract     = {Charge injection is an important factor for the stable operation of power equipment and power system. Our experimental measurements reveal a charge injection barrier of ∼1.2 eV at the Al/Polyethylene (PE) interface. However, previous simulation studies, which accounted for physical and chemical defects, reported charge injection barriers ranging from 2.5 to 5 eV and deviate from our experimental findings. In this paper, we employ first-principles calculation to determine the charge injection barrier at the Al/PE interface, in which the effects of chemical impurities, physical defects, and the morphological complexity of PE including amorphous regions, crystalline regions, and the amorphous/crystalline edge have been systematically investigated. The calculated results demonstrate that specific physical or chemical defects introduce only a single energy trap state, whereas the amorphous/crystalline edge induces multiple energy states. In the amorphous/crystalline edge model, the bandgap is reduced to 7.3 eV and multiple trap states are densely distributed at the amorphous/crystalline edge, which avoids the possibility of highly localized and sparsely distributed trap levels in the space. Consequently, charge injection is likely facilitated through a multi-step-hopping mechanism via these energy trap states at the amorphous/crystalline edge. In this condition, the calculated charge injection barriers of electrons and holes are reduced to 1.56 and 1.33 eV, which is closer to our experimental result of ∼1.2 eV. As the amorphous/crystalline edge widely exists in PE, defects at the amorphous/crystalline edge probably determine the charge injection at the electrode/polymer interface, rather than the specific physical or chemical defects.},

They are useful in various biological applications, such as for measuring the local magnetic and electrical fields and signal propagation in tissues as well as their local interaction dynamics. However, to enable measurements suitable for medical applications, an observation system that can noninvasively map neural activity from the magnetic fields generated by brain nerve cells with high spatial resolution and sensitivity is required. We fabricated a vertical waveguide array in a diamond containing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with cell size dimension using a green femtosecond Bessel beam laser. The red emission from NV centers within the waveguide is confined inside the waveguide (typically with a cell size of 15 μ m) by the total internal reflection at its walls. This enables efficient optical confinement and improves the light collection performance of the NV center emission. We have also developed a sensor—called the diamond micro-NV center array device (MAED)—that allows the observation of local magnetic field distributions and have measured spatial distribution of magnetic field with cell-size accuracy. This approach makes it possible to perform localized measurements of electrical and magnetic properties, as well as dynamic mapping of biological systems.

In this work, a time domain spectroscopy system for broadband terahertz detection with air serving as the detection medium was developed. To enable coherent detection, crystalline quartz was introduced to generate a local oscillator beam via the second harmonic mechanism, which allows for the reconstruction of the THz pulse waveform. Experimentally, a gapless spectrum extending up to 14 THz with a dynamic range of 60 dB was obtained. Our method provides the same level of performance compared to the traditional air-biased-coherent-detection method and operates without the need for a high-voltage modulator, offering a more user-friendly approach for broadband THz detection. We also demonstrated that the THz power from the spintronic terahertz emitter could reach 0.3 mW, resulting in a peak field of up to 1.95 MV/cm. These findings will contribute to the advancement for THz spectroscopy and remote sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnons are the quanta of spin waves and transport angular momenta through magnetically ordered materials. They can be used to distribute and control on-chip GHz signals without charge flow, thereby avoiding Joule heating. Beyond multiplexed signal processing, filtering, and Boolean logic, they allow for hardware implementation of neural networks exploiting cascaded magnon scattering on the nanoscale. A game-changing boost is expected if nonvolatile magnon-signal storage and in-memory computation schemes become realistic. We outline recent progress in experimental research and micromagnetic modeling toward these goals before sketching remaining challenges.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental understanding of the interplay between chemical bonding, lattice dynamics, and phonon transport is crucial for thermoelectric applications, and the desire for thermally insulating crystalline solids has gained notable attention over the years. Anharmonicity prevailing in crystalline solids has a significant effect on how heat moves through the lattice, and its correlation with low thermal conductivity is discussed in this work. Here, we have synthesized crystalline halide perovskites Cs 3 Sb 2 Cl 9 and Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 via the wet chemical process and explored the effect of lattice anharmonicity in thermal transport properties, which exhibits glassy thermal conductivity of 0.17–0.19 W m −1 K −1 and 0.14–0.16 W m −1 K −1 in the temperature range of 303–373 K. The hierarchical chemical bonding with mixed ionic and covalent interactions and local off-centering of stereochemical active 5 s 2 and 6 s 2 lone pair of electrons on Sb and Bi generates large lattice anharmonicity resulting in soft lattice with low sound velocity (927 and 897 ms −1 ) and Debye temperature (105 and 102 K). The presence of low frequency localized Cs–Cl bond vibration and the repulsion between the lone pair and the bond pair suppresses the heat carrying transverse acoustic phonon modes to steer glassy thermal conductivity in halide perovskites.},

  abstract     = {Microwave superconducting resonators are extensively studied in fields such as quantum computing and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. However, the integration of superconducting resonators with feedback mechanisms to create ultra-low noise oscillators is a relatively unexplored area, and the application of such oscillators in ESR spectroscopy has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the design, fabrication, and application of microwave oscillators based on superconducting resonators for ESR spectroscopy, illustrating an alternative way for the improvement of the performance of oscillator based ESR sensors. Specifically, ESR spectra are obtained by measuring the oscillator's frequency shift induced by the ESR effect as a function of the applied static magnetic field. The oscillators are composed of a single heterojunction bipolar transistor or high electron mobility transistor coupled with NbTi or YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) superconducting resonators. The fabricated oscillators operate at frequencies of 0.6 and 1.7 GHz and temperatures up to 80 K (for YBCO resonators) and 8 K (for NbTi resonators). The lowest measured frequency noise is about 9 mHz/Hz 1/2 (−139 dBc/Hz), the best spin sensitivity is about 1 × 10 10 spins/Hz 1/2 , and the best concentration sensitivity is about 3 × 10 18 spins/Hz 1/2 m 3 . The approach proposed in this work should allow for significantly better spin and concentration sensitivities compared to those achievable with normal conductors, up to operating frequencies, magnetic fields, and temperatures, where superconductors exhibit substantially lower effective microwave resistance than normal conductors.},

While the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation functional is efficient, its accuracy in describing defects is often not sufficient. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional is more accurate but computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale screening. This study evaluates the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) family of meta-GGA functionals as potential alternatives to PBE for characterizing NV-like color centers in 4H-SiC using the Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) framework. We examine nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine vacancies in 4H-SiC, focusing on applications in quantum technology. Our results show that SCAN and r 2 SCAN achieve a greater accuracy than PBE, approaching HSE's precision at a lower computational cost. This suggests that the SCAN family offers a practical improvement for screening new color centers, with computational demands similar to PBE.},

In this work, we prepare periodic ultra-high-temperature ceramic SLs made of transition metal carbides HfC and TaC with SL interface spacing ranging from 9.5 to 84.5 nm. The measured cross-plane phonon thermal conductivity displays a crossover dependence on SL interface spacing, achieving a minimum value of 0.84 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature. Moreover, the SLs with small interface spacing (9.5 and 14.7 nm) even show higher thermal conductivity than the constituent materials. The interfacial thermal resistance for HfC/TaC interface is determined from both a prepared single-interface double-layer sample and the thermal conductivity data of SLs, which is found to be a considerably large value for ceramic material interfaces. We further resolve the electron and phonon components of the interfacial thermal resistance. Finally, thermal stability of SLs is evaluated at 1200 °C in air, and a thin HfO 2 cap layer is shown to effectively protect against high-temperature oxidation and preserve the thermal insulating property to a good extent.},

  abstract     = {Inorganic CsPbI 2 Br perovskite solar cells have attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding performance and photo-thermal stability. However, the rapid crystallization of the solution-processed CsPbI 2 Br film often results in poor crystallinity and a high density of defects, which seriously restrict the improvement of the device performance. Here, we introduce a dual-functional additive, 4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (AMP), to regulate the crystallization and reduce the defect density of the CsPbI 2 Br film. The introduction of AMP notably improves the crystallinity and morphology of the CsPbI 2 Br film and promotes a preferred crystal orientation. The C=N and amino groups in AMP interact with Pb 2+ and Br - in the perovskite, respectively, effectively passivating the defects and improving the carrier lifetime. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the optimized carbon-based hole-transport layer-free device reaches 13.30%, which exceeds the 10.66% of the control device. The environmental and light stability of the device is also significantly improved.

Here, we report a quasi- in situ redeposition strategy enabled by Ce doping to realize rapid capture and deposition of Fe species on the surface of NiFeOOH. During the OER process, dissolved Ce ions, owing to their large ionic radius and strong electrostatic attraction, enhance OH − concentration at the solid–liquid interface, accelerating Fe redeposition and suppressing Fe leaching into the electrolyte. This significantly enhances activity and durability under high-current density. The optimized Ce-NiFeOOH catalyst delivers an overpotential of 294 mV at 1000 mA cm −2 and maintains excellent stability at 500 mA cm −2 .

Here, we report Zeeman-effect-induced luminescence suppression in Er 3+ -doped GdF 3 nanoparticles under dual-wavelength excitation (808 nm broadband and 527 nm narrowband) at moderate magnetic fields (up to 1.3 T). Under 808 nm excitation, upconversion emissions (528, 546, and 656 nm) dominated by two-photon absorption exhibit >79% intensity suppression (0.89 T), attributed to energy mismatch caused by Zeeman splitting of sublevels. In contrast, under 527 nm excitation, downconversion emissions (656, 842, and 983 nm) show uniform suppression (∼66% at 1.3 T) due to magnetic field-induced splitting of the 2 H 11/2 energy level. A simplified model elucidates how Zeeman splitting alters absorption resonance, with theoretical calculations aligning closely with experimental trends. This study reveals the physical mechanisms of magnetic field modulation using dual-wavelength excitation, providing a foundation for expanding magneto-optical technologies in imaging and sensing applications.},

Here, we systematically investigate THz response of nearly continuous and granular Mn 3 Sn by THz time-domain spectroscopy from 1.5 to 300 K. The results indicate that the THz response can be greatly modulated by the morphology of sample due to carrier localization. For nearly continuous samples, the transition from semiconductor to metal can be observed as the temperature increases, and the THz conductivity can be described by the Drude model within the range of 0.2–1 THz. For granular samples, the real part of the THz conductivity is an order of magnitude smaller than that of nearly continuous ones, and it exhibits temperature insensitivity and a negative imaginary part of THz conductivity. Moreover, we have observed two absorption peaks induced by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at ∼ 1.2 and ∼ 1.7 THz. The findings not only enhance our understanding of the photoelectric properties of Mn 3 Sn thin films but also pave the way for studying the THz conductivity of thin films.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional topological insulators have attracted considerable attention due to their topological edge states (ESs), which originate from the nontrivial topology of the insulating bulk states. Monolayer 1T′-MoTe 2 has been theoretically predicted to have topological ESs. However, the experimental verification of its topological characteristics (i.e., bandgap opening) with spatial information remains elusive due to its thermodynamic instability and semi-metallic characteristics. Here, we utilize molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of high-quality monolayer 1T′-MoTe 2 with different lattice deformations (strains) on graphitized SiC (Gr/SiC) and Au (111) substrates. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe the topological insulator and semimetal states in monolayer 1T′-MoTe 2 . Furthermore, by combining experimental observation and density functional theory calculations, we confirm that the tensile strain along the Y-axis (lattice constant b) is a crucial factor in modulating the bandgap opening of the monolayer 1T′-MoTe 2 . This work not only deepens our understanding of the topological properties of monolayer 1T′-MoTe 2 but also provides the potentiality for optimizing its topological characteristics through the regulation of local strain.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen vacancies in H f x Z r ( 1 − x ) O 2 (HZO) both contribute to stabilization of the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase and promote leakage pathways that limit the endurance of devices based on the material. For this reason, the defect states of oxygen vacancies were investigated using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), as their concentration was varied via ex situ laser exposure. Following a controlled oxygen vacancy reduction via visible (2.54 eV) laser dosing of HZO, deep-ultraviolet (DUV, 5.82 eV) PEEM was used to spatially probe the resulting mid-gap defect states and work function. Work function was found to increase monotonically with the laser-induced reduction in oxygen vacancy concentration culminating in a total increase near 70 meV. The change implies a Fermi level shift toward the valence band as the total available electron-filled charge states are reduced with the removal of oxygen vacancies. A reduction in charge states is corroborated by the observed lessening of both photoemission and photoluminescence intensities after laser dosing. The deduced position of the Fermi level is within a band of near-conduction band defect states produced by oxygen vacancies that are linked to endurance limiting leakage currents. Together, these results directly identify the primary role of oxygen vacancies on the defect states in HZO while demonstrating that laser exposure can be used for their modification.},

The L′-Ta 2 O 5 -type Zr 0.10 Ta 0.90 O 2.45 has a strong second-harmonic generation signal and higher dielectric constant of 55, compared to conventional L-Ta 2 O 5 -related structures. High-temperature x-ray diffraction shows the phase transition to the L″-Ta 2 O 5 phase with a pseudo-hexagonal structure around 400 K. The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant reveals that the phase has a maximum value of 60, which is attributed to the phase transition.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) temperature can significantly influence the physical and chemical properties of films, enabling compatibility with back-end-of-line (BEOL) thermal budgets; however, it also inevitably affects polarization switching dynamics, warranting further investigation. In this work, BEOL-compatible Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) films are fabricated at various ALD temperatures, and their polarization switching dynamics is characterized using the nucleation-limited switching model. Higher ALD temperatures result in faster polarization switching speeds and reduced asymmetry during program and erase stages, while lower ALD temperatures promote uniform polarization, although capacitors across all temperatures display similar remnant polarization (Pr) values after wakeup. Detailed analysis suggests that the influence of ALD temperature on preexisting oxygen vacancies (Vo) may be the underlying factor.},

In this paper, we investigated the magnetocaloric effect of triangular antiferromagnet ErPd 2 Sb. No evident manetic ordering can be observed at temperature above 0.56 K. Large volumetric magnetic entropy change of 172.8 mJ·cm −3 ·K −1 is obtained under a small field change of 2 T at 1.3 K, which is larger than that of commercial magnetic refrigerant Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 under the same condition. Due to the strong magnetic frustration, the minmum temperature of ErPd 2 Sb is revealed to be 254.8 mK by quasi-ADR measurement, which is much lower than its magnetic ordering temperature. In addition, a field-induced phase trantition can be marked in ADR curve at 0.5 T, which is consistent with the measurement results of electrical resistivity. These excellent magnetocaloric effects indicate that ErPd 2 Sb is an ideal candidate for ultra-low temperature magnetic refrigeration application.},

Direct current-tuned spin torque-ferromagnetic resonance measurement indicates that the effective spin Hall angle (θ DL ) of MnRh film near phase transition temperature (150 K) is in the value of 0.046. Notably, θ DL is 360% higher than that at room temperature. Experimental results indicate that large enhancement of θ DL attributed to spin fluctuation during phase transition not only improves the intrinsic spin Hall effect but significantly amplifies the spin transmittance. In addition, the spin diffusion length is basically independent of temperature, indicating that the spin dephasing effect related to magnetic order has little influence on spin propagation in antiferromagnetic MnRh. This work further reveals a method to enhance effective spin-torque efficiency by large improvement of interfacial spin conductance during phase transition and provides theoretical guidance for the application of spin–orbit torque devices.},

In this work, we demonstrate that capping with a Bi atomic layer enhances the antiferromagnet-induced PMA in Mn(FeMn)/Co/Ni(Fe) films when Mn(FeMn) transitions to the AFM state. Moreover, the Bi atomic layer stabilizes the antiferromagnet-induced PMA at elevated temperatures, maintaining its effects until the long-range AFM order is lost. This enhancement is attributed to the strong spin–orbit coupling of the Bi atomic layer, which reinforces the out-of-plane spin components of AFM moments, thereby amplifying the induced PMA. Our findings provide valuable insights into the interaction between 6 p -Bi atomic layers and AFM moments, underscoring their critical role in inducing PMA in adjacent FM layers under demanding thermal conditions. This approach shows significant potential for advancing AFM-based spintronic systems, particularly in applications requiring robust thermal stability.},

Upon heating in a very small magnetic field, or even in zero field, the sample continues to maintain the large value of magnetization, which eventually diminishes distinctly at around 200 K manifesting an ultrasharp jump. A similar feature is also observed in the Hall resistivity, which holds its saturation value when heated back in the zero field after being field-cooled. The ultrasharp jump in magnetization is also reflected in our Hall data. The observed thermo-remanence in magnetization and Hall resistivity in the arrested state can be attributed to strong uniaxial anisotropy and a probable cluster-glass-like phase.

Applying the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between two AFM magnon modes and results in different occupation numbers for the two magnon modes. Combined with the finite reflection of a narrow domain wall, this is found to have a significant impact on the magnon heat transport, giving rise to thermal magnetoresistance.

However, the traditional simulation and design methods of resonators often require much computation because the resonator includes a multilayer structure and many interfinger pairs. In order to improve the efficiency of simulation and designing, this paper proposed a series neural network to design the structural parameters backward based on the performance indicators. We validate the method using a SAW resonator based on a 42°YX cut LiTaO 3 substrate with an aluminum electrode. The device consists of an interdigital transducer and two reflector gates. The test set results from simulation data show that the trained model has a relative average error of less than 5% on the devices' structural parameters, and the coefficient of determination is more significant than 0.99. In addition, we compare the predicted and the experimental results, which show that the series neural network has excellent potential to infer the electrical response and structural parameters of SAW devices.

  abstract     = {Flatbands in the periodic electronic or photonic structures attract intensive attention due to their infinite effective mass, which leads to plenty of physical phenomena, for example, the localization of electrons or photons. However, direct observation of bosonic condensate in the triangle lattice with tunable flatband at room temperature is not realized yet. In this work, we fabricated a microcavity with a triangle lattice potential and perovskite CsPbBr 3 as the gain material at room temperature. In this microcavity, polariton bands due to the coupling among the triangle lattice are observed, and exciton polariton condensation is realized. By deforming the triangle lattice such that the coupling between the potential sites is modulated, two exciton polariton flatbands with different energies are observed. Above threshold, exciton polaritons condense at the higher-energy flatband, which experiences larger gain. Our results offer a method to investigate the polariton flatband induced interesting physical phenomenon by engineering a two-dimensional photonic lattice at room temperature.},

In this study, atomic layer etching (ALE) was applied to the Schottky contact area to remove surface defects and native oxide. SBDs without ALE treatment exhibited a breakdown voltage of 308 V, whereas ALE-treated devices achieved a significantly improved breakdown voltage of 1205 V. By reducing interface traps and eliminating native oxide, ALE leads to lower leakage current and a more uniform Schottky barrier. These findings demonstrate that ALE is an effective surface treatment for enhancing the interface quality of III-nitride Schottky barrier diodes, paving the way for high-performance devices and promising advances in other nitride-based power electronics.},

The treated TSBDs show a breakdown voltage increasing from 832 to 1200 V while maintaining a low turn-on voltage of 0.9 V and a low specific on-resistance of 12.1 mΩ cm 2 . As indicated by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, atomic nitrogen treatment reduces oxygen vacancies on the β -Ga 2 O 3 surface and promotes the formation of ternary Ga–O–N compounds at the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 interface. These compounds passivate ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma)-induced defects on the Ga 2 O 3 trench surface, reducing the leakage current in the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 MIS TSBDs. Meanwhile, the atomic nitrogen treatment induces a positive shift in the flatband voltage of Ga 2 O 3 MOS capacitors with Al 2 O 3 dielectric, a sign of an increase in the fixed charge density (Q 1 ) at the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 interface, which expands the depletion region under reverse bias and strengthens the contact barrier. These findings testify to the fact that atomic nitrogen treatment effectively optimizes the trench MIS interface, promising to an effective strategy for high-performance Ga 2 O 3 -based Schottky barrier diodes.},

Femtosecond Z-scan results show that the dispersion of β compares favorably with the theoretical prediction at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm (half of bandgap E g ). However, the nonlinear refractive index n 2 demonstrated a substantial deviation from theoretical calculations in the 350–450 nm regime, which is correlated with the sub-bandgap absorption band observed in AlN single crystal. The effects of trapped carrier-induced absorption and refraction were determined by femtosecond pump–probe measurements, which could be attributed to the transition from valence band maximum to mid-gap defect states in AlN. Our results provide guidance for developing AlN-based nonlinear integrated photonic devices in the UV–visible spectral range.},

The impact of various scattering phenomena on AlGaN channel HEMTs was analyzed with respect to the channel, buffer, and AlN interlayer design, revealing that the alloy disorder and ionized impurity scattering mechanisms were predominant, limiting the mobility of 2DEG up to 180 cm 2 /Vs for a sheet charge density of 1.1 × 10 13 cm −2 .

The dislocation line of an angle at approximately 60 ° with respect to the (001) plane observed from the [100] direction originates from the intersection line between the principal (100) plane of the nanopipe and the (11-1) plane in the quasi-tetrahedron region of the (010) plane surface. The surface morphology transition from a groove to a triangular pit is related to inheriting the cutting shape of nanopipes on the (001) surface. The appearance of chevron-shaped etching pits on CMP processed (001) homoepitaxial film can be explained by exposing two lateral (111) and (1-11) facets as sidewall, with the (100) facet remaining as the central core in the defect position after anisotropic wet etching. The 3D model also provides the possibility to explain the different angles and the Burgers vector of dislocation lines in single-crystal substrates, which is due to diverse sidewall planes of the nanopipe intersection with the planes in the quasi-tetrahedron region of the (010) plane.},

In this work, we have constructed a series of 2D chiral perovskites with strong TPA coefficients using an achiral organic spacer cation alloying strategy. Importantly, the carrier dynamics of 2D chiral perovskites has been investigated, which exhibit different responses to left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light. Interestingly, the microscopic images of two-photon excited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral perovskites are demonstrated, confirming they possess large dissymmetry factors of CPL.

Sc 2 Mo 3 O 12 is a typical NTE material, but its high synthesis cost, low density, and low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) need to be improved. In this work, a series of (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 ceramics has been prepared via solid-state reaction. Effects of (KCo) 3+ doping on crystal structure, microstructure, and NTE behaviors of the (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 ceramics were studied. The results show that (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 experiences a crystal structure change with increasing (KCo) 3+ substitution content. At x = 0.25, the (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 sample includes both hexagonal (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 and orthorhombic Sc 2 Mo 3 O 12 .

Compared to Sc 2 Mo 3 O 12 ceramics, hexagonal (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 ceramics present higher densification and better NTE performance. Thermal mechanical analyzer analysis indicates that the linear CTEs of hexagonal (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 ceramics decrease from −4.36 × 10 −6 °C −1 to −7.87 × 10 −6 °C −1 as x increases. High-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal that the hexagonal (KCo) x Sc 2- x Mo 3 O 12 samples exhibit anisotropic NTE. The linear CTEs of α a and α b ( α a = α b ) are −15.47 × 10 −6 °C −1 , while that of α c is 13.19 × 10 −6 °C −1 . The linear CTE of α l is −5.95 × 10 −6 °C −1 .},

  abstract     = {III-Nitride materials such as gallium nitride (GaN) and indium nitride (InN) are critical for applications in electronics and optoelectronics due to their exceptional properties. However, their high-temperature stability is often limited by decomposition into constituent elements at low nitrogen pressures near or below ambient. This work investigates the use of nonequilibrium nitrogen plasma to stabilize GaN and InN at elevated temperatures and low pressures. Bulk nitride synthesis was demonstrated via plasma-assisted nitridation of Ga and In metals. Following synthesis, the suppression of nitride decomposition at temperatures exceeding the predicted equilibrium limits was accomplished by means of a nonequilibrium nitrogen plasma. Experimental results revealed that the nonequilibrium plasma imparted an additional chemical potential onto the ground state nitrogen by electron impact excitation, stabilizing GaN at 1000 °C and InN at 600 °C for nitrogen partial pressures as low as 10 Pa. With this experimental approach, the chemical potential of excited nitrogen species in the plasma was estimated to be 1.8 eV higher than the ground state value. These findings highlight the potential for plasma-based processing to enable scalable synthesis and stabilization of III-nitrides at high temperatures for advanced material applications.},

  abstract     = {Chiral quantum dots (QDs) are expected to play a significant role in chiral molecular recognition, spin-selective filtering for charge transport, and various other fields. Photo-irradiation can enhance the photoluminescence (PL) of chiral CdSe QD films, which serves as a convenient method to modulate the optical properties. However, the effects of photo-irradiation on the absorption and spin properties of chiral QDs remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the influence of photo-irradiation on the PL, absorption, and spin properties of chiral L/D-cysteine-capped CdS QD films. Under the irradiation of the 458 nm continuous wave laser, the PL intensity of chiral CdS QD films can be significantly enhanced by over 50 times and the absorption peak exhibits a blue shift of approximately 3 nm. The transient transmission dynamics before and after irradiation indicate that the bleach recovery lifetime became longer after irradiation, which can be attributed to the increase in radiative recombination. Furthermore, the strength of the electron spin is diminished due to a decrease in the number of charge-separated electrons. The significant enhancement in PL intensity, coupled with the increased radiative recombination and the reduction in spin signals, strongly suggests that surface defects are effectively passivated. The influence of photo-irradiation on the optical properties of chiral QDs provides valuable insights for the design of chiral nanomaterials and their applications.},

In this Letter, we theoretically show that dielectric metasurfaces supported by dielectric-coated Weyl semimetal substrates exhibit prominent nonreciprocity. The spectral separation between the emissivity and absorptivity peaks is more than 6 times their spectral widths. In particular, the peak value of the difference between the emissivity and absorptivity amounts to more than 0.5 even for a small angle of 8° and it sustains near-unity over nearly all angles. The contribution of a resonantly excited surface plasmon polariton and the significant role of a dielectric film on the Weyl semimetal substrate have been thoroughly analyzed. We believe that the results are an important step toward practical applications of magnet-free nonreciprocal thermal photonics, including heat transfer, sensing, and radiative cooling.},

  abstract     = {Optics metasurfaces have been utilized for research into computer-generated holography imaging and encryption due to their exceptional ability to manipulate fundamental properties of light waves, including polarization, amplitude, and phase. In this study, we proposed a dual-polarization channel (DPCs) meta-pixel to achieve infrared polarization-multiplexed meta-holography. By leveraging the Pancharatnam–Berry phase metasurface, we constructed and imaged the holographic phase information of “NENU” and the school badge at an infrared wavelength of 10.6 μ m in the far field. The proposed meta-pixel, consisting of left-handed (LPC) and right-handed (RPC) circularly polarized channels, is designed to control the wavefront. The independence of the DPCs meta-pixel enables a single polarization channel to produce independent imaging. Furthermore, based on polarization decomposition and composition, the imaging intensity of the LPC and RPC reflects the ellipsometric properties of the polarization state. The relative phase and polarization conversion efficiency between LPC and RPC meta-atoms were carefully designed to enable full-polarization meta-holographic imaging. The results demonstrate that DPCs meta-pixels can operate independently or synergistically to achieve infrared polarization meta-holography. This work highlights the potential of infrared meta-holography, utilizing polarization information for enhanced security, and offers promising applications in infrared camouflage, information security, and communication.},

Based on the phase in the orthogonal direction and rotation angle of the meta-atom and the metal grating embedded in the substrate, a universal method is proposed to control the polarization of the metasurfaces. Among them, the orthogonal phase provides the parameter of the diagonal position of the Jones matrix, and the rotation angle provides the parameter of the rotation matrix. The integration of embedded metal gratings simplifies the transmission matrix, further enabling arbitrary polarization adjustment. The metasurface integrating polarization selection, control, and multiplexing achieves simultaneous control and multiplexing of linear, circular, and elliptical polarizations.

Using the thermionic emission model, we analyzed current–voltage ( I – V ) measurements to obtain the Schottky barrier height ( ϕ SBH ) and the ideality factor ( η ). The temperature dependence of the extracted ϕ SBH and η reveals kink features near the CDW transition temperature. The Schottky–Mott model is employed to explain these kink features in the derivatives of ϕ SBH and 1/ η and attributes them to changes in the work function of R Te 3 during the CDW transition. Our findings suggest that Schottky junctions can be utilized to probe the electronic states of R Te 3 , enabling potential R Te 3 device applications in electronics and optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Searching for systems in which electronic interactions dominate microscopic quantum behaviors is highly desired in condensed matter physics. Here, we provide spectroscopic evidence for the Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid—a state that describes the correlated one-dimensional (1D) electrons—at the tube-like edge with nanoscale width in folded graphene. Using a scanning tunneling microscope, the Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid state is evidenced by the characteristic suppression in the tunneling density of states near the Fermi energy, which exhibits an anomalous power-law scaling with both energy and temperature. We find that the extracted value of the Luttinger parameter K , which defines the interaction strength of the 1D system, is relatively small, around ∼0.16–0.18, as determined using the degeneracy factor of single-wall carbon nanotubes. This K value is comparable to those previously observed in the single-wall carbon nanotubes, indicating a possible strong electronic interaction regime. These results demonstrate that the quasi-1D tube-like structure at the folding edge of graphene can mimic the electronic properties of well-confined 1D carbon nanotubes. Our work therefore establishes graphene folding edge as an alternative platform to study emergent correlated physics in 1D.},

A high-power pump beam, characterized by a structured light, induces a refractive index change in the rubidium vapor. A low-power, initially Gaussian probe beam counter-propagates through the rubidium vapor cell, undergoing a nonlinear phase shift induced by the pump beam. This enables the transfer of the spatial characteristics imprinted by the pump beam onto the probe beam with maximum structural integrity and similarity. The spatial evolution of the transverse intensity of the probe beam vs frequency detunings of the pump and probe beams, pump beam power, and cell temperature is studied. We have further shown that the structural similarity can be manipulated by changing the pump beam power and temperature of the vapor cell.

Recent studies suggest that polarization locking via OIL could enable novel computational applications such as polarization-encoded Ising computers. However, the inherent polarization preference and limited polarization switchability of VCSELs hinder their use for such purposes. To address these challenges, we fabricate VCSELs with tailored oxide aperture designs and combine these with bias current tuning to study the overall impact on polarization locking. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach reduces the required injection power (to as low as 3.6 μ W) and expands the locking range. To investigate the impact of the approach, the spin-flip model is used to analyze the effects of amplitude anisotropy and bias current on polarization locking, demonstrating strong coherence with experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Bioinspired three-dimensional shape deformations of smart polymers in response to stimuli such as light, vapor, and external fields have garnered significant attention in the field of soft robotics. Among these stimuli, vapor-induced shape deformation is particularly promising due to its ability to generate substantial deformation in response to minimal vapor input. In this study, we investigated the influence of polymorphic phase fractions of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films on the actuation behavior upon exposure to acetone vapor. Our findings reveal that the actuation characteristics of PVDF films strongly vary with the polymorphic phase fraction. Notably, maximum actuation is observed at a specific phase ratio of β to α (52:48) in the PVDF film. Finite element analysis was conducted to provide deeper insights into the impact of varying polymorphic phase fractions on the actuation performance of PVDF films, supporting and corroborating the experimental observations.},

  abstract     = {The photophysics of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been extensively investigated. Especially the fast optical switch based on the NV centers' photoluminescence (PL) by the near-infrared laser (NIR) modulation has been demonstrated, but the photophysical processes behind it are still not fully understood. Here, the NIR modulation on the PL of an isolated single NV center in bulk diamond is probed and detected with precision at picosecond timescale. We thereby observe NIR optical excitation at the NV ground state as well as at the excited state. Meanwhile, a generalized model is constructed with additional energy levels that can be reached under NIR illumination. The transition rates from numerical simulations are demonstrated in good agreement with the experimental results. Our findings may provide insights into the understanding of the NV center's related photophysics and open intriguing prospects such as reversible optical switching, super-resolution microscopy, and so forth.},

Since NV centers are sensitive to external magnetic fields projected onto their crystallographic axes, distinguishing NV centers with different orientations is essential for fully extracting vectorial magnetic field information. While a calibrated magnetic bias field or optical polarization has been widely used for this purpose, the use of microwave fields remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the identification of NV axes using the spatial variation of microwave magnetic fields generated by a microwave loop structure. Continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance scanned over the NV center ensemble shows distinct patterns that align well with a simplified model for each NV axis. After identifying the NV axes, we reconstruct the magnitude and orientation of the external magnetic field. This technique expands the potential for miniaturizing and enhancing NV-based vector magnetic sensors.},

In this study, we demonstrate strong coupling between a ScAlN thin-film SAW resonator and a high-coherence qubit on the same substrate, where the enhanced qubit coherence was achieved through selective ScAlN etching. Distinct multimode anticrossings are observed in both the qubit and SAW resonator frequency spectra, with extracted coupling strengths closely matching theoretical predictions.

However, achieving precise control over Φ of perovskites remains a significant challenge. In this study, Φ of the FAPbI 3 perovskite surface is quantitatively regulated using anilinium (An) and its derivatives. Three factors contribute to the change in Φ ( ΔΦ ): surface structure relaxation, surface charge exchange, and modified layer potential difference ( ΔV ). After the modification of perovskite surface with anilinium (An) and its derivatives, ΔΦ of FAPbI 3 correlates linearly with ΔV of the modified layer, as the contribution of surface structure relaxation to Δ Φ is negligible, and the contribution of interfacial charge exchange to Δ Φ remains constant. The experimental results also demonstrated that Φ of perovskite surface can be linearly regulated. In addition, the linear relationship between ΔΦ and ΔV applies to other organic groups and their derivatives, as well as other metal halide perovskites. This methodology offers a practical computational strategy to precisely regulate Φ of the perovskite surface by designing ΔV of the modified layer.},

While oxygen plasma oxidation of the InAlN barrier can mitigate MIGS, it introduces defects and impurity scattering, further deteriorating channel performance. This study resolves this paradox by exploiting the thermodynamic oxidation selectivity between gallium nitride (GaN) and InAlN to selectively convert a GaN cap under the gate region into a wide-bandgap gallium oxynitride (GaON) layer, leaving the InAlN barrier intact. This barrier-friendly approach suppresses MIGS without sacrificing channel quality, achieving a near-theoretical intrinsic electron effective velocity (v eff. i = 2.2 × 10 7 cm/s). The enhanced transport enables record RF performance: (f T /f max = 240/530) GHz, a noise figure below 1 dB at Ka-band, attributed to suppressed interfacial scattering, and 8 dB linear gain at 94 GHz. With excellent uniformity, this GaON cap technology provides a scalable, reliable pathway to high-frequency GaN HEMTs that harmonize noise and power performance.},

Through a rational design, the bilayer IZO/IYZO TFT exhibits the best performance with a V th of 0.2 V and μ FE of 32.6 cm 2 /V s. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy band structure analysis demonstrated that, in the IZO/IYZO TFT, a 6-nm highly conductive ultrathin IZO provided free electrons and electron transfer from the IZO layer to the IYZO layer with the formation of band bending, thus increased the carrier mobility of devices. In addition, the 20-nm-thick IYZO layer controlled N e and V th by forming a potential barrier (0.38 eV), thereby increasing stability. Moreover, the experimental characterization revealed that Y doping can reduce the carrier concentration, oxygen vacancies, surface defects, and other trap densities of devices. Therefore, the IZO/IYZO TFT demonstrated the best stability with small V th shifts of −0.9, 0.8, −1.1, and 1.0 V under negative gate bias stress, positive gate bias stress, negative gate bias light illumination stress, and positive gate bias light illumination stress measurements.

This enhancement was achieved through fabrication of a micro-mesh p-electrode (p-GaN/metals) and scattering nanostructures on the p-side of the device to obtain both high electrical efficiency and enhanced light extraction efficiency (LEE). The micro-mesh p-electrode structure minimizes DUV light absorption by removing a part of the p-GaN layer while maintaining good electrical conduction. The scattering nanostructures, which consist of truncated HfO 2 cones, redirect guided light effectively into the escape cone, thus improving the LEE significantly. As a result, the WPE reached 9.1% at an injection current of 12 mA and an emission wavelength of 275 nm. This efficiency was enhanced by approximately 1.7 times when compared with that of conventional DUV-LEDs, in which a p-electrode structure covers the entire mesa. Although the micro-mesh p-electrode was used to reduce DUV light absorption, high electrical efficiency of 90% was demonstrated, with a drive voltage of as low as 4.8 V at 12 mA. These experimental results show good agreement with the results of three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations.},

  abstract     = {It is known that field electron emission (FE) characteristics of emitters are influenced by their flexibility, as bending under an applied electrostatic field, E P ⁠ , can significantly increase their characteristic field enhancement factor and emission current. However, this effect has not been thoroughly studied. In this Letter, a numerical algorithm is developed to investigate the impact of electrostatic forces on the FE properties of a flexible metallic carbon nanotube (CNT), classically modeled as a cylinder with a hemi-spherical cap, as a function of E P ⁠ , its sharpness aspect ratio, and its initial (assumed to be fixed) angle θ 0 of inclination with the substrate, i.e., the horizontal emitter's plate. Our numerical simulations are based on an iterative process to include the mechanical stress problem and resulting bending of the CNT, taking into account its finite Young's modulus and the electrostatic problem due to the redistribution of surface charges on the emitter until a convergent solution is found. The process is repeated as a function of E P ⁠ . Importantly, it is found that the emitted current of the bendable CNT can be several orders of magnitude larger than those for the case when the emitter is modeled as a rigid body. Moreover, the curvatures of the Murphy–Good plots predicted theoretically align with those observed experimentally in FE from carbon-based materials under the high E P limit, where protrusion deflection effects are likely to influence emission. Therefore, our findings highlight the necessity of considering the flexibility of nanoscale field emitters to accurately interpret their FE characteristics.},

This paper introduces a sandwich pMUT (SpMUT) designed to enhance ultrasound transmission and reception. The SpMUT features a silicon substrate with a scandium aluminum nitride thin film, a dual electrode layer, and a three dimensional printed horn. The horn acts as a mechanical intermediary, amplifying the mechanical strain generated by the piezoelectric layer or an external sound field. Our experiments yielded a fractional bandwidth of −6 dB at 107% with a center frequency of 421 kHz in water. By optimizing the ratio of the horn's back and front diameters, we achieved maximum amplification factors of 8.59 for transmission and 8.1 for reception.

Systematic reduction of the sputtering oxygen flow rate during a-IGZO film deposition from 6 to 4.5 sccm and subsequently to 3 sccm resulted in a progressive decrease in the Schottky barrier height to 0.94 and 0.85 eV, respectively. This could be attributed to the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies in a-IGZO, which induces changes in bandwidth as confirmed by further ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations.

  abstract     = {The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) is an antisymmetric exchange interaction that favors noncollinear spin configurations and plays an essential role in high-density, low-power magnetic memories. In general, DMI exists in magnetic systems with inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin–orbit coupling. It can also be induced by interface engineering, chemisorption, and so on. However, tailoring DMI by all-electrical means has yet been illustrated so far. In this paper, we report that DMI can be reversibly induced via electrically controlled proton intercalation in van der Waals magnet Cr 1.2 Te 2 nanoflakes, leading to a large topological Hall resistivity up to 0.47 μ Ω ⋅ cm at 3 K. The magneto-ionically coupling induced sizable DMI is further identified by theoretical calculation in the hydrogen intercalated Cr–Te system. In addition, the protonic gated Cr 1.2 Te 2 nanoflakes exhibit large exchange bias effects at low temperatures, suggesting the emergence of antiferromagnetic phase. Our finding establishes that magneto-ionically coupling can not only control the magnetism but also provide an alternative knob to tailor DMI by all-electrical means, allowing for the searching of unconventional magnetic structures in many more two-dimensional (2D) magnets.},

  abstract     = {Palladium diselenide (PdSe 2 )—a layered van der Waals material—is attracting significant attention for optoelectronics due to the wide tunability of its band gap from the infrared through the visible range as a function of the number of layers. However, there continues to be disagreement over the precise nature and value of the optical band gap of bulk PdSe 2 , owing to the rather small value of this gap that complicates experimental measurements and their interpretation. Here, we design and employ a Wannier-localized optimally tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional to investigate the electronic band structures and optical absorption spectra of bulk and monolayer PdSe 2 . In particular, we account carefully for the finite exciton center-of-mass momentum within a time-dependent WOT-SRSH framework to calculate the indirect optical gap and absorption onset accurately. Our results agree well with the best available photoconductivity measurements, as well as with state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory calculations, confirming that bulk PdSe 2 has an optical gap in the mid-infrared (upper bound of 0.44 eV). More generally, this work further bolsters the utility of the WOT-SRSH approach for predictive modeling of layered semiconductors.},

Here, we introduce a fully strain-relaxed boost layer that functions as a pseudo-substrate, enabling the integration of multiferroic mixed-phase BiFeO 3 (BFO) on silicon. This boost layer not only overcomes the limitations of traditional single-crystal oxide substrates by providing a strain platform but also facilitates the stabilization of BFO mixed phases through strain engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that an external electric field can reversibly switch between these two phases and toggle between distinct polarization states. These results highlight a strain-engineering strategy that advances ferroelectric oxide integration with semiconductor platforms, paving the way for scalable and cost-effective device applications.},

However, the skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) deflects their motion trajectory and often leads to annihilation at nanotrack edges, posing significant challenges for practical spintronic applications. In this work, we proposed an approach to guide skyrmion motion along predefined paths through the engineering of potential well lines, which is achieved by modulating local material parameters, such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy and exchange stiffness constant. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that this method effectively suppresses the SkHE, enabling skyrmions to follow designed trajectories. Additionally, the proposed method facilitates the alignment and sorting of multiple skyrmions from random distributions and proves effective for complex trajectory shapes, such as bends and waves. These findings provide a robust framework for the development of skyrmion-based information processing and storage devices, bridging the gap between theoretical potential and practical implementation.},

  abstract     = {The interested anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that occurs in heavy nonmagnetic metal/ferromagnetic metal systems holds immense promise for AHE-based spintronic devices design. However, the mechanisms are still under debate due to the complicated interfacial spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects. Here, the electronic transport properties of Pt ( t Pt ≤ 6 nm)/Fe 4 N ( t Fe4N ≤ 6 nm)/MgO(sub.) heterostructures were investigated. The sign reversal of Hall resistivity ρ xy occurs in ultrathin Pt/Fe 4 N bilayers. The dependence between AHE resistivity ρ AH and temperature T changes from ρ AH ∝ T to ρ AH ∝− T with decreasing Fe 4 N thickness from 6 to 3 nm in Pt(3 nm)/Fe 4 N( t nm) ( t =6, 5, 4, and 3). Meanwhile, a critical transition temperature T c appears in Pt (3 nm)/Fe 4 N ( t ≤ 5 nm). The changes from ρ xy ∝ T to ρ xy ∝− T and the appearance of T c can be ascribed to the contributions to AHE from the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) and inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). ρ xy induced by MPE increases with increasing temperature, while ρ xy caused by ISHE decreases with increasing temperature in Pt (3 nm)/Fe 4 N ( t ≤ 6 nm). Our work demonstrates that the effects of interfacial SOC on AHE unveil the role of temperature in the sign reversal of ρ xy , which provides a tunable platform for the development of AHE-based spintronic devices by enabling reversible control of Hall response through thermal modulation.},

Our findings reveal two unique and intriguing dynamic mechanisms, which depend on the polarization direction of the spin current: In the first scenario, the magnetic domain wall serves as a track that confines the motion of the bimeron and effectively suppresses the skyrmion Hall effect. In the second scenario, pushing the magnetic domain wall triggers a rapid sliding of the bimeron along the wall. This process significantly enhances the dynamics of the bimeron, resulting in a velocity increase by approximately 40 times compared to skyrmions and bimeron solitons. Our results highlight the potential advantages of the skyrmion Hall effect in developing energy-efficient spintronic devices based on domain wall bimerons.},

The simultaneous nature of the RSXS and Hall transport measurements allowed us to accurately connect various features in the transport data with the specific magnetic phases. We found that the topological Hall effect (THE) shows peaks with opposite signs, which we attribute to two different mechanisms. Our multimodal correlative study indicates that the sign reversal in THE occurs when the system transforms to and from a skyrmion lattice and low density isolated skyrmion phases. We propose that the skyrmion lattice contributes to the THE through a Berry phase induced emergent magnetic field mechanism in one case, and a skew scattering mechanism corresponding to the isolated low density skyrmion state.},

  abstract     = {Silicon carbide (SiC) crystallizes in more than 200 polytypes with various crystal classes, including cubic, hexagonal, and rhombohedral structures. They differ from each other mainly by the stacking order of hexagonal SiC atomic layers. Such superlattice-like stacking modulates the phonon dispersion by folding the single SiC-layer Brillouin zone into smaller ones along the axial direction normal to the atomic layer, resulting in an increased number of phonon branches. Earlier works suggest that these polytypes share a common unfolded phonon dispersion along the axial direction. We show from first principles that this is only true for an axial high-symmetry line. For other general k points such as in the planar k path, strong hybridization between longitudinal and transverse phonons and large avoided crossings are observed. The difference is a direct consequence of a distinctive symmetry decrease for these k points explained by group theory. The strong hybridization and avoided crossing soften the velocity and enhance the scattering of folded acoustic phonons, leading to significant thermal conductivity reduction for complex SiC polytypes, as confirmed by Boltzmann transport calculations with phonon–phonon scattering from first principles. This work provides a unified description and comparison of phonons in SiC polytypes on equal footing and provides physical perspectives into the impact of stacking order on the phonon transport behaviors.},

The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center (OMC) can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial—it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole–dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.},

  abstract     = {Sensitive and selective detection of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) is increasingly critical for both environmental protection and human health. However, current detecting methods are based on metal oxide sensors, which are greatly limited by issues of high energy consumption, low selectivity, and poor environmental compatibility. Herein, we systematically explore the potential of eleven experimentally available transition metal single atoms (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (M–N–C) for NO x detection. It is revealed that Ni–N–C exhibits exceptional selectivity and sensitivity toward NO x , as evidenced by the preferable and moderate adsorption strength and significant changes in microscopic electronic structures and macroscopic current–voltage characteristics. Furthermore, applying proper external electric fields or strains enables to accelerate the recovery of Ni–N–C. This work highlights the promising potential of Ni–N–C for real-time NO x monitoring and offers valuable insight into the application of single-atom catalysts in sensing.},

  abstract     = {InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are promising candidates for the next-generation photonic integrated circuits. We present a design that incorporates an oxidized aperture confined surface grating (OASG) structure, which reduces non-radiative recombination losses and surface optical losses sustained in a device fabricated by conventionally fabrication methods including etching and regrowth. The OASG-DFB laser eliminates the need for ridge waveguide etching and avoids instability in sidewall grating coupling. Experimental results show stable single-mode operation, a maximum output power of 15.1 mW, a side-mode suppression ratio of 44 dB, and a narrow linewidth of 1.79 MHz. This approach simplifies fabrication, reduces costs, and enhances the scalability of GaAs-based QD DFB lasers for applications in optical communication and photonic integration.},

In this work, we report on the experimental findings that demonstrate the remarkable dissociation of N 2 pairs into N i atoms in NCZ silicon quenched from an isothermal anneal at a high temperature in the range of 1050–1250 °C. Moreover, it is found that the N i atoms dissociated from the N 2 pairs at a high temperature can revert to the N 2 pairs at a lower temperature.

  abstract     = {Spin depolarization dynamics of wurtzite GaN under hydrostatic pressure was investigated by combining a time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy with a diamond-anvil cell technique. Upon resonant excitation with bandgap energy, spin polarization of electrons is observed to be robust up to several gigapascals. It is found that the spin depolarization is significantly accelerated due to the generation of non-radiative recombination centers induced by hydrostatic pressure, while the electron spin relaxation time shows a weak dependence on pressure. This observation is attributed to the wide bandgap of wurtzite GaN, which leads to an almost unchanged Rashba spin–orbit coupling within the pressure range of several gigapascals. Based on the D'yakonov–Perel' model, the effects of hydrostatic pressure and biaxial strain induced by the substrate on electron spin relaxation time are estimated in GaN epilayers. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanism of spin relaxation and are crucial for spin manipulation in the development of GaN-based spintronic devices.},

Here, we demonstrate an epitaxial stabilization of the ITO polytype having Rh 2 O 3 -II-type (space group: Pbna ) orthorhombic structure using an orthorhombic perovskite oxide (110) DyScO 3 (DSO) substrate. Distorted-orthorhombic ITO (o-ITO) films could be epitaxially grown at substrate temperatures of approximately 350 °C. The epitaxial relationships were determined to be ITO[100]//DSO[100] and ITO[001]//DSO[001], whereas the [010] of ITO was slightly inclined relative to that of DSO because of the strain effect. The transport properties of a distorted o-ITO film were better than those of a bixbyite-type ITO film grown on yttria-stabilized zirconia substrate, indicating that o-ITO has a potential of high-performance oxide semiconductor contributing to future electronics.},

However, the issue of fast ion migration in the materials, inducing operational instability problem, has not been well understood yet. Herein, we investigated degree of ease and pathways of ion migration in CsPbBr 3 using density functional theory calculations, examining both defect formation energies and migration barriers. Our findings indicate that Cs and Br are the most diffusing ions with the assistance of corresponding vacancies ( V Cs and V Br ) under various phases, exhibiting different activation energies. The Fermi level influences both defect formation energies and migration barriers, thereby changing the migration activation energies. Nonetheless, whether it changes the predominant migrating ion species depends on the phase. Our study elucidates the ongoing debate about the dominant transporting species between A-site vs X-site ions proposed by different research groups, providing valuable insights into identifying ways of mitigating the ion migration effect and improving perovskite-based devices.},

  abstract     = {Low-energy ferroelectric photocurrent switches hold promise for optoelectronic devices and digital logic gates. Pressure, a clean and efficient method for microstructure tuning, can significantly affect the polarization photocurrent relaxation process. Upon negative poling, the photocurrent switching in a narrow bandgap ferroelectric BaFe 4 O 7 single crystal from a negative direction to a positive direction during polarization photocurrent relaxation was observed under pressure. Notably, this photocurrent switching time (τ) is boosted up by more than ten folds, from 0.2 to 5 GPa, followed by a slow reduction to around 20 GPa. The very low pressure (0.2 GPa) that induces the PPR process and the τ tuned by slight lattice distortions highlight the feasibility of environmental pressure control of PPR in ferroelectric materials for practical applications. This pressure-induced behavior arises from the coupled effect of the ferroelectric remanent field and micro-ferroelectric domain relaxation process after the external poling electric field is removed. The broad range of switching times under pressure allows one to precisely control the photoelectric switch applications.},

The metasurface is composed of micro-perforated panels coupled with extended-neck Helmholtz resonators, forming a unit absorber referred to as Helmholtz resonator absorber (MHA). Experimental results demonstrate that a 48 mm deep MHA achieves near-perfect sound absorption (>97%) at 150 Hz. This performance is realized with a sub-wavelength thickness of only 1/48 of the operating wavelength and a volume-normalized wavelength ratio of 1/54. Additionally, the MHA exhibits a half-absorption bandwidth of 48 Hz. To broaden the sound absorption bandwidth while keeping the total area constant and to further reduce the total thickness, a configuration integrating three Compact MHA (CMHA) units is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the CMHA achieves an average sound absorption coefficient (SAC) exceeding 0.74 in the 300–500 Hz range with an overall thickness of only 27.5 mm and an SAC > 0.88 in the 543–945 Hz range with a reduced thickness of 26.2 mm.

These applications require compact, easily integrated, and high-performance devices, so the development of highly efficient broadband single-layer structures for vortex generation and control is an extremely relevant research topic. Here, we propose an aperiodic transmissive all-dielectric metasurface, which controls the phase delay of the electromagnetic waves via Pancharatnam–Berry (PB) phase manipulation. The metasurface is constructed on the basis of TiO 2 nanopillars in the form of an aperiodic golden angle (GA) Vogel spiral. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the metasurface enables the generation of vortex waves with a desired topological charge l and high mode purity over a wide wavelength range from 470 to 580 nm, which indicates a relative bandwidth of 21%. The proposed metasurface platform, due to its simple structure and wide bandwidth, is a good candidate for manipulating ultrashort vortex pulses and for the developing optical devices with improved functionality and performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a metamaterial (MTM)-based resonant structure and applies it to relativistic magnetrons (RMs) with an all-cavity axial extraction technique. The MTM structure is designed to overcome the size limitations of conventional RMs and enable π -mode operation below the cutoff frequency of traditional structures. High-frequency analysis confirms the double-negative characteristics of the MTM structure, enabling π -mode operation below the cutoff frequency. Particle-in-cell simulation of CST was employed to compare the performance of the MTM RM with a state-of-the-art traditional design under an identical operating condition. Consequently, for L -band designs, the MTM RM achieves a significant reduction in volume, the radius being 70% of the traditional design, leading to approximately a 50% volume reduction, while other performance metrics such as operating current, startup time, saturation time, output power, efficiency, and frequency are nearly the same as the traditional RM. The study thus validates the potential of MTMs in enhancing the performance and miniaturization of RMs without compromising efficiency or operational mechanisms.},

Here, we report the improved carrier mobility of diamond(100) enabled by surface modification with two-dimensional doped hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN). The energetically optimized structures of diamond(100)/ h -BN heterojunctions doped with Mg or Si at different atomic layer positions are studied through first principles calculations. The interaction between impurity atoms in h -BN to the diamond surface is particularly investigated according to the doping position. Surprisingly, when Mg doping at the interfacial layer of h -BN/diamond, specifically in the second h -BN layer from the interface, a considerably high hole mobility (∼2645 cm 2 /Vs) is achieved, in strong contrast to the same doping with Si. The mechanism of interfacial doping enhancement in hole mobility is specially studied. The results of this work provide potential routes for developing high mobility diamond-based electronic devices through surface modifications via h -BN.},

Herein, we develop an analytical model to study the interface charge separation and migration in CuInP 2 S 6 /AsSBr (CIPS/ASB) heterostructures. We reveal the influence of polarization reversal on the photovoltaic phenomenon using the tunable interface transport properties by modulating band alignment and built-in electric field. The results reveal that the interfacial electron mobility arises two orders of magnitude with the polarization reversal from up to down ward, which leads to the short circuit current and power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhanced by two times. Moreover, we find the thickness of CIPS and interface roughness play an important role in determining the optoelectronic properties as well, and suggest the optimal PCE can be obtained with ∼15 nm CIPS. Our method provides a general approach to deal with the optoelectronic properties and offers a guidance for improving the photovoltaic performances of ferroelectric-based nanodevices.},

  abstract     = {Severe thermal damage to biological tissue resulting from active electrosurgical electrodes often causes corresponding tissue adhesion and reduces cutting efficiency during the surgery process. The introduction of superhydrophobic surfaces has been proven to be an effective approach for thermal damage reduction and anti-adhesion. However, the heat transfer phenomenon, especially the effect of superhydrophobic microstructures on the electrodes, has not been fully illustrated. In this study, we investigated the water droplet behavior on a superhydrophobic micro-channel (SHMC) surface and bubble dynamics of identically structured electrodes under thermal and thermoelectric coupling fields. The thicker vapor film, caused by the trapped air within microstructures on the SHMC surface, resulted in a reduced evaporation speed of droplets. Moreover, under the thermo-electric coupling field, the SHMC surface exhibited notable three-stage bubble evolution compared to the flat surface: Enhanced bubble coalescence in the initial stage, attributed to accelerated single bubble growth rates; Surface-wide nucleation with subsequent adhesion and merging events in the transition stage; Sustained tip-encapsulation in the stable stage, resulting from increased bubble generation frequency and extended departure diameters. The vapor film that continuously encapsulates the microstructures alters the heat transfer mode from thermal convection to thermal conduction and radiation, inhibiting the heat transfer of the SHMC surface. Consequently, the heat dissipation performance is enhanced, reducing the thermal damage to the biological tissue. These findings provide support for understanding the thermal damage-reducing mechanism of superhydrophobic surfaces on electrosurgical electrodes.},

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that most of these advantages and issues are closely related to the soft nature of perovskites, making the understanding of these properties increasingly important. Here, we summarize and assess the interrelated origins and impacts of this unique property as well as its mechanistic interpretations, ranging from the constituent ions to the perovskite lattice and electronic structures.

The use of heterodyne technology further establishes a foundation for high-precision digital communication. However, current signal solvers limit its application in integrated radar-communication systems. To address this, we propose a multi-parameter mapping model between Rydberg heterodyne communication symbols and the receiver signals under radar interference. Based on this model, we introduce an adaptive signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based hybrid (ASIRH) solver for adaptive decoupling in the presence of wide power range radar interference, using the established Rydberg heterodyne small-sample dataset to update the solver parameters. We employ a Cs Rydberg atomic receiver to implement a single-channel 4-state frequency-shift keying digital communication protocol. The ASIRH model's solving capability is validated within the SIR range of −20 to 28 dB, demonstrating performance with an symbol error rate of less than 3.97% under communication conditions with a data rate of 80 kSym/s and a carrier amplitude of 50 μ V / cm ⁠ .

However, relaxation in miniature cells is dominated by interactions with the cell wall, which limits the performance of a chip-scale sensor that uses noble gases. While 129 Xe wall relaxation times have previously been limited to 10s of seconds in mm-sized cells, we demonstrate the first anodically bonded batch-fabricated cells with dual 3 He- 129 Xe isotopes and 87 Rb in a 6 mm 3 volume with 3 He and 129 Xe T 2 coherence times of, respectively, 4 h and 300 s. We use these microfabricated cells in a dual noble gas comagnetometer and discuss its limits.},

  abstract     = {The half-Heusler TiNiSn alloy is a promising candidate for thermoelectric power generation, capable of directly converting waste heat into electric power, due to its high thermoelectric performance over a wide temperature range from 500 to 1000 K. However, the thermoelectric performance of p-type TiNiSn is much lower than that of its n-type counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that Hf substitution in the p-type half-Heusler TiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn alloy significantly enhances thermoelectric performance within the miscibility gap region of the binary TiNiSn-HfNiSn phase diagram. The Seebeck coefficient, which is below 80 μ V/K for TiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn, is substantially improved to 170 μ V/K in Ti 0.5 Hf 0.5 Ni 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn at 650 K, owing to modifications in the electronic band structure induced by Hf substitution. Moreover, the lattice distortion and point defects introduced by Hf substitution effectively reduce thermal conductivity, from 5.0 W/mK for TiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn to 3.3 W/mK for Ti 0.5 Hf 0.5 Ni 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn at 900 K. Consequently, the thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) significantly increases from 0.03 for TiNi 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn to 0.26 for Ti 0.5 Hf 0.5 Ni 0.8 Co 0.2 Sn at 800 K. This enhancement of thermoelectric performance in p-type TiNiSn enables the construction of thermoelectric modules composed solely of half-Heusler TiNiSn based alloys, which are expected to exhibit high thermal stability useful for long-term thermoelectric power generation.},

Tungsten nitride (W 2 N) offers enormous potential as an anode material for ASCs, ascribed to its substantial specific capacitance, massive electrical conductivity, and extended negative potential window. In this work, we fabricated a durable coin cell and flexible ASC utilizing W 2 N/SSM fibrous nanograins for the anode and TiN/SSM nanopyramids for the cathode, both deposited over flexible stainless steel mesh (SSM) substrate using the DC magnetron sputtering technique. The W 2 N/SSM//TiN/SSM ASC device demonstrates a high areal capacitance of 21.3 mF cm −2 , operating across a wide and stable electrochemical voltage window of 1.3 V, with outstanding cycling robustness, demonstrating 89.09% retention over 8000 charge–discharge cycles. Notably, the ASC achieved a high energy density of 34.33 mWh.cm −3 and a high power density of 17.32 W.cm −3 . The persistent electrochemical performance of ASC is mainly attributed to the dominance of surface-controlled capacitive and pseudocapacitive charge storage kinetics of W 2 N/SSM for Na + ions, as comprehensively examined employing 3D Bode and Dunn's techniques. The flexible ASC shows remarkable mechanical stability of 92.36% over 500 bending cycles. This study establishes the potential of W 2 N nanograins as a high-energy anode material, revealing its capability to increase the effectiveness of ASC for portable and miniaturized energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Structural energy storage combines energy storage with structural strength, reducing weight, saving space, and improving efficiency. Among various types, transparent structural energy storage shows strong potential for seamless integration into windows, screens, surfaces, consumer electronics, and automotive applications. Developing new electrode designs with environmentally abundant materials is essential to achieving global decarbonization goals and the net-zero target. In this work, we developed a transparent electrochemical capacitor (TEC) as a structural energy storage using aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) film prepared by radio frequency sputtering on an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass. We observed that the excellent electrical properties of the AZO film including high carrier concentration 6.54 × 10 20 cm −3 , Hall mobility 25.8 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , and resistivity 3.7 × 10 −4 Ω cm contributed to enhancing the electrochemical performance of the TEC. The prepared transparent AZO exhibits a high specific capacitance of 44.4 μ F cm −2 at 1 mV s −1 for a three-electrode study in a liquid electrolyte. The TEC fabricated using gel electrolyte shows a specific capacitance of 5.93 μ F cm −2 at 1 mV s −1 . We observed that both the electrochemical double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance contributed to the charge storage in TEC, which was measured using Dunn's method. The double-glazed window shape of the TEC exhibits its promising potential for implementation as structural energy storage in smart buildings. We demonstrated TEC performance under various temperatures (−10 to 30 °C), its transparency of about 85% in the visible light range, and its integration capabilities with solar cells. This TEC aims to develop a structural element for smart buildings or autonomous electric vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Silicon holds significant potential as a material for future quantum processors. Transistors built in silicon-on-insulator technology and functioning as silicon qubit devices can be fabricated using industry-standard processes, allowing for easy integration with classical control hardware. However, achieving precise management of carrier transfer within the transistor channel is essential, requiring the elimination of electrically active defects that could act as recombination centers. Optimizing such a device demands a detailed characterization of the channel to assess the material purity. This study examines the presence of defects in the channel of fully depleted silicon-on-insulator transistors designed for qubit applications. Source and drain electrodes were connected together and voltage pulses were applied to the gate contact to perform capacitance deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements. Electrical simulations conducted using Sentaurus device simulator were used to figure out the extension of the depleted region in the channel. By adjusting the gate voltages, we were able to probe the channel and localize the electrically active defects responsible for DLTS signals. Three dominant hole traps were detected at, respectively, 0.54, 0.57, and 0.65 eV above the valence band edge in the source/drain regions and were associated with bulk and Si/SiO 2 interface defects. Their origin is likely related to the damage produced during the formation of p-doping by implantation. This study highlights not only the high quality of the channel material below the gate stack but also the need to keep the source and drain regions far from the gate edges to improve the qubit stability.},

These oscillations show a pronounced temperature dependence, with both the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations in current exhibiting significant changes as the temperature is varied. Furthermore, when a magnetic field is applied, the device demonstrates positive magneto current, which we associate with the suppression of weak localization effects in the carriers at low temperatures. The magneto-current and magnetoresistance are also strongly correlated with temperature, as validated by the temperature-dependent measurements.

In this study, we analyze the potential of all-inorganic perovskite betavoltaic batteries. The metal electrode commonly used in perovskite cell devices, such as Au, has a large effect on β particle incidence. MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) have excellent electrical conductivity, while their loose and porous structure reduces the effect on β particle incidence, which is an ideal electrode for betavoltaic nuclear batteries. Therefore, we propose the FTO/TiO 2 /CsPbBr 3 /NiO x /MWCNT structure and explore the prospects of CsPbBr 3 in betavoltaic batteries through simulations and experiments. The simulation results in an open-circuit voltage (V o c ) of 0.53 V, a short-circuit current (J s c ) of 21.53 nA cm −2 , a maximum output power (P m ) of 9.05 nW cm −2 , and a conversion efficiency ( ⁠ η ⁠ ) of 2.9%.

Moreover, the bionic-kestrel vision behaviors are exhibited, such as the in-site enhanced color object images and the improved recognition accuracy from 58% to 93.1% due to the contribution of UV negative response.

  abstract     = {We utilize ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy to investigate photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics in the topological materials LaSbTe and CeSbTe. Our results reveal that the relaxation dynamics in both materials are characterized by two distinct decay channels. In LaSbTe, the amplitude of the photoinduced reflectivity related to the first decay channel exhibits two pronounced peaks at 163 and 280 K, whereas in CeSbTe, a single peak emerges at 165 K. These observations are strongly indicative of charge-density-wave phase transition(s). Notably, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time for this decay process in CeSbTe deviates from that in LaSbTe, probably due to the influence of 4 f electrons. For the second decay process, LaSbTe exhibits behaviors dominated by phonon-assisted electron–hole recombination, while CeSbTe demonstrates a slower relaxation at low temperatures, possibly due to the imbalance between electron- and hole-type carriers. Furthermore, two coherent phonon modes around 1 and 3 THz are identified in both LaSbTe and CeSbTe. Remarkably, the phonon amplitudes in CeSbTe exhibit an unusual decrease with decreasing temperature until a very low temperature, which can potentially be ascribed to spin–phonon interactions. These findings reveal nonequilibrium charge dynamics and collective excitation in LaSbTe and CeSbTe, offering insights into the underlying physics of topological materials.},

  abstract     = {The family of transition metal dichlorides are recently found to be ferrovalley materials, exhibiting desirable spontaneous valley polarization that is a key to practical applications. In this work, Janus monolayer H-FeClBr is investigated as a case study by performing first-principles calculations. We focus on the giant correlation and many-body and exciton effects that will essentially modulate the electronic, valleytronic, and optical properties. The H-FeClBr presents strong ferromagnetism and spin–orbit coupling, giving rise to large spontaneous valley polarization. Due to the enormous electron correlation of the localized d electrons of the Fe atoms, the energy gap calculated using Hubbard U and hybrid functional HSE06 is extraordinarily widened by about seven times with respect to the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) counterpart. As a result, the orbitals in valley bands are exchanged, the sign of the valley Berry curvatures is switched, and the valley polarization is reversed. The GW calculations further enhance the gap significantly to about 4 eV, which is close to ten times that of the PBE gap and indicative of very strong many-body effects. The exciton spectrum obtained by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equations reveals colossal electron–hole interaction, giving rise to a giant exciton binding energies of ∼1.54 eV. Corresponding to the optical excitation in the two inequivalent valleys with unequal gaps, there are two split exciton peaks, as opposed to the A and B exciton peaks in MoS 2 spectrum, which correspond to the optical transitions in the same valley.},

By integrating a mirror symmetry into the structure, we are able to observe the existence of two pairs of chiral edge states due to a hidden chiral symmetry even though the original structure itself does not exhibit chirality. We uncover the existence of the hidden symmetry and unearth the topology for the origin of chiral edge state pairs using winding number of a subspace Hamiltonian. The measured dispersion and localization of sound on the edges verify the observations in theory and simulations. This study not only enriches our understanding of acoustic topological systems but also provides a framework applicable to other physical contexts.},

Spin–orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interaction induce valley-layer locking when the bilayer is ferromagnetic, however, spin-layer locking appears for the case of antiferromagnetic states. The inequivalent interlayer antiferroelectric couplings correspond to different magnetic ground states, and the antiferroelectric states can be switched through the breathing process, so the ferroelectric, magnetic, and valley properties can be simultaneously modulated. Through first-principles calculations, we also predict a favorable breathing Kagome bilayer W 3 Br 8 , where the above coupling mechanism and tunable layer-locked valley Hall effects can be achieved.

This method implants a TiNO x thin layer, which reduces leakage current and increases breakdown voltage (V bd ), leading to better device endurance. It can also effectively promote the formation of orthogonal phase and inhibit tetragonal phase during the wake-up process, which contributes to reducing V c . Therefore, the proposed 5 nm H 0.5 Z 0.5 O 2 (HZO) FTJ exhibits excellent performances, such as low V c (0.49 V), small V c /V bd ratio (19.1%), high endurance (>10 11 ), and high double remanent polarization (2P r = 41 μ C/cm 2 ), which are the frontier of the reported HfO 2 -based FTJ.

Consideration of the contributions of both ε and P r is particularly important in a unipolar electric field operation, such as on/off field switching used in device applications. Direct Δ T measurements were also performed based on the lock-in thermography technique to verify the accuracy of the Δ T intensity estimated by the indirect method. The indirect and direct Δ T values were largely consistent. The Δ T intensity near the peak temperature of Δ T was dominated by the P r contribution; a large ∂ P r / ∂ T was necessary to increase the overall Δ T magnitude. In contrast, a large ∂ ε / ∂ T was essential to expand the operating temperature range of Δ T at temperatures higher than the dielectric maximum temperature. Quantitative understanding of the contributions of both ε and P r to Δ T in unipolar electric fields is expected to guide the search for materials with a superior ECE.},

The temperature dependence of α E exhibits a peak at the magnetic transition temperature T C in zero magnetic field, evidencing an enhanced magnetoelectric effect near the phase boundary. When a DC magnetic field is applied along either a - or b -axis, the peak position of α E shifts continuously to a higher temperature while the peak amplitude reaches the maximum at a critical field and decays for higher magnetic fields. The obtained magnetoelectric phase diagram suggests that the maximum dynamic magnetoelectric effect occurs in a region above T C where short-range magnetic correlations play a crucial role and the peak is due to a metamagnetic transition. The measurements of the magnetostrictive coefficient dλ/d H reveal that the magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the magnetoelastic coupling.

This breakthrough facilitates field-free switching (FFS) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) under the influence of z -polarization. Despite this progress, a significant challenge persists in lowering the switching current density (J SW ) in SOT devices, which remains roughly an order of magnitude higher than in spin-transfer torque devices. We incorporated an ultra-thin (1 nm) copper (Cu) spacer into a tri-layer SOT structure where the orange peel effect likely arose. This ultra-thin Cu layer, combined with the optimized Pt-based SO layer, resulted in approximately a 35% reduction in J SW compared to the scenario without Cu insertion. The damping-like torque efficiency was analyzed concerning the FFS performance at optimized Cu spacer thickness to support the finding of J SW reduction. Using magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements and micromagnetic simulations, we identified domain nucleation as the primary mechanism driving FFS, confirming the role of z-polarization in reducing J SW effectively. This study proposes a design that simultaneously addresses three key challenges of PMA, J SW , and FFS in current SOT systems.},

  abstract     = {With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to the scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl 6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal ( T ) and time-inversion ( TI ) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.},

When the current is applied parallel to the domain wall, both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin–orbit torque (SOT) can drive the DWSK along the domain wall. Conversely, for currents applied perpendicular to the domain wall, STT can induce DWSK motion by leveraging the skyrmion Hall effect as a driving force, whereas SOT-driven DWSKs halt their motion after sliding along the domain wall. Furthermore, we demonstrated the current-driven motion of DWSKs along curved domain walls and proposed a racetrack memory architecture utilizing DWSKs.

In this study, we report the generation of a large charge-to-spin conversion and bidirectional OOP-SOT by engineering a vertical magnetization gradient within a Co/Ho multilayer system. Exploiting the antiferromagnetic coupling between Co and Ho, the magnetization gradient up to 16.8 (emu/cm −3 )/nm was achieved by gradually varying the Ho layer thickness from 0.4 to 0.9 nm. The presence of the OOP-SOT was confirmed through Hall resistance-field loop shift measurements, which has been attributed to the broken symmetry in spin current reflection and transmission in the Co/Ho multilayer with vertical magnetic property gradients. Additionally, the effective field of the OOP-SOT is strongly correlated with the direction of the magnetization gradient, measured to be around +0.7 and –2.5 Oe/mA for the positive and negative magnetization gradients, respectively. Furthermore, the largest SOT in the Co/Ho multilayer with a negative gradient was observed compared to the positive gradient and uniform Co/Ho multilayer structures. The enhanced SOT is attributed to the bulk Rashba field generated by the gradient structure, along with increased spin polarization. The results demonstrated here provide a promising approach for utilizing magnetization gradients for the development of efficient, current-driven spin-based storage and logic devices.},

  abstract     = {The electrical resistance change of a device when subjected to applied magnetic fields is essential for magnetoresistive magnetometers as well as for studying fundamental transport phenomena in condensed matter. One of the largest magnetoresistances at room temperature is observed in extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) devices composed of high-mobility materials with metal inclusions. However, the contact resistance between the constituent materials is often detrimental to their performance. In this work, we study the influence of the interface-near region on the performance of EMR devices using a numerical model, which mimics local doping, carrier depletion, and mobility degradation by independently varying the carrier density and mobility of an interfacial layer. We show that the magnetoresistance decreases by five orders of magnitude when the specific contact resistance increases from 10 − 5 to 10 − 2 Ω cm 2 ⁠ . Our results also show that it is beneficial to increase the conductivity of the interface layer, even at the expense of degrading either its carrier density or mobility. This study paves the way for designing contacting strategies for realizing high-performing EMR devices.},

In this article, we demonstrate a C-H diamond FET with low work function gadolinia (Gd 2 O 3 ) gate materials. For the 4 μ m gate length ( L G ) Gd 2 O 3 C-H diamond FET, the device demonstrates an obvious enhancement-mode with a threshold voltage of −1.3 V. Besides, the maximum source/drain current density and the leakage current density are −80.0 mA/mm and 1.6 × 10 −6 A/cm 2 at a gate voltage of −7 V, respectively. Moreover, the device demonstrates a saturation carrier mobility of 437.3 cm 2 /V · s. Accordingly, this enhancement-mode C-H diamond Gd 2 O 3 FET demonstrates high performance with relatively high source/drain current density and low leakage current density, which will provide a strategy for the development of enhancement-mode C-H diamond FETs significantly.},

However, there are limited reports on the integration of high-quality h-BN within III-nitride systems. We have fabricated thickness-controllable h-BN on a step-flow AlN template using a two-step growth method through metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Due to the formation of etched AlN defects during the one-step growth, h-BN grown at 1460 °C presents disordered layer growth near the defect region, adversely impacting the subsequent uniformity of the h-BN. In contrast, h-BN grown by two-step process exhibits well-defined layered alignment parallel to the interface, with strong x-ray diffraction peaks at 26.7° and narrow Raman E 2g peak, due to reducing epitaxial defects at the interface. Finally, high-quality well-ordered h-BN is achieved and wafer-scale mechanical exfoliation of h-BN epilayer has been realized with a clean surface. This work presents the significance of substrate thermal stability during the MOCVD process and highlights the great potential in the fabrication of flexible devices.},

Multiple mechanisms related to efficiency loss are independently examined, including injection efficiency, carrier density vs current density relationship, phase space filling, quantum-confined Stark effect, and Coulomb enhancement. An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in these InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for QWs having constant In composition. Despite improved control of deep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an imbalance in enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger–Meitner recombination coefficients. The imbalance in enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with QW thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device performance.},

Here, we predict a class of ideal intrinsic magnetic topological insulators naturally featuring a nontrivial flatband in the two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb-kagome lattices X 2 Rb 3 ( X =Cr, Mo, W). In the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), these monolayers are spin-polarized half-semimetals with a twofold degenerate nodal point and a flatband appearing at the Fermi level simultaneously. With SOC included, a significant bandgap (168 meV for W 2 Rb 3 ) opens up at the band touching point, and the flatband that spans the whole Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number ( C = 1). The topological property calculations verify that X 2 Rb 3 monolayers are intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall effect materials. Due to the similarity to 2D continuum Landau levels, the striking nontrivial flatband in X 2 Rb 3 makes it an ideal platform to investigate the flatband physics, such as the realization of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in real materials.},

The observed asymmetric behavior in the former scenario is attributed to the destructive interference among the edge waves. In the latter scenario, we elucidate this phenomenon by analyzing the spatial Fourier spectrum.

To investigate the origin of such a “threshold lowering” phenomenon, ion-implantation-induced softened phonon modes and lattice distortion as well as FsLDW-induced self-assembly of NPs and ferroelectric domain inversion are both analyzed, and the synergistic action of these effects is found to be the key factor.

In this work, starting from the physical origin, we propose that the charge redistribution is an effective strategy for decreasing Schottky barrier height (SBH), subsequently leading to a reduction in contact resistivity. Guided by this perspective, first-principles calculations are utilized to investigate the effect of a series of metal dopants on the SBH in the NiSi/Si system. The Φ B e values of NiSi/Si can be reduced to 0.27, 0.28, and 0.22 eV in Sc, Ti, and Zr doped systems, respectively. Especially for the Zr dopant, it can achieve ultra-low contact resistivity of 2.30 × 10 −9 Ω cm 2 , which can be ascribed to the dominant charge redistribution effect. In contrast, high electronegativity dopants like Au and Ir increase Φ B e ⁠ . Dopant diffusion and concentration effects are also examined, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. This work provides a useful theoretical guidance in reducing contact resistivity for 3D integration.},

  abstract     = {The existence of random media is challenging in optical imaging, as the existing approaches usually cannot work well when the optical channel exhibits a certain level of randomness. Here, we report an automated adaptive correction scheme for single-pixel imaging through random media. An alternating projection method is developed to reconstruct an object from light intensities recorded by a single-pixel detector. A series of scaling factors are incorporated into object reconstruction to correct wave distortions induced by random media. With the introduced scaling factors, an essential relationship between collected and theoretical light intensities is revealed. It is illustrated that the proposed corrections on the realizations do not require prior knowledge about random media, and can be adapted to various real-world scenarios. High-quality imaging through random media can always be realized in experiments, and the proposed approach opens up an avenue for high-quality imaging through random media in various applications.},

This paper introduces an enhanced reflectance difference spectroscopy imaging technique that can simultaneously determine the optical anisotropy principal axis of ReSe 2 across a range of thicknesses, from monolayers to bulk forms. Additionally, it presents a method for modulating the optical anisotropy principal axis of strongly anisotropic materials by overlaying them with isotropic materials via mechanical exfoliation, thereby creating van der Waals heterostructures. Overall, this research not only establishes a straightforward and practical optical technique for accurately identifying the optical anisotropy principal axis but also offers a viable strategy for controlling optical anisotropy.},

However, noise from ambient light and detector poses great challenges to its application. In this work, we present a phase-locked single pixel imaging (PL-SPI) technique that uses a lock-in amplifier (LIA) as detector. With the assistance of tunable illumination, the LIA can extract both amplitude and phase from weak signals. It enables the PL-SPI system to reconstruct images under condition of very low signal-to-noise ratio (<−52 dB) and to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) information with a thickness resolution of approximately 3 mm. It is anticipated that PL-SPI will provide a promising solution for weak signal and 3D imaging applications.},

  abstract     = {Achieving laser-induced periodic surface structures with both excellent regularity and high tunability is a challenging task. In this study, we address this challenge by utilizing a hybrid film structure, comprising an amorphous silicon coating on a copper film, to create periodic structures through a photochemical reaction induced by laser-plasmon interference. Our experiments, corroborated by numerical simulations, demonstrate a significant decrease in structural periodicity from 1020 to 750 nm with an increase in silicon film thickness from 15 to 70 nm. This corresponds to a tuning sensitivity of 4.6 ± 0.28, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of previously reported single-layer films. This substantial tunability is due to the high refractive index of silicon, where even slight thickness variations significantly alter the effective refractive index near the metal surface, thereby modulating the plasmonic wavelength. Additionally, we investigated the influence of laser pulse durations and repetition rates on laser-induced periodic surface structure periodicity and found them to have negligible effects.},

These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio frequency operation. Here, we show that ICL FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at λ ∼ 4.2 μ m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified shifted wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free running operation. Further, we show that, through active mode-locking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell–Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (∼100 ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.},

The 3D-RSM results reveal that epitaxial YBCO c domains dominate the films, with minor YBCO a domains in YBCO/LAO. The YBCO c domains present a consistent epitaxial relationship with the substrate STO and LAO, with the domain boundary parallel to the substrate [110] or [ 1 ¯ 10] axes. In contrast, YBCO/MgO films exhibit two distinct in-plane epitaxy orientations. Quantitatively measured lattice constants indicate the possible T c -related oxygen vacancy condition therein. A 2-in. YBCO/MgO film, prepared by a homemade pulsed laser deposition system, verified the structural non-uniformity issues, suggesting room for further optimization.

  abstract     = {Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLSs). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor Q i as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of Q i at low powers over periods of 12–16 h (relative standard deviation σ Q i / Q i = 13 % ⁠ ). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips, and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power Q i fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence, due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Graphite anodes are widely regarded as key components for achieving high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, research on the multiscale effects of anode microstructures remains lacking in depth. The influence of transport and reaction processes within the microstructure on overall battery performance requires a coupling investigation integrating both electrochemical and physical field data. In this study, we construct a two-dimensional (2D) multi-physics model and simulate the 2D geometry and internal electrochemical processes to investigate the multiscale effects of microstructures on overall battery performance. Concurrently, we design three distinct anode structures: porosity gradient distribution structures, hard carbon–graphite composite anodes, and hard carbon-coated graphite anodes to identify structural features that enhance key battery performance metrics. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of side-reaction products and the Li + concentration to reveal the influence of different microstructures on internal mass transport and electrochemical reactions. We also identify the factors within these three structures that contribute to extending battery lifespan and improving overall performance. This work systematically establishes the relationship between anode microstructures and battery performance, providing insights that are expected to optimize materials, reduce trial-and-error, and use simulations to guide experimental work more efficiently.},

In this work, a combination of magnetron co-sputtering and post-tellurization methods was used to prepare In doped Sb 2 Te 3 thin films. A high carrier concentration is ascribed to the increase in the density of states after In doping proved by first-principles calculations and experiments, which leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of ∼1686.84 S cm −1 and moderate S above ∼105.24 μ V K −1 . Consequently, a peak power factor of 18.68 μ W cm −1 K −2 was realized in In doped Sb 2 Te 3 thin films at 300 K, representing a ∼17% increase compared to the undoped samples. After 1000 bending cycles, the relative resistance evolution lower than 2% and relative S evolution lower than 5% exhibit excellent flexibility of In-doped flexible thermoelectric film.

The transport equations for both types of devices are derived using the ballistic transport theory. The electrocatalytic behavior of reaction sites in water splitting is modeled by using the Butler–Volmer equation. The impacts of the ESC parameters, including the extraction energy level and the transmission energy width, on the performance of HCPC devices have been investigated. The results indicate that the thermal losses from non-ideal ESCs significantly limit HCPC efficiency, which can be enhanced by optimizing ESC parameters. Comparisons show that HCPCs with quantum dot ESCs outperform those with quantum well ESCs, owing to their superior carrier transport capability and lower thermal loss rates. For an absorber bandgap of 1 eV ⁠ , the optimized solar-to- H 2 energy conversion efficiencies of the two HCPCs reach 62.34 % and 64.93 % ⁠ , respectively, highlighting the promising application potential of these catalysts.},

A multiplexed FP algorithm, utilizing both the bright-field and dark-field information, reconstructs a high-resolution quantitative phase image from the single-shot intensity image. Verified with resolution targets and a histological sample, our method achieved a resolution improvement of 2.5 times the diffraction limit of the objective lens and provided QPI over a large field-of-view.

We show that BP significantly amplifies the Raman signals of DNA nucleotides, enabling more sensitive and accurate detection of individual nucleotides. This enhancement may be attributed to the strong charge transfer with biomolecules and anisotropic structure, which increases molecular dipole moments when positioned on its surface. These factors lead to stronger molecular interactions and improved Raman signal sensitivity. Our findings highlight BP as a promising platform for biosensor applications, paving the way for more precise biomolecular sensing and advanced diagnostics.},

These pattern differences enable precise location-resolved disturbance detection through eight encodable phase patterns and their corresponding phase-space trajectories, showcasing memristors' precision in dynamic control.

However, their intrinsic properties of photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, key to photodetector performance, are still limited with conventional approaches (e.g., material purification and defect passivation). Here, we propose an efficient ultrasound-assisted growth method to manipulate the crystal phase of all-inorganic perovskites. Morphological, structural, and elemental characteristics of perovskites are comprehensively investigated, confirming the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 –CsPbBr 3 dual-phase (DP) perovskites. The fabricated DP perovskites exhibit enhanced carrier dynamics compared to CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), including over a tenfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an extended carrier lifetime of 656 ns. Such impressive improvements originate from the repeated radiative recombination introduced by the hierarchical phase of DP perovskites. As a result, the DP perovskite-based photodetector also demonstrates improved photoresponse, including a larger on/off ratio exceeding 10 3 and a higher detectivity of 1.48 × 10 10 Jones, especially in the absence of conventional transporting layers. These results offer strong competitiveness for state-of-the-art perovskite photodetectors and deliver important implications for the widespread use of DP perovskites in assembling high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kilohertz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 μ W/ μ m 2 within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.},

Beyond their intriguing electrical transport phenomena, such as the negative magnetoresistance driven by the chiral anomaly and the anomalous Hall effect, they also exhibit intriguing second-order optoelectronic responses, such as the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). In this Letter, we investigate the CPGE in a class of double Weyl semimetal protected by the C 3 z T symmetry by using the effective model. Unlike double Weyl semimetal protected by C n z (n = 4, 6) symmetry, when time-reversal symmetry T is broken, one C 3 z T -protected double Weyl point (WP) evolves into four single WPs, three of which are related by C 3 z symmetry, and these WPs share the same topological charge and reside at the same energy level. This unique configuration enhances the CPGE trace due to the combined topological charge of the three WPs, resulting in a higher quantized plateau. Our findings provide promising prospects for the development of optoelectronic devices in the future.},

  abstract     = {Group IVA elements Si and Ge and their compounds possess abundant natural distribution and excellent electrical properties that are widely utilized in Si-based technology. The exploration for potentially high-performance thermoelectric materials within the Group IVA elements is a viable pursuit. In this work, Ca intercalated Germanene-CaGe 2 films were grown on sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the partial lack of Ca between the germanene buckled layers effectively increases the Seebeck coefficient without restraining the conductivity. A maximum power factor of 170 μ W/mK 2 at 523 K, which is seven times larger than the stoichiometric CaGe 2 film, was achieved in the Ca 0.835 Ge 2 film by suppression of bipolar effect and formation of a Ca-deficient phase. This study presents a promising approach to tuning the thermoelectric properties of layered semimetal materials through interlayer atomic modulation, which induces the buckled structure of the framework layer, thereby modifying the electronic structure.},

  abstract     = {The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of monolayer MoS 2 is limited by weak optical absorption due to its atomic scale thickness. To enhance PL intensity, field enhancement techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metal nanoparticles, are often employed. However, SPR-induced light confinement at the nanoscale also leads to significant localized heating. In this study, we investigated the impact of near-field heating due to SPR using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and tip-enhanced photoluminescence studies. Our results reveal nearly an order-of-magnitude difference in the enhancement factors (EFs) for Raman and PL signals of monolayer MoS 2 , with a local temperature increase of approximately 147 °C under the TERS tip at a laser power of 10.57 mW. The reduced PL EF compared with Raman EF is attributed to additional near-field heating from SPR. We further observed that local temperature fluctuations critically affect the EFs and found that a high thermal conductivity substrate can effectively mitigate the near-field thermal effects associated with SPR.},

  abstract     = {The ultra-high piezoelectric activity of K 0.5 Na 0.5 NbO 3 (KNN)-based single crystals with excellent electromechanical coupling characteristics has attracted great interest. However, the growth of KNN-based single crystals is restricted by their high melting point and harsh equipment conditions. In this work, a large-sized single crystal of (K 0.5 Na 0.5 ) 0.994 Bi 0.006 Nb 0.998 Cu 0.004 O 3 (KNNBC) was grown using an inexpensive and simple seed-free solid state crystal growth method. The growth mechanism, domain structures, defects, piezoelectric properties, as well as the conduction mechanisms of the KNNBC single crystal were systematically investigated. A significant piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) as high as 392 pC/N is obtained in the KNNBC single crystal, which is three times higher than that of ceramics with the same composition, and the single crystal also maintains a high Curie temperature ( T c ∼ 399 °C). The superior piezoelectric properties are believed to stem from the ordered arrangement of large-sized striped domains (∼300 nm) and the sensitivity to polarization rotation due to the flattening of the Landau energy density. Additionally, the spontaneous polarization combined with complex defect dipoles consisting of Cu 2+ ions and O 2− vacancies effectively modulates both the quality factor ( Q m ) and the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) of the single crystals. This work broadens the growth strategy of high-performance KNN-based single crystals and highlights the great benefits of the synergistic modulation of defects and domains on the piezoelectric properties of single crystals.},

Notably, the point dipole polarization model provides a more comprehensive explanation of the relaxation time ( τ ), activation energy ( ⁠ W η ⁠ ), and T.

However, practical implementation remains challenging due to the limited control over valleytronic properties. Here, we propose ferroelectric HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 van der Waals heterostructure as a platform to overcome these limitations, enabling tunable and nonvolatile valleytronic behaviors. Our findings show that the electric polarization state of the Sc 2 CO 2 monolayer governs the electronic properties of heterostructures. Positive polarization induces a direct gap at the valleys, enabling valleytronic functionality for excitation and readout via circularly polarized light, while negative polarization results in an indirect-gap, suppressing valleytronic behavior. Moreover, our transport simulations further demonstrate a polarization-dependent ferroelectric p-i-n junction with 8 nm possesses a maximum tunnel electroresistance (TER) ratio of 1.60 × 10 8 % at a bias of 0.5 eV. These results provide insights into ferroelectric-controlled valleytronic transitions and position the HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 heterostructure as a promising candidate for energy-efficient valleytronic memory and nonvolatile storage applications.},

Therefore, we conduct the biased in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments on the electrical transport properties of BFO single crystals with single domains. The in situ measured I – V curves indicate neither one-way conduction nor resistance switching. The conductive behavior of BFO corresponds to space charge-limited conduction, indicating a high concentration of oxygen vacancies and the presence of Ohmic contact between the Pt electrode and BFO. After applying a DC constant voltage, the resistance decreases by approximately 50% and partially recovers after exposure to air. The electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra under different conditions indicate that BFO interacts with the external environment. Specifically, DC voltage causes BFO to release oxygen atoms, resulting in an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration and decrease in resistance. Air oxidation leads to a decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration and partial recovery of resistance. In addition, in situ heating experiments (at 20–400 °C) indicate that oxygen vacancies mainly originate from the external electric field rather than thermal effects.},

Recently, a family of Fe-based nanowires has been observed in high-throughput transition metal chalcogenides synthesized by chemical vapor deposition [Zhou et al. , Nat. Mater. 22 , 450–458 (2023)]. In this work, the atomic configuration, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of Fe 3 X 4 (X = S, Se, Te) nanowires were confirmed by first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Due to their intrinsic anisotropic character and strong d-p hybridization, Fe 3 X 4 nanowires exhibit antiferromagnetic semiconducting behavior with good stability, a tunable bandgap of 0.277–0.771 eV, a large vertical magnetic anisotropy energy of 2.39 meV/Fe, and a high Néel temperature of 680–840 K. Moreover, the calculation of the spin transport properties has shown that these Fe 3 X 4 nanowires possess the negative differential resistance behavior with the peak-to-valley current ratio from 1.84 to 6.85. Our results not only expand the database of magnetic nanowires but also provide a low-dimensional platform for multifunctional spin devices.},

  abstract     = {The inverse spinel oxide NiCo 2 O 4 , known for its high Curie temperature, low resistivity, and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, is a promising candidate for the development of next-generation spintronic devices. However, reducing the thickness of the NiCo 2 O 4 film to a few atomic layers degrades its room temperature magnetic and electrical properties, limiting its practical application. In this study, a Co 3 O 4 buffer layer is introduced into ultrathin NiCo 2 O 4 films, which significantly enhances the Curie temperature beyond room temperature and reduces the resistivity, while preserving the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as the robust anomalous Hall effect. It is found that the sheet resistance dramatically decreases with the increase in Co 3 O 4 thickness. The observed phenomena may originate from the increased occupation of Ni 3+ ions at octahedral sites due to the interfacial coupling, resulting in the intrinsic linear relationship between resistivity and Curie temperature. Additionally, the scaling relation between the anomalous Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity highlights the complex interaction between spin-dependent impurity scattering and the band intrinsic Berry curvature. This study indicates that interfacial coupling is an effective strategy for tuning the physical properties of oxides, providing a promising avenue for the application of NiCo 2 O 4 -based materials in miniaturized spintronic devices.},

The experimental results show that the SOT switching efficiency strongly depends on the magnetic structure of the ferromagnet (FM) layer. With the increase in cycle number of [Co/Ni] × n multilayers, the switching ratio rapidly decreases, even cannot present the magnetization switching. This switching behavior can be attributed to the strong domain wall pinning in the samples with the maze domain structure. Moreover, although the samples in this work have the same spin current sources, the estimated SOT efficiencies vary greatly, suggesting that the SOT efficiency in a FM/heavy metal (HM) structure depends not only on the spin Hall effect and/or Rashba effect but also on the magnetic structure of FM layer.

  abstract     = {During the grain boundary diffusion (GBD) of Tb, the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures are the two main microstructures influencing the magnetic properties of the sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. These two microstructures are all composed of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B phase, but the formation mechanisms are different. The difference in formation mechanism of the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures was studied by quenching the magnets at different temperatures and holding times. The (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell of the core–shell structure is the precondition for forming the reverse core–shell structure. The triple-junction phases (TJPs) area change proves that the Nd elements diffuse from the TJPs to the surface of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell to form the Tb-poor shell in the reverse core–shell structure and the Gaussian distribution of Tb in the shell of the core–shell structure. In addition, the difference in the Tb content distribution leads to different demagnetization processes, resulting in the opposite effect of these two microstructures on the coercivity. The GBD aims to increase the entire coercivity by enhancing the surface anisotropy field ( H A ), such as the Tb-rich shell for the grains and the Tb-rich surface (∼200 μ m) for the magnets. Therefore, for the reverse core–shell structure forming in the surface of the magnets, the surface with a low H A decreases the coercivity of the grains, reducing the coercivity of the magnets.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a data-driven measurement and sensing paradigm that capitalizes on the limited sensing capabilities of probabilistic bits (p-bits). Unlike traditional methods that rely on the high quality of individual devices, our approach achieves high precision through the extensive data collected from a large ensemble of p-bits. We demonstrate the feasibility of using magnetic tunnel junction-based p-bits in various applications, such as temperature stability monitoring, passive timekeeping, and weak magnetic field sensing. The paradigm is notably easy to implement and robust against device imperfections and non-uniformity, providing significant advantages in terms of practicality and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with high spin polarization and controllable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) are critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr 2 Te 2 exhibits intrinsic dynamic/thermal stability, half-metallicity, and robust ferromagnetic ordering. The Curie temperature ( T c ) can be elevated from 90 to 190 K via external stimuli. Strain engineering, carrier doping, and electric-fields enable precise control of MAE, while tensile strain and electron doping enhance MAE to 2.680 meV. Conversely, compressive strain and hole doping induce a spin reorientation transition. Moreover, external electric fields also play a key role in determining MAE, suggesting a promising strategy for manipulating MAE in 2D ferromagnets. These modifications primarily arise from the alternations of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) strength between Te-derived p -orbitals within specific spin channels. These findings establish Cr 2 Te 2 as a versatile platform for spintronics integrating half-metallicity with dynamically adjustable magnetic properties and motivate further experimental exploration.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the orbital torque generated in ferromagnetic (FM)/manganese (Mn) bilayer systems based on angular-dependent spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) experiments. From the ST-FMR results, it is found that a relatively large out-of-plane anti-damping torque can be obtained in Ni/Mn bilayers. The Gilbert damping constant, derived from the resonant linewidth of frequency-dependent ST-FMR experiments, decreases almost linearly with increasing thickness of Mn, further indicating the out-of-plane anti-damping torque in Ni/Mn bilayer systems. The origin of this torque can be attributed to the orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the orbital diffusion length ( ⁠ λ L ⁠ ) in Mn is determined to be more than 17 nm and larger than spin diffusion length, suggesting that the torque observed in our sample is predominantly influenced by the orbital-related effect. Finally, the insertion of Pt in a Ni/Mn bilayer system significantly enhances the orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that Mn is a promising material for future orbitronics devices.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermal transport behaviors across dissimilar metal films is essential for optimizing electronic devices' performance and efficiency. However, the effect of interfacial parameters such as the thickness on interfacial thermal conductance ( G ) of metal/metal remains elusive. In this Letter, the G between Al and Cu with varying Cu thickness was investigated from 78 to 295 K using the time domain thermoreflectance technique combined with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM). The temperature dependence of G Al/Cu follows a pattern that is consistent with phonon-related thermal transport behaviors and decreases with increasing Cu thickness. The phonon related behaviors are attributed to the existence of the oxide layer at the interface. By taking the oxide layer into account, NEMD and DMM calculations match well with the experimental results, proving that the oxide layer hinders electron transport across the interface. We further find that strain distributions in Cu layers have a negative correlation with Cu thickness. When applying compressive strain on Cu, the overlap of phonon density of states between Cu and Al increases, especially for phonons of 6.5–9 THz, which is responsible for the Cu thickness-dependence in G Al/Cu . Our results not only help revealing strain effect on G but also pave the way for the thermal design of metal interconnect in integrated circuits.},

  abstract     = {Integrating high thermal conductivity cost-effective SiC to the Si-active-layer film is an effective solution to enhance the thermal performance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and maintain its distinct electrical performance. Although direct bonding of Si films to SiC substrates demonstrates many advantages over epitaxial growth, different bonding techniques may yield disparate bonding qualities and heat dissipation abilities. Here, a comparative analysis from thermal-mechanical-structural perspectives of different Si/SiC interfaces, prepared by hydrophilic bonding (HB) and surface-activated bonding (SAB) methods, is systematically conducted. It was found that the amorphous interlayer thickness and thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of the SAB-Si/SiC heterojunction can be significantly modulated by annealing, accompanied by a beneficial decreased TBR at high working temperatures. Moreover, the residual stress within the Si film by SAB is greatly reduced to an order of magnitude lower than that by HB. In general, the SAB-Si/SiC interface exhibits a tunable microstructure, comparably low TBR, and nearly fully relaxed stress, potentially outperforming the HB-Si/SiC interface when considering the comprehensive performance. This work puts forward an important thermal-mechanical perspective to evaluate interface bonding quality for practical applications, and removes a headache barrier toward wafer-scale high-yield integration of Si active layers onto SiC substrates to greatly enhance SOI devices' thermal management.},

This study systematically investigated the electrical properties, microstructure, elemental valence states, and energy-band alignment of these heterojunctions through multiple analytical techniques. Current–voltage measurements revealed an asymmetric, nonlinear behavior due to the depletion region at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface, with annealing further enhancing electrical performance by yielding a lower turn-on voltage of 0.3 V, an increased rectification ratio of 81.1, and a reduced ideality factor of 6.69. Band structure analysis showed that both the conduction band offset and valence band offset at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface increase, indicating a higher barrier height, resulting in more pronounced rectification behavior. X-ray diffraction showed that the laser-treated samples have polycrystalline structures, and annealing improved the crystallinity, thereby enhancing the conductivity. Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the deep implantation of high concentrations of Cu ions into ZnO. Depth‐profiling x‐ray photoelectron spectra revealed the co-presence of Cu + and Cu 2+ , both of which contribute to the p -type conductivity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing ZnO heterojunctions in applications such as light-emitting diodes and laser diodes with a high level of efficiency and low turn-on voltage.},

However, the specific contact resistance values of p-GaN remain limited to the range of mid-10 −2 Ω cm 2 due to the low activation ratio of Mg dopants and high work function. Here, we propose an Ohmic contact method using a Pd-based metal stack to achieve lower specific contact resistance compared to conventional p-GaN contact metals such as Ni/Au or Pt/Au. A low specific contact resistance of 1.08 × 10 −5 Ω cm 2 was demonstrated for p-GaN by annealing a Pd-based tri-layer metal contact in an oxygen-rich ambient with an optimized Pd thickness. The mechanism driving this low specific contact resistance was investigated using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated the mutual diffusion of Ni, Pd, and Ga atoms within the metal alloy. A NiO layer was formed on the top of the metal alloy, and Pd-Ga compounds were formed at the metal/p-GaN interface through mutual diffusion of atoms. This process increased the number of Ga vacancies in p-GaN, playing a crucial role in reducing its contact resistance.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the impact of constant forward electrical stress on beta-gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) from the prospective of defect evolution. Prolonged stress significantly increased the reverse leakage current density ( J R ) and forward current density ( J F ) under small bias and decreased the turn-on voltage ( V on ). Temperature-dependent current-voltage ( I-V-T ) analysis revealed that the reverse leakage current is dominated by Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission in both fresh and stressed SBDs, while the forward current transport mechanism transforms from thermionic emission (TE) to trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) after stress. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) results identified an intrinsic trap E 2 * (E C - 0.75 eV) within the β -Ga 2 O 3 drift layer, which is likely a Ga vacancy-related trap. The consistency of this energy level with the PF barrier proves that the increase in this trap is the main reason for the increase in J R . The spatial distribution features that the increase in trap concentration near the metal-semiconductor interface is much larger than that inside the bulk, which establishes the association between this trap and J F under small bias and V on . These findings highlight the critical role of trap evolution in SBD performance degradation under electrical stress.},

We also report excess noise measurements of both p-i-n and n-i-p devices under illumination, resulting in single carrier injection.

In this study, we investigate freestanding VO 2 microbeams that undergo reversible transitions from an insulating triclinic (T) phase to an insulating monoclinic (M2) phase, followed by a transition to the R phase. The latent heat changes associated with these first-order phase transitions are monitored using a recently developed chip-based differential scanning calorimetry technique, which demonstrates exceptional sensitivity and resolving power. A series of sharp endothermic and exothermic peaks are observed during the temperature ramping process. In contrast to the abrupt and complete transformation typically observed in conventional insulator-to-metal transitions, our findings reveal a scenario in which multiple domains coexist, and phase transitions occur sequentially within each domain. These results underscore the intricate relationship between domain dynamics and the multiple phase structures in VO 2 . Furthermore, they highlight the potential of advanced thermal analysis techniques to detect subtle thermal signals associated with phase transition processes, providing fresh insights into the underlying mechanisms.},

Here, we proposed a hitherto unknown layered carbon structure, designated as pop -graphite, synthesizable from high-pressure prepared sodium–carbon compounds. Through ab initio evolutionary structure searches and first-principles calculations, we identify a thermodynamically stable layered NaC 3 intercalation compound at 14.0 GPa, featuring a distinctive edge-sharing penta-octa-penta ( pop ) carbon framework with intercalated sodium atoms. Upon sodium removal, the resultant pop -graphite structure remains stable under ambient conditions, exhibiting superior electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility compared to conventional graphite. Our calculations reveal its intrinsic metallic nature and single-gap superconductivity, driven by electron–phonon coupling involving C p z states.

Both phases are indirect bandgap, which is smaller than the atmospheric phase.

However, currently developed LARHEAs generally have poor room temperature ductility, which greatly limits their wide applications. In this study, two kinds of LARHEAs with chemical compositions of TiZrTaCr and TiZrTaV in equal atomic percentage were designed based on low neutron absorption cross section, low neutron activation, and mixing enthalpy parameters. The LARHEA samples were prepared by high vacuum arc-melting techniques, and their phase structures and mechanical properties were studied. It was found that the TiZrTaCr LARHEA exhibited two body-center-cubic (BCC) and one Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound phases, and it had a yield strength of 1364 ± 54 MPa, but it was brittle, while the TiZrTaV LARHEA formed three BCC solid solution phases, and it had a high yield strength of 1312 ± 57 MPa with a room temperature compression plasticity of 13% ± 0.8%. Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound formation in the solid solution matrix could have led to the brittleness of the LARHEAs, which was mainly due to the large negative mixing enthalpy of the Cr element with Zr element in this alloy system. This study proposed a basic method for LARHEA design to optimize the microstructures and improve the mechanical properties as structural materials.},

  abstract     = {The controllability of the spectral width and intensity of long-wave infrared (LWIR) emission is essential for various applications, including optical stealth, infrared radiation sources, and infrared lasers. Here, we proposed a multifunctional LWIR metasurface emitter with a switchable radiation state, which consists of germanium (Ge) rectangular pair resonators placed on a vanadium oxide (VO 2 ) film. By manipulating the reversible metal-to-insulator phase transition of phase change material VO 2 , the spatial and spectral emission characteristics could be dynamically controlled. The high loss of metallic VO 2 enables broadband emission in the LWIR band. The average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range reaches 91.3% and exhibits wide-angle emission properties. When the VO 2 is transformed to the insulating phase, the coupling effect of the symmetry-breaking rectangle with two quasi-bound states in the continuum modes enhances the emission intensity of VO 2 at a selective wavelength. This results in narrowband emission with a high-quality factor (Q-factor) and high directional selectivity. Notably, the emission peak's linewidth is only 28 nm, with a Q-factor of 293, and the average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range drops to 9.4%. Overall, the proposed metasurface device achieves an LWIR emissivity switching ratio of 9.7 between its two operating modes, showcasing significant differences in spectral and spatial radiation characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Open stopband (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leaky-wave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range . In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results, corroborated by full-wave simulations, demonstrate that the proposed device achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of about 25 m. The latter, at 30 GHz, approximately corresponds to 2500 wavelengths (in vacuum) and to 50 times the aperture diameter which is about 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow regions and over large distances is a key factor.},

Perfect absorption of left-handed circularly polarized light (LCP) exceeding 99% and weak absorption of only about 6% of right-handed circularly polarized light (RCP) are achieved at 7.24 THz in frequency. The discrepancy in absorption responses of LCP and RCP results in a large circular dichroism (CD) of 0.94. The CD value in the THz region can be actively modulated between 0.02 and 0.94 by controlling the phase transition of VO 2 , which is closely related to the ambient temperature. Moreover, near-field imaging and encrypted presentation are realized by leveraging the metasurface and its mirror-image properties. Our work holds significant promise in widespread fields including THz intelligent absorption, imaging, and chiral detection.},

Due to the limitations of the materials and process, existing THz polarization converters generally have the disadvantages of narrow operating frequency band and non-flexibility. We experimentally demonstrate a flexible ultra-broadband THz polarization converter operating in reflection. It can efficiently convert a linearly polarized THz wave to its orthogonal counterpart in a broadband regime. The device consists of three layers: the lower metal film, the middle dielectric layer, and the upper metal resonance structure array. The unit cell of the upper metal resonance structure is a four-open-ring formed by subtracting two metal bars from a metal ring. The position of the opening is in the diagonal direction of 45° from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the unit structure. The device is simulated using a full wave EM simulation software and fabricated by a surface micromachining process. The test experiment is completed using a THz-TDS spectrometer and the results show that the polarization conversion ratio is more than 0.8 in an ultra-broadband regime from 1.45 to 2.67 THz. This ultra-broadband conversion is mainly caused by the magnetic resonance of THz waves. More importantly, the convertible frequency band can be tailored for practical applications across the EM spectrum.},

However, there are instances where a droplet fails to rebound from a superhydrophobic surface. It has been reported that the combined effect of gravito-capillary length and visco-capillary length determines the pinning–bouncing criteria. While the fluid properties, such as viscosity and weight, are often considered primary factors influencing droplet rebound, this study highlights the crucial role of surface characteristics, particularly the contact angle hysteresis, in determining post-impact behavior. We propose a modified criterion that predicts droplet bouncing and pinning on superhydrophobic surfaces by integrating both fluid properties and the contact angle hysteresis of the surface. The findings emphasize the importance of surface morphology in droplet dynamics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of droplet behavior on non-wetting surfaces.},

The results demonstrate that the morphology of SiGe cladding can be controlled by adjusting the high-temperature H 2 baking conditions, leading to shapes such as triangular, circular, and hexagonal. Technology computer-aided design simulations and geometric phase analysis of TEM images revealed that the maximum compressive stress of SiGe cladding is 3 GPa, corresponding to a compressive strain of 2.48%, which significantly enhances hole mobility. Electrical performance tests and simulations on p -type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor devices with different morphologies showed excellent short-channel effect control, with a subthreshold swing (SS) of approximately 70 mV/dec and a drain-induced barrier lowering of only 40 mV/V.

In this study, we report a strategy using functionally graded lattice structures (FGLS) to manipulate the multipactor of the ceramic surface. First, particle-in-cell simulations were conducted to study the secondary electron avalanche process. Simulation results indicated that the interaction between electrons and FGLS hinders the development of secondary electron avalanche. Also, a few positive charges can be accumulated on the ceramic surface since FGLS eliminates the macroscopic interface between insulators and vacuum. Subsequently, stereolithography 3D printing technology was adopted to fabricate ceramic insulators with FGLS, and a further experimental characterization verifies the reduction of secondary electron yield, especially for surfaces with finer structures.},

  abstract     = {We report on the fabrication and characterization of p–n diodes made from wide bandgap II-VI semiconductors (p-ZnTe/n-CdTe) containing nano-inclusions of narrow bandgap material (PbTe). The diodes are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy on semi-insulating GaAs (100) substrates. The PbTe nano-inclusions are formed either as a single layer of PbTe with a thickness of 350 nm or as multilayers built from alternating thin layers of PbTe and CdTe. Comparison of cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images with electron beam-induced current measurements confirms that the PbTe nano-inclusions are located in depletion regions of the diodes. Despite the presence of the highly conductive, narrow bandgap PbTe semiconductor between the p- an n-type layers, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices show rectifying behavior and acceptable diode parameters in the wide temperature range of 60–290 K. The p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes with PbTe nano-inclusions exhibit significant sensitivity to infrared radiation starting at the wavelength of about 1.5 μ m and with a long-wavelength cutoff of 3.9 and 5.4 μ m at 290 and 50 K, respectively. A peak sensitivity appears at a wavelength of 2.29 μ m and reaches the maximum of almost 1 V/W at a temperature of 150 K. The temperature dependence of the cutoff wavelength clearly shows that the sensitivity to infrared radiation of the wide bandgap p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes is due to band-to-band optical excitations taking place in PbTe nano-inclusions. The results presented here prove that such diodes can be used for infrared sensing or for two-color infrared solar cells.},

Polar phases of interest can include different ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and paraelectric phases, which can be transformed into each other through external stimuli, offering unprecedented control over polar material properties. With this level of control, important size limitations and integration problems can be overcome, and material platforms with tunable polar properties for multi-functional devices and sensors can be developed for the next generation of information and energy technologies. We highlight the co-existence of polar properties that have been found on local scales using advanced local characterization techniques as well as methods to control polar properties in transition metal thio-/selenophosphates. We give an overview of future challenges and opportunities in this emerging field of energetically close polar phases.},

The hexagonal wurtzite structure, which is a typical crystal structure in compound semiconductors, demonstrates pronounced anisotropy, especially in its response to external stimuli. Recently, mechanical behavior under light illumination has attracted increasing interest especially in semiconductor compounds. In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of illumination effects on the nanomechanical properties of wurtzite ZnO. Four surface orientations—(0001), (0001) 45° off, ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ), and ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ )—were subjected to nanoindentation creep and nanoindentation hardness tests under controlled light illumination. The indentation depth during nanoindentation creep under light illumination was consistently smaller than that in darkness for all surface orientations, confirming that light suppresses indentation creep deformation, but to different degrees depending on the surface orientation. This suggests that the activated slip systems and the distribution of dislocations play a crucial role in modulating dislocation behavior under light illumination. The nanoindentation hardness followed the trend on the four surface orientations: (0001) > (0001) 45° off > ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ) > ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ ), reflecting anisotropic behavior in nanomechanical properties. Second and subsequent pop-in events were extracted, exhibiting different behaviors depending on the surface orientations, and may play a key role in determining the anisotropy in nanoindentation hardness. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the plastic anisotropy under light control in wurtzite ZnO.},

  abstract     = {Passive solar heating and radiative cooling attracted lots of attention in global energy consumption reduction due to their unique electricity-free advantage. However, static single radiation cooling or solar heating would lead to over-cooling or over-heating in cold or hot weather, respectively. How to achieve effective self-adaptive thermoregulation is critical for dynamic thermal management. Hence, in this work, a self-adaptive thermoregulation strategy was designed by coupling latent heat storage or release with reversible solar heating and radiative cooling. A commercial memory alloy could realize self-adaptive thermoregulation at the critical temperature between radiative cooling with high solar reflectance R ¯ solar = 0.95 and thermal emittance ε ¯ LWIR = 0.93, and solar heating with high solar absorptance α ¯ solar = 0.92 and low thermal emittance ε ¯ IR = 0.08. High thermal conductive phase change material could further improve the thermoregulation performance with a latent heat of ∼136 J g −1 , and thermal conductivity of 3.4 W m −1 K −1 , resulting in a superior heating performance than the single solar heating (39.9 vs 36.9 °C) and superior cooling performance than the single radiative cooling (33.8 vs 35.5 °C). The maximum heating temperature increase could be 12.7 °C in the cold situation, and the temperature drop could be 8.3 °C in the hot situation. Energy consumption calculation showed that the designed sample could save 68%–90% of annual energy consumption compared with the common roof, indicating that coupling spectral regulation with the latent heat can greatly improve the self-adaptive thermoregulation performance and save the total energy consumption in thermal management.},

  abstract     = {The lack of low-work function materials and the negative space charge effect have long prevented vacuum thermionic energy converters (VTECs) from becoming a practical means of power generation. Advancements in microfabrication have since provided solutions to these challenges, such as the suppression of negative space charge via a micro/nanoscale interelectrode vacuum gap distance, reigniting interest in VTECs as a potential clean energy technology. However, the limited operational lifetimes of many low-work function coatings have hindered their practical device-level implementation. Solid-state thermionic energy converters (SSTECs) have been proposed as a viable alternative to VTECs since they do not require an interelectrode vacuum gap or low-work function electrodes. Nevertheless, SSTECs still require a large temperature gradient between electrodes and are limited to low operating voltages. To address these limitations, we propose a near-field enhanced solid-state thermionic energy converter (NF-SSTEC), which leverages the advantages of SSTECs by eliminating the need for a large temperature gradient between the electrodes and increasing the range of possible operating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate conversion efficiencies of 16.8 % and power densities as high as 13.1 W cm −2 without needing a high-temperature gradient between the radiator and SSTEC. Additionally, we compare its performance under different radiation spectra, showing the potential for improvement via further optimization of the radiator.},

Specifically, we use a single gold subwavelength nanochannel to simultaneously apply both spatial confinement and plasmonic enhancement. Furthermore, instead of using an ultrafast laser, we demonstrate the feasibility of drilling nanochannels on suspended substrate using continuous lasers. In contrast to conventional plasmonic nanochannels with plasmonic enhancement only under transverse magnetic (TM) mode laser, our sample presents obvious plasmonic effects under both TM and transverse electric mode lasers, which is beneficial for improving the overall signal.

This study explored the vibration of buckled graphite sheets under external excitation using experimental analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and nonlinear isotropic plate model (NIPM). Notably, multiple peaks corresponding to the identical mode appeared in the spectrum. The additional peak distinct from the natural frequency arose from transition between two steady states of the film. Remarkably, the frequency of the peak corresponding to the transition exhibited greater sensitivity to external excitations and stress than the natural frequency of the resonator did.

However, further development of devices based on CsPbBr 3 is hampered by their poor electrical stability under operation. Migration and accumulation of native ions (Cs + , Pb 2+ , and Br - ) under electric fields has been suggested by many groups to be responsible for the observed device instabilities, although direct experimental evidence of ionic motion during operation has been seldom reported. In our study, ion migration has been probed by grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) in CsPbBr 3 polycrystalline layers grown in vapor phase. Our findings indicate that both Cs and Br experience ionic migration under electric field, suggesting that these ions are responsible for the measured current instability in our devices. In the timescale of a few hours, the ionic drifting rates of mobile Cs and Br under the top electrode were found to be similar, as high as ∼ 20 ppm h −1 V −1 mm.

  abstract     = {Models to describe electrical conduction in quantum dot (QD) constituted films often overlook the effects of geometric disorder. We address related issues by examining the influence of the QD packing fraction ( PF ) on the charge transport and transmission in QD arrays. Using transfer matrix based algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations, we quantify the transmission across disordered QD assemblies. Our results indicate a critical packing fraction ( ⁠ P F c ⁠ ) of ∼ 0.64, marking a transition from a non-conducting to a conducting state, aligning well with experimental observations and analytical predictions. This study enhances the understanding of transport in QD arrays, with implications for designing efficient electronic devices based on disordered nanoscale systems.},

  abstract     = {Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) has played an important role in determining the electronic band structures of semiconductors. However, the tip-induced band bending (TIBB) could strongly affect the measured valence and conduction band edges, which are of vital importance for a semiconductor. In the literature, the presence or absence of the TIBB effect in a given STS measurement is often not discussed thoroughly. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the TIBB effect in MoS 2 with varying thicknesses using light-modulated contact-mode STS. Our results demonstrate that the TIBB effect is strongly dependent on the thickness of MoS 2 . With thin MoS 2 of a few atomic layers (several nanometers), the TIBB approaches zero, and the measured STS can accurately reflect the band edges. While for thicker MoS 2 of ∼100 nm, the TIBB can be as large as ∼1 eV. This work clarifies the ambiguity about the TIBB effect and provides a foundation for the interpretation of STS data on atomically thin semiconductors.},

This study comprehensively tracks the ferroelectric polarization and phonon property changes resulting from interlayer sliding in a β -GaSe bilayer. The results indicate that sliding the upper layer of the bilayer induces charge transfer, causing polarization accompanied by periodic changes and reversal in non-polarized β -GaSe. Simultaneously, low-frequency optical phonons in polarized structures soften significantly, exhibiting a minimum or rapid decrease accompanied by the maximum value of in-plane polarization. Additionally, the sliding symmetry breaking has complex effects on phonon transport, causing intriguing changes in transport characteristics due to variations in group velocity and linewidth, which are closely related to ferroelectric polarization. This study reveals not only the polarization achieved in the β -GaSe bilayer through sliding-induced symmetry breaking but also its complex effects on phonons and profound physical changes, enriching our understanding of the associated condensed matter physics.},

However, the difference in charge between O 2− and F − anions makes the Ti 3+ arise in BTOT ceramics. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism was observed in BTOF ceramics at room temperature by P–E loop and M–H loop. Moreover, these two ferroic orders originate from the Ti atoms. This work presents an alternative scheme for exploring multiferroic materials with large polarization and magnetization at room temperature, and we also expect preferable magnetoelectric coupling.},

The dispersion relationships between the resonant frequencies and wavelengths for the resonators, including the shear horizontal (SH) and Rayleigh modes, are investigated. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the main SH mode provides a larger coupling coefficient ( K 2 ) and that the spurious Rayleigh mode can be shifted from the passband and away from the main SH mode. Although the proposed POI SAW resonators on two different substrates have comparable frequencies for the same wavelength, the sapphire-based substrate exhibits a larger K 2 of 28% and a higher fitted Bode- Q max of 977 at 1.4 GHz. The temperature behavior of the SAW resonators is measured over a temperature range from −25 to 250 °C. The findings indicated that the resonator with the Si-based substrate has better temperature stability, with a temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of −16.99 ppm/°C and a turning point at 150 °C. In contrast, the one with the sapphire-based substrate provides a moderate TCF of −22.15 ppm/°C and remains linear for temperatures above 200 °C. This study reveals the impact of different substrate structures on the performance of SAW resonators, providing guidance for the design of desired SAW devices and their applications.},

In this study, we present an alternative approach to flexoelectric-induced domain engineering in suspended two-dimensional CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) membranes by varying the ambient pressure. By capping CIPS over cavity holes, internal air pressurization induces bulging, which results in unique encircled domain configurations governed by local strain gradients showing upward and downward polarizations at the center and the edge of the suspended membrane, respectively. Furthermore, this domain configuration can be bidirectionally modulated by varying the ambient pressure. We demonstrate reversible variations in domain size, driven by topographic changes that redistribute the strain gradient. Our findings demonstrate that ambient pressure can be used to engineer domains in suspended ferroelectric membranes, opening avenues for the development of emerging ferroelectric devices that are sensitive to ambient pressure.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching in barium titanate single crystals across a range of temperatures using acoustic emission techniques. Ferroelectric domain switching induced by an electric field exhibits scale-invariant avalanche dynamics, with the energy exponent increasing from 1.63 ± 0.067 at room temperature to 1.92 ± 0.045 near the Curie point, before decreasing at higher temperatures. This peak in the exponent is attributed to the interplay between equilibrium critical fluctuations and avalanche criticality. As the temperature approaches the Curie point, smaller domains and reduced polarization promote lower-energy switching, increasing the energy exponent. Near the Curie temperature, equilibrium fluctuations further modify the energy landscape, likely generating more phase boundaries and amplifying the energy exponent. Above the Curie temperature, electric field-induced phase transition dominates the switching process, where the higher energy barrier hinders switching, resulting in more energetic events and a lower energy exponent. Across all temperatures, waiting time distributions exhibit double power-law behavior, with exponents of −1 ± 0.05 for short times and −2 ± 0.10 for long times, while aftershock activity follows Omori's law with an exponent close to −1, indicating robust temporal correlations in ferroelectric domain switching. This study underscores that the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching can be effectively modulated by temperature.},

By employing floating-zone synthesis with proper heat-treatment process, we systematically tune oxygen vacancies and reveal their dual effect: oxygen vacancies enhance the pyroelectric figure-of-merit, while removing oxygen vacancies extends the effective lifetime in one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion. We discover that the phase transition in a heat-treated single crystal SBN60 device helps achieve stable electricity generation for approximately 7000 cycles in 30 h with enhanced functional reversibility. The dual effect of oxygen vacancies on the coupling of pyroelectricity and effective lifetime provides a useful strategy to design high-performance pyroelectric materials, especially for one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion, offering a practical solution for real-world applications of pyroelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {Nb 2 GeTe 4 , a two-dimensional ferroelastic semiconductor, has garnered intense research interest due to its nontrivial physicochemical characteristics of high carrier mobility as well as extraordinary ferroelasticity and optical absorbance along with potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this work, the high-pressure structural, vibrational, and electrical transport properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 up to 60.0 GPa under different hydrostatic environments were systematically studied by Raman spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and first-principles theoretical calculations. Under non-hydrostatic compression, Nb 2 GeTe 4 experienced a metallization at 11.8 GPa originating from the closure of bandgap due to the considerable compression of interlayer distance and sequential an isostructural phase transition (IPT) at 26.5 GPa. The comparable metallization pressure and the pronounced delay of IPT by ∼4.0 GPa under hydrostatic condition can be reasonably interpreted by the influence of deviatoric stress. Upon decompression, the phase transition of Nb 2 GeTe 4 was demonstrated to be reversible with the possible structural destruction under different hydrostatic environments. Moreover, Nb 2 GeTe 4 underwent a Ohmic-to-super-Ohmic conversion at 1000 mV under high pressure, which was presumably caused by the higher sinusoidal voltage than its thermal voltage. These findings enrich our foundational comprehension on high-pressure physicochemical properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 , thereby fostering its potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

This restricts nanowire widths to the resolution limit of the photolithography system, which limits performance, particularly for mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we develop an SNSPD fabrication process that uses bidirectional atomic layer etching to reduce nanowire widths by > 100 nm, achieving performance that has only previously been attained using low throughput electron beam lithography.

This increase needs to be taken into account when obtaining the spin-mixing conductance from spin pumping measurements. We measure an increase in α by a factor of × 8 when the YIG is vacuum annealed at 300 °C. No such changes in α are observed when annealed at the same temperature in 1 × 10 −1 mbar of oxygen.

  abstract     = {A magnetic skyrmion exhibits topological protection property, making it a highly promising candidate as an information carrier in spintronic devices. However, this information carrier may face deformation issues when driven by high current densities, causing the unstable message transmission. In this work, we explore the skyrmion deformation under different magnetic systems, including ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. We conduct micromagnetic simulations and provide a theoretical analysis of AFM skyrmion deformation, where the skyrmion demonstrates the lowest susceptibility to deformation. We derive a canting term based on the Thiele equation, pointing out an essential term that explains the AFM deformation depression reason. This finding also indicates that the AFM system offers superior stability for skyrmion, making it a promising choice for better option for skyrmion-based spintronics devices.},

In this work, through micromagnetic simulations, we analyze the impact of changes in the size and position of the ring's hole on magnetization resonant modes in Permalloy eccentric nanorings. Our results show that the magnetization ground state forms a vortex centered either on the hole or on the geometric center of the nanoring, depending on the hole's position. The observed magnetic patterns yield spin wave modes that split when increasing the ring eccentricity. The new resonant frequencies are associated with hybridized radial and azimuthal modes, which form butterfly-like patterns, which are also observed in magnetic field-driven deviations of vortices from the center of nanodots. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry and magnetization dynamics, which is crucial for designing magnetic nanostructures with specific functional properties.},

Rare earth (RE) metals, which are promising candidates for tuning spin transmission, can form antiferromagnetically coupled interfaces with ferromagnetic layers. In this study, we investigate the laser-induced ultrafast spin injection from permalloy (Py) into the RE metal holmium (Ho), modulated by interfacial engineering and varying the external magnetic field strength. The antiferromagnetically coupled interface between Py and Ho is confirmed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and its correlation with spin dynamic damping is revealed by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. More importantly, we demonstrate the effective modulation of spin transmission through an external magnetic field. At the Py/Ho interface, a substantial spin-mixing conductance (SMC) of approximately 7.71 × 10 15 cm −2 is observed, which can be modulated by approximately 35% under an external magnetic field. The applied high magnetic fields are found to suppress the large SMC, primarily due to the modified sperimagnetic structure at the Py/Ho interface. These findings demonstrate the excellent spin transmission efficiency in the Py/Ho system, providing a promising approach for magneto-dynamics modulation in spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Diamond and graphene, which have extremely high thermal conductivity, are considered ideal candidates for the preparation of high-performance thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the development of flexible TIMs with efficient heat transfer paths still hampers their thermal management applications. Herein, a highly oriented diamond–graphene composite film (DGCF) was prepared by one-step microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition on carbon cloth (CC) using N-butylamine as a single liquid carbon source. The hybridized composition of sp 3 /sp 2 and the heat transfer path length of DGCF are regulated by the deposition temperature and the thermal conductivity of CC/DGCF at 30 °C is 2.71 W m −1 K −1 , which is 15 times higher than that of CC. Further flexible TIMs of CC/DGCF are achieved using thermal silicone grease (TG) as filler, and the thermal conductivity of the final flexible compound of CC/DGCF/TG is 6.97 W m −1 K −1 at 30 °C, which is 39 times higher than that of pure CC and 2 times higher than that of TG, respectively. In the actual TIMs performance test, the cooling efficiency is 1.4 times higher than that of the commercial thermal conductive silicone pad. Furthermore, finite element simulations demonstrated that the film at 800 °C has the optimal sp 3 /sp 2 ratio for thermal response and the best thermal conductivity path structure. This finding provides a method for the design of highly flexible TIMs and increases the possibility of their practical application in electronic thermal management.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies have shown that higher-order phonon–phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ lat ⁠ ) of 2D-GaN, with the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) calculated using experienced atomic displacement in the finite difference method. In this work, it is found that the 4th-IFCs of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite difference method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The κ lat from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron–phonon interactions have significant effects on the κ lat of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of electron–phonon interactions on the κ lat of both n -type and p -type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon–electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.},

Our investigation examines the lattice constants and electronic energy bandgaps of both the superlattice structures and alloys across different Al concentrations, shedding light on the intricate relationship between composition and electronic properties. The analysis on electronic properties reveals that as the number of Al 2 O 3 monolayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 superlattice rises from 2 to 6 monolayers, the bandgap correspondingly expands from 5.29 to 6.43 eV.

An energy band model for carbon defect dynamics was established based on transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our model discernibly reveals that C N and tri-carbon in GaN intricately modulate both the absorption spectrum and carrier capture process: The rapid capture of holes by the C N defect significantly reduces the hole recombination time to hundreds of femtoseconds in the near-infrared band. Conversely, the tri-carbon defect exhibited a higher absorption cross section by an order of magnitude than that of free carrier in the visible region with a long carrier recombination time.

Typically, heterovalent impurities, or dopants, are added to semiconducting QDs to provide extra electrons and improve conductivity. Since each QD is expected to contain a few dopants, the extra electrons and their parent dopants have been difficult to locate. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of the extra electrons and their parent donors in epitaxial InAs/GaAs QDs using local-electrode atom-probe tomography and self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson simulations in the effective mass approximation. Although dopants are provided in both layers, the ionized donors primarily reside outside of the QDs, providing extra electrons that are contained within the QDs. Indeed, due to the quantum confinement-induced enhancement of the donor ionization energy within the QDs, a lower fraction of dopants within the QDs are ionized. These findings suggest a pathway toward the development of 3D modulation-doped nanostructures.},

The threshold voltages (V th ) of the fabricated MIS-HEMT and MIS-FET reach 0.14 and 2.5 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the fabricated devices exhibited a high off-state breakdown voltage over 1500 V. Compared to high interface trap density (D it ) at the SiN/GaN interface of MIS-FET, a much lower D it was found at the SiN/AlGaN interface of MIS-HEMT owing to the barrier recess-free process. Thus, the MIS-HEMT exhibits a negligible V th shift tested via positive bias temperature instability, which is crucial in the practical application for the E-mode operation. Furthermore, a scheme of extracting the D it of the devices from the flatband voltages (V FB ) shift of C–V curves was developed, and the accuracy of the scheme was verified by multi-frequency C–V tests.},

  abstract     = {This work reveals the significant advantages of high-temperature nitrogen (N) ion implantation for fabricating current-blocking layers (CBLs) in β -Ga 2 O 3 . A comparative investigation on the structural and electrical properties of N-implanted β -Ga 2 O 3 was conducted under different implantation temperatures and post-implantation annealing (PIA) conditions. The results showed that the high-temperature implantation (HTI) at 500 °C, compared to the room-temperature implantation (RTI), introduced fewer structural defects and less lattice distortion to β -Ga 2 O 3 . The HTI-formed CBL demonstrated a far superior current-blocking capability than those formed by the RTI with/without a PIA, in terms of a much lower and more stable leakage current and a significantly enhanced breakdown voltage. Additionally, lateral MOSFETs fabricated with the HTI isolation exhibited a three orders of magnitude lower off-state leakage current while maintaining excellent on-state performance, compared to those using the isolation formed by RTI with PIA. These findings indicate that the in situ dynamic annealing effect of HTI effectively reduces implantation-induced damage, enhances impurity activation, and improves the overall performance of the N-implanted CBLs in β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

  abstract     = {The GaN family as an electronic material and AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as electronic devices have found their widespread usage in power electronics and radio frequency (RF) applications. The threshold voltage is a crucial parameter, and application-specific threshold voltage is a requirement for this technology. A large positive threshold voltage with enhancement-mode operation is useful for power electronics. A depletion-mode transistor is used for radio frequency (RF) applications where the electron mobility is much larger in the channel region due to low interface roughness. A multi-threshold voltage transistor is a desired feature to reduce nonlinearity through compensation in RF applications. We address the issue with threshold voltage by demonstrating a programmable threshold AlGaN/GaN transistor using a dielectric stack as the charge-trapping layer. We have fabricated and characterized a triple-layer dielectric gate stack for AlGaN/GaN metal–insulator–semiconductor HEMTs. The gate stack comprises a high-k tantalum oxide sandwiched between two aluminum oxide layers. The structure is analogous to the polysilicon–aluminum oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon memory used in silicon technology. In addition to providing a large programmable threshold voltage window, the fabricated diodes reduce the gate leakage current by more than four orders of magnitude. The experimental observations are explained by the band edge alignment of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with the dielectric stack and using a charge-trapping process by a high positive program voltage.},

This CCW phenomenon is due to the dipole formation between the a-In 2 O 3 channel and the SiO X gate insulator by relocating oxygen atoms under the influence of the applied electric field. Hence, bipolar switching of gate bias (V GS ) alters the dipole direction and leads to low (V TL ) and high (V TH ) threshold voltages. The dipole formation increases with the electric field, which can be tailored by gate oxide (SiO X ) thickness or gate bias (V GS ). Therefore, the devices with a gate oxide thickness of 200 nm initially showed the clockwise hysteresis at V GS of 2 V, transformed to the CCW (MW of 4.2 V) with an increase in gate bias to 14 V. Therefore, a difference in oxygen density at the interface can form a dipole to exhibit the CCW phenomenon and behave FeFET-like.},

  abstract     = {Dual-main-phase (DMP) magnets, a promising approach for the efficient utilization of high-abundance rare earth elements, exhibit enhanced coercivity compared to single-main-phase (SMP) magnets. This study demonstrates that a DMP magnet exhibits a 43 kA/m coercivity increase over an SMP magnet of equivalent composition. Microstructural characterization reveals two main-phase grains with distinct core–shell structures in the DMP magnet. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the increased Nd content enhances the anisotropy field of the shells in Ce-rich grains, crucially contributing to the coercivity enhancement. Conversely, Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains do not significantly enhance coercivity. A micromagnetic model, constructed by substituting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains with (Nd 0.5 Ce 0.5 ) 2 Fe 14 B grains, demonstrates a slight coercivity increase compared to the DMP magnets. Moreover, retaining only the core–shell structure in grains near the end faces maintains higher coercivity than that of DMP magnets. Experimental results of DyCoCu grain boundary diffusion show a 406 kA/m coercivity increase in the DMP magnet, less than the 510 kA/m increase in the diffused SMP magnet. Although diffusion significantly increases the anisotropy field in the shell, the core region of the Ce-rich grains maintains a low anisotropy field, limiting magnetic property enhancement. These findings underscore the critical role of an optimized core–shell structure in enhancing coercivity for Ce-rich magnets, suggesting that the DMP method may not represent the most effective strategy.},

However, the dimensional stability of those composites is not guaranteed due to the residual stress generated during fabrication and the microstructure instability of the matrix. Here, we studied the effects of heat treatments on the dimensional stability of ZTE Cu 2 P 2 O 7 /ZL101 composite (with 32 vol. % of ZL101) prepared using the pressure infiltration method. Compared with the as-cast case, after a certain heat treatment (water quenching after holding at 773 K for 1 h, then aging at 463 K for 8 h, and finally thermal-cold cycling between 463 and 77 K for three times), the dimensional stability was improved by a factor of 20 and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was highly reproducible in the subsequent temperature cycles test. The treated composite exhibits a CTE of −0.028 ppm/K at 240–305 K and a relatively high thermal conductivity of 29.5 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature, leading to a thermal distortion parameter well less than those of other ZTE materials. The improved dimensional stability and the CTE reproducibility can be attributed to the stabilization of matrix microstructure and the greatly relaxed residual stress as revealed by the analysis of 2θ-sin 2 ψ based on x-ray diffraction.},

In this work, we propose a three-dimensional carbon allotrope by interpenetrating α -graphyne sheets with van der Waals interactions and study its structural and electronic properties by first-principles calculations and tight-binding methods. Our calculations show that the energy of this interpenetrated α -graphyne is slightly lower than that of the α -graphyne nanosheet due to the weak van der Waals interactions, and its dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities are further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Remarkably, 3D interpenetrated α -graphyne is a semimetal with both Dirac nodal loops and triply degenerate nodal points near the Fermi level and the Fermi velocities at these nodal points are very high. These properties are superior to 2D α -graphyne and ordinary 3D carbon materials. Our work not only proposes a type of 3D carbon material with multiple types of fermions for carbon-based high-speed nanoelectronic devices but also shows that interpenetrating 2D materials with large hollows is a promising method for constructing 3D materials.},

A combination of HVPE and AlN substrate enabled decreasing deleterious carbon concentration and dislocation density, respectively, thus accentuating the influences of V Al -complexes on the luminescence processes. A low-temperature CL spectrum of unintentionally doped AlN exhibited predominant excitonic emissions at around 6 eV and a marginal deep-state emission band at around 3.7 eV that originates from residual carbon (<10 16 cm −3 ) on nitrogen sites ( ⁠ C N ⁠ ). However, the sample was revealed to contain a considerable amount ( ⁠ ∼ 10 17 cm − 3 ⁠ ) of vacancy clusters, most likely comprising a V Al and nitrogen-vacancies ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ), namely, V Al V N 1 − 2 ⁠ , which act as nonradiative recombination centers that decrease overall CL intensity at elevated temperatures. With increasing Si-doping concentration ([Si]), major vacancy species progressively changed from V Al V N 1 − 2 to V Al O N 1 − 2 ⁠ , where O N is oxygen on N sites, which exhibit other deep-state emission bands ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 eV. Further increase in [Si] gave rise to the formation of donor-compensating defects comprising V Al and Si on the second-nearest-neighbor Al sites ( ⁠ Si Al ⁠ ), abbreviated by V Al − Si Al n ⁠ , which exhibit emission shoulders at around 2.9–3.0 eV. When [Si] exceeded 5 × 10 18 cm −3 , an emission band at around 4.5 eV emerged, which had been ascribed to originate from the nearest-neighbor Si Al C N complexes. Because V Al -complexes, including those containing impurities, are thermally stable, incorporation of vacancies should be blocked at the growth stage.},

Antimony selenide is well known for its thermoelectric properties. However, the on-surface synthesis of chain-like structures with varying stoichiometries remains challenging. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the epitaxial growth of SbSe chain structures. With increasing deposition of Sb and Se, a transition is observed in both the structural and electronic properties, shifting from semiconducting mixed chains to metallic uniform tri-chains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the elemental composition and helps determine the stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations show that the mixed-chain phase is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.17 eV, and that spin–orbit coupling induces band splitting. In contrast, the tri-chain phase, formed by weak van der Waals interactions between chains within the unit cell, undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition due to strong hybridization near the Fermi level. These findings not only provide a strategy for tuning the electronic properties of one-dimensional materials but also provide valuable insights for the design of thermoelectric and quantum materials, with potential applications in next-generation electronic devices.},

In this work, both the conventional orthorhombic and distinct cubic CoSbS compounds were facilely synthesized using the high-pressure and high-temperature method. It was found that cubic CoSbS exhibits a higher solid solubility of Ni at the Co site compared to the orthorhombic sample. The high-density point defect Ni Co in cubic CoSbS results in enhanced phonon scattering, thereby sharply suppressing phonon thermal conductivity. First-principles calculations show that the cubic structure of CoSbS exhibits higher band degeneracy and greater band dispersion compared to the orthorhombic structure, resulting in superior electrical transport properties. As a result, an enhanced figure of merit zT ∼ 0.37 was obtained at 773 K for cubic Ni 0.1 Co 0.9 SbS, which is approximately 16% higher than that of the orthorhombic sample prepared by the same method.

  abstract     = {The inverse design of solid-state materials with targeted properties represents a significant challenge in materials science, particularly for piezoelectric semiconductors where both structural symmetry and electronic properties must be carefully controlled. Here, we employ the simplified line-input crystal-encoding system representation combined with the MatterGPT framework for discovering potential piezoelectric semiconductors. By training on a curated dataset of 1556 piezoelectric materials from the Materials Project database, our model learns to generate crystal structures with targeted piezoelectric properties through an autoregressive sampling process. Starting from approximately 5000 generated structures, we implemented a comprehensive screening workflow incorporating structural validity, thermodynamic stability, and property verification. This approach identified several promising candidates from 4100 reconstructed structures, each representing compounds unrecorded in existing databases. Among these, the most notable material demonstrated a piezoelectric stress coefficient of 25.9 C / m 2 in the e[1,6] direction. Additionally, these materials demonstrate suitable bandgaps ranging from 1.63 to 3.61 eV, suggesting potential applications in high-sensitivity sensors and high-temperature electronics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining crystal structure language encoding with generative models for accelerating the discovery of functional materials with targeted properties.},

  abstract     = {The reversible transformation of radiative cooling and solar heating of the film is significant for a building's energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. The current technology is constrained by its reliance on complex control mechanisms and a narrow control scope, which collectively impede its practical deployment. In this Letter, we introduce an all-season smart film, a multilayer film composed of In 3 SbTe 2 (IST), CaF 2 , and ZnS on an Al substrate, which possesses the unique ability to synergistically modulate solar-thermal radiation. The solar absorptance and infrared emittance are ( a normal , ε normal ) = (0.829, 0.055) for the solar heating mode and (0.361, 0.835) for the radiative cooling mode, respectively. The underlying mechanism pertains to the Fabry–Pérot resonance and antireflection. The modulation property of the smart film remains excellent even when the incident angle is large. Furthermore, the smart film is capable of achieving multilevel modulation through the alteration of the crystalline IST percentage. The excellent modulation properties of the smart film are substantiated through a quantitative assessment of the net heat flux for terrestrial applications. This analysis reveals that the smart film with amorphous IST achieves a solar heating flux of 800 W/m 2 at 250 K, while for crystalline IST it exhibits a radiative cooling flux of 600 W/m 2 at 330 K. Such a simple multilayer structure can be easily fabricated, which would facilitate the advancement and practical implementation of an all-season smart film.},

  abstract     = {Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is widely employed as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells due to its low manufacturing cost and favorable energy-level alignment. However, the suboptimal quality of TiO 2 films and the presence of multiple defects at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, such as uncoordinated Pb 2+ and oxygen vacancy defects, significantly compromise both device efficiency and stability. This study proposes a synergistic passivation strategy through the introduction of an acetylamino-functionalized interlayer between the perovskite and TiO 2 . The acetylamino groups within the passivation layer establish strong interactions with uncoordinated Pb 2+ in the perovskite, thereby enhancing interface stability. Acetylamino groups can also interact with the TiO 2 layer by bonding with Ti 4+ and reducing oxygen vacancy defects, thereby enhancing the electron transport potential of the TiO 2 layer. The enhanced hydrophobicity of the TiO 2 film, induced by the passivation layer, further promotes perovskite crystallization by minimizing surface tension effects during film growth. Therefore, the device efficiency significantly increased from 16.49% to 19.26%. The lifetime of the unencapsulated device was evaluated under environmental conditions (relative humidity: 30% ± 5%, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C). The efficiency of the unmodified device decreased to 75.3% after 800 h, whereas the modified device maintained 90.1% of its initial efficiency, demonstrating higher stability.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the chemical activity of deposited species is crucial for determining the structure of the 3D/2D heterointerface. During pulsed laser deposition, the chemical activity of SrTiO 3 (STO) can be adjusted by controlling the oxygen partial pressure. Therefore, the relative contributions of chemical and vdW interactions at the STO/mica interface can be tuned.

At room temperature (RT), the MIS-HEMT fabricated with an atomic layer deposited (ALD)-Al 2 O 3 (MIS-HEMT B) exhibits higher maximum drain current ( I d,max ), peak transconductance ( g m,max ), and lower subthreshold slope ( SS ) and gate leakage current compared to MIS-HEMT A fabricated without ex situ Al 2 O 3 , signifying the effectiveness of the ALD-Al 2 O 3 layer to passivate severe surface states. Of note, when the temperature rises from 298 to 423 K, the values of I d,max and g m,max decrease noticeably, while SS and gate leakage current increase considerably in both MIS-HEMTs A and B. However, MIS-HEMT B demonstrates a lower degradation rate in various device properties at 423 K compared to MIS-HEMT A, implying that ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation improves thermal stability. Additionally, ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation reduces the interface state density from 7.48 × 10 12 to 5.3 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 , highlighting its critical role in improving overall device performance.},

Most nonvolatile diodes are realized in ferroelectric systems, but size effects in ferroelectrics limit device miniaturization. In this work, we demonstrate an electrically tunable nonvolatile diode based on non-ferroelectric two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures of GeSe and a quasi-2D electron gas on SrTiO 3 surfaces. The device achieves a tunable current rectification ratio of 10 3 –10 4 without gate bias application, with a continuously adjustable turn-on voltage from 0.1 to 2.1 V. Furthermore, the heterostructure demonstrates nonvolatile resistance switching behavior induced by applied bias voltage. The integration of electrical tunability and non-volatility in a single non-ferroelectric diode offers a promising platform for low-dimensional nonvolatile memory devices with multi-bit storage capability.},

While the LM facilitated the handling of the droplet, LM breaks down upon squeezing, which limits the robust handling. Here, we show that LM exhibits high compression stability when the jammed particles distort the liquid surface to form sub- to single-micron roughness. We find that the particle layers' distortion increases with the evaporation of the inner liquid. Thus, we regulated the evaporation degree of the droplet by varying the mixing ratio of the nonvolatile and volatile liquids. First, we show the regulation of the mixing ratio and its effect on the equilibrium LM static shape and particle layer structure. Then, the effect of the LMs' surface structure on their mechanical response is explored. When 90% of the inner liquid is evaporated, the submicrometer wrinkle structure appears on the LM surface. We name the LM with the wrinkle structure “wrinkled liquid marble (WLM).” The WLM exhibited high compression stability and significantly higher resilience force than the droplet one. We believe this work helps the practical use of the LMs by improving their mechanical stability. Moreover, the fundamental understanding of the particle layer stability at the interface can be advanced.},

The wavelength selectivity in the silicon metasurface corresponding to different configurations enables the GaSe film/silicon tunable metasurface heterostructure to have a response in the range of 1500–1630 nm, covering the telecommunication C and L bands. The response spectrum is derived from the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance of the metasurface structure, and the pump light and signal light correspond to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances of the metasurface structure. The high quality-factor of the quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance brought by the metasurface greatly improves the density of the electromagnetic field near the GaSe film, thus improving the sum-frequency generation conversion efficiency in the GaSe film. The pump and signal corresponding to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances introduced by the silicon metasurface are designed in the telecommunication band, while the sum-frequency light is located in the range that can be directly detected by a silicon detector. The low noise level in a silicon detector can guarantee the high sensitivity detection of shortwave infrared light. The results indicate that the upconversion detector attained a peak detectivity of 1.4 × 10 12 Jones at 1555.1 nm, comparable to commercial broadband InGaAs detectors (Thorlabs).},

However, their practical applications are limited by thermal hysteresis due to low thermal conductivity. In this study, the effect of compressive strain on the thermal transport properties of [(CH 3 ) 4 N][FeCl 4 ] was investigated using molecular dynamic simulation with a deep potential. It is found that the thermal conductivities along the [100], [010], [001], [101], and [011] directions are enhanced under 9% strain by 110%, 580%, 114%, 408%, and 268%, respectively. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed through vibrational density of states and spectral energy densities. The enhancement in thermal conductivity is primarily due to reduced phonon scattering. These findings offer theoretical insights for the practical application of plastic crystals in thermal management systems.},

To date, quantum memories have been realized in many different systems. However, most of them have complex structures and high cost. Besides, it is not easy to simultaneously achieve both high storage efficiency and fidelity. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a low-cost optical quantum memory with high efficiency and high fidelity, by utilizing a butterfly-shaped cavity consisting of one polarization beam splitter, two reflecting mirrors, and one pockels cell crystal. In order to quantify the quality of the quantum memory, we carry out tomography measurements on the time-bin qubits encoded with weak coherent states after storage for N rounds. The storage efficiency per round can reach up to 95.0%, and the overall state fidelity can exceed 99.1%. It thus seems very promising for practical implementation in quantum communication and networks.},

However, the efficiency of traditional lead halide PSCs is approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit, prompting interest in tin-lead perovskite solar cells (Eg ≈ 1.25 eV) as a candidate for tandem configurations with the potential to surpass this limit. A key challenge lies in optimizing the hole transport layer (HTL), as widely used PEDOT:PSS suffers from high acidity and poor crystallinity, hindering device performance. In this work, we used a formic acid modification of PEDOT:PSS to enhance its conductivity, energy band alignment, and crystallinity. Acid treatment promotes proton transfer, reducing insulating PSS chains and improving phase separation, thereby facilitating efficient hole transport. Tin–lead perovskite films fabricated on formic acid-treated PEDOT:PSS (Fa-PEDOT:PSS) exhibit improved crystallinity, larger grain size, and reduced defect density. Devices incorporating Fa-PEDOT:PSS demonstrate enhanced photovoltaic performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.87% with reduced hysteresis and excellent stability, retaining ∼90% of initial efficiency after 1600 h in an inert atmosphere. These findings highlight the potential of acid-treated PEDOT:PSS as an optimized HTL for tin–lead PSCs, paving the way for high-efficiency, environmentally friendly photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have recently attracted considerable attention as promising drug carriers. In vivo imaging of AuNPs is required to investigate their pharmacokinetics. However, a direct and highly sensitive method has not yet been established. Therefore, we proposed the activation imaging of AuNPs that radioactivates AuNPs and non-invasively visualizes them using the emitted gamma rays. When the stable isotope of gold, 197 Au ⁠ , is irradiated with low-energy neutrons, it changes to radioactive 198 Au ⁠ , which predominantly emits 412-keV gamma rays. In this study, we synthesized [ 198 Au ] AuNPs through neutron irradiation and intratumorally injected them into tumor-bearing mice. In vivo imaging was performed using wideband x rays and gamma rays imager, and the distribution of [ 198 Au ] AuNPs in the body of mice was observed. Furthermore, we labeled the alpha-emitting therapeutic drug 211 At with [ 198 Au ] AuNPs ⁠ . Although 211 At itself can be visualized using its 79-keV x rays, the long-term tracking of 211 At -labeled AuNPs has been challenging due to its relatively short half-life of 7.2 h. The activation of AuNPs enables the long-term tracking of 211 At -labeled AuNPs owing to the 2.7-day half-life of 198 Au ⁠ . 211 At -labeled [ 198 Au ] AuNPs were injected intravenously into mice and visualized using a wideband x rays and gamma rays imager. Simultaneous imaging of 211 At and 198 Au was performed on the day of injection and 2 days after injection. Although 211 At could no longer be imaged 2 days after injection, the distribution of the drug was visualized using gamma rays from 198 Au ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {Perylenequinones are important photosensitizers commonly used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to their efficient photoreactivity and photostability, which originate from excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Herein, the mechanisms of ESIPT are explored through first-principle calculations, and the slowly-turned-on and rapidly-turned-off (STRT) laser pulse steered ground and excited states population redistribution of perylenequinone is characterized by employing time-dependent wave packet methods. It is revealed that the strengthened hydrogen bond favors proton transfer in the S 1 state, and due to enhanced non-resonant excitation and reduced energy exchange between the wave packet and external field during the falling period, the asymmetric pulses could increase the excited-state population, leading to improved excitation efficiency. Compared to traditional Gauss-type laser pulses, the optimization of STRT parameters (i.e., falling time, intensity, and wavelength) could bring more population in the excited state (>80%) and promote subsequent proton transfer processes that are responsible for enhancing therapeutic effects during PDT. The present work offers valuable insights into the interactions between external fields and molecules, paving the way for optimized drug delivery systems with minimal damage to normal tissue and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.},

However, it is still unclear whether a nonmetallic filament conductive mechanism could exist in these thinnest memristors. Here, the resistive switching characteristics of h -BN atomristors with different electrodes are systematically investigated, it is found that the switching processes in these thinnest memory devices are primarily dominated by the interactions between electrode-atoms and defects in the dielectric layer, and the resistive switching mechanism in these atomic devices could be tuned by the kind of single-defect. Based on this, we propose a nonmetal filament conductive mechanism according to the nitrogen vacancy ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ) enhanced conductivity effect in a single layer h -BN.

To obtain a cleaner frequency spectrum response, we propose an XBAR with a wave-shaped interdigital transducer (IDT) to suppress spurious modes. It is revealed by using a finite element method model, and spurious modes are significantly eliminated in the passband due to the non-parallel boundary of IDTs. We then experimentally verify the theoretical analyses. The wave-shaped XBAR is fabricated based on a Z-cut LiNbO 3 thin film, showing a nearly spurious-free impedance response. Then a filter based on the wave-shaped XBAR is fabricated, with fewer in-band ripples, featuring a center frequency of 5.77 GHz and a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 7.8%.

We solved this problem with the gradient doping technique, and the f c and V br were improved at the same time. For the proposed gradient doped GaN SBD, the doping concentration of the drift layer increases gradually from top to bottom. Then, the capacitance was reduced by the lightly doped surface region, while the series resistance was reduced by the heavily doped bottom region. As a result, f c was improved, and a high f c of 710 GHz was obtained. In addition, V br was also enhanced by the lightly doped surface region, and a high V br of 28 V was achieved. As a consequence, f c · V br of the proposed SBD is about 2 times that of the previous GaN SBDs, which is a great improvement. The gradient doping technology fully exploits the potential of GaN SBD in high frequency and high voltage, making GaN SBD a promising candidate for terahertz (THz) applications.},

This performance far surpassed that of small molecule non-fullerene acceptor PM6: 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]-thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) devices using PET/ITO and PI/AgNW TCEs. The toughening mechanisms of TCEs and devices were further analyzed through finite element simulations, highlighting the importance of optimizing the mechanical properties of both the TCE and the active layer. This study underscores the significant potential of PI/AgNW-based all-PSCs in the field of ultra-flexible solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Quantum interference has been intensively pursued in molecular electronics to investigate and utilize coherent electron transport at the ultra-small level. An essential type of quantum interference with drastic destructive-constructive switching, known as Fano interference, has been widely reported in various kinds of nanoelectronics electronic systems, but not yet been electrostatically gating in a single-molecule device. Here, we fabricate the three-terminal single-molecule transistors based on the molecule with a long backbone and a side group to demonstrate the gate-controllable Fano interference. By applying bias and gate voltages, the two-dimensional differential conductance map shows the noncentrosymmetrical Fano patterns. Combined with the electron transport model and the first principles calculations, the resonant parameters of the Fano interference can unveil the coupling geometry of the junction and the spatial distribution of the resonant states. Our findings provide an instrumental method to induce and utilize the quantum interference behaviors at the molecular level.},

While it has been widely reported in chiral magnets, oxide heterostructures, and hybrid systems such as ferromagnet/heavy metal and ferromagnet/topological insulators, the study of non-collinear spin texture in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) monolayers is relatively lacking, hindering the understanding at the atomically thin scale. Here, we probe the temperature-dependent antisymmetric humps in Hall resistivity by utilizing the proximity coupling of Fe-doped monolayer WSe 2 (Fe:WSe 2 ) synthesized using chemical vapor deposition on a Pt Hall bar. Multiple characterization methods were employed to demonstrate that Fe atoms substitutionally replace W atoms, making a 2D vdW DMS at room temperature. Distinct from the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, we found the transverse Hall resistivity of Fe:WSe 2 displaying two additional antisymmetric peak features in the temperature-dependent measurements. These peaks are attributed to the magnetic features at the Fe:WSe 2 and Pt interface. Our work shows that a DMS synthesized from 2D vdW transition metal dichalcogenides is promising for realizing magnetic and spintronic applications.},

The simulation results exhibited good agreement with the observed voltage transient behavior and predictions from the nucleation-limited-switching model. Although the capacitor achieved a comparable polarization distribution after the relaxation process, the pathways to reach the static state differed for the different writing signals. Specifically, writing signals with higher amplitude result in more complex polarization domain structures just after the signal is turned off. Analysis of the relaxation process revealed that the dielectric component dominated the early stage, whereas domain-wall motion became more dominant in the later stage. These insights into the polarization relaxation dynamics will contribute to improvements in the operational speed and reliability of ferroelectric devices.},

Because a certain level of thermal budget is required to achieve ferroelectricity in 10 nm HZO thin films, the crystallization temperature can be lowered below 400 °C by simply increasing the annealing time. In addition, the analysis of the crystallization behavior of HZO thin films based on the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov model revealed that longer annealing times are required to lower the annealing temperature for HZO crystallization due to the limitation of the crystallization rate. Consequently, low-temperature (<400 °C) ferroelectric HZO thin films with large remanent polarization along with improved leakage behavior and endurance were realized. These results not only facilitate the back-end-of-line integration of HZO thin films but also demonstrate the feasibility of in situ HZO crystallization by thermal budget for subsequent interconnect formation, simplifying the overall process and saving costs by eliminating a dedicated annealing process.},

Current morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior exhibits a higher permittivity but relatively high leakage. In this work, we propose a feasible approach to achieve MPB and low leakage by the charge balance effect in the doped HfO 2 -ZrO 2 superlattice system. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the synergy effect of doping and oxygen vacancies can achieve lower phase transition barriers between polar and nonpolar phases, suggesting the formation of more MPB regions. Especially for Y dopant, it is more preferred due to the smallest transition barrier. Additionally, defect states arising from oxygen vacancies can be passivized at the charge balance state to enable large bandgap, suppressing leakage currents. This work provides a potential solution for a dielectric material with a higher permittivity and a lower leakage, paving the way for future 3D DRAM capacitors.},

These “singles” are consistent with events occurring within the aluminum athermal phonon collection fins. Similarly, our measured detector noise is higher than the theoretical expectation. Measured noise can be split into an uncorrelated component, consistent with shot noise from small energy depositions within the athermal phonon sensor itself, and a correlated component, consistent with shot noise from energy depositions within the silicon substrate's phonon system.},

Ferrimagnets (FIM) composed of rare earth and transition metals show peculiar properties near the magnetic compensation point, including an exceptionally high SOT efficiency and a significantly enhanced DMI effective field. Here, we investigate FIM [Co/Gd] N multilayers with a magnetic compensation by varying the number of stacking layers ( N ). The net magnetization is dominated by Co and Gd at small and large N , respectively, with the magnetic compensation point located at N = 9. The DMI effective field, obtained by using a magnetic droplet model, increases substantially when the multilayer approaches its magnetic compensation. Correspondingly, we found the emergence of current-induced magnetization switching in the Gd-dominated region, among which the case of N = 10 was realized without an assistance field. We attribute such magnetization switching behavior to the symmetry breaking provided by DMI, together with its large value and the huge SOT associated with it near the magnetic compensation. Our work establishes the direct connection between the DMI and the field-free SOT switching in rare-earth/transition-metal FIM systems.},

In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO 2 (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin-torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis supports the coexistence of USHE and APHE and demonstrates that both originate from the crystal symmetry of IrO 2 (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.},

This has resulted in the absence of experimental data on the pressure–temperature ( P–T ) phase diagram at low temperatures. Here, we probe the pressure-induced B3–B1 phase transition and phonon evolution behavior of ZnS at low temperatures (90–300 K) using isothermal compression Raman spectroscopy. We experimentally determine the ZnS B3–B1 phase boundaries at low temperatures and obtain the corresponding Clapeyron slope, dP / dT = −16.4 ± 2.1 MPa/K. In addition, we found that the pressure coefficients ( ⁠ K i T ⁠ ) of all phonon modes of B3-ZnS decrease with decreasing temperature. This is mainly due to the reduction of anharmonic effects at low temperatures. Further, K i T of the multi-phonon coupling states are always larger than those of the single phonon state.},

  abstract     = {As an ultrawide bandgap semiconducting material, Ga 2 O 3 has attracted significant attention in providing a foundation for applications in optoelectronic and power devices. The structural incompatibility and/or lattice mismatch of the substrate poses a challenge in preparing vertical devices using Ga 2 O 3 . Additionally, the challenges Ga 2 O 3 faces in its epitaxy on a silicon substrate further hinder its integration with other silicon-based advanced electronics. This study demonstrated the use of Sr 3 Al 2 O 6 as a sacrificial layer to realize single-crystal freestanding ε-Ga 2 O 3 membranes with physical and performance characteristics comparable to those grown epitaxially on rigid substrates. Importantly, these membranes retained integrity after transfer. Observation of sharp diffraction peaks of ε-Ga 2 O 3 (00 l) orientation in x-ray diffraction indicates excellent single-crystalline characteristics and crystalline quality of ε-Ga 2 O 3 . High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed clear lattice structures belonging to the hexagonal crystal structure of ε-Ga 2 O 3 . The dark current of the photodetector made from freestanding ε-Ga 2 O 3 reaches 10 −12 A at 5 V, while the photocurrent under 100 μ W/cm 2 of 254 nm light illumination reaches 10 −9 A, with a responsivity of 81.16 mA/W, a detectivity of 2.36 × 10 12 Jones, and an external quantum efficiency of 39.67%. Its performance can be compared to or even better than photodetectors made using ε-Ga 2 O 3 directly grown rigid substrates. These results demonstrate that this approach overcomes challenges in fabricating ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based vertical devices and their integration with silicon, laying the groundwork for diverse applications with the next generation of semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Low-symmetry, non-centrosymmetric two-dimensional materials offer a promising basis for applications in multifunctional nanoelectronic devices. In this study, we utilize density functional theory calculations coupled with particle swarm optimization to design a monolayer polymorph of SbP 3 that exhibits monoclinic Pc symmetry and good stability (M-SbP 3 ). M-SbP 3 demonstrates excellent phonon-limited electron mobility of 3525 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature, with an ultrahigh anisotropy ratio of 108, which is four times the previously reported maximum value. Additionally, its optical absorption anisotropy ratio, reaching up to 13.3, is greater than that of most known two-dimensional low-symmetry materials. Due to the high anisotropy of the Young's modulus, the in-plane and out-of-plane Poisson ratios can achieve positive values of 1.29 and 1.91, as well as negative values of −0.43 and −0.88. Furthermore, our results reveal two opposite piezoelectric responses in M-SbP 3 , with significant in-plane piezoelectric coefficients of up to 50.5 × 10 −10 and −86.6 × 10 −10 C/m, respectively. These responses are primarily influenced by the clamped-ion term and may be associated with the high anisotropy of the electronic structure. Moreover, the electrical auxetic effects are a natural consequence of the high anisotropic piezoelectric responses. The highly anisotropic optoelectronic, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties, along with the coexisting mechanical and electrical auxetic effects, make M-SbP 3 a promising component for multifunctional nanoelectronic devices.},

In this Letter, we show that valley-layer coupling (VLC), which is robust against spin–orbit coupling, could be achieved in 2D heterostructures built using distinct 2D monolayers with no VLC feature, as demonstrated by density functional theory calculations on Tl 3 Cl 3 /Ba 2 I 2 F 2 /Tl 3 Cl 3 and Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 Br 2 /Sn 2 Te 2 van der Waals heterostructures. These two heterostructures exhibit valley-selective linear dichroism, which enables the optical creation of interlayer or intralayer excitons with selected valley and electric polarization. Furthermore, both the K 2 Br 2 /Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 Br 2 and Sn 2 Te 2 /K 2 ClBr/Sn 2 Te 2 heterostructures are ferrovalley materials due to the ferroelectricity of Sn 2 Te 2 and the built-in electric field caused by Janus K 2 ClBr, respectively. Our results broaden the candidate VLC materials from 2D monolayers and bilayers to 2D van der Waals heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {Stacking of freestanding membranes enables the formation of interfaces beyond what can be obtained with classical heteroepitaxy. In particular, twisted interfaces provide unique physical properties not existent in the corresponding individual layers. An ideal twist grain boundary yields an in-plane screw-dislocation network, assuming sufficiently strong interactions across the interface, for example, via covalent or ionic bonding. Hereby, the distance between dislocation lines, that is the length scale of the Moiré pattern, is set by the twist angle between the adjacent crystalline surfaces and the lattice mismatch in case that different materials are placed together. The associated strain gradients of the periodic pattern are especially appealing for oxide-based perovskites due to the intricate connection between surface polarization and subtle structural deformations such as the oxygen octahedra tilt. Recently, freestanding oxide perovskites became available via the sacrificial layer approach, opening a pathway toward oxide-based Moiré materials. Here, we demonstrate efficient bonding of a freestanding SrTiO 3 layer to a SrTiO 3 single-crystal by initially conducting a wafer-bonding process at high temperature and only subsequently dissolving the sacrificial layer. We investigate the twisted SrTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface with x-ray diffraction in grazing incidence geometry and observe clear signatures of a highly periodic lateral superlattice consistent with the formation of a screw-dislocation network. Our work demonstrates a robust route for the fabrication of twisted perovskites and their development into a functional material platform with designed strain gradients at the nanoscale.},

Herein, we investigate charge transfer at organic-perovskite heterojunctions and explore how bandgap engineering can be utilized to modulate interfacial charge dynamics. Using transient absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that charge transfer at the interface of organic-perovskite heterojunction can be regulated and enhanced by increasing the energy level offset, which is achieved through the adjustment of the halide ion ratio in the perovskite material. These findings provide insights into interfacial charge transfer mechanisms and confirm the feasibility of bandgap engineering as a strategy for tailoring charge-transfer properties in organic optoelectronic devices.},

Using a minimalist anisotropic nanofin library, we optimize the phase distribution of the metalens at each designed wavelength with the particle swarm algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate a stable focal length with a deviation of less than 4% and an average focusing efficiency of 80.5% in the visible wavelength range of 450–650 nm. Moreover, we design a multi-wavelength off-axis bi-focal metalens to demonstrate the flexible control of output light phase and dispersion achieved by this method. The generality of this design enables its implementation in various metasurface devices, accelerating applications in high-quality and multi-channel image display.},

Quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) can greatly localize the light field and enhance light–matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing a platform for high quality (Q) factors in chiral light devices. In this paper, we conduct a numerical investigation into the perfect chiral linear and nonlinear optical responses in the high-Q QBIC metasurfaces. The designed metasurface consists of silicon nanodisk tetrameric, and when one of these nanodisks is resized along a specific direction, symmetry breaking occurs within the structure. The high-Q QBICs of 1.13 × 10 4 can be excited by the right circularly polarized (RCP) light, while the response is weaker under the left circularly polarized (LCP) light. The observed circular dichroism (CD) value reaches 0.9988, indicating an almost perfect chiral optical resonance with a high Q-factor. Furthermore, we investigate the third and fifth harmonic generation of this device. Under RCP (LCP) light irradiation, their conversion efficiencies attain 2.99 × 10 − 2 ( ⁠ 7.98 × 10 − 4 ⁠ ) and 2.21 × 10 − 8 ( ⁠ 5.91 × 10 − 11 ⁠ ), and their corresponding harmonic CD values reach 0.948 and 0.994, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the conversion efficiency across different RCP power levels to further validate the generation of the third and fifth harmonics, as well as assess their CD values at varying powers, which show good stability. This work presents a promising approach for exciting high-performance chiral light sources.},

The second type is a two-layer MM structure that consists of a dielectric FM thin plate bordering a dielectric nonmagnetic thin plate. The periodic lattice of the dielectrically insulated metal wires is embedded in both plates. The simulations of the PPWGs with both MM-filling types are made with a finite-difference time-domain Landau–Lifshits–Gilbert (LLG) electromagnetic solver MaxLLG, based on a joint solution of the Maxwell and LLG equations. It is shown that in both cases a bandwidth of the “extraordinary” slow forward EMW is wider by approximately an order of magnitude than a bandwidth of a similar wave existing in the PPWG completely filled with a single FM thin layer without wire inclusions. The ultra-wideband effect is observed only for FM MM thin plates located in high-intensity magnetic biased fields.},

Reciprocal space mapping and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal that a pseudomorphic wetting layer forms during the early growth, followed by the nucleation of mixed κ / β -phase islands. As the film thickens, strain drives further κ -to- β transitions and thickens the disordered intermediate β -phase layer. First-principles calculations confirm that the κ -to- β phase transition is triggered when the in-plane strain exceeds the threshold value of 2.7%.

The magnetic dipole constants A P 3 / 2 of 111 Cd + and 113 Cd + are estimated to be 395 939 ( 8 ) and 411 275 ( 6 ) kHz ⁠ , respectively. The difference between the measured and theoretical hyperfine structure constants indicates that more physical effects are required to be considered in the theoretical calculation and provides critical data for the examination of deviation from King-plot linearity in isotope shifts.},

This technique is based on the introduction of a nonlinear chirp that is determined solely by the input spectral intensity and the target temporal intensity. We describe its working principle and experimentally demonstrate the generation of triangle-shaped pulses at the output of a laser source, which delivers 150 μ J, sub-200 fs pulses at 150 kHz. These pulses are then passed through a nonlinear multipass cell to observe wavelength shifting via self-phase modulation. A spectral tunabibility of 14 nm is achieved around the input central wavelength of 1034 nm.},

  abstract     = {p-hBN/n-AlGaN heterojunctions were fabricated using a dry-selective lift-off/transfer of Mg-doped hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer on top of n-AlGaN. Electrical contacts were used as mechanical stressors to provide structural rigidity to hBN layers as well as enabling selective lift-off. These junctions exhibit a rectifying behavior with a rectification ratio of approximately 3 × 10 5 at 3 V. When junctions were forward biased, ultraviolet (UV) emission around 262 nm was measured. This emission corresponds to recombinations in the n-AlGaN layer, demonstrating good hole injection in the structure. Full light emitting diode (LED) structures were fabricated by integrating UV multi quantum wells (MQWs) into these junctions. Produced UV LEDs emit around 290 nm serving as a proof of concept for future layer transferred p-hBN/MQWs/n-AlGaN structures in which the Al content is increased to go toward deep ultraviolet (DUV) emission. The selective pick and place process used to build these LEDs has multiple advantages. First, it allows independent optimization of the p-side as well as of the n-side, which includes the quantum wells. Second, UV MQWs are protected from the high temperatures needed for high hBN material quality growth, and thus their thermal stability is not affected.},

Our approach involves developing a data-driven deep learning simulator that estimates the electromagnetic response. Specifically, the simulator predicts the electric field distribution at a given cross section of a plasmonic meta-atom based on its geometry. Since the simulator is differentiable, it enables the optimization of various powers of the electric field intensity by coupling it with a generator model and a suitable loss function. With respect to conventional methods that rely on trial and error for optimization and miss atoms intercoupling, our approach systematically considers the collective behavior of the metasurface and efficiently explores the design space. Furthermore, it is capable of capturing multiple local minima within these electrodynamic systems, with optimization results well beyond the training dataset. The generalization capability of the simulator and the behavior of the optimized geometries are validated against a finite element method numerical model.},

However, the efficiency of micro-LEDs sharply decreases with decreasing device size due to sidewall damage resulting from the mesa etching. Therefore, the implementation of a low-damage pixelization technique is essential for enhancing the performance of micro-LEDs. In this Letter, ion implantation (IIP) was employed to improve the performance of InGaN green micro-LED arrays with a pixel size of around 6.5 μ m and a resolution of 25 × 25. The peak external quantum efficiency of the micro-LED array is enhanced to 6.2%, which is much higher than the 2.4% of that fabricated by conventional inductively coupled plasma etching. In addition, the transmission data rate of the IIP-pixelized micro-LED array is 2.7 times higher, increasing from 115.5 to 307.3 Mbps at an operating current density of about 100 A/cm 2 .

With the rapid development of nonlinear metamaterials and metasurfaces, the concept of geometric phase has been extended to the regime of nonlinear optics and attracts growing interest due to its capability of manipulating the nonlinear optical fields. On the one hand, nonlinear geometric phase offers a platform to investigate the fundamental principles in light–matter interactions during the nonlinear optical processes. On the other hand, it can be applied to design nonlinear optical elements with versatile functionality, such as wavefront engineering, optical imaging, and optical holography. To give a comprehensive review of nonlinear geometric phase, here, we overview the fundamental mechanisms, including the symmetry selection rules, the origin of the geometric phase in harmonic generations, and the characteristics of nonlinear geometric phase. We summarize the related applications based on the concepts of nonlinear geometric phase and symmetry selection rules, mainly focusing on the recent progresses from nonlinear optical sources to nonlinear optical field manipulation and beyond. In addition to reviewing the achievements in a wide variety of applications based on the nonlinear geometric phase, we also give prospects on their future development.

However, in the conventional L-C-type matching circuits, resonator frequency tunability is limited by poor design flexibility of the shunt capacitance and hence the circuit. Recently, L-L-type matching circuits comprising a series and a shunt inductor have been proposed to address this issue. Here, we report RF reflectometry readout of silicon quantum dot-based charge sensors embedded in L-L-type circuits. We determine the inductance values for target resonance frequencies based on our equivalent circuit model that incorporates the parasitic elements of the inductors and demonstrate resonator frequency tunability of up to 1 GHz with 3-dB resonator bandwidths on the order of MHz. The measured conductance sensitivities, on the order of 10 −5 ( e 2 / h ) / Hz at 4 K, are only moderately dependent on the resonance frequency up to 630 MHz.

Here, we develop a homogeneous plasmon-enhanced Raman biosensor integrated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, namely LASSO-ANN-PERB, to sensitively assess spectroscopic variations of human urine samples for label-free and rapid stone screening. In a practical scenario loaded with low-volume Raman features of urine from healthy subjects and patients, the integrated biosensor realizes an excellent stones identification accuracy as well as can largely shorten the time consumption throughout the workflow. These practically demonstrated merits suggest the potential of integrated biosensor with the unique ability to enable noninvasive urine fluid biopsy for further development of rapid stones diagnostics, which may promisingly advance the existing clinical routine toward a convenient one.},

  abstract     = {Non-contact pulsed magnetic fields can enhance the permeability of biological cells, creating an innovative approach for delivering external substances through cell membranes. However, the mechanism by which pulsed magnetic fields cause cell permeabilization remains unclear, and experimental findings from different researchers often vary widely, sometimes even contradicting one another. To gain a deeper understanding of cell permeabilization caused by pulsed magnetic fields, this study uses a theoretical analytical approach. It begins with a qualitative analysis of how the induced electric field and radial stress generated by a time-varying magnetic field affect the free energy of pores from an energy perspective. Next, a numerical model is developed to quantitatively explore the dynamic changes in pores driven by the induced electric field and radial stress. The results demonstrate that, compared to the numerical model considering only the induced electric field, the model incorporating both the induced electric field and radial stress increases the predicted pore expansion capability by 161.8%. This enhancement allows for more accurate predictions of pore formation on the cell membrane under the influence of pulsed magnetic fields. This study incorporates radial stress into a pore-opening dynamics model under pulsed magnetic fields and develops an associated numerical model, thereby providing a foundation for elucidating the permeabilization mechanisms of pulsed magnetic fields.},

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) study showed that modification at moderate concentration (20 mM modification) increases the “I/Pb” ratio from 2.08 to 2.72. Angle-resolved XPS study is performed by varying the takeoff angle from 150° to 90°. OAI treatment increases the I/Pb ratio at each takeoff angle, showing the coordination of Pb (II) has been fully improved. Besides, the atomic ratio between N2 (from OAI) and Pb (from PVSK) decreases from 1.13 to 0.86 (20 mM modification), showing that OAI prefers to react with the surface layer of PVSK. Due to the improved coordination environment of Pb (II), the work function of PVSK increases by approximately 0.3 eV as revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy study, the built-in potential of perovskite solar cell (PSC) increases from 1.0 to 1.05 V. Accordingly, carrier extraction is accelerated, while carrier lifetime is prolonged, and the power conversion efficiency of PSCs is upgraded from 20.47% to 24.00%, with the fill factor rising from 77.32% to 82.79% and the open-circuit voltage from 1.11 to 1.16 V.

  abstract     = {Converting external physical information into tactile sensations for efficient dynamic processing like human beings is crucial for edge applications such as intelligent prosthetics and robotics. Reservoir computing, a bio-inspired computing paradigm, excels at processing temporal signals and offers advantages like low training costs and easy deployment on edge devices. Many applications have been developed for reservoir computing using physical devices. However, there has been a paucity of research using reservoir computing to simulate the human tactile system. Furthermore, the implementation of a reusable physical reservoir computing system is of significant importance. Herein, we implement a near-sensor physical reservoir computing system for haptic simulation, utilizing a simple peripheral circuit design. The reservoir's high-dimensional, nonlinear, and short-term memory requirements are physically realized by a memristor with an integrated lithium polymer electrolyte and polycrystalline tungsten oxide layer, which exhibits good cycle-to-cycle consistency. As a proof of concept, the system completes the learning and classification tasks for Braille numerals and characters, achieving a high recognition accuracy of up to 96% within 400 cycles. This approach offers innovative insights for developing human–machine interaction applications with enhanced intelligent perception capability.},

Therefore, exploration for a flexible and transparent thermoelectric power generator (F-TTEG) is on the rise. In this study, we develop n -type transparent CdO films on the polyimide (PI) substrate, which exhibit outstanding flexibility, maintaining 90% and 99% of their original electrical conductivity and transmittance after 500 bending cycles around a 11-mm diameter rod. The films also demonstrate a high power factor of ∼ 1.3 μ W cm −1 K −2 at room temperature. A thermoelectric prototype consisting of 8-leg of the CdO film generates a voltage of 15.2 mV and a maximum power density of 5.48 W m −2 at a temperature difference of 85 K. This work suggests that CdO films offer promising prospect for the development of high performance F-TTEG devices.},

  abstract     = {Gray tin ( α -Sn) is an elemental topological material with various topological phases. It is predicted to be a 3D Dirac semimetal when appropriate strain is applied. However, the Dirac semi-metallic properties, such as chiral anomaly, are hard to be observed, probably due to the imperfections in the α -Sn samples. It is even more challenging to manipulate the topological properties in this metastable material without a sacrifice in the crystalline quality. Here, we report a strategy of Fermi level tuning by doping the α -Sn films grown on CdTe (001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. The negative magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect, which are attributed to chiral anomaly, are observed in α -Sn when the Fermi level is tuned close to the bulk Dirac point. Detailed analyses of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations show nontrivial Berry phases for all the samples. Combined with first-principle calculations, these results provide a strong evidence of the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal phase in α -Sn. Furthermore, a clear transition from two-dimensional topological surface states to three-dimensional bulk Dirac cone is demonstrated in α -Sn by precise Fermi level tuning through doping. This study proves the 3D Dirac semimetal phase in α -Sn and provides an effective strategy to manipulate the topological properties for both fundamental studies and device applications.},

  abstract     = {The (K,Na)NbO 3 -based ceramics are a promising type of lead-free piezoelectric material, but simultaneously achieving an ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficient d 33 and good temperature stability in them is extremely difficult due to the phase transitions. An approach of fabricating the engineered piezoelectric materials of laminated ceramic composites (LCCs) was proposed to break the bottleneck instead. Two or more piezoelectric ceramic layers are stacked in the order of alternatively opposite polarizations and are combined together by electrodes, which are connected as in the cases of bimorph or laminated multilayer ceramic capacitors. Experimentally, a compositional series of (1 − x )(K 0.48 Na 0.52 )(Nb 0.96 Sb 0.04 )O 3 – x (Bi 0.50 Na 0.50 )ZrO 3 (KNNS- x BNZ) ceramics and a textured 0.965(K 0.48 Na 0.52 ) 0.99 Li 0.01 (Nb 0.98 Sb 0.02 )O 3 -0.035(Bi 0.50 Na 0.50 )ZrO 3 (KNLNS-BNZ) ceramic were used to verify this approach. The four-layer LCC with thin ceramic plates of different KNNS- x BNZ compositions shows an averaged d 33 of 1230 pC/N, and temperature stability of d 33 changes within ±5% up to 120 °C. The three-layer LCC of KNLNS-BNZ textured ceramic exhibits d 33 of 1100 pC/N at room temperature with d 33 changes of less than 8.1% up to 190 °C.

However, its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study examines the influence of DC poling on pyroelectricity in Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 films. Direct measurements of pyrocurrent hysteresis curves revealed asymmetries along both the voltage (horizontal) and pyrocurrent (vertical) axes that cannot be explained using conventional single-coefficient pyroelectric evaluations. The switchable and non-switchable contributions to the pyrocurrent were also investigated. Our results indicate that the switchable contribution is directly proportional to the remanent polarization, consistent with the behavior of ideal ferroelectrics. Conversely, the non-switchable pyrocurrent, which is of comparable magnitude, is enhanced by poling and exhibits dependence on the poling direction. This non-switchable contribution shares the same poling-time dependence as the internal bias field, suggesting its origin lies in electrets such as fixed dipoles or pinned domains. These findings underscore the value of directly evaluating pyrocurrent for both positive and negative voltage polarities and demonstrate the potential to enhance directional pyrocurrent in ferroelectric thin films through controlled poling.},

  abstract     = {Fe/GaAs is a prototype system of spin injection at room temperature. The interfacial strain and oriented bonds are both considered the origin of the Fe in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which remains decisive. Here, by the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and the vibrating sample magnetometer measurements, this study shows that in the Fe/Cr( t )/GaAs structure, the in-plane UMA of Fe originates from the chemical bonding between the Fe and the GaAs substrate by varying Cr thickness, t . The UMA drops as the Cr coverage increases, characterized by a decrease in the saturation field from 2400 to 57 Oe. The XMCD studies reveal that the Fe orbital moment, a signature of chemical bonds, decreases from 0.216 μ B at Cr = 0 ML to 0.138 μ B at Cr = 5 ML. The reduction of the Fe orbital moment and the UMA are qualitatively consistent, establishing a link between the UMA and the interfacial chemical bonds. The decreased UMA remains unchanged at t > 5 ML, above which Fe and GaAs are fully separated by a continuous Cr layer. Our findings provide clear experimental evidence that the UMA in the Fe/GaAs system originates from the oriented interface bonds, clarifying the UMA origin in this prototype system.},

  abstract     = {Twisted spin waves (or twisted magnons, TMs) have significant potential in high-capacity communication due to their orbital angular momentum (OAM) degree of freedom. Consequently, manipulating the propagation of TMs has become an important topic in spintronics. Here, we theoretically study the band structures of TMs in ferromagnetic cylindrical magnonic crystals with periodically modulated anisotropy. We find that the TMs with arbitrary OAMs exhibit forbidden bands at the boundary of the Brillouin zone, though, in different frequency ranges. This unique feature offers a promising avenue for developing filters capable of blocking the propagation of TMs with specific OAMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of TM bandgaps, as their position and width can be easily adjusted by altering the magnitude of anisotropy or the period of the crystal structure. Full micromagnetic simulations are performed to verify the theoretical predictions, showing good agreement. Our work not only enhances our understanding of TM propagation characteristics but also paves the way for the design of advanced spintronic devices that harness the magnon OAM degree of freedom.},

  abstract     = {Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for spin–orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3 d ferromagnetic metals including spin–orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L1 0 -MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3 d ferromagnetic metals are on the order of 1000 ℏ/2 e (Ω cm) −1 at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01–0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L1 0 -MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10 000 ℏ/2 e (Ω cm) −1 , with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3 d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding of the spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.},

By changing the orientation of the Cu(1,3-bdc) flakes on the chip, coherent level repulsion of two different magnon modes is demonstrated. Our measurements indicate that magnon modes in two anisotropic Cu(1,3-bdc) flakes interact with each other by the mediation of cavity photons, with the coupling energy transfer conforming to the “magnon-loss-resistor” model. Our research offers a pathway to investigate spin dynamics in innovative quantum materials, facilitating magnon–photon coupling for effective quantum operations.},

  abstract     = {Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available atomic force microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6 ± 0.6 × 10 −15 Nm torque while applying 373 ± 5 mT field at 12 ± 2° angle to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 μ m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a ≈1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles' mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {Developing permanent magnets with fewer critical elements requires understanding hysteresis effects and coercivity through visualizing magnetization reversal. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of the geometry of nanoscale ferromagnetic inclusions in a paramagnetic/nonmagnetic matrix to understand the key factors that maximize the magnetic energy product of such nanocomposite systems. Specifically, we have considered a matrix of “3 μ m × 3 μ m × 40 nm” dimension, which is a sufficiently large volume, two-dimensional representation considering that the ferromagnetic inclusions' thickness is less than 3.33% of the lateral dimensions simulated. Using this approach, which minimizes edge effects to approximate bulk-like magnetic behavior while remaining computationally tractable for simulation, we systematically studied the effect of the thickness of ferromagnetic strips, separation between the ferromagnetic strips due to the nonmagnetic matrix material, different saturation magnetization values, and the length of these ferromagnetic strips on magnetic coercivity and remanence by simulating the hysteresis loop plots for each geometry. Furthermore, we study the underlying micromagnetic mechanism for magnetic reversal to understand the factors that could help attain the maximum magnetic energy densities for ferromagnetic nanocomposite systems in a paramagnetic/nonmagnetic material matrix. In this study, we have used material parameters of an exemplary Alnico alloy system, a rare-earth-free, thermally stable nanocomposite, which could potentially replace high-strength NdFeB magnets in applications that do not require large energy products. However, we project the energy density ( BH ) max of materials with higher saturation magnetization to have an ideal theoretical limit of ( BH ) max ∼94 kJ/m 3 (∼12 MGOe), which is ∼(35%–40%) of the energy density of Rare-Earth Free Magnets. This energy density could be higher if exchange bias from antiferromagnets, defects, and pinning is included and could stimulate further experimental work on the fabrication and large-scale manufacturing of RE-free PMs with different nanocomposite systems.},

A silicon diaphragm measuring 1.5 × 1.5 mm 2 is coated with Pt (100-nm-thick) and FeGa (100-nm-thick) thin films. An alternating charge current passed through the FeGa/Pt/Si diaphragm under a magnetic field perpendicular to the charge current generates an alternating spin current via the spin Hall effect in the Pt film, transferring angular momentum from the Pt film to the FeGa film. The injected spin current provides energy and changes the effective temperature, thereby varying the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moments. In a magnetic material with volume magnetostriction, the thermal fluctuation of the magnetic moments affects its volume. When the spin fluctuations change, the volume magnetostriction induces a corresponding expansion or contraction of the material. Both electrodeposited and ion-beam sputter-deposited FeGa films are investigated, and it is observed that the FeGa film exhibits SVE. The force generated by the SVE is evaluated based on the vibration amplitude at the fundamental resonant mode. This study demonstrates that the force generated by the SVE is correlated with the volume magnetostriction and the deposition process.},

In this work, we present an MTJ design with a free layer and two polarizers capable of computing the sigmoidal activation function and its gradient at the device level. This design enables both feedforward and backpropagation computations within a single device, extending neuromorphic computing frameworks previously explored in the literature by introducing the ability to perform backpropagation directly in hardware. Our algorithm implementation reveals two key findings: (i) the small discrepancies between the MTJ-generated curves and the exact software-generated curves have a negligible impact on the performance of the backpropagation algorithm, (ii) the device implementation is highly robust to inter-device variation and noise, and (iii) the proposed method effectively supports transfer learning and knowledge distillation. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the performance of an edge computing network using weights from a software-trained model implemented with our MTJ design. The results show a minimal loss of accuracy of only 0.4% for the Fashion MNIST dataset and 1.7% for the CIFAR-100 dataset compared to the original software implementation. These results highlight the potential of our MTJ design for compact, hardware-based neural networks in edge computing applications, particularly for transfer learning.},

  abstract     = {While the multiple electronic phase transitions in rare-earth perovskite nickelates ( Re NiO 3 ) open up a new paradigm in developing the next-generation logical devices and sensors catering for artificial intelligence, their respective contact strategy for making electronic devices largely relies on noble metal (e.g., Pt). Herein, we demonstrate the critical roles associated with the work function ( W ) of the contacting metal that is critical in the device application of Re NiO 3 based on both their conventional metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) and the recently discovered hydrogen-triggered Mottronic transition. Owing to the high valence Ni 3+ associated with Re NiO 3 that is rather oxidative and also results in bi-polar carriers from generating Ligand holes, we demonstrate that their low resistive contact is only achievable for using inert metal (e.g., the standard electrode potential beyond 0.4 V) with either high W (e.g., >5 eV) or low W (e.g., <4.7 eV). This sheds light on alternative contacting strategies for Re NiO 3 using the much cheaper Cu or Ag with low W that can also achieve abrupt resistive switch across MIT, in addition to the present noble metal with high W . Furthermore, the magnitude of W was also discovered to dominate the hydrogen-triggered Mottronic transition for Re NiO 3 via upward (or downward) bending the energy bands that promotes (or inhibits) the H + inward diffusion that switches the orbital configurations between the electron itinerant Ni 3+ and electron localized Ni 2+ . Clarifying these previously overlooked roles from the perspective of the metallic contacts further paves the way for the correlated electronic applications of Re NiO 3 .},

  abstract     = {Germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si), group IV semiconductors, as innovative epitaxial structures, continue to offer improved properties and enhanced parameters for applications in classical and quantum electronics as well as spintronics. The mobility of free carriers is one such parameter that defines the ultimate performance of electronic devices. The dependence of two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) mobility on 2DHG density in an undoped gate controlled compressively strained Ge quantum well (QW) grown on Si (cs-GoS), with QW thicknesses of 15 and 30 nm, is studied and compared at T = 0.3 K. Experimental results show that 2DHG mobility is higher in the thinner QW. 2DHG mobilities of 3.1 × 10 6 and 1.55 × 10 6 cm 2 V −1 s −1 are measured in 15 and 30 nm QWs, respectively, with the same carrier density of 0.9 × 10 11 cm −2 . The results are explained by the existing theory of carriers' scattering on background ionized impurities.},

  abstract     = {An increasing magnetic field perpendicular to an undoped semiconductor surface at low temperature is known to strengthen the binding of localized electrons to stationary ions, as the wavefunction's tails evolve from exponential to Gaussian. It is also known that application of a high bias voltage to a depleted semiconductor can liberate bound charge and induce a large drop in electrical resistance. We connect these established results to experimental electrical transport measurements on off-state germanium Schottky-barrier metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFETs) with an aluminum oxide insulating dielectric and platinum germanide contacts. We make measurements at the three distinct orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the substrate and the current. At 6 K, we observe sharp attenuation of current by more than 2 orders of magnitude, within 60 mT, at a crossover magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate. A 1 T magnetic field attenuates the current by more than 4 orders of magnitude. The strength of the attenuation and the value of the crossover field are controlled by both the gate–source and drain–source voltages. The attenuation is much weaker when the magnetic field is parallel to the current. Finally, we orient the magnetic field parallel to the substrate, but perpendicular to the current, allowing us to distinguish charge hopping at the oxide interface from charge hopping in the bulk. This large off-state magnetoresistance can be exploited for cryogenic magnetic- and photo-detection, and for high-bias, low-leakage MOSFETs.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the GeO 2 thin film has attracted intense attention due to its ultrawide optical bandgap energy (>4 eV), endowing it with quite a promising application for solar-blind photodetectors (SBPDs). Although many epitaxial growth strategies of GeO 2 thin films have been achieved, the design for the controllable GeO 2 SBPDs is still rarely reported, thus hampering its development as next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we deposited pure GeO 2 films with ultrawide bandgap energies of around 5.81 eV using the radio frequency magnetron sputtering method and fabricated back-gated three-terminal SBPDs based on GeO 2 /p-Si heterojunction structures. Subsequently, boosted optoelectronic characteristics at 213 nm, including a lower dark current of 93.52 pA, a higher photon-to-dark-currents ratio of 98.88, and a larger breakdown drain-source voltage (V DS ) over 30 V, are demonstrated due to the introduction of SiO 2 layer between the GeO 2 film and the Si substrate. More importantly, by applying the various voltages on the gate voltage (V GS ) of the GeO 2 /SiO 2 /p-Si three-terminal SBPDs, a significant change in the threshold V DS is achieved in the range from −21.91 to 8.16 V, demonstrating that the V GS can effectively regulate the turn-on V DS of the device. The obtained results can be instructive for the high-performance SBPDs based on GeO 2 films, and our findings will provide a promising approach for achieving high-performance GeO 2 -based SBPDs.},

Designing effective termination structures is a critical step in exploiting the advantages of β -Ga 2 O 3 power diodes. Among various types of termination structures, mesa technique features a simple preparation process and theoretically high efficiency electric field management capability in β -Ga 2 O 3 devices. In order to further reduce the peak electric field along the mesa sidewall and corner, the p-type NiO junction termination extension (JTE) structure was incorporated. However, deep level transient spectroscopy revealed a new shallow energy level at E c –0.28 eV related to interface states inducing by dry etching, which is the cause of the weakened JTE structure effect and instability of electrical properties. A low-temperature post-annealing process was proposed to eliminate the interface states, thereby achieving better charge balance and enhancing the breakdown voltage of compounded termination device from 1.35 to 2.1 kV without sacrificing the forward characteristics. This work reveals the energy level related to interface states introduced by dry etching in β -Ga 2 O 3 and facilitates the fabrication of high-performance devices.},

  abstract     = {p-type ultrawide bandgap oxide semiconductors play a crucial role in developing optoelectronic and electronic devices. Our previous studies have identified rock salt-structured Zn 1−x Ni x O (∼0.27 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys as promising wide bandgap oxides for achieving p-type doping. This is attributed to their high valence band maximum position, which favors the formation of native acceptors, such as nickel vacancies (V Ni ). However, the application of p-type O-rich Zn 1−x Ni x O 1+δ alloys in bipolar devices remains unexplored. In this study, we synthesized rock salt-structured p-type Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ thin films with a bandgap ∼4.4 eV using room-temperature magnetron sputtering in varying oxygen flow ratios (0%–30%). The structural and optoelectronic properties of films were characterized by x-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and variable-temperature Hall-effect measurements. We observed a significant increase in subgap absorption with higher oxygen flow ratios. Subsequently, p-Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ /n-ZnO heterojunction diodes were fabricated on ITO glass. These p–n diodes exhibited high rectification ratio up to ∼3.1 × 10 4 and an ideality factor of ∼3.1. The band diagram of the p–n heterojunction was simulated using SCAPS-1D. These findings underscore the potential of p-type ultrawide bandgap Zn 0.7 Ni 0.3 O 1+δ semiconductors in bipolar device applications, demonstrating their promising performance for future optoelectronic and electronic technologies.},

The internal electric field formed at the interface of Van der Waals junction promotes the separation and efficient transfer of photogenerated carriers, showing the characteristics of low power consumption, self-drive, high responsiveness, and ultrafast response. Therefore, we fabricate a transverse homojunction photodetector by mechanical stripping. Furthermore, considering the influence of the contact between the two sides of the metal electrodes, we select the metal electrodes corresponding to the matching work function according to the Fermi level with different thicknesses of MoTe 2 , and two anti-barrier layers are obtained. Finally, a transverse homojunction self-driven photodetector with Au-thin MoTe 2 -thick MoTe 2 –Ni/Au structure is fabricated, which improves the photosensitivity and response time, and broadens the spectral detection range. When V ds = 0 V, the rectifier ratio increases to 4.6 × 10 3 , which is 50 times higher than that of symmetrical electrode homojunction. Under zero bias voltage, when the spot area is 3 × 10 −9 m 2 , the photosensitivity reaches 28 mA/W (637 nm), the response time is 38.83/40.17 μ s, and the infrared detection is extended to 1550 nm.

We also discovered that for x = 0.75–1.0, a phase transition occurs from the α-Cu 2 P 2 O 7 structure to the β-Cu 2 P 2 O 7 structure with increasing temperature, accompanied by large volume contraction of at most 1.5%.

Traditional methods, relying on high-quality factor resonators or hybrid systems with external feedback, often struggle with complexity, environmental sensitivity, and integration challenges. Advances in non-Hermitian physics and parity-time (PT) symmetry, particularly exceptional points (EPs), offer unique opportunities by leveraging coalescing eigenstates for frequency splitting sensing. However, PT systems require precise gain-loss balance and multi-resonance-mode setups, while EP-based sensors amplify both signals and noise, limiting their robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a single-resonator system with intrinsic anti-PT symmetry, incorporating a dual-channel excitation mechanism that enables dynamic adjustment of loss and coupling for precise resonance control. This design achieves an 80% linewidth reduction and dramatically enhances peak signal and sensitivity by 24.4-fold and 125-fold, respectively, offering a compact, high-performance solution for the next-generation sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in the mid-infrared region have been widely explored to enhance light–matter interactions for biochemical sensing. However, their steep dispersion bands often limit Q-factor stability under focused light. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a super QBIC within a flatband by introducing lateral geometric perturbations in a square lattice of etched holes in high-index Ge films, enabling strong coupling between energy bands. The super QBIC achieves a theoretical Q-factor two orders of magnitude higher than conventional QBICs, with nearly zero group velocity, and supports ultra-narrowband resonances with slow light effect. Experimentally, we report a robust Q-factor of ∼270 at a tilted angle, a full width at half maximum of ∼22 nm, and a field enhancement of ∼23 in accessible optical cavities. Vibrational strong coupling is achieved between the super QBIC mode and the C=O vibrational mode of polymethylmethacrylate molecules, with Rabi mode splitting and a Rabi energy of 24.2 cm −1 at zero detuning. Differential transmission spectra reveal a fivefold enhancement in molecular absorption due to strong field localization. These results demonstrate the potential of flatband metasurfaces for advancing surface-enhanced infrared absorption at the micrometer scale.},

Theoretical calculations on the electronic properties of these expanded Si forms suggest that, unlike the most stable d-Si structure, many may possess direct or quasi-direct bandgaps and only exhibit slightly higher formation energies than d-Si. The few that have been synthesized already display exciting optical properties, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Their unique open-framework, guest–host structures enable distinctive interactions between Si and interstitial guest/dopant atoms, offering exciting potentials in spintronics, energy storage, and bio/medical technologies. In this Perspective, we provide an introduction and overview of the latest theoretical and experimental advancements in low-density Si allotropes, emphasizing their potential in various electronic and energy-related applications.

However, the formation of passivation films and the suboptimal standard electrode potential have been primary scientific challenges hindering the rapid advancement of magnesium-air batteries. This study develops Mg 2 Sn anode materials and conceptualizes a mechanism leveraging their superior thermoelectric properties to enhance the open-circuit voltage and inhibit the formation of passivation films. By employing a self-designed magnesium saturation temperature smelting method, high-performance n-type and p-type Mg 2 Sn thermoelectric materials are synthesized rapidly in the air. Notably, the n-type thermoelectric material exhibits a peak power factor of up to 4.83 mW m −1 K −2 and a thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) exceeding 1. A unique Mg 2 Sn-air battery is engineered to utilize thermoelectric effects for modulating the built-in electric field. This design not only compensates for the open-circuit voltage but also harnesses the Seebeck electromotive force generated by Mg 2 Sn to suppress the formation of passivation films on the anode surface, giving the high thermoelectric performance Mg 2 Sn, which tends to deliquesce in air, a unique application prospect. It elucidates a pathway for utilizing thermoelectric effects to synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance of metal-air batteries.},

The microbubbles are directly generated by electrolysis of the hydrogel, and their displacement is detected using optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam. Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the transfer of the beam's angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations finally provides local values of the medium's shear modulus, which are found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of complex soft materials, opening opportunities in the field of active rheology.},

  abstract     = {Delta-E effect sensors developed for detecting small amplitude and low-frequency magnetic fields have shown potential for miniaturization. However, a comprehensive signal-and-noise analysis of such miniaturized sensors is lacking. Here, we present an in-depth study of the key performance characteristics of sub-millimeter-sized delta-E effect sensors with a double-wing resonator geometry. Several resonance modes are evaluated for their sensitivity, noise, and limit of detection ( LoD ⁠ ) as functions of the excitation voltage amplitude and magnetic bias flux density. We identify and discuss the optimal conditions for sensor operation and compare the performance to that of the reported macroscopic devices. While all investigated resonance modes behave qualitatively similar, quantitative differences in signal and noise lead to an almost sevenfold difference in LoD s. The performance is limited by magnetic noise at large excitation amplitudes and, unlike reported macroscopic delta-E effect sensors, by noise from the excitation signal and charge amplifier at low excitation amplitudes. The best performance is achieved in the third resonance mode excited at 683 kHz with a LoD ≤ 7.4 ± 3 nT / H z between 10 and 1000 Hz and a minimum of 2.8 nT / H z at 195 Hz. This demonstrates an improvement over previously reported values for miniaturized delta-E effect sensors in this frequency range. Moreover, the sensors show a −3 dB bandwidth of ≈440 Hz, which is significantly wider compared to macroscopic delta-E effect sensors. Reducing electronic noise and employing advanced magnetic multilayers can further improve the LoD ⁠ , making these miniaturized sensors promising candidates for compact arrays.},

A crucial aspect of this method is the use of a low fundamental frequency of vibrations, which broadens the possibilities for γ -ray control. The results of numerical simulations are experimentally validated by generating single and double γ -pulses and inducing short-term absorption. For this, a resonant absorber containing 57 Fe nuclei was vibrated with different motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with a fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed technique represents an advancement in the manipulation of γ -rays, and potentially x rays, paving the way for the performance of unique types of γ -ray or x-ray quantum experiments and the development of tools such as adjustable table-top γ -pulse sources or γ -ray or x-ray delays and gates.

Thus, in this work, we investigated the relationship between the absorption of multilayer graphene with different stacking orders from the transition dipole moment (TDM) and joint density of states (JDOS). It is found that the interlayer linkage of different stacking sequences leads to the varied chiral pseudospin doublets, which results in changes in TDM, consequently influencing the absorption spectra in the infrared and visible regions. While the enhanced absorption in the thicker multilayers from the ultraviolet to ionizing radiation region could be attributed to the increasement of JDOS.

Here, we demonstrate an efficient difference-frequency conversion of UV photons, emitted from a trapped Yb + ion, into a visible range.

By utilizing a coplanar electrode piezoelectric mode, pressure applied to one electrode generates a potential difference between the two electrodes. Notably, the piezoelectric performance of the device can be adjusted by modifying its structure. Numerical simulations and experimental results indicate that the piezoelectric performance reaches an optimal value when the distance between the electrodes is equal to one-half of the electrode length. Additionally, we have developed a method to enhance the piezoelectric voltage output capability of the device under low load resistance conditions. Specifically, by introducing charge carriers into the piezoelectric layer from the doped silicon substrate, the device's resistance is reduced due to the Schottky contact.

The enhanced nonreciprocal thermal radiation is attributed to the field enhancement of epsilon-near-zero layer and nonreciprocal guided resonances excited in the WSM film. By studying the magnetic field distribution, the physical mechanism of multi-band nonreciprocal thermal radiation is revealed, which can be verified by the impedance matching theory. Furthermore, the dependence of the structure dimensions and the axial vector b of the Weyl semimetal on the performance of the nonreciprocal radiation is investigated in detail.

The proposed deep learning solution was comprehensively validated through both computer simulations and phantom experiments, demonstrating its strong superiority over the conventional approach for precise and robustness reconstructions of the target BFI anomalies, with much better performance in reducing errors (i.e., the mean absolute error was reduced by 26.1 times) and preserving fine structure (i.e., the structure similarity index measure was increased by 12.8 times). The proper establishment of a deep learning strategy enables future exploration of the microvasculature blood flow mechanism on pathological tissues even from the limited DCT signals.},

  abstract     = {Elastic properties of soft tissues are important indicators for disease progression. Previous studies have utilized mechanical resonance spectroscopy to infer elastic properties of soft tissues by extracting their resonance frequencies. However, the method to accurately obtain the elastic modulus from the resonance frequencies remains inconclusive. In this study, we report a method based on a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) model to determine the Young's modulus of soft tissue samples from the measured resonance spectroscopy. Resonance frequencies of agar tissue phantoms with different elastic properties were obtained, and Young's modulus was calculated using the MDOF-based method. The result was validated by mechanical compression tests and finite element method simulations. The results show that the multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF)-based method is capable of determining Young's modulus of soft tissue samples with various elasticities and dimensions. This study provides an opportunity to accurately assess the elastic properties of small-sized soft tissue samples.},

We fabricated Co/CoO/Co point contact devices and studied their random telegraph signal (RTS) characteristics at various temperatures. In the time domain, the current fluctuates asymmetrically with respect to zero bias, with RTS behavior emerging above a certain voltage threshold. In the frequency domain, the RTS power spectral density exhibits Lorentzian lines. As temperature increases from 50 to 300 K, two RTS behaviors are observed: at ≤100 K, the high current state dominates; at ≥200 K, the low current state prevails, with RTS absent at 150 K. Single exponential fitting shows that RTS state lifetimes decrease with temperature. The charge capture and release model explains the RTS origins and temperature-dependent behavior from an energy band perspective. This study provides insights into charge dynamics, single-electron transport, and the noise mechanisms affecting the reliability of nanoscale devices.},

TFET offers significant potential for applications in future industries, such as low-power sensors and wearable devices, where extreme energy efficiency is critical. Notably, due to the characteristic of the BTBT mechanism, TFET can maintain stable SS performance even at high temperature, enabling low-power operation under such condition. Although numerous theoretical predictions and simulations support this capability, experimental validation has not yet been demonstrated. As electric and autonomous vehicles advance, the demand for automotive semiconductors has increased, highlighting the importance of transistor technology that remains stable at high temperatures and consumes less power. Here, we report high temperature TFETs showing SS < 60 mV/dec through vertical heterojunction of two-dimensional semiconductors. n-TFET and p-TFET were implemented via BP-MoS 2 and WSe 2 -ReS 2 heterojunction, respectively. Both TFETs reached SS min under 50 mV/dec at room temperature and maintained SS 1dec_avg under 60 mV/dec up to 400 K.

  abstract     = {One-dimensional structures such as nanowires (NWs) show great promise in tailoring the rates of hot carrier thermalization in semiconductors with important implications for the design of efficient hot carrier absorbers. However, the fabrication of defect-free crystal structures and control of their intrinsic electronic properties can be challenging, raising concerns about the role of competing radiative and non-radiative recombination mechanisms that govern hot carrier effects. Here, we elucidate the impact of crystal purity and altered electronic properties on the hot carrier properties by comparing two classes of III–V semiconductor NW arrays with similar bandgap energies and geometries, yet different crystal quality: one composed of GaAsSb NWs, which host antisite point defects but are free of planar stacking defects, and the other InGaAs NWs with a very high density of stacking defects. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrates distinct hot carrier effects in both NW arrays; however, the InGaAs NWs exhibit stronger hot carrier effects, as evidenced by increased carrier temperature under identical photo-absorptivity. This difference arises from higher rates of Auger recombination in the InGaAs NWs due to their increased n -type conductivity, as confirmed by excitation power-dependent measurements. Our findings suggest that while enhancing material properties is crucial for improving the performance of hot carrier absorbers, optimizing conditions to increase the rates of Auger recombination will further boost the efficiency of these devices.},

  abstract     = {Zero-dimensional/one-dimensional (0D/1D) heterojunctions have excellent potential in the field of optoelectronic devices due to the synergy effect of different dimensions. Most reported 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors only focus on optimizing the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers at the interface. However, the carriers within the quantum dots (QDs) cannot be transferred to the electrodes, resulting in recombination of photogenerated carriers separated at the interface. Therefore, the response speed of most 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors is still limited to the order of seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). In our work, we demonstrate a nanosecond (ns) scale ZnO/CuO heterojunction photodetector with efficient photoelectric conversion by engineering the type-II 0D/1D heterojunction interface. Herein, the surface defect states of ZnO QDs are deliberately introduced as “electrons storage pool” to suppress carrier recombination and further promote separation, which has been confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As a result, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance with ultrafast response speed of 20 ns, responsivity of 213 A/W, and detectivity of 2.95 × 10 11 Jones, respectively. This defect related interface engineering provides a feasible strategy for the development of high-performance 0D/1D heterojunction photodetectors.},

For LIM circuits, the complementary structure is desirable for low-power consumption. To date, there have been rare reports on the n-channel organic thin-film transistor nonvolatile memories (OTFT-NVMs), which is indispensable for building the complementary LIM circuits. In this Letter, we demonstrate a route to achieve the low-voltage operatable n-channel OTFT-NVMs, by blade-coating an ultrathin tetratetracontane buffer layer on the oxygen plasma treated ferroelectric terpolymer insulator with a low coercive field. The n-channel OTFT-NVMs exhibit good performances, with a high electron mobility over 0.1 cm 2 /V s, highly reliable endurance over 1000 cycles, and highly stable retention over 10 000 s. The mechanism for improving device performances is discussed. Moreover, the mechanism and the route for improving performances are also suitable for p-channel OTFT-NVMs. Furthermore, the LIM architecture-based complementary organic inverters are constructed by integrating the n-channel and p-channel OTFT-NVMs, which can well perform logic and memory operations at the low voltage of 10 V.

  abstract     = {Improving the energy storage density of dielectric capacitors, which are widely used in power electronic devices, is a continuous challenge. In this work, a site-selection multi-element co-doping strategy was used by doping Pr atoms at the A-site and then doping Mn atoms at the B-site in bismuth-based layered perovskite-like structure prototype ferroelectrics Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 due to its large polarization and high Curie temperature. On the one hand, the substitution of Bi 3+ with Pr 3+ at the A-site introduces significant cation disorder, which disrupts the long-range ferroelectric order, consequently leading to a reduction in remnant polarization. On the other hand, the substitution of Ti 4+ by Mn 4+ at the B-site results in delayed polarization saturation due to the different electronic configurations between d 3 Mn 4+ and d 0 Ti 4+ . In addition, the leakage current of the thin film exhibits a continuous decrease with doping concentration, which can be attributed to microstructural modifications including reduced grain size and the formation of amorphous regions, consequently leading to an enhanced breakdown field. Finally, a recoverable energy storage density of 42.1 J cm −3 and an efficiency of 69.9% were obtained for the BPT film, and a recoverable energy storage density of 81.8 J cm −3 and an efficiency of 73% were achieved in the BPTM film. The enhanced energy storage density can be attributed to the synergistic effect of co-doping of A- and B-sites on polarization and breakdown. Besides, the doped films have excellent frequency, temperature, and cycling stability. This work provides a guide to substantially enhance dielectric energy storage by a site-selection multi-element co-doping strategy.},

In this study, we investigate the electrical depoling behavior of [001]-oriented rhombohedral Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -PbTiO 3 (PMN-PT) single crystals poled using direct current poling (DCP) and alternating current poling (ACP). We reveal that the ACP sample exhibits a lower reverse coercive field than the DCP specimen. We compare the effects of bipolar and unipolar electric fields applied in the reverse poling direction, analyzing the changes in permittivity and piezoelectric resonance. Piezoresponse force microscopy is employed to characterize domain configurations in poled and electrically depoled samples. Our findings suggest that property degradation may arise from the nucleation and growth of domains oriented opposite to the initial arrangement.},

  abstract     = {Flexible magnetoelectric composite devices have exceptional features and potential in peculiar scenes. However, maintaining the magnetoelectric response under extreme bending conditions remains a challenge. Polyvinylidene fluoride-based polymers, possessing favorable piezoelectric properties and high flexibility, provide a viable solution for magnetoelectric composites. This work constructed multiferroic core-shell nanoparticle-embedded flexible membranes and achieved a retainable high magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient in the curved composite materials. A maximum ME coefficient of 74 mV cm −1 Oe −1 was obtained, far higher than the 0–3 ME nanocomposites reported thus far. The ME coefficient can be maintained above 40 mV cm −1 Oe −1 when the bending angle is less than 90° and expresses high sensitivity within the H dc range of 100–2400 Oe. Based on crystal structure analysis and phase-field simulation, the synergy magnetoelectric effects accounting for the multiferroic core-shell nanoparticles, copolymer matrix, and magnetic cores contribute to the promoted ME coefficient in the flexible composites. This work provides a feasible pathway for next-generation flexible devices in the wearable and portable fields.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer vast potential for designing ferroelectrics with desired properties through simple layer stacking. Here, based on first principles, we demonstrate that the vdW layered crystals RuX 2 (X = Cl, Br, and I) are a class of 2D multiferroic sliding ferroelectrics. The stacking of two magnetic RuX 2 monolayers with the same orientation breaks the spatial inversion symmetry, resulting in a stable vertical polarization. In addition, the direction of polarization can be reversed through slight interlayer sliding, in which it only needs to overcome the small energy barrier of 7.16 meV. Among these layered crystals, the bilayer RuI 2 not only possesses a remarkable sliding ferroelectricity of 0.49 pC/m but also exhibits stable long-range magnetic order due to its large magnetic anisotropy energy. When the RuI 2 stack is increased to trilayers, the polarization significantly increases to 1.03 pC/m, which is much larger than that of its bilayer structure. Furthermore, the application of compressive strain results in a substantial increase in vertical polarization. This work provides an efficient method for designing 2D multiferroic sliding ferroelectric materials by stack engineering.},

However, no superconducting diodes reported in the literature have a forward current carrying capacity exceeding 1 A, and hence are not suitable for use in superconducting power applications. Here, we present a high- T c superconducting diode that leverages permanent magnets to induce an asymmetry in the critical current of a superconducting coated conductor upon current reversal. The magnets are arranged to replicate the self-field of the conductor at I c ⁠ , causing constructive or destructive interference with the transport current's self-field depending on the current direction. This interference generates asymmetric internal magnetic field distributions, leading to the directional suppression of the critical current density and a diode effect. We demonstrate Δ I c values > 150 A and a half-wave transformer rectifier using a single high- T c flux diode submerged in liquid nitrogen, which rectifies 30 A into a 220 μ H superconducting magnet.},

  abstract     = {Spin transport across an interface in energy-efficient spintronic devices, especially for spin–orbit torque applications, has sparked interest in the spintronics community. Here, we employ a rare-earth metal spacer Dy to modify the interface of a Py-based heterostructure, with the aim of modulating the spin dynamics of the system and thereby controlling the spin–orbit torques. As the thickness of Dy increases, it is found that the saturation magnetization of Py/Dy decreases and eventually reaches a plateau, suggesting the induced magnetic moment of Dy that aligns opposite to the Fe and Ni moments. Such a self-assembled antiferromagnetic interface can be destroyed by the insertion of a Cu layer between Py and Dy. Utilizing this interface effect, an additional spin dissipation is observed by enhancement of spin dynamic damping, which has achieved a high spin mixing conductance at the interface of Py/Dy according to spin pumping theory. Utilizing the Py/Dy interface, an unconventional in-plane field-like torque spin–orbit torque (SOT) in a Py/Dy/Pt structure is achieved, while the field-like SOT efficiency experiences a notable enhancement in the Py/Dy/Pt system. By optimizing the interface between the Dy layer and Pt, it is possible to further enhance the performance and efficiency of the devices, thereby promoting the development of spintronic devices. This discovery has significant implications for the future design of low-power spintronic devices.},

Upon increasing pressure, MnF 2 undergoes sequential phase transitions from the rutile structure to the SrI 2 -type structure and further to the α-PbCl 2 -type structure. Under high pressure, all three structures of MnF 2 exhibit stable altermagnetism, with the maximum spin splitting of 307.5 meV at 3 GPa for the rutile structure, 133.6 meV at 12 GPa for the SrI 2 -type structure, and 58.4 meV at 20 GPa for the α-PbCl 2 -type structure.

  abstract     = {High-performance artificial synaptic devices that emulate the functions of biological synapses are crucial for advancing energy-efficient brain-inspired computing systems. Current studies predominantly focus on memristive devices, which achieve synaptic functions through nonvolatile electric current-assisted carrier modulation. However, these methods often suffer from excessive energy consumption. Here, a type of low-energy-consumption artificial synapse based on strain-mediated electric-field control of magnetic skyrmion's radius is demonstrated, where the energy consumption is 10 fJ per state and the non-volatility is achieved by local ferroelectric domain switching under bipolar electric fields. The proposed skyrmion-based synaptic device can replicate essential synaptic behaviors, including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and spiking-time-dependent plasticity, aligning it closely with the biological synaptic system. The synaptic weight change and non-linearity of the artificial synapse are emulated by modulating the magnetic skyrmion's radius through precisely engineering the applied electric-field pulses. Simulation using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database reveals that the pattern recognition rate decreases exponentially with increasing LTP/LTD non-linearity, quantifying the effect of the LTP/LTD non-linearity on the pattern recognition rate. This work underscores the potential of strain-mediated electric-field control of single skyrmion's radius as a groundbreaking approach for developing high density and low-energy consumption artificial synaptic devices.},

The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching.

  abstract     = {Unconventional computing schemes inspired by biological neural networks are being explored with ever growing interest to eventually replace traditional von Neumann architecture-based computation. Realization of such schemes necessitates the development of device analogs to biological neurons and synapses. Particularly, in spin-based artificial synapses, the spin–orbit torque (SOT) can be utilized for changing between multiple resistance states of the synapse. In this work, we demonstrate synaptic behavior, namely long-term potentiation and long-term depression in a ferrimagnet (GdFe) via SOT generated using a heavy metal (Pt). The dependence of the synapse-like output on the input parameters is extensively investigated. Synaptic arrays based on experimental results are simulated and used to perform the classification of a handwritten digit dataset. Correlating the classification accuracy with the experimentally observed synaptic behavior, the performance of the synapse is found to depend on the critical switching currents.

  abstract     = {Rapidly developing fifth-generation (5G) communications urgently require a ferrite material with high permeability and low magnetic loss in frequency bands up to 6 GHz. However, none of the present magnetic materials are capable of meeting the requirements of 5G communications because their magnetic properties deteriorate drastically when approaching GHz frequencies. Herein, we report the high-frequency magnetic properties of the modified Ba 5 Cu 2- x Ni x Ti 3 Fe 12 O 31 (Cu–Ni 18H) ferrites, achieving a relatively high permeability of 1.6 and a low magnetic loss of 0.05 at 6 GHz, which is much better than previous reports. Such excellent performance is attributed to the expanded mono-domain critical size and reduced damping of magnetic moment precession. Moreover, deploying Cu–Ni 18H ferrites as a substrate on a patch antenna working at 6 GHz can reduce the antenna dimensions to 35% of traditional commercial materials. The present work provides a proven and promising candidate material for 5G communications and expands the research landscape for the high-frequency magnetic properties of microwave ferrites.},

This work theoretically investigates effects of nitrogen and fluoride anions (N-anion and F-anion) substitution on the MgO barrier interface of Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ for iPMA and α using first-principles calculations. We find that the N-anion substitution significantly enhances iPMA by four times and reduces α by 65% compared to the pristine Fe/MgO/Fe, indicating a guideline toward an MTJ with large iPMA and low α simultaneously. The mechanism is explained by a band realignment at the Fermi level ( E F ) where Fe d ±1 ( d xz ,d yz ) orbitals at the interface are pushed above and below E F but Fe d ±2 ( d xy , d x 2 −y 2 ) orbitals remain at E F by the N-anion substitution.},

Spin-torque oscillators have been experimentally and theoretically applied to neuromorphic computing, but their physical parameters are usually optimized via grid search procedures. In this paper, we propose a scheme to optimize the dynamics parameters of macrospin-type spin-torque oscillators using the gradient descent method with automatic differentiation. First, we numerically create dynamic data for teaching and tune the parameters to reproduce the dynamics. This approach can be applied to determine the correspondence between spin-torque oscillator simulations and experiments. Next, we solve an image recognition task with high accuracy by connecting a coupled system of spin-torque oscillators to the input and output layers and training all of them through gradient descent. Combining this approach with experimentation makes it possible to design an experimental setup and physical system to solve a task with high precision using a spin-torque oscillator.},

  abstract     = {This study systematically investigates the optimization mechanism of NaClO solution treatment on Mo substrates for enhancing the optoelectronic performance of CZTSSe thin film solar cells. Experimental results demonstrate that a 10 s NaClO soaking forms a “spike-like” texture on the Mo surface, increasing the average surface roughness difference from 34.52 to 77.75 nm. This significantly enhances light scattering, particularly for photons reaching the back Mo electrode, thereby extending the optical path and promoting photon reabsorption. Additionally, the roughened Mo surface improves the wettability of the precursor solution (contact angle decreases from 19.3° to 12.7°), facilitating the formation of larger CZTSSe grains. Electrical characterization reveals that the NaClO-treated Mo substrate significantly reduces the density of negative charge traps at CZTSSe grain boundaries (contact potential difference increases from −1.1 V to −263 mV), suppressing hole recombination and optimizing carrier collection efficiency. The spike-like structure of the Mo surface also shortens the transport path of hole carriers generated by short-wavelength light, further enhancing collection efficiency. Ultimately, the PCE of CZTSSe devices based on the Mo-10 substrate increases from 9.34% to 11.07%, attributed to the reduction in R s and J 0 . This study highlights the critical role of a back electrode interface microstructure design in synergistically optimizing light absorption and carrier transport.},

However, challenges remain in synthesizing high-quality crystals with low defect concentrations, high homogeneous thermal conductivity, and high yields using the conventional chemical vapor transport method. In this study, we report the synthesis of high-yield c -BAs single crystals using the Bridgman method. The crystals exhibit high uniformity, reduced defect densities, and lower carrier concentrations as confirmed through x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, and electrical transport measurements.

A nitrogen doping range of 1.3 × 10 18 to 4.5 × 10 19 cm −3 was achieved. The nitrogen doping profiles have top-hat shapes with sharp turn-on and turn-off. Nitrogen doping was found to have a negligible impact on surface morphology. Nitrogen incorporation was unaffected by gallium flux and growth temperatures over a large growth window. An incorporation dependence on plasma power and total gas flow rate was observed. This was attributed to the N 2 triple bond strength compared to the O 2 double bond strength, which makes N 2 harder to crack in the plasma source. Increasing the plasma power from 140 to 230 W increased nitrogen incorporation by 1.6×, while increasing the total gas flow rate from 0.8 to 2.0 sccm decreased incorporation by 3.2×. The compensation effect of nitrogen was verified by characterizing effective carrier concentration in conducting tin and nitrogen co-doped films. A 2.1 V built-in voltage was extracted from a nitrogen-doped, n − junction device using CV measurements. The device was found to exhibit rectifying behavior with a 100 A/cm 2 current density at 2.9 V. The junction demonstrated here can play a key role in field management and electrostatic engineering for β -Ga 2 O 3 -based power devices. Overall, the controllability of PAMBE nitrogen doping and the properties of nitrogen-doped films suggest PAMBE-grown, nitrogen-doped layers have promising power device applications.},

We employed a single-crystal chromium-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 sample, grown by the Czochralski method, and performed ellipsometry measurements at magnetic field strengths ranging from 2 to 8 T, at frequencies from 82 to 125 and 190 to 230 GHz, and at a temperature of 15 K. Analysis of the frequency-field diagrams derived from all Mueller matrix elements allowed us to differentiate between the effects of electron spin Zeeman splitting and zero-field splitting and to accurately determine the anisotropic Zeeman splitting g -tensor and the zero-field splitting parameters. Our results confirm that Cr 3+ ions predominantly substitute into octahedral gallium sites. Line shape analysis of Mueller matrix element spectra using the Bloch–Brillouin model provides the spin volume concentration of Cr 3+ sites, showing very good agreement with results from chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and suggesting minimal occupation of sites with inactive electron paramagnetic resonance. This study enhances our understanding of the magnetic and electronic properties of chromium-doped β -Ga 2 O 3 and demonstrates the effectiveness of high-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry for characterizing defects in ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors.},

Typically, time constants are measured by expensive, ultra-fast instruments with high temporal resolution. Instead, here, we demonstrate an alternate, inexpensive, cyclostationary measurement technique to characterize self-heating (and cooling) with sub-microsecond resolution. The results are independently confirmed by direct imaging of the transient heating/cooling of the channel temperature by the thermoreflectance method.

The results revealed that lowering the growth temperature significantly reduced the thickness of the “unintended compositionally graded layer” a diffusion layer formed at the interface through solid-phase diffusion. However, a bottleneck also existed in LDs with extremely steep interfaces, where the diode characteristics could not be obtained due to the device's high resistance. This study highlights the trade-off between the steepness of the interfaces in the AlGaN heterostructure and diode performance, indicating the need for further optimization to achieve high-performance UV-B LDs. Specifically, future efforts should focus on refining growth conditions to reduce impurity concentrations resulting from low-temperature growth and controlling the thickness of individual layers, such as the EBL, to address high resistance and achieve high-performance UV-B LDs.},

This work studied the internal stress distribution and dislocation configuration around an inclusion of ∼300 μ m in GaN substrates grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy, by means of combined Raman spectroscopy, x-ray topography, and two-photon excitation photoluminescence. The inclusion-induced internal stress decreased exponentially along the radial direction. However, the internal stress, though reduced to a small magnitude, was unexpectedly maintained and propagated over long distances. A stress localization phenomenon, which was out of the prediction of classic elasticity theory, was also observed. The inclination of threading dislocations was found to be substantially influenced by the unreported distribution of internal stress. Four characteristic dislocation inclination patterns were identified: the two-short-tooth pattern, two-long-tooth pattern, gear pattern, and sun-like pattern. The dependence of internal stress on the dislocation inclination pattern was revealed. Based on this dependence, a method to predict the stress field in crystal based on dislocation pattern without corrosion was proposed.},

  abstract     = {Micro-nanocavity graphene/paraffin nanocomposites (MNGPNs) are emerging as promising phase change materials for passive thermal management in electronics, utilizing the superior thermal conductivity of graphene in conjunction with the excellent heat storage capacity of paraffin. However, current assessments of MNGPNs thermal management performance are primarily conducted under laboratory static conditions, which do not fully represent the complex overload environments encountered in practical applications. In this study, we conducted strain freezing experiments using a split Hopkinson pressure bar and performed recovery analysis to investigate the influence of dynamic loading on thermal behavior through postmortem microstructural characterizations. Our findings reveal significant thermodynamic coupling effects in the in-plane direction, while coupling effects in the out-of-plane direction were less apparent. Specifically, the increase in internal thermal resistance under impact loading, due to the cracking, shedding, and directional changes in the graphene structure, diminishes the heat transfer capacity of MNGPNs in the in-plane direction. Alternations in interfacial thermal resistance caused by the layer compression and shedding affect the out-of-plane heat transfer capacity. Furthermore, the thermal behavior of MNGPNs was validated through heat dissipation experiments. This work provides valuable insights for the practical thermal management applications of MNGPNs, highlighting their performance from a dynamic perspective.},

  abstract     = {Plastic crystals have large entropy change during first-order phase transitions due to strong molecular orientation disorder and volume changes. This feature has revived interest in plastic crystals, as they have great potential in solid-state refrigeration applications induced by external pressure. However, the reversible barocaloric effect in most plastic crystals does not compare favorably with their isothermal entropy change. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the particle size of the plastic crystal KPF 6 can help achieve a compromise between the phase transition resistance at grain boundaries and the phase transition correlation within grains and induce a giant reversible barocaloric effect at low pressure. In particular, the 75–150 μ m plastic crystal KPF 6 displays the lowest thermal hysteresis, with a giant reversible barocaloric entropy change of 50.0 J · kg −1 · K −1 under a pressure change of 40 MPa. The reversible barocaloric effect can be more than doubled by simply optimizing the microstructures of the plastic crystal KPF 6 . Our work provides an effective way to enhance the reversible barocaloric effect in plastic crystal materials. We also give insight into the physical mechanism that enhances the reversible barocaloric effect through transmission electron microscopy analysis.},

Researchers have explored BaZr 1- x Ti x S 3 and BaZrS 3- x Se x alloys to reduce their band gaps, allowing them to absorb lower-energy photons. However, the hexagonal structures of BaTiS 3 and BaZrSe 3 , along with the incompatibility of Ti or Se atoms in BaZrS 3 , lead to phase separation in these alloys. In this work, using EuZrS 3 and Sr 0.7 Eu 0.3 ZrS 3 alloys as examples, we demonstrate that the band structure of chalcogenide perovskites can be tuned by using Eu as the A-site cation. In EuZrS 3 , the Eu 4f orbitals contribute to the valence band maximum, thereby raising the valence band and resulting in a narrow bandgap of 0.54 eV. Furthermore, due to the structural and atomic compatibility of Eu with SrZrS 3 , the Sr 1- x Eu x ZrS 3 alloy is designed to fine-tune the band structures of both SrZrS 3 and EuZrS 3 . EuZrS 3 also exhibits typical semiconducting characteristics, making it promising for potential optoelectronic devices.},

The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ( ⁠ f 0 ⁠ ) of 900 Hz ≤ f 0 ≤ 1500 Hz with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ( ⁠ f s ⁠ ) of f s = 0.1 f 0 in CaCl 2 /H 2 O/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer and atom probe tomography showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.},

However, the strong coupling of BICs with quantum emitters in single-particle systems has not been reported. In this paper, we propose a dielectric nanodisk integrated with a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides. A supercavity mode known as Friedrich–Wintgen BIC is launched in the nanodisk to enable strong coupling of BIC with WS 2 excitons. We demonstrate that the reduction in coupling strength as the quasi-BIC quality factor increases is due to a decrease in the number of excitons participating in the coupling. Additionally, the coupling strength can be manipulated by adjusting the shape and aspect ratio of the nanoresonators, enabling a transition from strong to weak coupling regimes. Near-field analysis shows that the manipulation of the BIC–exciton interaction arises from the overlap of the BIC mode's near-field with the excitons. Our findings offer a promising strategy for manipulating light–matter interactions and enhance the potential applications of BIC resonances in photonics.},

Changing the width of silicon nanowires entails a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of 2.2%–3.8%. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode.

Solutions are thus not necessarily bound to wave functions physically realizable by the optical system. A method is presented to characterize reconstructed probes by conventional lens aberrations. The fitted aberrations are then used to investigate the quality of the retrieved probes, and their consistency is examined in a systematic study using a 4D-STEM focal series recorded for a thin SnS 2 2D flake. Additionally, the influences of partial coherence and limited electron dose on the retrieved probes are analyzed, and the usefulness of the retrieved probes for different ptychographic methods, such as single sideband, Wigner distribution deconvolution ptychography, and gradient descent-based schemes, is elucidated.

Conventional methods for achieving this property often rely on additional organic coatings to lower the surface energy; however, they are very prone to chemical decomposition and even flaking during practical usages. Here, we demonstrated that the laser-induced phase transition in hierarchical structures of metal surface can act as an effective approach to directly produce the superhydrophobic effect without any organic decorations. Through gradual increasing numbers of the femtosecond laser processing, we transfer the surface structures from the initial polycrystalline material into the super-nanometer-sized dual-phase and three-phase material that consists of nano and para-crystallinity embedded in amorphous substance, both of which contribute to lowering the surface energy. Meanwhile, the geometrical profiles of the surface structures become richer and more complicated for improving the stability of air pockets. Remarkably, it is found that both the mechanical and chemical durability of such superhydrophobic surfaces are enhanced significantly for the three-phase based material. This study describes the great value of the metal phase transition in achieving the inherent superhydrophobic properties, which provides a different route to develop high-performance coating-free superhydrophobic surfaces.},

Within this bandgap, where the QDs preferably emitted right-handed circularly polarized light, we observed a distinct cavity mode peak characterized by left-handed circular polarization (CP). This observation indicates that the chiral PhC modifies the optical density of states for left-handed circular polarization to be suppressed in the polarization bandgap and be largely enhanced at the cavity mode. The results obtained may not only provide photonic devices such as compact circularly polarized light sources but also promote strong coupling between circularly polarized photons and excitons in solid states or molecules, paving the way for advancements in polaritonics, spintronics, and quantum information technology.},

  abstract     = {We engineer the loss function by removing the conventional physics-based energy constraint during the training of broadband diffractive neural networks (DNNs) to enhance their spectral filtering capabilities of supercontinuum light. Simulations show that compared to DNNs trained with conventional loss function, the suppression of out-of-band spectral intensities can be improved by three orders of magnitude, resulting in an extinction coefficient of 10 −6 . Additionally, the spectral resolution can be enhanced by over 50% with a 6.6% improvement of energy efficiency. These findings are corroborated by experiments conducted with a two-layer DNN. The proposed method holds promise for enhancing the performance of broadband DNNs across various applications, including spectral reconstruction, spectrum classification, and color image processing, among others.},

Here, a visible-blind bipolar response photodetector based on GaN/ZnO:Ga/GaAs double heterojunctions is proposed. Under self-powered conditions, the designed photodetector only shows dual-band photoresponse in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectrum. Specifically, originating from the absorption characteristics and suitable energy band of multilayered structures, it exhibits positive (negative) photocurrents under UV (IR) illumination. The maximum responsivity of 4.7 mA/W (−1.8 mA/W) under the UV (IR) illumination and fast response time (19.6/36.8 μ s) are achieved. Dual-band optoelectronic logic operations, including OR, AND, NOR, NOT, and NAND, are realized with a single photodetector by precisely regulating the UV and IR illumination. This work paves an approach for the development of visible-blind bipolar photodetection and all-in-one optoelectronic logic gates.},

Herein, we present a normally-off, visible-blind ultraviolet (UV) AlGaN/GaN phototransistor featuring a fluorine-ion-implanted trench gate structure. This design effectively disrupts the conductive channel of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, drastically reducing the dark current to the magnitude of 0.1 pA. The trench structure enhances the localized electric field in the confined gate region, significantly improving UV detection sensitivity. Additionally, the finite electric field enhancement induced from fluorine ions (F − ions) accelerates the establishment of photogenerated electron channels. Consequently, the phototransistor exhibits ultrafast response speed, with rise and decay times of 1.5 and 6.7 μ s, respectively, along with an exceptional specific detectivity of 3.45 × 10 16 cm·Hz 1/2 W −1 . The detection of weak UV light reaches as low as 76.0 nW/cm 2 . This remarkable detection capability allows the device to perform high-fidelity single-pixel imaging and facilitates real-time UV communication.

In addition, light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) allow studies of light–matter interactions mediated by OAM couplings. In this work, we present an alternative approach to generating high-order harmonic vortices using elegant Laguerre–Gaussian (eLG) beams. We examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of these harmonic vortices in the far-field regime and demonstrate how the low divergence of eLG beams makes them suitable for producing extreme ultraviolet (XUV) twisted attosecond pulses. Additionally, by solving the far-field Fraunhofer integral, we analyze the influence of azimuthal and radial indices on the spatial profile of vortex beams, thereby exploring the impact of larger topological charges. This study extends the concept of harmonic vortices generated by Laguerre–Gaussian beams to applications beyond the paraxial approximation.},

The array is grown in the pores of an anodic aluminum oxide membrane by the solid-state dewetting process. Control over the nanoparticle size and spacing between particles was achieved by sequential metal deposition and annealing processes, yielding nanoparticles with diameters ( D ) ranging from 50 to 70 nm and corresponding interparticle distances ranging from 12 to 30 nm. The advantage of this technique is that the nanoparticle size, spherical shape, and hexagonal close-packed ordering of the array can be precisely controlled, allowing for fine tuning of the plasmonic absorption properties. The important parameters that determine the size, shape, and distribution of nanoparticles in the array are the template morphology (dimple geometry) and the thickness of the evaporated metal layer. Above a certain critical film thickness, the nanoparticles coalesce to form nano-islands. The significance of this work is that it provides a reliable technique to assemble metal nanoparticles into high density arrays, with good control over particle shape and distribution. Such arrays can be used to generate highly concentrated electromagnetic fields for plasmonic sensor applications.},

This work aims to investigate the effect of substituting Fe on the thermoelectric properties of the CTS system. It is found that the electrical conductivity enhanced after Fe substitution due to the simultaneous enhancement of carrier concentration, as well as a reduced bandgap from 0.88 to 0.5 eV. The high power factor of ∼514 μ W/mK 2 was obtained for the Cu 2 Sn 0.7 Fe 0.3 S 3 sample. The Fe substitution generated different types of phonon scatterings, such as mass fluctuation scattering arising from the difference in atomic mass of Sn and Fe and strain field scattering as a result of size and interatomic coupling force difference between Sn and Fe. Accordingly, the Fe-substituted CTS samples obtained the thermal conductivity of 0.45 W/mK at 753 K. In addition, the density functional theory calculations reveal that the substitution of Fe in Cu 2 SnS 3 significantly alters the electronic structure and reduces the bandgap, resulting in enhanced electrical conductivity and power factor, thereby a high zT of ∼0.5 is obtained in Cu 2 Sn 0.7 Fe 0.3 S 3 .},

The scaling of the Mach number with the ratio of electron temperature to ion temperature is examined, which reveals a non-monotonic relationship that can be approximately described by the assumption of marginally stable wave growth.

  abstract     = {Effective manipulation of magnetic beads (MBs) with dimensions similar to single cells is crucial for advancing clinical and diagnostic technologies. Traditional methods like optical tweezers and dielectrophoresis often require complex setups, making them less suitable for scalable laboratory-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. While strain-mediated magnetoelectric (ME) micro-motors offer a promising alternative, they are limited by a 45° rotation when using planar electrode systems, the complexity of multi-electrode systems for rotations beyond 45°, and the lower thermal stability of symmetrical ferromagnetic (FM) rings or disks. This work introduces a ME-based LOC device that incorporates strain-mediated micro-magnetic motors, utilizing shape-anisotropic FM elliptical rings on a ferroelectric substrate to achieve MB rotations up to 90° experimentally with a simple planar electrode system. The inherent high thermal stability of elliptical FM rings enables this rotation without the need for multi-electrode designs. Micromagnetic simulations are employed to identify the optimal elliptical ring structures that generate the localized stray magnetic fields necessary for trapping and rotating MBs. Effective single MB trapping with optimized MB concentrations and flow rates is demonstrated with 40 % capture probability. Under an applied electric field of 0.8 MV/m, a 90 o rotation is achieved for a 1.5 μ m wide elliptical ring, closely aligning with micromagnetic modeling results. The ability to achieve 90° MB rotation without complicated experimental setup opens possibilities for critical biotechnology applications, such as photothermal and hyperthermia therapy, where the thermally stable, highly shape-anisotropic FMs in ME-based LOC devices could be transformative.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in phosphorus-doped diamond have potential applications in quantum technologies because their electron spin has the longest spin coherence time among those in solid systems at room temperature (RT) and because their negative charge state is more stable than that in undoped diamond. However, the conventional phosphorus source, phosphine, is toxic and explosive; a safer precursor is therefore preferred. We consequently attempted to synthesize phosphorus-doped diamonds using tert -butylphosphine (TBP), which has lower toxicity and explosivity than phosphine. However, controlling phosphorus incorporation during doping with TBP is difficult because it condenses easily and remains in the synthesis reactor due to its low boiling point. Here, we report controlling the incorporation of impurities by optimizing the synthesis conditions, such as the synthesis pressure. Comparing diamonds synthesized at 15 and 50 kPa reveals that the phosphorus concentration was reduced by 93% and the nitrogen concentration by 72% in the diamond synthesized at 50 kPa. For diamonds prepared under optimized conditions in our synthesis reactor, a long spin coherence time ( T 2 = 2.23 ms) for NV centers with almost perfect selective alignment of the NV axes was achieved. The T 2 was comparable to the longest reported length for NV centers in a sample synthesized with phosphine, indicating that TBP is a promising phosphorus source for obtaining NV centers with excellent properties. We also achieved high electron mobility [580 cm 2 /(V s) at RT] in diamonds synthesized with TBP; this value is comparable to that for diamonds synthesized with phosphine.},

However, practical applications of AMF in electrochemistry are always impeded by the inherent characteristics of the catalyst (i.e., non-magnetic nature and oxidizable feature). Here, a self-heating working electrode substrate of C/Fe 3 O 4 /C is proposed to be fabricated, on which non-magnetic Ru nanoparticles confined within the amorphous carbon matrix are deposited as the catalytic layer. Under AMF, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 particle can be stimulated and generate the magnetic heating associated with Néel relaxation, which improves the OER efficiency of Ru nanoparticles with the overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 reduced by 72 mV. Together with the high stability rendered by confined structure, the exploitation of AMF on non-magnetic catalyst is confirmed, and the developed strategy offers a general pathway to advance OER catalyst performance in the future.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting wideband and random vibration energy in the vehicle environment is a promising route to power mobile electronic devices. Conventional energy harvesters cannot realize steady-state output, making the energy management circuit design difficult. This work presents an electromagnetic harvester with a counterweight unit, a gearbox, and a generator, which can be adapted to wideband automatic energy storage and quantized output release. The counterweight unit with the low-frequency response can effectively sense the weak vibration. The coil spring in the energy storage gear train is in particular used to store low-frequency random vibration energy in the environment and release the energy stored by the coil spring by switching the gear train. Finally, the coil spring drives the generating gear train to realize the steady-state output of mechanical energy to electrical energy. At a frequency of 2.5 Hz and an acceleration of 0.4 g, the average output power of the automatic energy storage and steady-state output release energy harvester (ASSR) by using a coil spring to first store energy and then quantize the output is 114.5 times higher than that of the method of continuous generating without using a coil spring. The ASSR's energy output can charge the lithium battery (3.7 V, 40 mAh) from 2.6 to 3.716 V during a 60 km ride at an average speed of 12.7 km/h while powering the mobile phones and Bluetooth devices continuously through the energy management circuit.

Also, the power generation characteristics were readily adjusted by the flow channel forming the Venturi effect without modifying the PWVEH structure. So, the VE-PWVEH could possess both great power-generating capability at low wind speed and strong robustness at high wind speed. The results demonstrated that both the output voltage and cut-in wind speed were affected by the attack angle of two rectangular plates used for stimulating the constricted channel. There was an optimal attack angle of 60° where a maximum peak voltage of the VE-PWVEH was increased by 621% and the cut-in wind speed was reduced by 171% compared with the harvester without the Venturi effect. Besides, it demonstrated the VE-PWVEH could achieve an output power of 0.863 mW and illuminate about 120 blue LEDs in series. The introduction of the Venturi effect provides a simple and viable method of flow field disturbance to tune the performance of PWVEHs.},

However, the output voltage of the present TMDC-based WTEGs remains at a relatively low level. In this study, we precisely modulate the electronic structure of titanium disulfide (TiS 2 ) nanosheets in a restacked film by surface modification, leading to the decoupling phenomenon of a simultaneous rise in the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. This method enhances the thermoelectric power factor by approximately 14 times compared to pre-modified samples. We fabricated a flexible self-reassembly WTEG using 1T-phase molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets as p -type material and modified TiS 2 nanosheets as an n -type material.

To understand the process of flagellar bundling, especially propulsion force generation, we develop a multi-functional macroscopic experimental system and employ advanced numerical simulations for verification. Flagellar arrangements and phase differences between helices are investigated, revealing the variation in propulsion contributions from individual helices. Numerically, we build a time-dependent model to match the bundling process and study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions. Surprisingly, it is found that the total propulsion generated by a bundle of two filaments is constant at various phase differences between the helices. However, the difference between the propulsion from each helix is significantly affected by a phase difference, and only one of the helices is responsible for the total propulsion when the phase difference is equal to π ⁠ . Building on our experimental and computational results, we develop a theoretical model considering the propulsion contribution of each filament to better understand microbial locomotion mechanisms, especially the wobbling behavior of the cell.

In the traditional dual-channel SPR sensor structure, it is necessary to coat different metal films on two channels to obtain two independent SPR signals in one probe. In this work, the dopamine hydrochloride was used to separate two resonance peaks. Sensing channel 1 is used as an immunosensing road by using the LSPR effect, coating its surface with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/IRMOF-3/thiomalic acid and adsorbing rabies virus antigens to enhance the loading of biomolecules on the surface of the sensor and the immune response. The sensing channel 2 adopts a silver film to excite the SPR effect, then the position of the SPR resonance peak is shifted back by dopamine hydrochloride, and, finally, a layer of polydimethylsiloxane is coated as a temperature sensing channel. The results show that the sensitivity of the sensor is 0.504 nm/°C in the temperature range of 30–35 °C, and it has good temperature stability. The high sensitivity detection of rabies virus was achieved in the range of 0.1–10 3 pg/ml. The sensitivity and detection limit are 3.065 nm/(log(pg/ml)) and 0.234 pg/ml, respectively.

  abstract     = {Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit a unique competition between long-range and short-range interactions that can be tuned electrically, which prioritizes these materials in a broad range of electro-mechanical energy-conversion technologies, including biomedical imaging and electric-charge generators. Here, we demonstrate differential negative piezoresponse by utilizing the short-range interactions in relaxor ferroelectrics. The effect was observed over a broad temperature range with local piezoresponse spectroscopy in unpoled samples, while no negative piezoresponse was observed when the material was pre-poled. These measurements suggest that the effect, which is promising for power-generation applications, originates from non-ergodic behavior. Complementary macroscale impedance and dielectric constant measurements as a function of temperature and frequency supported the mesoscopic findings. Bearing in mind the direct relationship between piezoresponse and capacitance, relaxor ferroelectrics appear as an excellent platform for the emerging technology of low-power negative-capacitance transistors.},

  abstract     = {PZT95/5 is a widely used ferroelectric material renowned for its exceptional ferroelectric properties, making it a crucial component in pulsed power systems and advanced devices. The phase transition behavior of ferroelectric ceramics under compression is vital for the effective design of materials and devices. The phase transition processes in these ceramics differ significantly between static and dynamic compression, presenting a long-standing controversy in the field. This study investigates the phase transition of PZT95/5 under dynamic shock compression using a shock response model. The findings indicate that the dynamic phase transition begins at lower pressures and completes at higher pressures compared to hydrostatic conditions, resulting in a broader pressure range for the phase transition. Theoretical modeling, grounded in ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects, combined with one-dimensional uniaxial stress density functional theory calculations across various orientations and three-dimensional Python visualizations, clarifies the physical mechanisms driving the progressive phase transition of ceramics under dynamic conditions. Additionally, the dynamic phase transition ratio of the ferroelectric material is quantified. Under hydrostatic pressures, the phase transition is independent of grain orientation, resulting in consistent transition pressures across all directions. In contrast, under anisotropic stress, grains with different orientations exhibit varying sensitivity to pressures, leading to distinct transition pressures in each direction. These insights advance the understanding of the phase transition mechanisms governing ferroelectric ceramics under both static and dynamic pressures.},

  abstract     = {Scaling silicon-based transistors to sub-ten-nanometer technology nodes presents significant challenges due to the difficult in achieving both atomic-scale thickness and excellent tunneling performance simultaneously. In this work, we employed first-principles calculations to investigate the dielectric properties of two recently reported van der Waals layered materials, Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 . Our results reveal that Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 monolayers exhibit out-of-plane dielectric constant of 15.2 and 7.6, respectively, with in-plane dielectric constant reaching as high as 39.0 and 26.0. To evaluate their potential as gate dielectrics, we calculated the band offsets and equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOTs) of Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 monolayers. The results show that both materials exhibit favorable band offsets relative to silicon and transition-metal dichalcogenide channel materials, along with low EOT. Finally, we estimated the dielectric leakage current density utilizing Bi 2 SeO 5 and Bi 2 TeO 5 based on a p-doped silicon-channel transistor, predicting a low leakage current (<10 −8 A cm −2 ). Our study provides theoretical insights into the potential application of bismuth selenite and bismuth tellurite monolayers as gate dielectrics in two-dimensional electronics.},

However, such exotic compounds are still limited. Here, we systematically study a self-intercalated van der Waals magnet Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 by combining first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 is thermodynamically stable and a half-metallic ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to 485 K, much above room temperature. Excitingly, we find that topological nodal lines and Weyl nodes coexist in the Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 bulk. Correspondingly, the Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 bulk exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 160 and 427 Ω − 1 c m − 1 when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy and hard axes, respectively. Moreover, its anomalous Hall conductivity can be increased to 374 (882) Ω − 1 c m − 1 by doping electrons (holes). Finally, we disclose that the 7-layer Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 thin film possesses half-metallic ferromagnetism with a high T C of 425 K, strong out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energy, and large anomalous Hall conductivity. Our findings suggest that Cr 3 Si 2 Te 6 is a room-temperature topological half-metallic ferromagnet, which could have promising prospects for practical applications in next-generation topo-spintronic and nanoscale electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Contrary to the conventional spin current with the in-plane spin polarization, spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization can achieve efficient all electrical control of perpendicular magnetization by spin–orbit torques (SOTs) without an external magnetic field. This feature is essential for high-density magnetic memory and logic devices. While such spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization has been demonstrated in a limited number of high-quality low crystal or magnetic symmetry systems, its generation in conventional heavy metal is challenging but crucial for field-free spintronic devices. Here, we show that overcoming this challenge is possible by fabricating a crystalline phase gradient in heavy metal tantalum, where the out-of-plane spin polarization was induced and triggers an out-of-plane SOT providing the field-free switching for perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet in Pt/Co/Ta (crystalline phase gradient) heterojunction. Meanwhile, the critical switching current density is lower than that of the Pt/Co/Ta (non-crystalline phase gradient) control case, and the polarity of field-free switching is determined by the sign of the crystalline phase gradient. Our work demonstrates that the crystalline phase gradient is a promising platform to generate the spin current with the out-of-plane spin polarization and achieve efficient field-free magnetization switching based on heavy metal tantalum, thus opening an avenue toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

Ferromagnetic resonance studies further demonstrate a low Gilbert damping factor of 8.4 × 10 −3 , highlighting its potential for efficient spin transport.

We micromagnetically investigate the nucleation dynamics of magnetic skyrmion pairs excited underneath two 30 nm nanocontacts with varying separations on top of an extended Co/Pt bilayer thin film. At close separation of 100 nm, the magnetization configurations strongly interact, giving rise to the formation of stable merged skyrmion states. As the separation increases beyond 200 nm, topologically distinct metastable configurations emerge, including the coexistence of tunable skyrmion–antiskyrmion pairs through Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction strengths and current pulse amplitudes. These metastable states eventually relax into two stable skyrmions that can be independently toggled ON and OFF using a weak in-plane magnetic field, enabling complex logic operations and more flexible circuit designs. Beyond the fundamental interest in skyrmion interaction dynamics, the independent control of skyrmion–antiskyrmion states holds promise for next-generation spintronic devices, with potential applications in memory, logic, and computing.},

  abstract     = {Direct observation of the band structure variation of electrical devices, such as MOSFETs, during device operation is the most important for understanding MOSFET device operation. However, there are a few reports on the direct measurement of variation in the metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) interface band structure during operation, and further investigation is required. This paper focuses on elucidating the changes in the band structure at buried interfaces under applied bias using a nondestructive approach. We conducted measurements using bias-applied laboratory hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Lab. HAXPES) with liquid gallium (Ga) x-ray source on MOS structures, which are widely recognized as fundamental and commonly used devices. We utilize HAXPES with Ga x-ray, providing high-energy/intensity x-rays, to achieve sufficient detection depth and enable observation of the deeper regions of the silicon substrate buried under gold and silicon dioxide layers. As a result, this approach allowed us to observe bias-dependent peak shifts resulting from changes in the band structure in detail. We observe HAXPES peak shift caused by the different substrate concentrations. Additionally, we obtained detailed information on band bending by applying a wider range of bias compared to previous bias applied HAXPES.},

  abstract     = {Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy are employed to study near-band edge excitonic emission lines in an aluminum nitride (AlN) film over a range of temperatures. The thermal quenching of the neutral silicon-bound exciton (Si 0 X) emission peak in AlN is observed, which is caused by the thermally activated processes from Si 0 X to two types of free exciton (Γ 1 and Γ 5 ), along with a two-electron satellite (TES) transition as a competing pathway. Among these, the activation process to the higher-energy Γ 1 free exciton state is predominant, which may be related to the symmetry of the exciton states. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of the TES emission intensity is observed, which originates from the predominance of the thermally activated TES transition rate at low temperatures, as opposed to the delocalization tendency of Si 0 X. Due to the rapid reduction in the nonradiative recombination lifetime, the PL lifetime of the Si 0 X emission peak decreases from 160 ps at 4.5 K to 15 ps at 80 K. Meantime, the radiative recombination lifetime increases with temperature, which further accelerates the thermal quenching of the Si 0 X emission peak to some extent.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides and their alloys provide a unique platform for exploring interlayer charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures. These structures are crucial for advancing the next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices. In this study, interlayer charge transfer in heterostructures composed of MoSe 2 , MoS 2 , and their alloy, MoSSe, is investigated using transient absorption, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The experimental results reveal that electron transfer in the alloy heterostructures, MoSSe/MoS 2 and MoSe 2 /MoSSe, is faster than in the pure MoSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure, despite the smaller conduction band offsets of the alloy systems. Raman spectroscopy confirms that alloy layers support phonon modes matching those of the pure layers, aligning with theoretical models of phonon-assisted interlayer charge transfer. Additionally, efficient hole transfer is observed in both alloy heterostructures. The findings suggest transition metal dichalcogenides alloys can be used for engineering heterostructures with desired charge transfer properties. By leveraging compositionally tunable band gaps and optical properties, alloy-based heterostructures offer opportunities for designing tailored materials suitable for diverse applications such as photodetectors, light-emitting devices, and flexible electronics. Moreover, the ultrafast charge transfer observed in these systems provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing interlayer interactions in 2D materials.},

It is widely accepted that enhanced NTE can be achieved in PbTiO 3 -based ferroelectrics by improving the tetragonality of PbTiO 3 ( c / a = 1.064) through chemical substitutions. Nevertheless, most substituted PbTiO 3 -based ferroelectrics exhibit reduced tetragonality and weakened NTE, while enhanced NTE has only been achieved in those materials with enhanced tetragonality so far.

A fully connected neural network is developed to predict transmission mapping, transmission spectra, multipole scattering, and TD components. Comparison with numerical simulations shows that the neural network predicts TD resonance efficiently and accurately. Experimental validation through fabricated samples further confirms the strong TD response.

Here, a dual-metal hybrid metasurface is demonstrated for polarization-selective perfect absorption and reflection with liquid tuning capabilities in the infrared band. Based on the metal–insulator–metal architecture, the metasurface composed of Al/Ti nanostrips enables an intense absorption resonance at x -polarization and reflects light as a mirror at y -polarization, thus acting as a high-performance linear polarizer. The absorption peak wavelength can be continuously tailored from 1200 to 1850 nm with an average absorption > 99% by scaling the unit-cell period of metasurfaces. Furthermore, the perfect absorption wavelength of the metasurface exhibits a large range switch (>750 nm) through immersion tuning, and its absorption remains above 99.5%. The proposed dual-metal hybrid metasurface for liquid-tunable absorption can promote practical technologies of dynamic polarizers, photodetectors, and optical imaging.},

However, previous explorations toward higher-order TBICs have been limited to the Hermitian assumption, omitting the nonconservative characteristics present in many artificial materials. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an acoustic lattice model supporting higher-order TBICs that solely rely on non-Hermiticity, in which the non-Hermiticity is implemented by strategically applying additional loss to specific sites in the lattice. Importantly, these in-band corner states are protected by chiral symmetry and can be spectrally switched by introducing perturbations to the corner sites or couplings. Our findings highlight the distinctive role of non-Hermiticity in constructing higher-order TBICs, which may inspire sophisticated and externally tunable approaches for designing high- Q devices in wave-based technologies.},

A resistance enhancement of ∼8% at room temperature was achieved at an electric field of −1 kV/cm, which indicates that such 2DEG is rather sensitive to the strain in the TiO 2 layer.

We experimentally test a range of geometries, comparing shear adhesion strength to understand structure–function relationships in our chosen parameter space. Our findings indicate that introducing cuts to form serpentine paths in a disk results in longer effective lengths and enhanced compliance, thus requiring less energy to deform into a rough surface. Leveraging this insight and associated scaling analysis, we conclude that serpentine-like features arranged in a radially symmetric wedge configuration achieve high levels of adhesion, even on rough surfaces, enabling robust adhesion relative to featureless electroadhesive disks.},

  abstract     = {The electromagnetic wave pollution, originating from various electronic devices, has attracted widespread attention and has brought serious threats to human life. For this situation, the high-efficiency electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) materials are required. Herein, carbon material modified with molybdenum dioxide is designed and synthesized by carbonizing the Mo-precursor. The Mo oxide/carbide-modified carbon materials are obtained by changing the raw material ratio and carbonized temperatures. The optimal material (MO-2-750) is composed of MoO 2 and carbon with uniform nanotablet-like shapes and has excellent impedance matching. The maximum reflection loss of MO-2-750 is about −59.9 dB at a thickness of 2.2 mm, which is nearly 6 times that of carbon material. The effective absorption bandwidth is in the range of 11.29–17.32 GHz. This MoO 2 -modified carbon material could serve as an EMA platform in the electromagnetic wave absorption fields.},

The two lasers, with different free-running repetition rates, are coupled through a long delay fiber path, they synchronize, and generate optical pulse trains with identical repetition rates in a wide range of experimental conditions (optical frequency, optical delay, and coupling strength). The common repetition rate can be easily fine-tuned with the control of the external coupling path length. In synchronized state, both lasers operate with significantly reduced timing jitter with respect to their free-running values. Finally, under specific conditions, the repetition rate locking is accompanied by partial mutual coherence between the lasers, as indicated by the formation of interferometric fringes.},

However, these plasmas can be subject to the formation of plasma non-uniformities propagating in the E × B direction. These rotating plasma structures (or “spokes”) enhance the transport of charged species across the magnetic field, which can harm the gentle processing capability of the plasma. In this work, we investigate the role of electrostatically active boundaries on the spoke formation by incorporating a variable bias conducting boundary (known as an anticathode) placed on the axially opposite side of the cathode. Our findings indicate azimuthal mode suppression occurs when the anticathode is electron collecting. Furthermore, we show selective azimuthal mode suppression by biasing the anticathode to an intermediate potential between the cathode and anode potentials. These findings suggest a link between the axial electron confinement in the e-beam generated plasma and azimuthally propagating plasma structure formation.},

However, leveraging defects to tune the intrinsic electronic structure of REO to enhance electrochemical performance, as well as understanding the underlying physical mechanisms at the atomic level, remained an open challenge. Density functional theory plus U calculations revealed that doping and oxygen vacancies not only regulated Li-ion insertion stability but also reduced the migration energy barriers in CeO 2 . Doping also decreased the volume change rate of CeO 2 during Li-ion insertion. Oxygen vacancies lowered the Li-ion migration energy barrier in CeO 2 from 1.516 to 0.903 eV. In comparison, Li-ion migration energy barriers in the La 2 O 3 series structures were significantly lower than those in CeO 2 . Experimental results confirmed that the Li-ion diffusion coefficient of La 2 O 3 was markedly higher than that of CeO 2 . Upon Li-ion insertion, the bandgap of CeO 2 decreased from 2.18 to 1.60 eV, and density of states analysis revealed the profound impact of lithiation on the electronic structure.

However, the undesired growth of zinc dendrites and the prevalence of side reactions pose significant challenges that limit the practical application of ZIBs. The sophisticated structural design and crystal orientation of the Zn anode can effectively suppress the occurrence of zinc dendrites and side reactions. Herein, a highly oriented Zn (002) lattice plane on 3D conductive frameworks [Zn/TiN nanotubes (NTs)] is designed to address uncontrolled dendrite growth, water-induced side reactions, and suboptimal Zn metal utilization in ZIBs. By leveraging an abundance of active sites for Zn 2+ adsorption, minimal charge transfer resistance, and the controlled growth of Zn crystal facets, the reversibility and stability of ZIBs can be significantly enhanced during the Zn plating/stripping process. Remarkably, fiber-ZIBs based on Zn/TiN NTs exhibit a large specific capacity, long-term cycling durability, and excellent mechanical properties. This work proposes an approach to achieve highly reversible zinc anodes from the perspective of nanostructure and crystal orientation.},

However, the evolution of point defects during gamma ( γ )-irradiation is still poorly understood. In this paper, we report the evolution of point defects in Bi 2 Te 3 materials subjected to varying doses of γ -irradiation and their impact on TE performance. Precisely, Bi 0.5 Sb 1.5 Te 3 and Bi 2 Te 2.7 Se 0.3 materials, along with TE modules, were fabricated and subsequently subjected to γ -irradiation. The segregation of Te elements in Bi 2 Te 3 was observed under low irradiation dose, attributing to the formation of interstitial atom–vacancy pair of Te induced by γ -irradiation. In addition, the formation of point defects has a positive relation with the irradiation dose. The positron annihilation (PA) measurements revealed that the number of vacancies in Bi 2 Te 3 diminished with increasing irradiation dose. The accompanying changes in carrier concentration ( n H ) and mobility ( μ H ) suggest that γ -ray drives Bi atoms to occupy Te vacancies, forming antisite defects. The TE performance of Bi 2 Te 3 was subsequently evaluated, and the findings revealed a strong correlation with the evolution of point defects. This study provides insights into the damage mechanisms and property alterations of Bi 2 Te 3 materials under γ -irradiation.},

For practical applications, the major challenge for SWCNTs is improving the thermoelectric performance and thermal durability of n -type SWCNT films. Here, SWCNT inks were prepared using a dopant, which is a cationic surfactant of dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride (DODMAC), by changing the mass ratio of DODMAC/SWCNT. The SWCNT films were fabricated by vacuum filtering, followed by heat treatment at 423 K. The in-plane thermoelectric properties were measured at 300 K, and the Seebeck coefficient changed from positive to negative values when the DODMAC/SWCNT was 10 −2 . The highest dimensionless figure-of-merit, ZT , of 1.0 × 10 −2 was exhibited at a DODMAC/SWCNT of 80, which was close to saturation concentration. This ZT was achieved mainly because the thermal conductivity decreased significantly to 0.16 W/(m · K), and it is currently one of the highest values among those of n -type SWCNT films with various dopants. To demonstrate power generation, we fabricated a SWCNT-TEG consisting of n -type SWCNT films with the highest ZT . The SWCNT-TEG exhibited an output voltage of 24 mV and a maximum power of 0.9 μ W at a temperature difference of 80 K. Furthermore, to investigate the thermal durability of n -type SWCNT films, thermal cycling tests were performed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 423 K. The SWCNT film with a DODMAC/SWCNT of 80 exhibited the highest durability. These findings will contribute to the widespread use of SWCNT-TEGs as power sources for IoT sensors.},

The composite array consists of a reflection phase gradient metasurface array and a horizontal omnidirectional antenna, with a central operating frequency of 5.8 GHz. The reflection phase gradient metasurface array elements are insensitive to the polarization of the incident wave and are arranged radially around the array center. This configuration creates a radial reflection phase gradient that efficiently converts incident plane waves of different polarizations into surface waves converging toward the center. The surface wave energy is then extracted by the horizontal omnidirectional antenna and converted into direct current (DC) by a rectifier. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the composite array maintains effective surface wave excitation and propagation toward the center for both circularly polarized and various horizontally polarized plane waves, achieving a plane wave-to-surface wave conversion efficiency of 74.89%. Experimental validation shows that the proposed array achieves a maximum energy collection efficiency of 62.23% and an RF-DC conversion efficiency of 39.96% over a broad frequency range of 5.6–6.0 GHz. This study achieves polarization insensitivity while simultaneously enhancing the operational efficiency of microwave energy receivers.

To solve the problem of high return loss in existing terahertz amplitude modulation techniques, this paper proposes a near-zero reflection terahertz modulator based on an electrical length reconfiguration cascade. The ON-OFF effect of the modulator is achieved through the cascade's electrical length reconstruction, and the reflections are effectively suppressed from the ON state to the OFF state. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modulator achieves a broadband low-reflection effect in the 170–260 GHz band, with a Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of less than 1.5 over a bandwidth of 60 GHz and an optimal VSWR of 1.1. It has the potential to support high-speed response as well as the large-capacity, high-rate data transmission. Accordingly, the proposed modulator offers a promising solution for the design of high-performance terahertz modulators and multi-channel integrated terahertz communication systems.},

  abstract     = {To meet the demands for more advanced computer chips, creating devices with advanced 3D architectures is becoming commonplace in the semiconductor industry. To ensure alignment between the different layers, the bottom-up technique of area-selective deposition (ASD) is promising. However, ASD may not always be feasible depending on the various surface chemistries present during manufacturing of complex semiconductor devices. Topographically selective deposition (TSD) is emerging as an alternative, focusing on differences in surface orientation rather than chemical properties. This work demonstrates a TSD supercycle approach in which atomic layer deposition (ALD) is directed to proceed exclusively within a 3D trench structure, by covering the top of the trench with an amorphous carbon (aC) inhibition layer. The aC layer is applied selectively on the top surface of the trench by exploiting the ion-radical synergy required for its deposition. Since the aC layer lacks adsorption sites for ALD precursors, growth of the target material is inhibited on the top surface of the trench, whereas it occurs selectively within the trench. After several ALD cycles of selective deposition of the target material, the aC layer is removed and reapplied in a supercycle recipe until sufficient material has been deposited in the trench. The selective deposition of an aC inhibition layer on the top surface of the trench, as well as the selective deposition of 3.0 ± 0.1 nm of TiO 2 in a trench is demonstrated on a 3D nanostructure.},

By employing multiple measurement configurations via low-frequency noise and direct current I–V characterization, we quantitatively investigated the energetic distribution of subgap density-of-states in the a-IGZO channel and the spatial distribution of oxide traps ( N ot ) in the gate insulator, respectively. Also, the qualitative analysis was performed to determine the oxygen-related defects after γ-ray irradiation using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the validity of our results was additionally confirmed by measuring the breakdown voltage and applying positive-bias stress to the fabricated devices exposed to radiation for accelerated tests.},

In this work, we simulate the electrostatics and quantum transport properties of quantum dots on a Si metal–oxide–semiconductor platform and a Si/SiGe heterostructure. We investigate the effects of gate configurations and the SiGe spacer thickness on device characteristics, such as gate capacitances, Coulomb blockade, and charge stability. For a single quantum dot, placing its barrier gates (BGs) under the plunger gate improves the charge stability, while swapping the positions of those gates reduces the effects of the barrier gate biases on the charge stability. A thicker SiGe spacer further suppresses the effects of the barrier gate biases on the charge stability for quantum dots on the Si/SiGe heterostructure but leads to stronger crosstalk between neighboring quantum dots. Wider barrier gates can help to mitigate the crosstalk effects for multiple quantum dots. These findings provide key insights into the optimization of the gate configurations and material selection to improve the charge stability and minimize the crosstalk by different gates for future development of scalable Si-based quantum dots.},

  abstract     = {Rare earth (RE) ions are important dopants to modulate semiconductor properties because of their abundant energy levels. Herein, a simple Er–Yb co-doping strategy was developed to enhance the near-infrared optoelectronic properties of SnS 2 nanosheets. The constructed device based on Er–Yb co-doping SnS 2 has a detectivity of ∼4.97 × 10 8 Jones at 980 nm. The enhanced photoresponse of the doped system at 980 nm could be attributed to the upconversion behavior of the Er–Yb ion pairs. The Yb 3+ ions as sensitizers significantly enhance the upconversion emission and near-infrared photoresponse properties of the material. The energy transfer from Yb 3+ to Er 3+ ions can occur between different layers of co-doping nanosheets by investigating the properties of the constructed SnS 2 :Er/SnS 2 :Yb homojunction nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Er or Yb doping introduces slight structural and charge distribution changes owing to the similarity in the metal–atom coordination structure between SnS 2 and RE sulfide. Our study demonstrates that RE doping is an effective way to improve the near-infrared photoresponse of 2D materials and clarifies the relationship between luminescence and photoelectric properties.},

To enhance the optoelectronic properties of Ga 2 O 3 films, a controllable doping strategy is proposed in this work. Using a sol-gel method, Ga 2 O 3 films doped with magnesium (Mg) are prepared, with the Mg concentration adjustable through the precursor solution. The results indicate that the bandgap of Ga 2 O 3 increases with higher doping levels, while the electrical conductivity decreases proportionally. To evaluate their optoelectronic characteristics, a series of photodetectors with Mg-doped Ga 2 O 3 active layers are fabricated. Under a 254 nm incident light, the device with an optimal doping concentration of 4.2% demonstrates the best performance, achieving the highest responsivity ( R ) of 1.97 A/W and a photo-dark current ratio of 2.6 × 10 3 . Furthermore, density functional theory calculations are employed to provide a detailed analysis of the fundamental mechanisms behind the enhanced optoelectronic properties. This approach to controllable and optimized doping in Ga 2 O 3 films shows promise for future applications in semiconductor devices.},

Using Hall and photo-Hall measurements, we identify macroscopic separation of negative and positive carriers as the most likely origin for delayed photoconductivity decay, with a strong electron localization expected at grain boundaries or cracks within the polycrystalline films. Additionally, measurements on perovskite films with varying morphology and SnF 2 additive content reveal that large apparent grain size (>5 μ m ⁠ ) and effective passivation of recombination centers combine to provide a path for achieving PPC extending over 100 h at room temperature.},

However, In 2 O 3 nanofiber FETs typically exhibit deteriorated electrical performance and bias stability due to the disordered arrangement of nanofibers and a high concentration of oxygen vacancy defects. In this study, In 2 O 3 nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning, and the effects of nanofiber orientation and Y 2 O 3 passivation on FET electrical performance were systematically investigated. The results indicate that after Y 2 O 3 passivation, the aligned In 2 O 3 nanofiber FETs exhibit enhanced electrical performance and superior positive bias stress and negative bias illumination stress stability. The Y 2 O 3 passivation layer effectively prevents the penetration of external O 2 and H 2 O molecules, while the diffusion of Y 3+ into the back channel reduces oxygen vacancies, thereby improving device stability. When Al 2 O 3 was employed as the dielectric layer, the electrical performance of aligned In 2 O 3 nanofiber FET with Y 2 O 3 passivation was further optimized, achieving a mobility of 18.2 cm 2 /V s and a subthreshold swing of 85 mV/dec. Meanwhile, the FET exhibits excellent environmental stability after 60 days of atmospheric exposure.

Herein, the heterostructures composed of bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) ferroelectrics and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are constructed to promote the photocatalytic CO 2 performance. The large spontaneous polarization of BNT optimizes the transfer dynamics of photoinduced electrons and holes and causes energy band bending with strong intrinsic electric field. With the aid of Ag NPs, the BNT@ x Ag heterojunctions exhibit intensified light absorption due to the phenomenon of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which extends the visible light absorption spectrum and strengthens charge transfer. The modified catalysts demonstrate improved charge separation capacity and notably prolonged electron lifetime up to 40.95 ns. The synergistic effect of LSPR and intrinsic polarization significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency together with ultrahigh CO product selectivity, which is outstanding among the ferroelectric and other representative photocatalysts.

We demonstrate that thinner films exhibit a greater fraction of the non-polar tetragonal phase (t-phase), with increased V O concentration at the interface, affecting the device performance. Electrical measurements reveal contrasting wake-up and fatigue behavior between the two thicknesses, with thinner films showing decreased remanent polarization (2P R ) due to t-phase dominance and V O redistribution during field cycling.

  abstract     = {Orbitronics has been extensively explored theoretically and experimentally in orbital-charge conversion. The spin-charge conversion efficiency induced by the orbital Hall effect can be much larger than that of the spin Hall effect. However, orbitronics focuses primarily on light metal elements and their oxides, while exploring heavy metal elements and oxides is rare. In this Letter, we report significant enhancements in the ultrafast spin (orbit)-charge conversion for the CoFeB/Pt/SrIrO 3 (SIO) trilayer using the terahertz emission spectroscopy, where the maximum enhancement calculated by the normalized terahertz emission amplitude is about three times that for the CoFeB/Pt bilayer. In addition, we observe a ∼2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the THz emission due to significant orbital transport in Pt-insertion heavy metal layer in the CoFeB/Pt/SIO heterostructure as compared to the CoFeB/SIO bilayer. Our findings not only demonstrate that the transition metals and their oxides exhibit strong inverse orbital Hall effect but also show that multilayer structures allow enhancing the spin-to-charge current conversion efficiency for THz applications, providing a direction to tailor THz emitters.},

We observe a negative SMR, which is contrary to the positive SMR usually measured in heavy metal/ferromagnet bilayers. We further observe a transition from negative to positive SMR with increasing thickness of the WTe 2 layer, as well as SMR sign reversal with increasing temperature in heterostructures with thicker WTe 2 . The peculiar SMR behaviors in polycrystalline WTe 2 /Py heterostructures are attributed to the interface-induced spin current and its competition with the spin Hall-induced spin current.

The good correlation of micromagnetic modeling and experimental data of spin wave propagation in the multistructure as a function of the applied magnetic field was clarified by the convergence parameters of the obtained polymer 3D magnetic microvolcanoes fields and the standard theory of spin wave propagation.

  abstract     = {The construction of irradiation-tolerant anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors is crucial for weak-field detection in scenarios of aerospace and radiotherapy. Presently, the utilization of the NiFe/oxide composite structure was considered to be an effective scheme to optimize the spin-dependent transport property; however, it exhibited poor anti-irradiation ability due to the crystal instability of oxide. Here, a strategy was proposed to break through the limitation based on the electronic reconstruction and structural stabilization. By introducing an oxygen-affinitive Hf intercalation into the Ta/MgO/NiFe/MgO/Ta multilayer, the electron coordination was modified to tune the 3d orbital occupancy of Fe, apparently boosting the s-d electron scattering and spin-related transport property. Meanwhile, the irradiation stability of electronic and crystal structures was effectively improved due to the emergence of the Hf–O–Mg bond with high dissociation energy. Therefore, we constructed a highly reliable AMR sensor with both the ultrahigh sensitivity of 3.1 mV/V/Oe and excellent irradiation-tolerant ability capable of resisting the γ-ray irradiation of 1000 Gy. These results not only build an important basis for the sensor application in the irradiation environment but also provide a possible idea for the anti-irradiation design in spintronic devices.},

The Gaussian-distributed plane wave heats the medium adjacent to the Fresnel reflection surface. Meanwhile, a continuous probe light traverses the heating field, and the periodic temperature change then modulates the phase of the probe light. A multi-beam interferometer formed by aligning the Fresnel reflection surface to a gold-coated high-reflection surface possesses high resolution and sensitivity, significantly enhancing the detection performance. A well-established theoretical model of instantaneous PT transduction and optical phase modulation is employed to obtain the optimized interferometric configuration. To validate the effective interferometric phase transformation within the cavity, a comparison is made between the simple silicon cavity and the gold-coated cavity. The limitation of detection of such extrinsic fiber-tip PT sensors indicates one magnitude lower as compared to the conventional PT interferometric gas sensor with such robust and compact sensing designs.

It is clearly shown that the capacitance signal associated with the electron emission from a trap level previously identified in the literature as E14 and characterized by an activation energy of 0.18 eV is found to be a superposition of electron emissions from two closely spaced energy levels. Furthermore, we noted that the corresponding L-DLTS signal splits into two well separated components with activation energies of 196 and 209 meV, and the splitting occurs as the electric field in the space charge region of a Schottky diode exceeds 2 × 10 7 V/m (0.2 MV/cm). Additionally, a strong dependency of DLTS and L-DLTS signals on the electric field strength and resulting enhancement of the electron emission from these two trap states agree well with the 1D Poole–Frenkel (PF) model, suggesting donor-like behavior of both states. Finally, we found that the barrier height for thermal emission of the electrons is significantly reduced in our samples by 121 meV due to the PF effect for experimental conditions corresponding to an electric field of 3.5 × 10 7 V/m (0.35 MV/cm).},

With the assistance of S-parameter characterization combined with secondary ion mass spectroscopy analyses, the incorporated oxygen impurity has been identified to be the main source bringing about the severe RF loss of N-polar GaN. The compensation of Fe-doping enables an effective reduction in RF loss. Moreover, the unintentionally doped (UID) GaN layer grown on top of the Fe-doped GaN buffer requires a careful design due to the distinct memory effect of Fe-doping in N-polar GaN. With an optimization of its thickness, a very low RF loss of 0.36 dB/mm at 94 GHz has been attained. Furthermore, by fitting the Fe concentration profile of UID-GaN according to the mass balance rate equation, it is found that the desorption of Fe on the N-polar GaN surface is significant. A bond-based model is introduced to elucidate the difference of the Fe memory effect between Ga-polar and N-polar GaN.},

Among various innovative materials, two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered attention as frontrunners for next-generation device fabrication. In this work, we report the fabrication and comprehensive characterization of a memristor based on 2D PtTe 2 . The device demonstrates exceptional performance metrics, including a high OFF/ON ratio, low switching voltage, and long data retention time. Leveraging density functional theory calculations, we unravel the underlying conduction mechanism, revealing the pivotal role of Ag conductive filaments in resistive switching behavior. Furthermore, the neuromorphic capabilities of the PtTe 2 memristor were evaluated through its emulation of key brain-inspired synaptic functionalities, such as long-term depression/enhancement, paired-pulse facilitation, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. By modulating its electrical conductance, we implemented a convolutional neural network for MNIST handwritten digit recognition, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97.49%. To further illustrate its adaptive learning capabilities, we demonstrated a Pavlov's dog experiment using the device. This study establishes 2D PtTe 2 as a promising material for neuromorphic applications and represents a critical step forward in bridging the gap between advanced materials and next-generation computing architectures.

Our results indicate that an optical transition involving O N − (a DX center) gives rise to an absorption band peaked at 2.22 eV, suggesting it is a source of the absorption band with an onset at ∼ 2 eV observed in oxygen-containing samples. We also propose that neutral O N – DX complexes can form, which would give rise to absorption peaking at 3.06 eV. In addition, we find that oxygen, in spite of its DX character, may behave as an “optically shallow donor” and be involved in optical transitions from deep defect states to the conduction band. This observation provides an alternative physical mechanism for the optical absorption bands observed in AlN samples in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) region.},

The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations, we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a line shape is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode, which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for the identification of quantum emitters in hBN.},

  abstract     = {The van der Waals crystal NbOX 2 (X = Cl, Br, I) has recently attracted much attention due to its remarkable in-plane anisotropy and substantial second-order nonlinear optical response. Moreover, the importance of modulating its physical properties through strain has become increasingly prominent. Herein, we investigate the anisotropic phonon response of NbOX 2 along various crystallographic directions under uniaxial tensile strain by Raman spectroscopy. The results show that opposing frequency shifts manifest in the Raman modes when uniaxial tensile strain is applied either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis, and the highest frequency peak, P5, shows significant blue or red shifts. Density functional theory calculation results are consistent with the observed Raman shifts under strain. The change in Nb–O bond length is the main reason for the significant blue shift of P5. The anisotropic and pronounced frequency shifts of NbOX 2 under strain can serve as sensitive indicators for strain modulation, offering insights for potential applications such as flexible optoelectronic devices and strain sensors.},

It is revealed that all the alkalis (Na, K, Rb) prefer to accumulate in the surface region of the absorber with occupying Cu sites. A hole barrier can be introduced in the absorber surface region, and the electron barrier at CdS/CuInSe 2 interface is nearly changed after alkali incorporation. Distinct effects of Na and heavier alkalis (K and Rb) are explored. Post-deposition treatment (PDT) with Na leads to form Na x Cu 1−x InSe 2 in the near-surface region. While monoclinic KInSe 2 (or RbInSe 2 ) secondary phase tends to form at the surface during K (or Rb) PDT. The hole barrier introduced by Na PDT can be much lower than that in the case of heavy alkali PDT due to the limited Na solubility in Na x Cu 1−x InSe 2 . The improved V O C in CIGS solar cells by heavy alkali PDT is mainly attributed to the absence of interfacial states and the elimination of isolated In Cu and V Cu defects in the surface region.},

P-type Schottky contacts are obtained in all 1T/H-XA 2 contacts to Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and the contacts can be engineered from Schottky to Ohmic contacts via external electric fields. Furthermore, a large pinning factor to suppress the FLP effects was observed to approach the Schottky–Mott limit, and the origin is elucidated.

The monolayered SMoSiN 2 possesses excellent stability and direct bandgap at the K / K ′ valley, making it a promising candidate for valleytronic semiconductor. The ferromagnet CrCl 3 substrate induces a sizable valley splitting via proximity coupling. The valley-contrasting property of the top-stacking is significantly tunable by both in-plane sliding and vertical strain engineering, leading to extraordinary tunability of valley splitting in the range 1.6–9.4 meV. In contrast, the valley-contrasting property of the bottom-stacking is comparably robust due to the screen effect originating from the outmost N sublayer to reduce the proximity interaction. Our investigation reveals that the stacking order is a degree of freedom to manipulate the valley-related properties of various vdW heterostructures, facilitating the achievement of versatile valley-contrasting properties.},

The effects of the counter-electrode's curvature on the apex field enhancement factor ( ⁠ γ Ca ⁠ ) of the emitter are still not understood. In this Letter, we theoretically explore how the apex field enhancement factor of an emitter, represented by a hemisphere on a cylindrical post (HCP) with apex radius r a = 50 nm, is influenced by the curvature of a sphere-shaped counter-electrode. Importantly, our results show that for HCPs with sharpness aspect ratios typically between 10 2 and 10 3 ⁠ , there is a universal scaling such that γ Ca = γ Pa Ψ ( R / d gap ) ⁠ , where γ Pa represents the apex field enhancement factor for the emitter assuming a planar counter-electrode, and Ψ ( R / d gap ) is a universal scaling function such that Ψ ∼ 1 for R / d gap ≫ 1 and Ψ ∼ ( R / d gap ) α ⁠ , with α close to unity, for R / d gap ≪ 1 ⁠ . These findings help partially explain discrepancies observed in orthodox field electron emission experiments, where it was reported that the effective γ Ca values extracted from the current–voltage characteristics of single-tip carbon nanotubes typically underestimate the theoretical γ Pa values when R ∼ d gap ≫ r a ⁠ , a trend that is predicted by our results.},

  abstract     = {At micro- and nanoscales, momentum transfer between surfaces is influenced by various physical mechanisms, including quantum fluctuations, electromagnetic interactions, electric charges, and the dynamics of (rarefied) gases. Under non-isothermal conditions, rarefied gases give rise to thermal Knudsen forces whose magnitudes strongly depend on the gas species and surface characteristics. Knudsen forces are particularly relevant in nanotechnology, optical manipulation, and aerospace systems, where gas rarefaction occurs due to highly confined geometries, sub-micrometer length scales, and reduced particle densities. Despite their significance, predictive modeling of Knudsen forces is limited by a lack of comprehensive experimental data across diverse materials and surface morphologies. In this work, we present a highly sensitive and adaptable measurement platform capable of directly quantifying Knudsen forces using a suspended, interchangeable micro-cantilever within controlled rarefied helium and nitrogen environments. The system integrates optical fiber interferometry to precisely capture out-of-plane displacements at sub-micrometer resolution, driven by Knudsen forces. From the empirical data, we derive a robust correlation linking the magnitudes of Knudsen forces to energy accommodation coefficients, offering deeper insights into the underlying gas–surface interaction mechanisms.},

This “asymmetric” waveguide design is potentially advantageous, since it improves the active-core optical confinement factor, as well as the overall thermal conductance, especially for epitaxial-side-down mounted devices. When operated in pulsed mode, the broad-area ICL featured a characteristic temperature of 57 K and a threshold current density as low as 95 A/cm 2 at 25 °C, which is the lowest ever reported for an ICL operating at a similar temperature.

Based on these data, we have performed systematic simulations using an eight-band k · p model to identify the relationship between QD dimensions and the energy difference between corresponding confined hole states in the two QDs.

  abstract     = {With the improvement of heterostructure preparation technology, research on the physical properties and device performance of mixed-dimensional heterostructures has been greatly developed. Numerous studies have focused on 2D/2D heterostructures, but research on 1D/2D heterostructures is comparatively limited, and the interface electron transfer mechanism needs to be further explored. In this study, we leverage the inherent band structure alignment characteristics of 1D Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 and 2D WSe 2 to create Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 /WSe 2 heterostructure with Type-I band alignment. The results of PL, Raman, and KPFM prove the existence of a strong coupling effect at the heterostructure interface. The Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 nanowire enhances the PL intensity and red-shifts the PL peaks of WSe 2 . This strong local electric field at the heterojunction interface improves the photoresponse performance of the Bi 1.3 In 0.7 Se 3 /WSe 2 heterostructures devices. They achieve excellent photoresponce properties in a wide spectral range from solar-blind ultraviolet C (254 nm) to near-infrared (980 nm) region, with a large responsivity of 98 A/W, a high detectivity of 1.16 × 10 13 Jones, and a fast photoresponse time of 500 μ s ⁠ . In addition, the optoelectronic performance of the device is controlled by modulating the Fermi level of the heterostructure by the applied gate electric field. Our work paves the way for the development of 1D/2D heterostructures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic holography is a promising technique for contactless manipulation, remote sensing, and energy harvesting. It involves retrieving holograms used to modulate acoustic sources for reconstructing target acoustic fields. The performance of reconstruction is primarily determined by two key criteria, including the spatial bandwidth product, which measures the pixel number representing information capacity, and the resolution, which quantifies the pixel size supporting detail gain. However, existing techniques face limitations in reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic, and real-time acoustic fields with enhanced spatial bandwidth product and resolution across the entire aperture size. These challenges stem from the reliance on physically constrained holograms with static nature or relatively low spatial bandwidth product and resolution. Here, we introduce super-resolution acoustic holography, wherein the spatial bandwidth and resolution of the reconstructed target acoustic fields surpass those of the retrieved source holograms, especially within the same aperture size. We further develop a deep learning strategy that combines a classical neural network architecture with a linear accumulation based physical model, allowing for the customization of reconstructed acoustic planes with higher resolution while maintaining the same lateral coverages. Extensive algorithmic validations, numerical simulations, and practical experiments demonstrate the capability of our method to achieve high-fidelity, dynamic, real-time super-resolution acoustic holography, rendering its potential to advance practical applications in holographic acoustics.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we reported the fabrication of improved Au/ZnO/Si resistance switching (RS) devices achieved by introducing buried cone - like Au nanoparticles (NPs). The Au NPs were facilely obtained by thermally annealing a thin Au film grown on a Si substrate, which did not influence the subsequent growth of ZnO thin films. Electric measurements verified typical RS behaviors in the Au/ZnO/Si devices, which are related to the recovery and rupture of conductive filaments due to electric field-driven oxygen vacancy migration. Notably, COMSOL-based electrostatic field simulations on Au/ZnO/Au structures have shown that an enhanced local electric field with 4.5 times enhancement was produced at the tip of Au NPs, which facilitated the oxygen vacancies migration around the tip of Au NPs. Accordingly, controlled formation and rupture of conductive filaments are proposed in the Au/ZnO/Au NPs/Si devices, which greatly improved the RS window, stability, and endurance. The results shown in this work may pave the way for the fabrication of high-performance oxide-based RS devices in the future.},

As an example, we consider the potential gain observed in their application in frequency stabilization schemes. We investigate how the parameters used to burn the spectral hole impact its shape, and how these factors determine the minimum achievable linewidth. In addition to the stability of the hole's center frequency, the linewidth and contrast play a crucial role in frequency locking. At sub-kelvin temperatures, the temperature-dependent T 7 broadening from two-phonon Raman scattering is expected to be negligible, and the spectral hole's linewidth should therefore remain constant in this interval. We observe however a linear broadening with increasing temperature, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms governing the linewidth at ultra-low temperatures.},

Electrochemical measurements suggest that OER performance of CoSe 2 nanosheets is improved under a 200 mT magnetic field, with the overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 reduced by 81 mV. Moreover, magnetic force microscopy observations on CoSe 2 nanosheets reveal that spin disorder in the magnetic domain wall region transforms to spin order under the 200 mT magnetic field, resulting in improved OER performance. Although the magnetic field has a negligible effect on the OER performance of single-domain CoSe 2 nanosheets, these findings reveal the decisive role of magnetic domain walls in enhancing OER performance under an applied magnetic field, pointing to the potential for industrial applications of magnetic field-assisted catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Pressure-induced evolution of the bandgap, structural phase transitions, and changes in exciton effects can significantly modulate the luminescent properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) quantum dots (QDs). Previous studies have indicated that CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 (MAPbBr 3 ) QDs, as a typical low-dimensional LHP material, and their photoluminescence (PL) at ambient conditions are mainly attributed to the radiative recombination of the initially generated excitons upon light absorption and the excitons involving surface states, while the existence of biexciton radiative recombination remains unclear. In this work, we confirm the existence of biexciton radiative recombination in MAPbBr 3 QDs at ambient conditions through experimental measurements of excitation-intensity-dependent PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra at ambient conditions as well as temperature-dependent PL spectra (80–260 K) at ambient pressure. We also establish that the PL of MAPbBr 3 QDs primarily originates from the combined effects of three excitons radiative recombination physical processes: biexcitons, initially generated excitons upon light absorption, and excitons involving surface states. Furthermore, through in situ high-pressure PL, absorption, and TRPL spectroscopy measurements, we reveal that the recombination lifetimes and the relative contributions of these three excitons in MAPbBr 3 QDs are all subject to alteration in response to the pressure-induced bandgap evolution and the structural phase transitions, thereby modulating their PL emission characteristics.},

However, concerns about electrochemical degradation under high-energy radiation hinder their widespread use in space. To this end, a NASICON-type Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) electrolyte with high ionic conductivity at room temperature was selected, and the effects of high-dose electron irradiation on the microstructure as well as electrochemical and mechanical properties of electrolyte were investigated by using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), NPD stress analysis, micro-computed tomography, nanoindentation, and XRD residual stress test. It was confirmed that LATP SSEs held good resistance to irradiation at absorbed doses of 1 and 2 MGy with negligibly performance degradation, while irradiation at high doses induced a rapid decrease in the Young modulus and hardness of SSEs and introduced a tensile stress of 65.79 MPa at up to 10 MGy absorbed dose, which increased the cracking tendency and the risk of lithium dendrite growth in the solid-state electrolyte. NPD revealed that the reduction of lithium vacancies at the M1 site of the irradiated SSEs was the critical factor for the ion transport performance degradation. This is evidenced by a significant increase in impedance, up to 453 Ω, and an increase in the activation energy for ion transport to 0.501 eV.},

  abstract     = {GeSe has recently gained attention for its structural similarity to SnSe, an excellent thermoelectric material. However, for the orthorhombic GeSe, the maximum zT is limited to ∼0.2 at 700 K. A significant improvement in the thermoelectric performance is observed when GeSe is stabilized in a rhombohedral or cubic structure; thus, the crystal structure plays an important role in GeSe for improved zT. In this study, we investigated the structural transitions and thermoelectric properties of Te-substituted GeSe. Increasing Te substitution in GeSe 1-x Te x (x = 0.00–0.50) induces a transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral crystal structure at ambient conditions with the maximum zT ∼ 0.58 observed in rhombohedral GeSe 0.6 Te 0.4 at 573 K. The improved thermoelectric performance in the rhombohedral phase is due to a concurrent increase in the power factor and a decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. The phonon dispersion calculation tells that the high-frequency optical phonon modes significantly increase the phonon–phonon scattering for the rhombohedral phase, enhancing the lattice anharmonicity and reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. This behavior aligns with the presence of metavalent bonding in rhombohedral GeSe. Additionally, peak broadening observed in the Raman spectra of the rhombohedral phase indicates pronounced lattice anharmonicity and phonon modes softening due to the metavalent bond character.},

First, a low-magnification telecentric lens is used for sparse axial sampling within a large depth-of-field range to obtain a coarse estimate of vascular depth. Then, based on the frequency-depth characteristics of dynamic blood flow signals, a TFDA-based focusing evaluation function is established in combination with Lambert–Beer's law, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 2.06%. Finally, validation on a 3-day-old chicken embryo demonstrated a lateral spatial resolution of 2.95 μ m and imaging time of 11.5 s for a 4.95 × 4.95 × 0.7 mm 3 sample. Our method provides effective blood flow depth localization by assessing focal modulation intensity relative to focal plane and blood flow position, offering promising support for vascular disease research.},

Herein, we reported an effective strategy to boost the triboelectric charge transfer efficiency by synergizing the strong ferroelectric polarization and high permittivity of embedded lead zirconate titanate fillers. The influence of interfacial polarization intensity and the dielectric permittivity, as well as corona poling, on the triboelectrification of composite film was systematically investigated. Notably, the switching of interfacial polarization direction renders an increase (207%) or a decrease (71%) in the triboelectric output in comparison with the non-poled counterpart. Theoretical modeling was established by combining Kelvin probe force microscopy characterization with the electron cloud overlap energy band derivation.

  abstract     = {Magnetoelectric transducers are being investigated as a promising alternative for wireless power transfer in cases where small device size and/or low operation frequency are desired. To maximize the output power of such transducers, operation at their mechanical resonance frequency is imperative. However, a reduction in size along the direction of oscillation is intrinsically accompanied by an increase in resonance frequency. Here, we report on a computational shape optimization strategy to minimize the resonance frequency in magnetoelectric transducers by ≈38% within a set of given optimization constraints. We show that our algorithm can be used to guide the design of magnetoelectric transducers optimized to operate at different resonance frequencies and allows for consistent frequency spacing between transducers, thus enabling separately addressable devices and clustered operation. Finally, we propose four needle-shaped devices that could be used as bioimplants that impose minimal tissue damage upon direct insertion into tissue. The increase in resonance frequency associated with the needle shape is overcompensated by a frequency minimization step.

  abstract     = {This study presents the use of micro-ring resonator (MRR) devices to extract and enhance nonlinear signals. MRRs “trap” incoming light and, therefore, have been shown to achieve extremely high local intensities of light. Thus, they can be used to facilitate highly nonlinear optical signals that are usually weak in intensity and require high excitation power. By embedding materials that host nonlinear optical processes inside the MRR, we expect to observe an enhancement in the strength of the nonlinear optical signals. This concept is demonstrated here by extracting the Raman signature of graphene that is placed inside a MRR device. A highly doped silica MRR featuring an optical bus waveguide coupled to a ring tuned to near-infrared wavelengths is used. Raman signal with an excitation wavelength of 522 nm via third-harmonic generation inside the MRR is observed. The higher-order Raman signal of the embedded graphene is also observed at the 1597.6 nm excitation wavelength. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the MRR as a nonlinear signal enhancer using high-Q MRR device setups.},

This device can respond differently to inputs ranging from 0.75 to 11.11 Hz, and at the same input frequency, it exhibits different responses by varying the control gate voltage from 0 to −0.8 V. This innovative design can dynamically adjust the cutoff frequency, enhancing edge feature processing in images, thereby significantly improving the recognition accuracy of information in blurry images that can be difficult for humans to distinguish. Our results provide a hardware edge-computing image processing method, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-gate transistors that typically have fixed parameters. The recognition accuracy of information in blurry images preprocessed by this device improved significantly from 80% to 100%.

Recently, 2D anisotropic/isotropic heterostructures have shown promise in breaking isotropic symmetry and inducing anisotropic responses through precise control of interfacial structures, such as moiré patterns. However, detailed experimental investigations into the correlation between anisotropic behaviors and anisotropic moiré patterns remain scarce. Here, we report optical anisotropy in WS 2 by stacking a WS 2 /ReS 2 heterostructure. Through measurements of polarized photoluminescence spectra, we observe that the intralayer excitons (both localized-state exciton LX and neutral exciton X A ) of WS 2 in the heterostructure exhibit pronounced anisotropy, which remains robust at both room temperature and a low temperature of ∼10 K. Furthermore, the angles between the linear polarization directions and the orientation of the corresponding one-dimensional moiré patterns remain approximately constant values (∼60° for LX and ∼45° for X A ), demonstrating a clear correlation between anisotropic exciton emission and the anisotropic moiré patterns. Our work offers valuable insights into achieving artificial optical anisotropy using anisotropic/isotropic heterostructures, paving the way for enhanced performance in anisotropic sensing devices.},

In our work, we propose a stable monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO with altermagnetic ground state and spin-valley locking (SVL) effect. The monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO exhibits a multipiezo effect with a large out-of-plane piezoelectricity and piezovalley effect with large valley polarization. The piezovalley effect is induced by uniaxial strain effect in different directions, which contributes the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) observed in AM systems. Moreover, compressive uniaxial strain could induce quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the AM system, where the dissipationless topological edge states' chirality could be manipulated by the direction of uniaxial strain. These manifest topological phase transitions could be realized via piezovalley effect in the AM system. Furthermore, the AM quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) could be induced by biaxial strain effect, which contributes quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work reveals that strain-engineering technique could serve as an important method to tune dissipationless edge states in monolayer Janus Nb 2 SeTeO. By designing the SVL effect, topological physics could be emerged in AM systems such as AVHE, QAHE, and QSHE.},

  abstract     = {Graphene exhibits a pronounced photo-thermoelectric effect (PTE) in its in-plane carrier transport and has attracted attention toward various optoelectronic applications. In this study, we demonstrate an out-of-plane PTE by utilizing electron tunneling across a barrier, namely, the tunneling photo-thermoelectric effect (TPTE). This was achieved in a monolayer graphene (MLG)/bilayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN)/bilayer graphene (BLG) asymmetric tunnel junction. MLG and BLG exhibit different cyclotron resonance (CR) optical absorption energies when their energies are Landau quantized under an out-of-plane magnetic field. We tuned the magnetic field under mid-infrared irradiation to bring MLG into CR conditions, whereas BLG was not in CR. The CR absorption in the MLG generates an electron temperature difference between the MLG and BLG and induces an out-of-plane TPTE voltage across the h -BN tunnel barrier. The TPTE exhibited a unique dependence on the Fermi energy of the MLG, which differed from that of the in-plane PTE of the MLG. The TPTE signal was large when the Fermi energy of the MLG was tuned near the transition between the quantum Hall state (QHS) and non-QHS. The TPTE allows one to measure the PTE on vertically stacked tunnel junctions, thus providing another degree of freedom for probing the electronic and optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures.},

Nevertheless, due to varying physical mechanisms, achieving and fine-tuning multiple such phenomena within a single S-N system continues to be a challenge. In this work, we employ NbSe 2 and WTe 2 to fabricate an S-N-S heterostructure. Below the superconducting transition temperature of NbSe 2 , two distinct resistance-temperature behaviors are observed: a continuous decrease in junction resistance with temperature decrease, indicative of the superconducting proximity effect and consistent with the BCS model, and an increase in resistance attributed to competition between Andreev reflection (AR) and normal reflection at a low-transparency interface, which can be suppressed by applying a small bias current or a magnetic field. Our results indicate the signature of the coexistence of proximity-induced superconductivity with AR in the measured S-N-S heterojunction, demonstrating the tunability of charge carrier transport behavior at the interface. This finding enhances our understanding of such systems and holds potential for the development of superconducting electronics, quantum computing, and energy harvesting technologies.},

Strong, circularly polarized luminescence reflecting the spin-polarized electron states generated by a GaNAs spin filter is needed to realize practical opto-spintronics applications. This study examined the impacts of the GaNAs thickness on the room-temperature spin-polarized luminescence properties of tunnel-coupled InAs quantum dots (QDs) through polarization- and time-resolved photoluminescence in combination with a rate equation analysis. Reducing the GaNAs thickness from 20 to 5 nm increased the QD luminescence intensity by over an order of magnitude at low excitation powers. This increased luminescence was attributed to decreased electron capture in the deep-level defect states of GaNAs, which resulted from fewer defects in thinner GaNAs layers. Furthermore, the reduction in GaNAs thickness decreased the excitation power needed to maximize electron spin polarization of QDs while maintaining a near-maximum value. This efficient spin-amplified luminescence of QDs was achieved through spin-selective capture of QD electrons by defect states under low excitation spin densities. These results demonstrate that using a thin GaNAs spin filter can result in strong QD luminescence and high circular polarization at room temperature and low excitation spin densities. The findings give valuable implications for the development of spin-functional optical devices utilizing a GaNAs spin filter.},

However, as a potential spintronic material, its spin related properties have not been fully understood yet. We investigate the efficiency of spin current detection in GeSn by using the technique of ferromagnetic resonance drive spin pumping. Some fundamental spintronic parameters can be extracted from our experimental results to measure the change of spin injection/conversion efficiency. A Co layer is deposited on the top GeSn thin films to serve as the spin current generator. Here, the effective spin mixing conductance ( ⁠ g eff ↑ ↓ ⁠ ) and the product of spin diffusion length and spin Hall angle [ λ s θ ISHE (%)] represent the spin injection efficiency and the spin-charge conversion efficiency, respectively. g eff ↑ ↓ and λ s θ ISHE (%) are 9.3 × 10 19 m −2 and 1.39 nm for p -type GeSn; and 7.4 × 10 19 m −2 and 2.09 nm for n -type GeSn. The high-efficient spin injection in both p- type and n- type Co/GeSn systems is attributed to a low barrier height at the Co/GeSn interface because the spin current at the interface is proportional to the square root of barrier height. Our experimental results show that GeSn is effective as a spin current sink.},

We verified our method by measuring the height, horizontal position, and vibration of the levitating film. The results show that the film levitates at the height of the original standing wave node and at discrete horizontal positions approximately every transducer interval. The levitated film vibrates at the same frequency as the ultrasonic transducer and cannot be regarded as rigid against ultrasonic waves. Different film materials and thicknesses were examined, including metal foils and wood papers. In this study, the maximum surface density of the films that levitated was 3.5 × 10 − 2 mg/mm 2 . Therefore, the proposed method can be used to hold film samples in the air for observation or as an aerial screen.},

  abstract     = {Thermal conductivity measurements of submicrometer structures are at the core of the efficient power design of semiconductor devices. Micro-Raman spectroscopy measures thermal conductivity in a fast, nondestructive, and non-contact manner. However, the focused laser heating in micro-Raman experiments may cause drastic thermal size effects. To date, the role of such effects in the accuracy and limitations of the measurement has not been addressed. Here, we present an advanced thermal model to capture the role of material properties, laser power, and film thickness in the thermal size effects, based on the three-dimensional (3D) gray phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recalling that laser-induced thermal size effects can lead to unexpectedly high local temperatures, even damaging the measured materials, our advanced 3D model gains particular importance for the accurate measurements of directional thermal conductivities in submicrometer structures using future high-resolution optical pump–probe techniques.},

  abstract     = {The phase change of a liquid into vapor results in a sharp volume expansion, generating a powerful driving force, which is fundamental for the operation of pulsating heat pipes (PHPs). However, the performance of PHPs is hindered by instability arising from the lack of directional control over the expansion process. In this work, we propose a PHP incorporating thermal-to-mechanical energy conversion (TMC) microstructures, which direct the TMC by controlling the expansion in desired directions, thereby more efficiently utilizing the driving force. Two designs for enhancement of TMC, i.e., one featuring a vapor actuator microstructure (VA-PHP) and another with diameter-variant channels (DVC-PHP), were fabricated and experimentally investigated under low inclination angles and horizontal orientations (0°, 1°, 5°, and 9°). The experimental results indicated that the incorporation of the TMC microstructures into the PHPs facilitated more efficient startup, enhanced unidirectional circulation, and reduced the dependence on the inclination angle. Notably, while the conventional PHP failed to operate at small inclination angles, the VA-PHP achieved stable operation at 1°, and the DVC-PHP further maintained stable operation even at 0°. The robust performance of the proposed PHPs at low inclination angles demonstrates the potential of TMC microstructures to overcome orientation-dependent limitations, thereby delivering a practical solution for improving the effectiveness of PHPs.},

It is, therefore, in hot pursuit of seeking solid-state electrolyte materials with high energy density and flexible operation conditions. Here, we verified a class of two-dimensional superionic conduction in A(BC) 2 , in which A are alkaline earth metals such as Be, Mg, and Ca, and boron–carbon (BC) form graphene-like layers. Our first-principles molecular dynamics simulation, boosted by high-accuracy machine-leaning potentials, shows that alkaline metal becomes super-ions under high-temperature conditions, moving freely between BC layers. Differences in superionic conduit lead to the diffusion in Be(BC) 2 driven by the vacancy mechanism. In contrast, the diffusion in Mg(BC) 2 and Ca(BC) 2 is jointly driven by both the vacancy and cooperative mechanisms. We demonstrate that the superionic transition temperature is controlled by the deficiency of mobile super-ions, tuning from 1300 to 1600 K, with up to 2.5% cation defects. With superior thermal stability, these two-dimensional compounds are promising electrolyte materials with ultrahigh heat resistivity capable of operating under high-temperature environments such as deep drills and aerospace devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is commonly chosen as a photocatalyst of PHE due to its non-toxicity, robust stability, and superior photocatalytic activity. However, the efficacy of TiO 2 is restricted by rapid electron–hole pair recombination, limited electron mobility, and sluggish surface reactions. To address these issues, we have synthesized a Ni–P alloy onto the surface of TiO 2 (Ni–P/TiO 2 ) using a safe and efficient photo-deposition method, thereby constructing a Schottky heterojunction photocatalyst. The construction of the heterojunction significantly reduces the recombination rates of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and enhances the charge transfer rates within the photocatalyst. Additionally, the incorporation of the Ni–P alloy increases the density of oxygen vacancies, providing abundant active sites for the reduction reaction. The metallic properties of the Ni–P alloy improve the overall light absorption capacity. As a result, Ni–P/TiO 2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic hydrogen production capability. When the mass ratio of the Ni–P alloy to TiO 2 is 12 wt. %, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches its maximum value at 1654.2 μ mol g −1 h −1 . Furthermore, density functional theory calculations substantiate that the formation of an internal electric field between the Ni–P alloy and TiO 2 facilitates electron migration and carrier separation. This investigation provides a promising strategy for constructing TiO 2 -based Schottky heterojunctions to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.},

Amorphous VO x thin films are grown by ALD employing tetrakis[ethylmethylamino]vanadium and ozone as precursors. Subsequent post-annealing of the as-grown VO x thin films at 500 °C in atmospheres of air, 1 Pa O 2 , and vacuum (10 −4 Pa) could, respectively, result in the crystallization of V 2 O 5 , VO 2 , and V 2 O 3 phases, as verified by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the valence states of vanadium in the annealed thin films exhibit dramatic changes with the variation of annealing atmosphere toward the targeted phases. The VO 2 thin film exhibits a sharp metal–insulator transition (MIT) near 340 K with a resistivity change exceeding three orders of magnitude. The V 2 O 3 thin film features a characteristic MIT with obvious thermal hysteresis between the cooling and warming processes, whereas the V 2 O 5 thin film is highly insulating. The spectral weight near the Fermi level revealed by the XPS in the valence band region coincides with the changes of VO x phases and consequent transport properties due to post-annealing. Our results demonstrate that the combination of ALD and post-annealing provides a facile method for the synthesis of multivalent VO x thin films for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The quantum Hall effect arises when electrons in a two-dimensional plane are subjected to a magnetic field, causing them to undergo cyclotron motion and form discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. These levels play a critical role in condensed matter physics. However, practical limitations of applying a magnetic field have led to the introduction of pseudomagnetic fields, which can similarly induce Landau levels. Such pseudomagnetic fields are typically generated through synthetic strain, achieved by deforming geometric patterns, and have been applied to systems like graphene, photons, and phonon crystals. Building on previous research in electronics and optics, we present a plasmonic metasurface that induces Landau levels via synthetic strain in the microwave frequency range. This strain is realized by printing metal structures of specific shapes on a dielectric substrate using printed circuit board technology. The fundamental unit of the plasmonic metasurface is a C 6 symmetric structure composed of six localized surface plasmon patches. By applying a displacement function along the transmission direction, we discretize the dispersion curve, leading to band degeneration and the emergence of edge states. The distribution of these edge states is influenced by the strength of the pseudomagnetic field, which is controlled by the magnitude of the displacement function. We validate our design through fabricated models and demonstrate the existence of edge states using near-field scanning experiments. Our work, which combines synthetic magnetic fields and plasmonic metasurface, provides valuable insights for the development and application of integrated photonic devices.},

Created using an inverse-design approach and grayscale lithography, the MDL achieves achromatic focusing, confirmed through hyperspectral point-spread function (PSF) characterization. Imaging experiments resolved spatial frequencies up to 181 lp/mm and demonstrated the MDL's capability in capturing high-quality, full-color images of the moon, sun, and distant terrestrial scenes. Color-enhanced lunar images revealed key geological features, while solar imaging identified visible sunspots. Additionally, the MDL was integrated with a refractive achromatic lens to form a hybrid telescope, significantly reducing weight for airborne and space-based imaging applications. Simulations and experimental results reported here underscore the potential of large-area achromatic flat lenses as lightweight alternatives to conventional refractive systems for astrophotography and other long-range imaging tasks.},

  abstract     = {Crude oil spill accidents cause extreme environmental damage, with huge economic costs that include the loss of oil resources. Despite the advances in conventional oil spill cleanup technology, such as dispersants, absorbents, and skimmers, there is still a need for more efficient solutions. In this study, we introduce a Joule-heated stearic acid/carbon nanotube-wrapped polyurethane sponge (SCPU) for rapid and all-weather recovery of leaked crude oil. SCPU is both hydrophobic and oleophilic and is electrically conductive. When 6 V were applied across the SCPU, the surface temperature increased to 146 °C within 70 s, which reduced the viscosity of crude oil and shortened the recovery time by over 99%. In addition, the Joule-heated SCPU can continuously recover crude oil floating on the water surface when connected to a peristaltic pump. This Joule-heated SCPU has a high crude oil adsorption capacity, a scalable preparation method, and is mechanically stable, and thus is expected to provide an efficient and practical solution for responding to crude oil spill accidents.},

An asymmetric electrode structure can effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs by introducing an internal electric field, thereby facilitating faster carrier transport and significantly reducing the response time. In this study, we utilized PdSe 2 , a semi-metal, as an electrode to construct an asymmetric electrode structure in conjunction with Ti–Au electrode, aiming to enhance the performance of Bi 2 O 2 Se NIR photodetectors. The response time of the PdSe 2 /Bi 2 O 2 Se/Ti–Au photodetector was 21 and 16 μ s under 1064 and 1550 nm light sources, respectively, with a responsivity of 121 mA/W at 1064 nm.

  abstract     = {Mode-locked lasers with narrow spectral bandwidths and high power spectral density are valuable for various applications that require selective and efficient light–matter interactions. However, mode-locked lasers in the mid-infrared (MIR) region so far face significant challenges in both narrowing the spectral width and expanding the tunable range. In this work, we demonstrate a Fourier transform-limited pulsed laser with ultra-narrow bandwidth by utilizing the frequency-modulated (FM) mode-locking technique in a Cr:ZnS laser. The proposed laser achieves a spectral width of ∼2 GHz (∼40 pm) and a pulse duration of ∼200 ps within a wide tunable range from 1966 to 2572 nm. By incorporating an etalon into the cavity, the spectral width is further narrowed to ∼500 MHz (∼8 pm), and the pulse duration is extended to ∼1 ns. We also find unique detuning characteristics of the FM mode-locked laser in that the narrowband mode-locked state is maintained over a large detuning frequency of ∼20 kHz, while its operating wavelength varies linearly with detuning. This property indicates a significantly better resistance to cavity length fluctuations compared to other active mode-locking schemes as well as a promising way to achieve precise wavelength fine-tuning through electronic control. The demonstrated laser, featuring an ultra-narrow spectral width at a desired mid-infrared wavelength, offers a powerful tool for high-resolution and high-sensitivity spectroscopy and coherent control of molecular vibrations.},

However, certain applications like THz endoscopes, strong-field THz near-field nonlinear optics, and THz high-power devices require a deep understanding of strong-field THz–matter interaction mechanisms. Therefore, improving the manipulation of strong-field THz coupling and propagation characteristics, particularly through the use of metal wire waveguides, is crucial. To this end, we systematically investigate the coupling and propagation characteristics of strong-field THz waves on the surface of tungsten wires and implement two effective coupling methods: two-wire coupling and crossover coupling. This allows for a propagation distance of up to 100 mm along the tungsten surface as THz surface waves. This effective control of strong-field THz waves using metal wires enables the guidance of THz waves from free space into transmission lines and waveguides, which holds significant value for various specific applications.},

Despite their promising applications in optical document security, they have been the subject of only a handful of research efforts, underscoring the need for further exploration in this area. Here, we propose a hybrid metasurface that achieves this functionality and thoroughly characterize its performance using simulations. In our device, nanohole arrays in an aluminum film function as plasmonic color filters for blue, green, and red channels with low crosstalk. Amorphous titanium dioxide (aTiO 2 ) nanopillars comprise the hologram metasurface, which modulates the outgoing light's phase to produce a holographic image. Due to the subwavelength dimensions of the unit cell of the color filter (e.g., 415 nm for red, 315 nm for green, and 255 nm for blue wavelengths) and metasurface hologram (e.g., 430 nm for red, 360 nm for green, and 305 nm for blue wavelengths), the color print and holographic images can have very high resolution. Simulations reveal that the metasurface can be perceived as a tricolor image under incoherent white light, whereas under illumination from red, green, and blue lasers, three distinct holographic images can be observed.},

High- Q Si photonic nanocavities with asymmetric claddings offer mechanical stability, high functionalities from heterogeneous materials, and vertical integration of optoelectronic devices. However, achieving a high Q factor in an asymmetric structure remains challenging because of the TE–TM coupling loss in the Si slab. To suppress the TE–TM coupling, we designed a high- Q two-dimensional (2D) Si photonic crystal slot cavity by significantly reducing the electric field components in the slab, leveraging a large dielectric discontinuity between Si and the low-index slot. We fabricated 2D Si photonic crystal slot nanocavities with asymmetric claddings consisting of a lower cladding of thermal oxide ( n lc = n BOX = 1.45) and an upper cladding of infiltrated spin-on glass ( n uc = n SOG = 1.3). The Q factor of this slot cavity is as high as 6.32 × 10 5 , which is the highest Q value ever recorded among nanocavities with asymmetric claddings. Our results are useful for heterogeneous integration of Si photonic crystal nanocavities with various functionalities such as active and nonlinear optical materials, which are unattainable in conventional Si photonics.},

However, despite its significance, research on large-scale defective systems has been hindered by the high computational cost associated with density functional theory (DFT). In this study, we propose HamGNN-Q, an E(3) equivariant graph neural network framework capable of accurately predicting DFT Hamiltonian matrices for diverse point defects with varying charges, utilizing a unified set of network weights. By incorporating background charge features into the element representation, HamGNN-Q facilitates a direct mapping from structural characteristics and background charges to the electronic Hamiltonian matrix of charged defect systems, obviating the need for DFT calculations. We showcase the model's high precision and transferability by evaluating its performance on GaAs systems encompassing diverse charged defect configurations. Furthermore, we predicted the wave function distribution of polarons induced by defects. We analyzed the node features through principal component analysis, providing physical insights for the interpretability of the HamGNN-Q model. Our approach provides a practical solution for accelerating electronic structure calculations of neutral and charged defects and advancing the design of materials with tailored electronic properties.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a versatile technique for measuring the in-plane thermal conductivity, in-plane thermal diffusivity, and volumetric heat capacity of nanoscale-thick films by means of lock-in thermography. The technique relies on the thermal analyses of imaged lock-in temperature distribution over the surface of films generated by an on-chip line heater. This enables simultaneous estimation of the properties for a free-standing membrane or multilayered thin films deposited on the membrane. We validate the usability of this technique by determining the thermophysical properties of Ni films with different nanoscale thicknesses. This technique also enables measurements under an external magnetic field, facilitating investigation of magneto-thermal transport properties. Thus, the proposed approach will be useful for exploring nanoscale thermal transport properties in thin films and thermal management systems.},

  abstract     = {Microstructure-enhanced discharges are critical for achieving higher plasma electron density and energy, offering significant potential in advanced plasma applications. A two-dimensional fluid model of pulsed dielectric barrier discharge was developed in atmospheric helium with a dielectric microhole. Two distinct high-electron-density regions, the T-region and L-region, were identified, driven, respectively, by transverse and longitudinal electric fields as the ionization wave traversed the microhole. The axisymmetric T-region is approached and squeezed as the radius decreases, in which the discharge intensity and electron density are enhanced. Based on the electron reaction source item, a virtual electrode is proposed in the dielectric microhole, which segregates the T- and L-regions. The width of the virtual electrode decreases with the microhole radius, and the virtual electrode extinguishes with the discharge ignition in the lower chamber and the formation of ionization wave in the dielectric microhole. These findings offer insights into plasma behavior in microstructures for advanced applications.},

We theoretically show that an experimentally feasible circuit model suppresses the residual ZZ coupling.

To validate the effectiveness of this process, we systematically characterize both resonators and qubits with suspended arrays of Josephson junctions, ultimately confirming the high quality of the superinductive elements. In addition, this process is broadly compatible with other types of superinductors and circuit designs.

However, these magnetometers suffer from a fundamental problem known as a “dead zone,” making them insensitive to certain magnetic field directions. Here, we demonstrate a simple experimental scheme for the dead-zone-free operation of a FID atomic magnetometer. Using a single laser beam containing equal strength of linear- and circular-polarization components and amplitude modulation at a low-duty cycle, we have synchronously pumped the rubidium ( 87 Rb) atoms with both first- and second-order frequency harmonics. Such a pumping scheme has enabled us to observe the free Larmor precession of atomic spins at a frequency of Ω L (orientation) and/or 2 Ω L (alignment) in a single FID signal, depending on the direction of the external magnetic field. We observed that the amplitude of the FID signal does not go to zero for any magnetic field direction, proving the absence of dead zones in the magnetometer. The magnetometer has a sensitivity in the range of 3.2–8.4 pT/ Hz in all directions. Our experimental scheme can be crucial in developing miniaturized atomic magnetometers for various practical applications, including geomagnetic applications.},

  abstract     = {The transfer of quantum entangled states is of fundamental interest in quantum physics and plays an important role in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and quantum technology. Here, we propose a scheme to transfer quantum entangled states of two photonic qubits by utilizing four microwave cavities coupled to a superconducting qutrit (a three-level quantum system). The photonic qubits are encoded using two orthogonal eigenstates of the photon-number parity operator with eigenvalues ± 1, which allows for various encodings for the photonic qubits. The employment of four cavities at distinct frequencies effectively reduces the inter-cavity crosstalk. The utilization of only a single superconducting qutrit as the coupler significantly reduces the circuit resources. The entanglement transfer can be completed in just one step, making this scheme remarkably efficient. During the state transfer process, the third energy level of the coupler qutrit remains unoccupied, and thus decoherence from this level is diminished. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that within current circuit quantum electrodynamics technology, one can achieve high-fidelity transfer of the entangled states of two photonic qubits encoded via squeezed vacuum states and cat states. Our scheme possesses generality and can be applied to accomplish the same task in a variety of physical systems.},

Here, by modifying the space-confined vacuum heating method, we synthesized high quantum yield CDs with increased size and improved absorption cross section (up to 2.7 times greater than the smaller counterparts), which was elucidated by the size-dominated non-resonant absorption mechanism. The enhanced absorptivity at reduced concentration was demonstrated to mitigate aggregation-induced quenching effectively. Furthermore, we designed a multi-film coating structure to block and recycle the transmitted harmful ultraviolet and short-wavelength blue light through optical interference, thereby fully exploiting this ‘useless’ waveband. By optimizing both the CD absorption cross section and the blue light recycling, the fabricated 80 × 80 × 2.5 mm 3 LSC device achieved a record-high external optical efficiency of 9.6%, while still maintaining 71% average visible transmittance.

Due to the simultaneously strengthened effective mass by inducing resonant levels nearby the Fermi level and decreased carrier concentration, a considerably improved Seebeck coefficient is obtained in In-doped PbSnGeTe 3 and thereby the greatly increased power factor. The decreased carrier concentrations resulting from In substitution can also suppress the electronic thermal conductivity for a decreased thermal conductivity. The enhanced power factor and reduced thermal conductivity finally contribute to an extraordinarily high average ZT of 0.93 between 300 and 773 K in PbSnGeTe 3 .

In this Letter, trace doping of the rare earth element Yb in a Pb 0.95 Na 0.04 Te matrix effectively regulates charge carriers by competing with cation vacancies. This mechanism optimizes carrier concentration and phonon scattering, resulting in a high power factor of ∼27 μ W cm −1 K −2 and a low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.42 W m −1 K −1 at 823 K in Pb 0.94 Na 0.04 Yb 0.01 Te. First-principles calculations reveal that Yb doping induces local lattice distortions in PbTe, potentially forming pseudo-nanostructures in localized regions. This strategy leads to a peak zT of ∼2.4 at 823 K and an average zT of ∼1.4 from 303 to 823 K in Pb 0.94 Na 0.04 Yb 0.01 Te. Our findings suggest that the competition between dopant cations and cation vacancies reduces thermal conductivity via local lattice distortions while simultaneously improving electrical conductivity at high temperatures.

The spatial matrix representation is modeled as the sum of a negative exponential matrix, which represents the single scattering component, and a Gaussian matrix, which represents the multiple scattering component. The Marchenko–Pastur distribution and the Tracy–Widom distribution are employed in conjunction to calculate the moments of the single and multiple scattering components. The single-frame statistical gating method is validated using an electric field Monte Carlo simulation and demonstrated in vivo in brain imaging. Based on rotational invariance, a rotational sampling strategy is proposed to significantly improve the imaging quality of the single-frame statistical gating method.

  abstract     = {Gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ), with its ultra-wide bandgap (>4.5 eV), is a key material for the next-generation power electronics due to its high breakdown voltage and efficient power-switching capabilities. Multifinger (MF) Ga 2 O 3 MOSFETS, designed to enhance current handling and thermal management, experience significant self-heating effects that can lead to localized hotspots, thermal runaway, and reduced device reliability. Accurate thermal characterization is therefore critical to ensure the reliable operation and longevity of such devices. Conventional methods, such as thermoreflectance imaging, Raman thermometry, and infrared thermography, are limited by complex setups, slow response times, resolution constraints, and cost, making them less practical for real-time, on-chip applications. On-chip thermal characterization directly at the active regions of the device provides an unparalleled opportunity to overcome these limitations by capturing localized temperature variations during operation. In this study, we demonstrate the integration of micro-thin film thermocouples (micro-TFTCs) onto multifinger Ga 2 O 3 MOSFETs for precise, real-time, and localized thermal monitoring. The sensors captured temperature variations across different gate fingers, with the measured maximum channel temperature reaching 40.5 °C under peak power dissipation. Predicted thermal behavior under high power densities shows temperatures rising to approximately 80 °C at 5 W/mm 2 , illustrating the thermal challenges faced by Ga 2 O 3 devices. This work demonstrates that micro-TFTCs are not only compatible with complex device architectures but also highly effective for localized thermal characterization, making them a promising tool for improving the thermal management and reliability of Ga 2 O 3 -based power electronics.},

  abstract     = {Photodetectors with high integration and detectivity are in great demand for the development of wearable and flexible electronic devices. However, the limited photoelectric conversion efficiency at low film thickness has significantly hindered further applications for both traditional semiconductors and newly emerged perovskite materials. In this study, we have incorporated a biomimetic nanostructure inspired by the lotus leaf onto the perovskite active layer using a modified two-step room temperature low-pressure nanoimprinting technique. This approach has greatly improved the quality of the perovskite material during the spatially limited crystallization process. By incorporating a biomimetic optical nanostructure, we have achieved a synergistic effect between enhanced scattering and local surface plasmon resonances, leading to a significant improvement in incident light utilization efficiency. With the incorporation of this biomimetic nanostructure, we observed a remarkable enhancement of 1100% in photogenerated current and 39.6% in response speed. This strategy provides a viable approach for designing high-efficiency ultra-thin photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the wide tuning range, high-temperature stability, flexible design, and fast recovery dynamics, quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used in many research fields, such as lasers, photodetectors, solar cells, and displays. Among these, III–V InAs/GaAs QDs are especially suited for infrared optoelectronic applications due to their strong working stability and enhanced light output efficiency. The doping technique has been admitted as a very effective method to enhance the modal gain and temperature insensitivity for InAs/GaAs QDs-based devices. Additionally, doping could modulate critical optical responses, like light absorption and carrier recovery dynamics, making these QDs ideal for ultrafast applications. In this work, p-type (Be) doping and n-type (Si) doping were introduced into multilayer QDs to mitigate the adverse effects of grown-in interface states, which were verified by temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) characterization. The results show a significant increase in PL intensity for n-doped samples, which was attributed to the effective suppression of interface states. This enhancement correlates with doping levels, with PL intensity increasing from 1.71 to 2.72 times as Si concentration rises from 1 × 10 18 /cm 3 to 3 × 10 18 /cm 3 . In contrast, p-doped samples show a slight decrease in PL intensity and a 20 nm blueshift in PL emission peak, indicating different interdiffusion behaviors between In and Ga atoms compared to that in n-doped ones. By integrating with distributed Bragg mirrors, QD semiconductor saturable absorption mirrors were developed, where n-doped QDs presented superior performance in mode-locked ultrafast lasers with the shortest pulse width and highest output power.},

Monitoring these properties is essential when, e.g., engineering micro-mechanical devices. Established methods such as wafer bending and bulge testing provide only average values for the entire wafer or impose constraints on the sample fabrication process. Therefore, a method to efficiently characterize mechanical properties locally with simple sample fabrication is desirable. In this study, we determine the stress in direct-current magnetron-sputtered aluminum nitride films on prefabricated silicon nitride membranes by measuring the fundamental eigenfrequencies of the membranes and combining it with mechanical band structure simulations. We find that the stress, which is directly related to the strain, transitions from compressive to tensile as a function of the film thickness. Our simple and robust method allows in situ measurements that are compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques of, e.g., hybrid photonic circuits and can probe the stress locally over the chip.},

In this study, we employ a dual-mechanism approach by designing an organic electrolyte gate-selected memtransistor (OESmT) to reliably and rapidly update synaptic weights in both directions. The switching between synaptic inhibition and excitation depends on the connection state of the gate (modulation terminal), which can be either grounded or floating. This switching mechanism is driven by the dynamics between the electric-double-layer (EDL) and charge-trapping effects, resulting from the antagonistic effect of the two mechanisms. Long-term synaptic plasticity in both directions is demonstrated. The reconfigurable characteristic of the OESmT remains stable for 5000 pulses applied. Besides, the device has been applied to the autonomously guided vehicle.

Moreover, the forward-bias currents of the μ LEDs are examined using the extracted ideality factor to examine the impacts of sidewall defects. The results show that sidewall treatments are highly effective for suppression of leakage currents. From the efficiency perspective, higher wall-plug efficiency (WPE) than external quantum efficiency (EQE) is observed when the operating voltage is lower than the photon voltage in both blue and green 20 × 20 μ m 2 devices. This enhancement of the WPE over the EQE is due to the suppression of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) nonradiative recombination. These observations indicate that μ LEDs with sidewall treatments not only improve optical performance but also further enhance the electrical performance of devices by suppressing the leakage current paths due to SRH nonradiative recombination processes.},

This methodology facilitates the fabrication of a wearable wavy structure TEG with an impressive stretchability of up to 300%. The effect of the geometric parameters of the wavy structure on TEG performance is explored. The designed TEG with three p–n pairs (TEG-3pn) achieves an open-circuit voltage output of 50.46 mV at a temperature difference of 60 K. Demonstrations of thermal energy harvesting from the human wrist and a hot water cup underscored the TEG's efficient exploitation of vertical temperature gradients and its versatility for diverse applications.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism behind the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (hole gas) on the surface and interlayer directional charge transfer process of polar quintuple-layers (QLs)-Al 2 O 3 through first-principles calculations. The accumulated polarized electric field acts as the thermodynamic driving force for directional charge transfer between QL-Al 2 O 3 layers, involving all Al and O atoms in the charge transfer process. However, the point defects in 2QLs-Al 2 O 3 , including different effective charge, significantly influence the dynamic process of directional interlayer charge transfer.

Experimental results attribute this EQE enhancement to improved light-extraction efficiency, driven by better current spreading. In larger micro-LEDs, pronounced current crowding causes carrier overflow from the active region, leading to reduced EQE at high current densities.

  abstract     = {One of the well-established and significant applications of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is in solid-state neutron detectors, which necessitate the development of quasi-bulk h-BN crystals. To advance the material and device development of h-BN, it is essential to characterize its bulk electrical transport properties. However, this task is challenging due to h-BN's ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) of approximately 6.1 eV, which results in an extremely high electrical resistivity, typically exceeding 10 12 Ω⋅cm. On the other hand, the mobility-lifetime (μτ) product, a key figure of merit for determining the overall device performance, is more readily accessible through the characterization of the I-V characteristics under illumination. In this study, we investigate the in-plane μτ products of lateral devices fabricated from freestanding quasi-bulk h-BN wafers synthesized by hydride vapor phase epitaxy. Our results reveal an unexpected decrease in the in-plane μτ product as the device width decreases. Utilizing a simple two-region carrier transport model, where the central region of the device represents the bulk h-BN material free from metal contacts and the two edge regions are influenced by metal contacts, we demonstrate that the μτ product in the edge areas covered by metal contacts decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to the bulk value. We attribute this significant reduction in μτ product to the layered crystalline structure of h-BN, which permits metal atoms to infiltrate into the interlayer spacings. As a result, the measured μτ product is significantly lower than the true bulk value. These findings provide valuable insights into the design and fabrication of high-performance h-BN devices, which typically leverage its exceptional in-plane transport properties.},

Thus, understanding the modulation of ferroelectric properties in two-dimensional ferroelectric materials is essential for their efficient nanoscale applications. NbOI 2 , a recently confirmed van der Waals ferroelectric, offers an ideal platform for investigating in-plane spontaneous polarization at the nanoscale. We explored the influence of laser excitation on the ferroelectric polarization properties of NbOI 2 . In multilayer NbOI 2 devices with in-plane configurations, no significant current signals were detected along the c-axis or b-axis (the ferroelectric polarization axis) in the absence of illumination. However, under laser excitation, the material exhibited clear hysteresis loop behavior along both the c-axis and b-axis, indicating that laser excitation effectively reduces the coercive voltage. Furthermore, at the same excitation wavelength, the current peak along the c-axis was larger, with more pronounced hysteresis loops. Our experimental findings demonstrate that laser excitation can lower the coercive field in multilayer NbOI 2 and induce different electrical hysteresis behavior along different crystallographic orientations, providing valuable insights for the development of NbOI 2 -based optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been the subject of numerous research efforts in the last decade. Of particular interest is the creation of optically active defects in hBN because of their easy integration, e.g., in van der Waals heterostructures, and their room temperature photon emission. Many methods to create such defects in hBN are still under investigation. In this work, we present our approach to creating single defect emitters in hBN using remote plasma with different plasma species and report on the outcome statistically. We have used argon, nitrogen, and oxygen plasmas and report statistics on the emitters, produced by the different gas species and their optical properties. In particular, we examine the emission of the exfoliated flakes before and after the plasma processes without an annealing step to avoid creating emitters that are not caused by the plasma exposure. Our findings suggest that the purely physical argon plasma treatment is the most promising route for creating optically active defect emitters in hBN by plasma exposure.},

Interlayer interactions enable desirable functionalities, and manipulating these interactions is essential for optimizing device performance. In this work, we introduce ozone intercalation into vdW heterostructures and adopt laser irradiation as a manipulation tool, creating a photoluminescence (PL)-based modulation type using interface engineering. Interlayer engineering can be quantitatively achieved by precisely controlling the laser modification time, enabling a controllable PL intensity from no quenching to quenching. The mechanism behind this regulation can be attributed to the interlayer exciton suppression introduced by ozone intercalation being repaired by ozone molecule reduction during the laser treatment. This effective regulatory technique is universal and can be achieved in various type II band-aligned TMD heterostructures, providing an intriguing strategy for the design of two-dimensional vdW TMD device systems.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed from transition metal dichalcogenidess provide an ideal platform for exploring various quasiparticle behaviors, with trion—composed of neutral exciton and charged carrier—being a notable example. There are typically three methods to generate trion: electrical doping, chemical doping, and direct optical doping. The first two methods generate static trion, while the last gives rise to transient trion. Here, we present an indirect optical doping approach to generate transient trion via ultrafast charge transfer (CT) and achieve control over the trion-to-exciton ratio by adjusting CT in Gr/MoS 2 heterostructure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dynamics of the transient trion generated with this method, which shows slightly longer lifetime than that of exciton accounted for the Coulomb interactions between trion and charged defect. This study provides fresh perspectives on the construction of desired quasiparticles, dynamical characterization, and the control of the many-body interaction in two-dimensional structure.},

  abstract     = {The (1 − x)(Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 )TiO 3 -xBaTiO 3 (BNT-BT) system has attracted a great deal of interest because it presents a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases for 0.05 < x < 0.08. Identifying the MPB in the BNT-BT system often results in materials exhibiting a high-symmetry (pseudo)cubic x-ray diffraction pattern. However, this singular composition exhibits ferroelectricity, which has been explained as a consequence of a field-induce phase transformation. Here, we demonstrate that the stress release after poling, from the virgin state of the sample, is a crucial phenomenon to obtain piezoelectric response in MPB BNT-BT. The mechanism behind the unusual poling–depoling process in piezoceramics exhibiting high-symmetry MPB is elucidated by combining x-ray diffraction measurements and advanced Raman spectroscopy. This underscores the importance of post-poling stress release from the virgin state as a critical factor in attaining piezoelectric response in lead-free piezoceramics with high-symmetry MPB configurations.},

In this study, we present relaxor ferroelectric terpolymers with an increased gamma ( γ )-phase content, prepared through a facile and scalable interfacial engineering approach that incorporates ultra-low amounts of graphene oxide. The γ -phase crystals in the terpolymer reduce hysteresis losses and generate numerous deep traps, resulting in enhanced performance. These terpolymers achieve a high energy density of up to 15.2 J/cm 3 and an improved breakdown strength of 562 MV/m, representing enhancements of 62% and 39.8%, respectively, compared to the pristine terpolymer.

  abstract     = {Dynamic spectroscopies in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) are critical for probing material properties, such as force interactions, mechanical properties, polarization switching, electrochemical reactions, and ionic dynamics. However, the practical implementation of these measurements is constrained by the need to balance imaging time and data quality. Signal to noise requirements favor long acquisition times and high frequencies to improve signal fidelity. However, these are limited on the low end by contact resonant frequency and photodiode sensitivity and on the high end by the time needed to acquire high-resolution spectra or the propensity for sample degradation under high field excitation over long times. The interdependence of key parameters such as instrument settings, acquisition times, and sampling rates makes manual tuning labor-intensive and highly dependent on user expertise, often yielding operator-dependent results. These limitations are prominent in techniques like dual amplitude resonance tracking in piezoresponse force microscopy that utilize multiple concurrent feedback loops for topography and resonance frequency tracking. Here, a reward-driven workflow is proposed that automates the tuning process, adapting experimental conditions in real time to optimize data quality. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and time required for manual adjustments and can be extended to other SPM spectroscopic methods, enhancing overall efficiency and reproducibility.},

The change in the spectral response is due to the decrease in the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift, and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysterically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.},

In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. The largest MR can reach 27% at 10 K and 9 T. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. It was found that the nonlinearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration ranges from 10 18 to 10 21 cm −3 , with a high mobility up to ∼3 × 10 3 cm 2 /V s below 50 K. These indicate that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.},

The ability to switch between skyrmions and bimerons is considered to be important for developing future computing architectures based on multiple different topological bits. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that the FeSnN 3 monolayer with a polar structure is a 2D ferromagnetic half-metal, exhibiting an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.181 meV, a high Curie temperature T C of 510 K, and a substantial DMI of 2.96 meV. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the DMI-induced skyrmions in the FeSnN 3 monolayer can persist above room temperature under feasible magnetic fields. Notably, skyrmion-bimeron switching can be achieved by altering the direction of the external magnetic field. Our findings not only suggest that the FeSnN 3 monolayer is a promising candidate for developing spintronic devices based on topological spin textures but also provide alternative insights into skyrmion-bimeron switching through magnetic field.},

To be precise, we construct a two-leg ladder composed of acoustic resonators and linking tubes. Utilizing the concept of pseudospin, the spin- 1 / 2 is encoded by the leg degree of freedom of the ladder, and meanwhile, the SOCs are achieved by engineering the couplings between resonators. We further highlight the emergence of the symmetry-protected topological phase respecting the chiral unitary (AIII) symmetry in such acoustic SOC lattices. This scheme is confirmed by the full-wave simulations. Our acoustic structure is within immediate experimental reach and enables the direct visualization of symmetry-protected topological boundary states, not yet been observed experimentally. Our results represent a route to synthesize the SOCs and will benefit an in-depth study of the spin–orbit physics in acoustics.},

  abstract     = {Periodic moiré superlattice structures in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) heterostructures exhibit nanoscale tunable electronic and optical properties. Much effort has been devoted to understand the twist-angle-dependent optical properties of the TMDs heterostructures. Therefore, quickly determining the stacking angle of TMDs and constructing the desired moiré superlattice structure is crucial. Here, we investigate the twist-angle-dependent optical properties of WS 2 /MoSe 2 , finding that the out-of-plane Raman mode is a reliable marker for determining the stacking angle. The interlayer exciton energy, being close to that of MoSe 2 excitons, is highly sensitive to material quality and fabrication, making it unsuitable for identifying the stacking angle. In contrast, the out-of-plane Raman peaks of WS 2 and MoSe 2 are more sensitive to changes in the stacking angle. The out-of-plane Raman mode of WS 2 is enhanced more than fivefold in near 0° or 60° WS 2 /MoSe 2 heterostructures, while the out-of-plane mode of MoSe 2 is only significantly decreased in near 0° heterostructures. Combining the intensity of out-of-plane Raman mode of WS 2 and MoSe 2 , near 0° and 60° heterostructures can be distinguished without the need for complex optical characterizations. These typical peaks offer researchers an efficient way to construct the desired moiré superlattice structures.},

Thermally annealing the samples decreased the EPR signal, with the critical temperature to quench the EPR signal being larger in the lower Al-content sample.

  abstract     = {Despite its promise, growing a quasi-freestanding monolayer of germanene with Dirac cone signature remains a significant attention. Synthesizing germanene on semiconductor surfaces is highly desirable to preserve its linear energy dispersion near the K points, which has been experimentally challenging. Here, we report the molecular beam epitaxy of monolayer germanene on semiconducting Cu 2 Te supported by Cu(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM) revealed a low-buckled honeycomb lattice of germanene, exhibiting an intrinsic Dirac cone at the K point. By combining STM measurements with theoretical simulations, we confirm that germanene atoms occupy threefold hollow sites on Cu 2 Te via van der Waals interaction. Remarkably, by dI/dV spectra fitting, we find the prepared germanene owns the Fermi velocity of (6.9 ± 0.1) × 10 5 m/s, which is slightly higher than the density functional theory calculated 4.6 × 10 5 m/s with considering the dielectric constant of the underlying Cu 2 Te, implying the weak coupling of germanene with the substrate. This work provides a platform for further exploring the ballistic charge transport properties of germanene with a Dirac cone.},

Compared to lithium niobate, the most widely used nonlinear optical material, wurtzite AlScN, offers advantages in nano-photonic devices due to its compatibility with integrated circuits. We perform detailed first-principles calculations to investigate the electro-optic effect in Al 1 − x Sc x N alloys and superlattices. At elevated Sc concentrations in alloys, the EO coefficients increase; importantly, we find that cation ordering along the c axis leads to enhanced EO response. Strain engineering can be used to further manipulate the EO coefficients of AlScN films. With applied in-plane strains, the piezoelectric contributions to the EO coefficients increase dramatically, even exceeding 250 pm/V. We also explore the possibility of EO enhancement through superlattice engineering, finding that nonpolar a -plane ( AlN ) m / ( ScN ) n superlattices increase EO coefficients beyond 40 pm/V. Our findings provide design principles to enhance the electro-optic effect through alloy engineering and heterostructure architecture.},

This present study introduces a thin-walled circular tube (TWCT) structure, characterized by a pronounced twisting angle of up to 59.5°, achieved only through a single-layer TWCT configuration. We demonstrate a significant compression-torsion coupling phenomenon, surpassing the findings of previous research endeavors. TWCT's deformation mechanism is harnessed in optical imaging through the integration of experimental, theoretical, and finite element approaches. The information stored in TWCT can be gradually projected through optical imaging when the elastic strain stimulates TWCT. These findings presented herein introduces a straightforward and valid approach to employ TWCT as a reliable mechanical switch for optical imaging, thereby showcasing its potential in the fields of cryptographic techniques, information storage, and transmission via optical imaging.},

In this study, we investigate the dynamics of Gaussian wave packets at time interfaces within one-dimensional lattice models, providing insights into generalized temporal refraction and dispersion control. By redefining time reflection as temporal negative refraction, we propose a generalized temporal Snell's law based on the equivalent refractive index, which effectively predicts both temporal positive and negative refraction. Furthermore, we introduce a “temporal uniaxial crystal” by extending our investigation to a three-band model without symmetry constraints, characterized by double temporal positive and negative refraction. Our approach not only deepens the understanding of time refraction but also offers a versatile tool for studying complex wave behaviors in time-variant systems.},

The enhancement in controllability, flexibility, and simplicity of droplet manipulation is sustainably demanded and developed. Herein, we create a unique droplet manipulation method by modulating wettability based on surface charges. With contactless charge deposition on tilting dielectric surfaces with the corona discharge generated by needle-plate electrodes, droplet sliding can be actuated in real time. Droplets show wettability enhancement after eliminating charge deposition, in which contact angle decreases reach up to ∼20°. The presented surface-charge-modulated wettability results in fast-speed (∼14 mm/s) and high-volume-range (10–80 μ L) droplet manipulation. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal the underlying mechanism of droplet actuation is surface charge gradients, which induce asymmetric electrostatic forces. Controlling charge distributions on dielectric surfaces with plate-electrode patterns, programmable, and reconfigurable droplet sliding along complex pathways can be achieved. Moreover, a droplet sliding value for controlling stepwise chemical reactions is demonstrated by moving plate electrodes.},

The unique architecture of the CF network realizes the coexistence of both ∼800-nm low-spatial frequency LIPSS (LSFL) and ∼100-nm high-spatial frequency LIPSS (HSFL) overlapping on the same fiber surface. It is suggested that LSFL formed through the interference with Fresnel diffraction patterns projected by the fiber edges, while HSFL formed through LSFL-splitting assisted by surface plasmons. Moreover, the fundamentally different formation mechanisms of the two types result in distinctively different LIPSS orientations, where the LSFL is structure-dependent and self-orients according to the fiber propagation direction, while the HSFL is structure-independent and self-orients perpendicularly to the polarization direction of the incident pulses. The findings not only introduce an optical approach to prepare nano-textured carbon materials for future energy and regenerative-medicine applications but also reveal important insights into the underlying formation mechanisms of LIPSS on complex three-dimensional surfaces.},

As such the radial quantum well configuration presents a unique advantage for the realization of intraband absorption of normal-incidence light in the nanowires, which cannot be achieved in conventional planar quantum well structures due to polarization selection rules. We report here mid-infrared intraband transitions within the atmospheric window (3–5 μ m) in InP nanowire arrays embedded with five InGaAs quantum wells under normal-incidence light. The light absorption coefficient of the quantum wells is modeled, and the absorption peak indicates a bound-to-continuum transition. The intraband photocurrent shows a linear dependence on the incident power, while the interband photoresponse is sublinear due to the surface states of the nanowires. These nanowires with radial quantum wells open up great opportunities for developing next-generation mid- to long-wavelength infrared photodetectors and focal plane arrays.},

The theoretical analyses verify that the wavelength-insensitive PTE response of Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 comes from the nearly same trend of its wavelength-dependent optical refractive index and extinction coefficient, and the best PTE performance of 4%-Se doped Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 is attributed to the largest product of Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity.

It employs only eight illumination patterns trained by the digital neural network to convolve the object from two-dimensional images into only eight intensity values measured by a single-pixel detector, achieving a 93.8% accuracy rate in handwritten digit recognition. Our work therefore paves an image-free way for metasurface-based object recognition using only a single-pixel detector, which exhibits its powerful information compression and accurate extraction capabilities coupled with a compact structural design.},

In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path toward a QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb) 2 Te 3 systems.

It is characterized by its applicability to the wider laser energy range, covering laser-induced breakdown to significant plasma shielding and spectral lines undergoing self-absorption, outperforming the widely used physical linear or multivariate data-driven normalization methods. The home-made end-to-end LAP-RTE codes serve as the benchmark to validate the physical reciprocal-logarithmic transformation and its extensibility to self-absorption spectral lines for PIGAs. Next, experimental spectral lines are statistically used to validate PIGAs' correction effects; the median RSDs of spectral intensities can be effectively reduced by 85% (corrected by P ) and 88% (corrected by T shock ) for 108 Fe I lines, while for 33 Fe II lines, reduced by 77% (corrected by P ) and 86% (corrected by T shock ). Seventeen self-absorption lines are also corrected effectively, with RSDs being reduced by 78% (corrected by P ) and 89% (corrected by T shock ). Our proposed idea of combining optimization methods to quantify unknown parameters in normalization strategies can also be extended to excavate the correlation between parameters for other low-temperature plasma fields with similar processes.},

However, traditional optical sorting methods often rely on external equipment, such as microfluidic devices. In this Letter, we proposed a phase-gradient force-based optical array sorting (POAS) scheme, which achieves the accurate transporting and sorting of the particles by regulating the phase-gradient force based on the physical characteristics of the particles. The method combines the function of particle transporting and sorting, eliminating the need for external auxiliary equipment. Based on the POAS scheme, we used the complex amplitude beam shaping algorithms to design a 1 × 2 array sorting beam with the controllable phase-gradient forces. The array sorting beam was used to experimentally sort two kinds of particles with different sizes, and the particles are first transported and then precisely sorted at the designated sorting nodes. All the parameters of the sorting beam were adjustable, which greatly enhances the flexibility and scalability of the optical sorting technology. This study provides an alternative scheme for the high-throughput particle sorting, which can be easily integrated into the optical sorting chips for applications in medical detection and drug delivery.},

This study introduces a multi-physics concept by investigating the impact of highly localized mechanical stress in electrically sensitive regions, such as the gate in a transistor. Our hypothesis is that reducing mechanical stress beneath the gate will decrease voltage transients caused by SEE by limiting charge generation and diffusion. To explore this electro-mechanical coupling in relation to SEE, we milled a microscale trench in the substrate beneath a transistor of the LM124 operational amplifier using a focused ion beam, thereby alleviating mechanical stress in the vicinity of the trench. We then perform pulsed laser SEE testing on the stress-relieved transistor and a control specimen without a micro-trench modification. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant decrease in single event transient peak amplitude and collected charge in the stress-relieved device compared to its pristine counterpart under identical pulsed laser conditions. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that mitigating mechanical stress localizations could inform the design and fabrication of radiation-hardened electronics.},

Breaking of the hexagonal symmetry in graphene can disrupt its π -conjugated system, thus increasing the surface reactivity. Here, by employing first-principles calculations, we predict a 2D carbon allotrope (called QH-graphene), which exhibits remarkable stability across the dynamic, thermal, and mechanical aspects. It has several advantages as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), including a high theoretical capacity (1116.7 mA h g −1 ), a moderate Na migration barrier (0.35–0.60 eV), a suitable average open-circuit voltage (0.55 V), and a small change in lattice parameters (∼3%). When contacted with electrolyte solvents, the Na adsorption and diffusion capabilities are enhanced. Moreover, introducing a monovacancy defect in QH-graphene improves the adsorption strength of Na but reduces its mobility. Compared with single-layer QH-graphene, QH-graphene bilayer has a stronger binding affinity for Na while maintaining rapid ion diffusion on its exterior surface.},

Herein, alkylamine-tuned MoO x with synergistic manipulation of interlayer spacing and oxygen vacancies as a bifunctional mediator for separator modification (refer to as MOC/PP) in Li–S batteries is proposed. The increased interlayer spacing provides a rapid and stable pathway for Li + diffusion, facilitating uniform Li + deposition on lithium anode. Rich oxygen vacancies serve as active sites for efficient chemisorption and catalysis with polysulfide. As demonstrated by theoretical calculations and experimental results successively, MOC/PP efficiently captures and accelerates the redox reaction of polysulfide. Therefore, LiǁLi symmetric cells with MOC/PP exhibit stable cycling over 1000 h at a current density of 1 mA cm −2 . The full cells deliver a notable discharge-specific capacity of 602 mAh g −1 at 5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g −1 ) and maintain stable cycling for 800 cycles at 1 C, with 0.07% capacity decay per cycle.

In this work, we report an LMPs (liquid metal particles)/MXene/AgNWs strain sensor (LMA strain sensor) with high sensitivity (GF = 6.339), high linearity (R 2 = 0.982 24), and low hysteresis (0.452%). In this process, AgNWs act as a bridge between the MXene nanosheets, and the change in contact area of the MXene nanosheets under stretching endows the sensor with high sensitivity. The aggregated LMPs function as a structural framework, capitalizing on their intrinsic fluidic characteristics to serve as an adhesive between silver nanowires (AgNWs) and MXene nanosheets. This approach effectively minimizes the interstitial spaces between AgNWs and MXene. The formation of Ti-O → Ga 3+ coordination bonds between MXene nanosheets and LMPs has strengthened the interfacial interactions. Consequently, the sensor demonstrates superior linearity and low hysteresis. In addition, a sensitive layer with a buckled structure is obtained by stretch-release. The buckled structure inhibits inhomogeneous and irreversible connection losses of the sensitive material, further improving the sensor's mechanical durability. LMA strain sensors can accurately detect various human activities such as breathing detection, motion detection, and expression detection. This work will provide an avenue for developing high-performance strain sensors.},

  abstract     = {Meeting the advanced demands of display technology, developing oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) with high mobility remains a significant challenge in current research. This paper reports the fabrication of high-crystallinity In 2 O 3 thin films and high-mobility TFT devices through low-temperature annealing using aluminum (Al) and tantalum (Ta) for induced crystallization. In the control film, partial crystallization occurs only in the central region, with grain lateral dimensions around 50 nm, resulting in a reasonable field-effect mobility of 23.9 cm 2 /V s for the corresponding TFTs. In contrast, metal-induced films form In 2 O 3 grains with lateral dimensions exceeding 100 nm, along with numerous spherical crystalline particles at the metal/In 2 O 3 interface. The well-defined front-channel structure allows the Al- and Ta-induced In 2 O 3 TFTs to achieve high field-effect mobilities of 65.2 and 101.0 cm 2 /V s, respectively. Additionally, Al induction improves the subthreshold swing and threshold voltage (V th ), enhancing overall electrical performance. This study investigates the crystallization behavior of induced technology in the In 2 O 3 system, elucidates the mechanism of metal-induced crystallization, and demonstrates that Al-induced crystallization significantly enhances the performance of metal oxide TFTs under processing temperature constraints.},

This lightweight metamaterial features a unique 3D four-way braided structure combined with Dirac semimetals. Static analysis reveals that AlCuFe quasicrystals significantly enhance mechanical properties, with a Young's modulus reaching 38 GPa in the z direction and 18 GPa in the x and y directions at 40% fiber content and a 30° weaving angle. Frequency domain simulations show a high average absorption rate of 83.4% in the 3–12 μ m range, primarily due to internal electromagnetic coupling. The study further reveals that the electromagnetic properties of the WCM are closely related to fiber content and weaving angle. As a lightweight optical material, the WCM shows strong application potential in fields such as aerospace and electromagnetic countermeasures.},

The resulting devices exhibited exceptional electrical characteristics, including an ultrahigh field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) of approximately 147.5 ± 16.6 cm 2 /V s, subthreshold swing of 103.7 ± 9.1 mV/dec, and threshold voltage ( V TH ) of 0.5 ± 0.1 V. These enhancement-mode devices represent increases of more than threefold in μ FE compared to devices without an amorphous passivation layer. This is despite all the fabrication processes being identical, except for the introduction of the Al 2 O 3 interfacial layer. This improvement can be primarily attributed to the reduced electron scattering through suppressed remote Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the In 2 O 3 TFTs exhibited enhanced operational stability, showing minimal V TH shifts of 0.15 and −0.01 V under positive and negative bias-stress conditions, respectively. The findings of this study emphasize the critical role of the surface passivation of polycrystalline HfO 2 dielectrics in improving the electrical performance of ultrathin In 2 O 3 TFTs.},

  abstract     = {The observation of superconductivity in antiperovskite Sr 3 SnO crystals has sparked significant interest in understanding its underlying mechanism and fabricating them in thin film forms. To date, molecular beam epitaxy has been used to prepare Sr 3 SnO thin films, but superconductivity has not been observed. Sr deficiency and subsequent hole doping have been suggested as crucial for the emergent superconductivity, but difficulty in sample preparation due to high chemical instability of this material system has posed challenges for systematic and extensive studies. In this study, we report the fabrication of Sr 3 SnO thin films through co-sputtering of Sr and SnO 2 and investigate the stoichiometry effect on the structural properties of Sr 3 SnO thin films using a combinatorial approach. A single Sr 3 SnO phase is observed over a wide range of off-stoichiometric Sr/Sn ratio regions, with preferred orientation changing depending on the Sr/Sn ratio. The formation of intermetallic Sr–Sn compounds in highly Sr-deficient regions suggests the need for careful consideration in elucidating the origin of superconductivity. The single orientation along the [002] direction and lattice parameter change due to biaxial strain applied by using a LAO substrate are indicative of the possible epitaxial growth of antiperovskite oxides using sputtering. Our experimental approach and findings pave the way for high-throughput preparation and characterization of antiperovskite oxides, thus encouraging research on antiperovskite oxides as well as other exotic materials involving highly reactive elements.},

  abstract     = {Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), an emergent two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor, represents the ultimate thickness for scaling down channel materials beyond silicon to overcome the limit of semiconductor technology nodes in the sub-1 nm range. However, despite extensive efforts in the growth of monolayer single-crystal MoS 2 , growth optimization for higher electronic property and reproducible fabrication for satisfying industrial stability still need to be reported. Here, we report an approach to synthesize wafer-scale monolayer single-crystal MoS 2 with high carrier mobility and on/off ratio on sapphire by controlled release of S/Mo precursors ratio during the chemical vapor deposition process. We infer that the main cause of the mismatch in the stoichiometric S/Mo ratio is the oxygen doping. It is found that the MoS x film (x = 1.94) has rather high optimization, as confirmed by the relatively high electronic performances of related devices. Specifically, a fabricated field-effect transistor (FET) array based on the single-crystal monolayer MoS 1.94 channels demonstrates significant enhancement in room-temperature mobility (up to 122 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and an exceptional on/off ratio (over 10 10 ).

However, the coexistence of the second-order topological phase and valley Weyl phonon features in 2D materials remains unexplored. In this Letter, we present a two-dimensional Li-intercalated graphene material family that serves as an ideal platform for demonstrating the coexistence of topological electron and phonon features. Our study, which utilizes first-principles calculations, investigates the structural, electronic, and topological properties of several Li-intercalated graphene materials. The higher-order topological phases are protected by C 6 rotation and inversion symmetries in Li-C 6 and Li-C 6 -Li layers, respectively, as confirmed by their calculated topological invariants ( ⁠ χ 6 , Z 4 ⁠ ). Topologically protected corner modes are noticed within the gapped bulk and edge states (in the armchair edge) in the nanoflake geometry of the Li-C 6 compound. Notably, the phonon spectra of the Li-C 6 and Li-C 6 -Li materials exhibit Weyl phonon nodes in the Brillouin zone where the phonon bands touch at the valley-high symmetry point. The presence of localized Berry curvature and robust topological phonon edge states further confirms the existence of Weyl phonon nodes in these materials. Our first-principles study predicts potential candidates for hosting the coexisting electronic and phononic features and highlights the technological aspects of Li-intercalated graphene materials.},

We begin by discussing the higher-order topological origin of h-BPN, which is an extended model of the Kekulé lattice characterized by a multi-node π -conjugation. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding model, we reveal SOTI in h-BPN, characterized by non-zero fractional corner charges. Furthermore, we show that by varying the number of biphenylene units, h-BPN exhibits adjustable second-order topological phases with alternating parity. Specifically, odd biphenylene indices in the h-BPN system correspond to a SOTI, while even indices result in a trivial insulator. We propose that the h-BPN evolves from the Kekulé lattice. These materials will have important applications in two-dimension devices as higher-order topological materials.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, chiral materials have drawn significant attention because it is widely claimed that they can act as spin injectors/detectors due to the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect. Nevertheless, the microscopic origin of this effect is not understood, which generates the need for transport experiments that confirm the spin-dependent transport in chiral materials. Hanle spin precession measurements can unambiguously prove the injection and detection of a spin accumulation in a non-magnetic material, as was shown with traditional ferromagnetic injectors/detectors. Here, we model and analyze in detail the Hanle spin precession-induced magnetoresistance for chiral/semiconductor systems and find that the signal is inverted as compared to the ferromagnetic case. We explicitly model the spin injection and detection by both a chiral system and a ferromagnetic system, as well as the spin transport in a semiconductor, for a general set of (spin) transport parameters that cover the relevant experimental regime. For all sets of parameters, we find that the Hanle signals for a chiral system and ferromagnet are each other's opposites. We also discuss the implications for four terminal nonlocal spin transport experiments with separate chiral spin injector and detectors.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at perovskite oxide interfaces, such as strontium titanate (STO), have garnered significant attention due to their induced ferromagnetic (FM), spin–orbit coupling, and superconducting properties. The 2 D EG ⁠ , formed at the interface between STO and either insulating oxides or reactive metals, exhibits efficient charge-to-spin interconversion in STO / NM (non-magnetic) / FM structures. The insulating oxide layer at the STO interface attenuates the spin currents injected into the ferromagnet. In contrast, the metallic layers facilitate efficient spin current injection but suffer from spin current diffusion. Here, we present an approach to overcome these challenges by directly creating a 2 D EG at the STO surface through A r + ion bombardment. This method enables efficient spin-to-charge conversion without an intermediate NM layer. Our experimental and simulation results demonstrate the generation of unconventional spin currents at the STO ( Ar + ) / NiFe ( Permalloy ) interface. Our findings may enable applications of complex oxide and ferromagnet interfaces for efficient charge-to-spin conversion, paving the way for low-power, room-temperature oxide-based spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Temperature dependence of the 1/f noise intensity in Bi 2 Se 3 features a weak structure of unknown origin. Comparing the noise structure with the Raman spectrum of Bi 2 Se 3 , we found that it is the image of the surface phonon spectrum of this topological insulator. It also revealed that the low intensity of both noise bands composing the structure in the topological regime is due to the weak interaction of the Dirac electrons with the surface phonons of Bi 2 Se 3 . One of these noise bands has been found to correspond to the boson peak of the amorphous Se surface atoms, while the other one is well fitted by the Eliashberg function of amorphous Bi. It indicates that the interaction of the Dirac electrons with the thermal motion of the Se and Bi atoms, in the first and second atomic layers of the first quintuple Se–Bi–Se–Bi–Se surface cell, respectively, is the microscopic source of the surface 1/f noise in this quantum material. A step-like noise increase observed at a surface-bulk transition in a Bi 2 Se 3 film is assigned to a Fano resonance. This proves that the electron–phonon coupling is involved in the microscopic mechanism of 1/f noise in solids.},

  abstract     = {Many phonon hydrodynamics phenomena, including heat vortices, wave and parabolic distributions of heat flux, which appear due to sufficient normal process, can also appear when there is insufficient normal process. In other words, a smoking gun of phonon hydrodynamics phenomena at the macroscopic level is still lacking. To find it, transient cooling phenomenon in two-dimensional materials is studied based on the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. A heating pulsed Gaussian laser beam is added at the center of two-dimensional disk and it continues to heat the system for a while under the environment temperature. After the heating laser is removed, results show that the transient temperature could be lower than the environment temperature and this phenomenon could only appear with sufficient normal process and insufficient resistive process, which is exactly a smoking gun of phonon hydrodynamics. In addition, the possibility of this phenomenon measured by transient Raman experiments is theoretically discussed. Numerical results show that given a single-layer suspended graphene disk sample with diameter 7 μ m, this transient cooling phenomenon can appear in the temperature range of 50 – 150 K.},

By introducing a shallow trench structure between the excitation and sensing electrodes, the short-circuit current flowing into sensing contacts in GaN-based vertical Hall devices was strongly suppressed. Through TCAD simulation analysis, the optimal range of the shallow trench depth was determined, which was then confirmed by the experimental data. From the experimental results, the sensitivity was found to be improved by 4674.7%, from 3.8 to 177.6 mV/AT, while nonlinearity was reduced by 95.5%, from 19.17% to 0.87%. The effects of device width and sensing electrode length on the device performance were also investigated in detail. Finally, this work experimentally validated the device's angle detection capability, indicating that the GaN-based vertical Hall sensor could be combined with the currently well-established horizontal Hall sensors to create high-performance monolithic integrated three-dimensional Hall sensors.},

A high-power factor of 1.91 × 10 −3 W m −1 K −2 is obtained in p-type In 0.93 Cd 0.07 Sb at 723 K due to the increased carrier concentration. Moreover, the lattice thermal conductivity is decreased to 2.0 W m −1 K −1 owing to the significant multiscale phonon scattering and the suppressed bipolar diffusion effect. Ultimately, the peak zT value of 0.40 is achieved at 723 K in p-type In 0.93 Cd 0.07 Sb, which surpasses most contemporary p-type InSb materials.

Atomic-scale observations revealed that the interface of the IDBs from Al-polar AlN to N-polar AlN consists of three monolayers (MLs) of O-Al-O, while the IDBs from N-polar AlN to Al-polar AlN consist of 8–10 ML of Al x O y N z . Additionally, the positions of the IDBs from N-polar AlN to Al-polar AlN shifted by 20–30 nm from the interface of sputtered AlN toward the surface, whereas those from Al-polar AlN to N-polar AlN remained at the same position as the interface of sputtered AlN.

We investigate the non-radiative carrier lifetime in GaInN/GaN single quantum wells (SQWs) with various emission wavelengths and its relation to the growth conditions. We observe that the non-radiative lifetime in SQWs increases exponentially with decreasing buffer and cladding layer growth temperature. As a first conclusion, diffusion of point defects leading to non-radiative recombination is a universal mechanism present during III-nitride growth. Second, this is likely a predominant mechanism for thermal degradation observed while growing layers on top of the quantum well, e.g., a p-layer, and after post-growth annealing. Performance and reliability of devices can be improved by properly controlling point defect diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Deep mesa is an effective edge termination widely deployed in high-voltage power devices. However, its effectiveness requires the minimal distance between mesa and electrode edge and is susceptible to charges in the dielectric passivation, posing challenges in practical implementation. Here, we propose a deep mesa termination encapsulated by p -type materials, which functions as a reduced-surface-field (RESURF) structure and enables a wide design and process window. We demonstrate the RESURF-mesa design in vertical Ga 3 O 3 diodes. In this design, a 5 μm deep mesa, which is intentionally not aligned with the anode edge, is encapsulated by p -type nickel oxide (NiO). This termination has been applied to devices on three Ga 2 O 3 wafers with epitaxial doping concentrations ranging from 1.2 × 10 16 to 5 × 10 16 cm −3 , enabling an average one-dimensional junction field of 4.2–4.4 MV/cm in all wafers. Additionally, the diode with 1.2 × 10 16 cm −3 doping achieves a specific on-resistance ( R ON,sp ) of 4.05 mΩ·cm 2 and a breakdown voltage of 3214 V, resulting in a power figure of merit of 2.55 GW/cm 2 , which is among the highest in multi-kilovolt β -Ga 2 O 3 diodes.

  abstract     = {Bismuth has been investigated as a potential n -type dopant in hybrid lead halide perovskites, but its behavior in all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr 3 has not been thoroughly characterized. We show that Bi behaves as a deep defect in CsPbBr 3 and gives rise to broad near-infrared emission, similar to its behavior in hybrid perovskites, but a phenomenon not previously reported in CsPbBr 3 . Using inverse temperature crystallization, we synthesized a series of Bi-doped CsPbBr 3 crystals and quantified their Bi concentrations by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Bi incorporation redshifted the absorption edge, and hybrid density functional theory calculations show that this increased absorption comes from excitation into the deep donor level of Bi, not from narrowing of the bandgap of CsPbBr 3 . All Bi-doped crystals emitted both narrow band-edge (2.37 eV) and broad defect-level (1.16 eV) photoluminescence, consistent with our theoretical prediction. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate that Bi incorporation decreases the lifetime of the band-edge emission and gives rise to long-lived defect emission. Power-dependent photoluminescence measurements conducted at 14 K show that the band-edge peak intensity scales as expected for a free or bound exciton, while the sublinear scaling of the infrared defect peak is consistent with recombination between a free hole and a trapped electron, as proposed by theory. These results demonstrate the quantitative accuracy with which current theoretical approaches predict defect behavior in halide perovskites; such theory is key to guiding the experimental development of doping in these materials.},

Clear localization and associated photocarrier redistribution can be evidenced by the S -shape temperature dependence of the PL peak energy and inflection of the PL linewidth. An unexpected maximum of the integrated PL intensity as a function of temperature is observed. This maximum is identified as proof that the localized states behave as chains of quantum dots with reduced radiative lifetime due to the combination of strong two-dimensional lateral quantum confinement in the NW core with localization. This is underlined by the time-resolved PL measurements exhibiting a fast, sub-ns, single-exponential decay, in addition evidencing negligible quantum-confined Stark effect for efficient light sources emitting in the red.},

However, the limited light absorption efficiency of monolayer WSe 2 severely hinders its practical applications. To address this challenge, vertical Te-WSe 2 heterojunctions consisting of Te nanomesh and monolayer WSe 2 nanofilm have been prepared using the two-step vapor deposition method, which significantly enhances the optoelectronic performance. Te-WSe 2 heterojunction photodetector exhibits a high responsivity of 1.3 A/W and a specific detectivity of 1 × 10 10 Jones under the irradiation of 460 nm light source. This study demonstrates the controllable fabrication of large-scale of Te-WSe 2 vertical heterojunctions. The underlying mechanism for the performance enhancement of Te-WSe 2 heterojunction photodetector was elucidated based on the Ohm-like type-I band-aligned structure. The research can be further extended to other Te-based mixed-dimensional heterojunctions, providing valuable theoretical and experimental support for the application of next-generation integrated optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving strength-ductility and functional integration is a key issue to promote the application of alloys in the field of functional materials. CoFeNiCr x Al 1−x alloys exhibit excellent magnetic and corrosion resistance properties; however, their mechanical properties remain underexplored and insufficiently understood. In this work, the microstructure and mechanical properties of CoFeNiCr x Al 1−x alloys were investigated, and their intrinsic deformation mechanisms were elucidated. The results indicate that as Cr is gradually replaced by Al, the phase structure transforms from a single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structure to a dual-phase FCC and body-centered cubic (BCC), and finally to a BCC/B2 structure. Mechanical tests demonstrated that alloy hardness rises with higher Al content, with the Cr0Al1 alloy exhibiting a hardness approximately 3.3 times greater than that of the Cr1Al0 alloy. Notably, the Cr0.5Al0.5 alloy exhibits an optimal strength-ductility balance, with a yield strength increase in about 60% to 248 MPa and tensile strength increase in about 36% to 610 MPa, while maintaining nearly the same ductility as the Cr1Al0 alloy. The deformation mechanisms were found to be driven by solid solution strengthening due to severe lattice distortion, a high dislocation density resulting from reduced dislocation formation energy, the second-phase strengthening and interface strengthening via the micrometer-scale BCC phase, and twin-induced plasticity induced by the reduced stack fault energy. This work broadens the potential applications of CoFeNiCr x Al 1-x alloys as versatile engineering and magnetic functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Interactions of chiral light with chiral matter, such as Raman optical activity (ROA) and, independently, spin-polarized materials have attracted a lot of interest for both fundamental science and applications. The ROA, on the one hand, provides information on chiral phonons of molecules. However, the short-lifetime ROA signal in general is extremely weak and requires long exposure times, making it not accessible for many important systems with short lifetime. Materials exhibiting high spin polarization in d or f band, on the other hand, remain very limited even at very low temperature. There has been no report on materials exhibiting spin polarization in s band. Herewith, we report a room temperature, full spin polarization in unconventional, correlated s band of highly oriented single-crystalline gold quantum-dots (HOSG-QDs). Intriguingly, the HOSG-QDs produce a chiral correlated-plasmons enhanced Raman optical activity (CP-ROA) with anomalous ROA enhancement and strong spin-dependent chiral coupling. We then address a fundamental problem in crystal violet. Using spin-polarized HOSG-QDs chips, we observe strong CP-ROA signal, revealing chiral properties. The chiral correlated-plasmons of HOSG-QDs interact with the spin, electronic, and lattice structures of crystal violet, revealing chiral phonons and chiral electronic Raman excitations of crystal violet. Such a strong CP-ROA spectrum is obtained within a minute of measurement and a simple preparation without patterning. Our result shows that the CP-ROA based on a spin-polarized HOSG-QDs is extremely sensitive to the chiral property of phonon and spin and electronic structures and a fast, label-free chiral spectroscopic-based detection.},

Here, we utilized Voronoi diagram randomized metallic mesh and 3D printing technology to achieve transparent EMI shielding on curved surface. For the metal grid based on Voronoi diagram, one can realize highly homogeneous light transmission, with that optical performance is superior to that of regular and random quadrilateral mesh. The designed Voronoi diagram meshes were fabricated using aerosol jet (AJ) technology, which needs no mask and can achieve patterns on curved surfaces. The Voronoi metal meshes were fabricated on a 40 × 40 mm 2 planar and a plano–convex lens with a diameter of 10 mm and a crown height of 3.7 mm. We investigated the optical transmittance of the Voronoi metal mesh grid and also the imaging performance of plano–convex lens with mesh grid. Furthermore, we analyzed the EMI shielding characteristics of the fabricated Voronoi mesh grids in the Ku-band (12–18 GHz) by using a vector network analyzer, which is higher than 23 dB. Therefore, the proposed Voronoi diagram and AJ technology can provide good diffraction uniformity and an effective method to fabricate the metal mesh grids on conformal surfaces.},

The restricted Brownian motion trajectory of the nanoparticles near the structure indicates that both modes can achieve stable nanoparticles trapping.

  abstract     = {A reactive ion etch process that achieves high selectivity between SiO 2 and photoresist (PR) and based on C 4 F 8 /H 2 chemistry in an inductively coupled radio frequency plasma is developed. The process is accompanied by the formation of a fluorocarbon film, which defines key process characteristics. The SiO 2 etching is described as a sum of two competing mechanisms: (i) an inhibition mechanism related to fluorocarbon film deposition and (ii) a defluorination mechanism, describing the diffusion of etching species to the C x F y /SiO 2 interface. However, the photoresist etch rate is primarily determined by the inhibition mechanism. In order to achieve high SiO 2 /PR selectivity, both mechanisms are studied as functions of hydrogen admixture, pressure, gas residence time, and substrate temperature. This study reveals that depending on the superposition of the process parameters, one of the mechanisms can prevail over the other one, which significantly affects etch rates and selectivity. By adjusting the process parameters, a maximum selectivity between SiO 2 and PR of 8 is achieved corresponding to a SiO 2 etch rate of 200 nm/min.},

The CF density decreases dramatically when the wafer temperature is reduced from 20 to −130 °C by applying identical plasma conditions, demonstrating that the CF surface sticking coefficient increases as the surface temperature is reduced. This suggests that CF 4 plasma could be used to form sidewall passivation layers and perform anisotropic etching at cryogenic temperature, which is impossible at room temperature. Subsequently, a cyclical Bosch type etching process of silicon was evaluated at −100 °C using CF 4 plasma to passivate the trench sidewalls. Anisotropic etch profiles were obtained with an etch rate of 4.4 μ m/min. Compared to a typical Bosch process using highly polymerizing c-C 4 F 8 plasma, chamber wall contamination could be significantly reduced, alleviating a major issue of this cyclic process. Furthermore, CF 4 has a 28% lower global warming potential than c-C 4 F 8 .},

Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2× 10 5 electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time-averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatiotemporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies, and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge, and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.},

This method combined the significant electromagnetic resonant characteristics of meta-unit, the high-speed controllability of GaAs Schottky diode, and the high integration of on-chip transmission line together to realize high-speed modulation. Then, we achieve transmission characteristic reconstruction by adjusting the resonance strength under different applied voltages through fan branch lines, enabling high-order amplitude modulation of sub-terahertz waves. The experimental results show that the PAM4 modulation of sub-terahertz waves is achieved with a nearly linear variation of the transmission coefficient in the whole voltage range and a maximum modulation rate of 21 Gbps, providing a promising prospect for the development and application of integrated sub-terahertz direct high-order modulation technology.},

  abstract     = {Microscopic imaging through complex scattering media is recognized to be challenging. Here, we report high-resolution single-pixel microscopic imaging through complex scattering media. This is developed via an integration of temporal corrections with single-pixel microscopic imaging to enhance the quality of the reconstructed object images and achieve high resolution in complex scattering environments. By adopting a fixed pattern as a temporal carrier, the effect of dynamic scaling factors induced by complex scattering media, which disturb the recorded light intensities, is removed. Artificial targets and biological specimens are tested in optical experiments, and feasibility of the proposed approach is validated to show that the developed single-pixel microscopic imaging system exhibits high robustness against complex scattering. This work offers a promising solution for high-resolution microscopic imaging through thick, dynamic, and complex scattering media.},

  abstract     = {Microcavity-based Brillouin lasers are promising high-performance light sources for integrating photonics and optoelectronics. One method to lock the pump light frequency is to utilize a complex system with optoelectronic feedback, which requires a high-cost narrow-linewidth pump laser and limits the application of microlasers in integrated optoelectronic systems. Another method reported recently is all-optical feedback to achieve the locking of microcavity laser. We propose to utilize Rayleigh scattering of microcavities to lock the frequency of the pump laser to the resonant frequency of the Brillouin laser microcavity with the all-optical method. While compressing the linewidth of the pump laser, it can greatly improve the long-term stability of the optically pumped microcavity Brillouin laser. In the experiment, the linewidth of the semiconductor pump laser is compressed from the MHz level to the kHz level. The microcavity Brillouin laser achieves an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 100 Hz, with an ultra-low frequency noise of 35 Hz 2 /Hz. The constructed microlaser obtains a locking time up to 1 h, which does not require any temperature control or vibration isolation of the laser system. This work demonstrated an optically pump-locked microcavity Brillouin laser, which provides a stable and reliable low-cost experimental platform for ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers, precision laser sensors, microwave-photonic signal synthesizer, and optomechanical systems.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate an optical frequency standard by locking the output frequency of an external cavity diode laser to the 780 nm D 2 transition of diffuse laser cooled 87 Rb atoms using frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS). A 50-cm-long cold atomic cloud is obtained within a ϕ 2 cm × l 50 cm vacuum glass tube, featuring greater simplicity and reliability. By analyzing the impact of power and detuning of cooling and repumping lasers, and power of frequency-modulated laser on FMS based on cold atoms, we choose the optimal parameter and lock the laser frequency to the 87 Rb 5 2 S 1/2 ( F = 2) → 5 2 P 3/2 ( ⁠ F ′ = 3) cycling transition. The cold-atom-based optical frequency standard achieves an in-loop frequency stability of 3.3 × 10 −15 at 1 s, with peak-to-peak frequency fluctuations being less than 50 Hz within 6000 s. This represents the integration of cold atoms into an optical frequency standard utilizing FMS for frequency stabilization. In contrast to the common cold-atom optical frequency standards, our approach requires fewer lasers and eliminates the need for a complex and expensive Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) system. Its low complexity makes it a promising candidate for development into a space cold-atom clock, promoting advancements in space science and navigational positioning. Additionally, it possesses great potential to serve as an absolute wavelength standard.},

  abstract     = {Optical clocks with high precision are practical and necessary in atomic physics, geodesy, gravitational wave measurement, etc. Transportability and environmental adaptability are two key indicators to measure the performance of frequency standards. Here, we utilized a highly robust atomic-filter-based Faraday laser as the local oscillator, and achieved two compact Faraday optical frequency standards based on 133 Cs 6 S 1 / 2 | F = 3 ⟩ → 6 P 3 / 2 | F ′ = 2 ⟩ and 6 S 1 / 2 | F = 4 ⟩ → 6 P 3 / 2 | F ′ = 5 ⟩ transitions at 852 nm, leveraging modulation transfer spectroscopy for laser frequency stabilization. The Faraday laser automatically aligns atomic transition spectral lines, due to the use of atomic filters as frequency selective elements. Therefore, the laser wavelength has strong robustness against environmental changes. This setup not only simplifies the operational complexity but also ensures frequency stability. By heterodyne beating between two such compact optical frequency standards, the beatnote achieved a short-term frequency stability of 1.68 × 10 −13 at 3 s, remained at the 10 −13 level for up to 400 s, and stayed below 2.7 × 10 −12 for up to 1600 s, predominantly exhibiting white frequency noise. This underscores the potential of atomic-filter-based Faraday laser in realizing compact and stable frequency standards, mitigating coherent communication error rates, and enhancing the precision of quantum interferometric measurements. Moreover, this approach eliminates the continuous need for external monitoring and adjustments, thereby, offering a practical and robust solution for out of laboratory applications demanding high frequency stability.},

For the advancement of spin–orbit photonic technologies, quantitative characterization and unambiguous physical interpretation of the various spin–orbit interaction (SOI) effects exhibited in complex nanophotonic systems are of utmost importance. This Perspective addresses some of these outstanding challenges in the domain of spin–orbit photonics, focusing on the simultaneous manifestation of multiple SOI effects in hybridized nanophotonic systems and the role of polarization-based techniques in their characterization and quantification. After introducing the fundamentals and physical origins of SOI effects, we present a polarization Mueller matrix technique as a powerful tool to probe, decouple, and independently quantify these effects in a unified experimental framework, demonstrated with hybridized waveguided plasmonic crystals. We further discuss the potential of structured light and tailored polarization to enable unconventional SOI phenomena in simple nanostructured metamaterials and metasurfaces. These advancements not only enhance our fundamental understanding of SOI phenomena across micro- and nanoscale optical systems but also pave the way for the development of multifunctional and tunable spin–orbit photonic devices.},

  abstract     = {To date, no treatment has been developed for targeted delivery to the inner ear (IE). Sonoporation, a promising drug delivery method, increases the permeability of round window membranes (RWMs), enhancing drug diffusion to the IE. A dedicated ultrasound protocol is essential to treat IE pathologies in combination with sonoporation. In situ acoustic pressure (AP) measurements cannot be used for RWM sonoporation because of the heterogeneous anatomy of the temporal bone. This study aimed to model ultrasound propagation in the IE to ensure adequate AP for RWM sonoporation. The impact of the position of the ultrasound probe relative to the RWM on AP as well as potential temperature increases caused by tissue/ultrasound interaction were investigated. Using MATLAB ® , a surgical procedure was simulated based on the computed tomography scans of sheep heads (14 IEs). An ultrasound probe (12.7 mm in diameter, 1 MHz) with a degassed water-filled adapter was placed in front of the RWM. Mechanical properties, such as tissue density, sound speed, and ultrasound attenuation, were computed. Ultrasound propagation was simulated using k-wave. Standing waves can double the AP locally; however, the final AP is comparable to a free water field map when accounting for microbubble-induced attenuation. The angle and distance of the probe relative to the RWM have minimal effect on the AP; the main effect is caused by centering the probe on the RWM. No significant thermal elevation was observed. The developed computational model paves the way for designing an optimal and safe ultrasound protocol for sonoporation-mediated drug delivery into the IE.},

Environmental noise is the main obstacle for QSDC's practicality. For enhancing QSDC's noise robustness, we introduce the quantum error correction (QEC) code into QSDC and propose the QSDC protocol based on the redundancy code. This QSDC protocol correlates atomic state with the electron–photon entangled pairs and transmits photons in quantum channels for two rounds. The parties can construct the remote atomic logical entanglement channel and decode messages with the heralded photonic Bell state measurement (BSM) and single electron measurement. This QSDC protocol is unconditionally secure in theory and has some advantages. First, benefiting from the heralded photonic BSM, it can eliminate the influence from photon transmission loss and has the potential to realize long-distance secure message transmission. Second, taking use of the error correction function of the repetition code, the error rate caused by the decoherence during the second round of photon transmission can be reduced, which can reduce the message error and increase the secret message capacity. Third, the whole protocol is feasible under current experimental condition. Our QSDC protocol can be extended to use other stronger QEC code. It provides a promising method to promote QSDC's practicality in the future.},

In this Letter, we report a method for accurately determining the microwave conductivity and complex permittivity of PCB laminates over a wide temperature range, from 4 to 300 K. The use of higher-order resonant modes of a balanced-type circular disk resonator (BCDR) enables broadband measurements ranging from below 5 GHz to above 20 GHz. Furthermore, a temperature-independent determination scheme is achieved by employing a pair of BCDRs and a cryogenic calibration technique. This method is demonstrated by measuring two commercially available PCB laminates. The results indicate that while dielectric loss is monotonically reduced at cryogenic temperatures, the reduction in conductor loss is strongly suppressed by the surface roughness of the copper foil. Additionally, the obtained conductivity as a function of frequency and temperature fits well with the Gradient Model, allowing for the evaluation of the root mean square roughness parameter.},

  abstract     = {Utilizing lithium metal as an anode in batteries has been expected to replace conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, the mechanical properties and electrochemical performance of current separators do not meet the requirements for practical applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we report an elastomer separator with an interconnected structure of plastic-crystal-embedded and garnet-conductor-regulated thermoplastic polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-r-butylene)-b-polystyrene elastomer integrated with the polyethylene matrix. The 14-micron-thick elastomer separators show a combination of excellent elongation of ∼115.2% and sufficiently high tensile strength of ∼56 MPa. The elastomer separators accommodate volume changes and block dendrites for high-current-density cycling of LMBs. As a demonstration, the elastomer separators enable stable operation of LMBs under stringent conditions, a practical high loading of 18 mg cm −2 LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) cathode at an extremely high charging/discharging current density of 1.8 mA cm −2 , delivering a high reversible capacity of 164 mAh g −1 and capacity retention of 88% after 140 cycles.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells have experienced rapid development in the last few years due to their excellent photovoltaic properties, and their efficiency and stability have attracted widespread attention. Passivating interfacial defects has been universally recognized as an effective performance enhancement strategy for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most reported strategies often fail to simultaneously meet the requirements of efficiency and stability. This paper proposes to enhance the passivation function of phosphine oxide by fluorination. On the one hand, P=O is used to form coordination bonds with Pb 2+ in perovskite. On the other hand, the strong hydrophobicity of F gives perovskite excellent moisture stability and can hydrogen bond to organic cations in the perovskite. Thanks to its strong chelation with the defect sites, it achieved optimized energy level arrangement, suppressed non-radiative recombination, and excellent operation stability. Consequently, the efficiency of the optimized device increased by 21.6% with a remarkable enhancement of 40 mV in V OC and remained more than 90% of its initial efficiency after aging in air environment for 1000 h, improving both efficiency and stability. This study demonstrates a promising functional modification strategy for constructing efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly PSCs.},

  abstract     = {The ternary strategy offers a promising route to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this contribution, we focus on the state-of-the-art binary system PM6:L8-BO and reveal how the n-type polymer guest (PYIT) in the PM6:L8-BO:PYIT ternary system enhances carrier dynamics, thereby improving both efficiency and scalability for large-area printable OSC modules. These benefits are primarily attributed to two key factors: (i) the excellent miscibility of the PYIT guest with the host materials, coupled with the chain-dominant structure and high crystallinity nature of the PYIT polymer, which creates additional pathways for carrier transport and charge transfer; (ii) the incorporation of PYIT, which limits the excessive aggregation of L8-BO, improves molecular packing, and reduces film defects, thereby enhancing exciton dynamics. These optimizations lead to an increase in PCEs from 17.58% in the binary system to 18.59% in the ternary OSC, with improvements across all photovoltaic parameters. More importantly, the PM6:L8-BO:PYIT ternary system exhibits excellent compatibility with large-area printing processes, as demonstrated by a doctor blading OSC module achieving 15.57% PCE over an area of 11.7 cm 2 . This work highlights the potential of the ternary methodology in tuning the physical properties of OSCs while enhancing both performance and scalability.},

Currently, most P-SCs adopt a sandwich structure that is limited by electrode fabrication methods. However, the development of planar paper-based devices is crucial to satisfy the tremendous demand for wearable electronics. Herein, based on the mechanism of interaction between the laser and material, we used direct laser writing (DLW) techniques to fabricate in-plane P-SCs based on graphene oxide (GO) and manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) composite-covered paper substrates. Owing to the in-plane device structure and pseudocapacitive MnO 2 , the acquired rGO-MnO 2 -based planar P-SCs possessed a much higher specific capacitance value (17.7 mF/cm 2 ) than that based on sandwich-structured reduced GO (rGO) (1.71 mF/cm 2 ). In addition, three in-series integrated devices can be easily achieved via the DLW fabrication method, which shows potential for practical applications such as powering a light emitting diode. In addition, by carefully designing the paper substrate structure, the paper-based device exhibited excellent stretching stability. A specific capacitance retention of 86.8% remained after 5000 stretch cycles. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the design and fabrication of wearable paper-based electronics.},

  abstract     = {Lead sulfide (PbS) is a promising thermoelectric material due to its high availability, thermal stability, and cost-efficiency, with research predominantly aiming to enhance its carrier concentration through heavy doping for optimal ZT values at high temperatures. However, this approach often results in suboptimal performance at ambient temperature, significantly constraining its applicability in thermoelectric cooling technologies. In this work, the carrier concentration of n-type PbS is optimized by incorporating trace amounts of InBi. Due to the low carrier concentration, PbS retains a high Seebeck coefficient and carrier mobility, resulting in a high average power factor ( PF ave ) of 15.4 μ W·cm −1 ·K −2 within the temperature range from 300 to 773 K. In addition, the introduction of In/Bi interstitial atoms and dislocation defects enhances phonon scattering, effectively reducing the lattice thermal conductivity of PbS. The peak ZT value of Pb 0.999 (InBi) 0.001 S at 773 K reaches ∼1.0, while an average ZT value ( ZT ave ) of ∼0.6 is achieved between 300 and 773 K in Pb 0.9995 (InBi) 0.0005 S. This study demonstrates that trace element doping is an effective strategy for optimizing the thermoelectric performance of PbS across a wide temperature range, which is vital in the thermoelectric power generation and refrigeration application.},

The septuple atomic-layered ternary compound SnBi 2 Se 4 is reported as a promising thermoelectric material in both bulk and single-layer structures based on theoretical calculations, though experimental investigation remains unexplored. In this work, the melting and hot-press sintering methods were adopted to synthesize the septuple atomic-layered SnBi 2 Se 4 . Its unique layered crystal structure contributed to significant anisotropic transport properties and reduced thermal conductivity. However, its thermoelectric performance is constrained by a low carrier concentration that limits electrical conductivity. To solve this issue, the high-valent transition metal Nb was doped at Bi site to provide additional electrons. This doping resulted in a noticeable improvement in the performance of septuple atomic-layered SnBi 2 Se 4 due to increased electrical conductivity and decreased thermal conductivity. Finally, a peak ZT ∼ 0.17 was obtained for SnBi 1.97 Nb 0.03 Se 4 at 723 K, suggesting the effectiveness of Nb doping in enhancing the performance.

This design is specifically developed to demonstrate the potential of thermal energy harvesting for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By leveraging the high energy conversion efficiency of TAEs and the exceptional robustness of H-TENGs, this harvester overcomes the limitations of traditional designs, which often involve complex or costly components. The experimental results revealed the oscillation characteristics of the TAEH-TENG: by utilizing a hot heat exchanger (HHE) with a length of 10 cm, the system can sustain oscillation over 150–350 °C. Furthermore, the harvester is capable of generating an open-circuit voltage of 25 V, an RMS current of 0.98 μ A, and a peak power output of 0.48 mW, representing the highest power output achieved to date in comparison to previous studies. To further showcase the harvester's capability, an ultra-low-power IoT node was developed. Solely powered by the TAEH-TENG, the IoT node achieved cold-start, conducted in situ temperature measurement five times, and transmitted the data via Bluetooth within 120 s. This study not only showcases a fully self-powered IoT application but, more importantly, significantly advances the technology beyond the previous limitations faced by thermoacoustic and triboelectric integrations. By demonstrating the capability to power an ultra-low-power IoT node, this research highlights the TAEH-TENG's potential for practical, real-world energy solutions, marking a significant milestone in the deployment of heat-powered IoT applications.},

In this work, metal-organic framework-derived Fe 3 C decorated nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Fe 3 C–NC) composites were prepared to modify the separator to promote the reaction kinetics of Li–S batteries. The porous and conductive NC facilitates the trapping of LiPSs, rapid transfer of charge, and alleviated volume expansion, while the Fe 3 C–NC with optimum Fe 3 C content can significantly reduce the energy barrier of the electrochemical conversion reaction, accelerate the transport of lithium ions, and enhance the reaction kinetics of LiPSs, which are conducive to inhibit the shuttle effect through synergistic physical and chemical interactions. The Li–S battery with Fe 3 C–NC separator exhibits excellent cycle stability with an initial discharge specific capacity of 1099.19 mAh g −1 at 1 C and a low-capacity decay of 0.068% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even at a high S loading of 5.93 mg cm −2 , it still delivers reliable cyclic stability with an initial discharge specific capacity of 903.65 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C.

  abstract     = {This paper describes a label-free liquid crystal (LC)-based biosensor for a rapid and straightforward detection of whole cell Shigella dysenteriae at aqueous interfaces using a bacteria-specific aptamer. The stimuli-receptive properties of LCs induce a change in the orientational ordering of molecules at the LC–aqueous interface. This interfacial phenomenon has been utilized to record target binding interactions of the biosensor. The homeotropic LC alignment at the glass–LC and the aqueous–LC interfaces was obtained using the aligning agent dimethyloctadecyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride and the self-assembling property of the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, respectively. The introduction of the negatively charged Shigella aptamer causes the homeotropic molecules to morph to a planar/tilted ordering. Upon adding a small quantity of Shigella cells in liquid media, the aptamer–bacterium interaction causes a redistribution of the surfactant at the LC–aqueous interface, restoring the homeotropic alignment. This results in a bright-to-dark optical change observed under a polarizing optical microscope, thus implying the presence of the microbes. This reported aptasensor demonstrates high specificity, with the limit of detection being 30 CFU/ml within a linear range of 1–105 CFU/ml. To test the utility of this system, the sensor was also tested with close taxonomic relatives S. dysenteriae as well as real samples from the food chain. This proposed LC-based sensor offers several advantages over conventional detection techniques for a quick and convenient way for the detection of whole cell targets.},

  abstract     = {Flexible piezoresistive strain sensors are crucial for monitoring human motion, but achieving the right balance between sensitivity and operating range has always been challenging. Additionally, the complexity of muscle movements across different body parts means that relying on sensors with limited dimensional sensing is insufficient. This paper presents a flexible piezoresistive three-dimensional strain sensor (FPTDSS) designed to address these challenges. The FPTDSS features a wide operating range capable of detecting various human movements and boasts a high sensitivity, with a maximum gauge factor of 20 479. It can capture strain information along both the X- and Y-axes, as well as small vibrations along the Z-axis, through its intrinsic stretching and vibration properties. The sensor's effectiveness comes from the synergy between laser-induced graphene, silver nanoparticles (a zero-dimensional nanomaterial), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (a one-dimensional nanomaterial). The synergistic effect of nanomaterials with different dimensions enables the FPTDSS to perform three-dimensional strain sensing, allowing for accurate detection of a broad range of complex human motions without requiring intricate circuit designs or preparation processes. This approach moves beyond limited strain information to provide a comprehensive view of three-dimensional strain, making the sensor versatile for detecting everything from subtle pulse vibrations to significant joint movements.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the magnetization reversal of a perpendicularly magnetized nanodevice using a chirped current pulse (CCP) via spin-orbit torques (SOTs). Our numerically simulated findings demonstrate that both the field-like (FL) and damping-like (DL) components of SOT in CCP can be efficiently utilized to induce ultrafast magnetization reversal without any symmetry-breaking means. For a wide frequency range of the CCP, the minimal current density is significantly smaller compared to the current density of conventional SOT-reversal. This ultrafast reversal is achieved due to the CCP triggering enhanced energy absorption (emission) of the magnetization from (to) the FL- and DL-components of SOT before (after) crossing over the energy barrier. We also verify the robustness of the CCP-driven magnetization reversal at room temperature. Moreover, this strategy is applicable also to induce field-free ultrafast and efficient switching of perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic (SFi) nanodevices. The minimal current density of deterministic switching of the SFi system decreases significantly with the reduction of one layer's magnetization, mainly because the SOT amplitude is inversely proportional to the saturation magnetization. Therefore, this study enriches the basic understanding of field-free SOT-reversal and provides a way to realize ultrafast SOT-MRAM devices with various free layer designs.},

The preferential growth of nanocrystalline IGZO with matched crystal structure in the channel favors the transport of electrons. In addition, the accumulation of a large number of electrons at the heterojunction due to energy band bending provides a strong guarantee for high mobility. The crystallized stacked IGO/IGZO TFT exhibits a superior field effect mobility of 95.7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , which is 55.9% higher than that of single-layer IGO TFT. At the same time, the stability of the device was also dramatically improved.

Here, the influence of band structures and interfacial transport properties on the performance of self-powered ultraviolet position-sensitive detectors based on PrNiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 p – n junctions is systematically investigated.

To date, they have been usually synthesized by a chemical solution process. However, the chemically synthesized ITO NPs are capped with organic protecting agents, which often block exchange of charge carriers and access of chemical species to the NPs, limiting some applications. In the present study, we propose a method for direct deposition of ITO NPs on a glass or plastic substrate using commercially available ITO-coated glass via NIR laser ablation. The LSPR characteristics of the ITO NPs, thus, prepared were controlled by changing the ablation conditions such as laser power.

By applying a stress field, the WSe 2 /CrI 3 heterostructure manifests enhanced spin polarization, Rashba splitting, and tunable bandgap. The TRS-breaking QSH effect observed in the WSe 2 /CrI 3 heterostructure exhibits remarkable robustness against interlayer shearing.

Nevertheless, the development of 2D photodetectors that can achieve high responsivity, a fast response time, and long-term stability remains a significant challenge. The present study is a systematic investigation of the effects of top and bottom encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on the performance and stability of 2D photodetectors. By employing a dry transfer process to fabricate a high-quality h-BN/MoS 2 /h-BN structure, we provide effective protection against environmental degradation. The encapsulated devices exhibited a responsivity increase of one to two orders of magnitude under 532 nm laser illumination, in comparison to those without encapsulation. Additionally, the rise and decay times were markedly reduced, by approximately two orders of magnitude, from 0.538 and 3.43 ms to 23.1 and 99.6 μ s, respectively. Moreover, the devices demonstrated sustained performance over a 60-day storage period, with response times remaining faster than pre-encapsulation levels.

  abstract     = {Exploring magnetoelectric coupling properties in multiferroic materials is scientifically intriguing and of great technical importance in nanoscale devices. In this work, the magnetoelectric coupling behaviors in the two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic heterostructure (HS), NiCl 2 /Ga 2 S 3 , are explored using density functional theory calculations. Our results show that the NiCl 2 /Ga 2 S 3 HS remains in the ferromagnetic (FM) state in both ferroelectric (FE) polarization states, with the magnetic easy axis lying close to the xoz plane in the Ga 2 S 3 -P↓ state and aligning along the eclipsed z axis in the Ga 2 S 3 -P↑ state, respectively. Moreover, the HS in the Ga 2 S 3 -P↑ polarization state behaves as an FM semiconductor, while it changes to be an FM half-metal in the Ga 2 S 3 -P↓ polarization state. By applying tensile strains, the NiCl 2 /Ga 2 S 3 -P↓ can transit from FM quasi-half-metal to FM semiconductor with type-II band alignment. The regulation of physical properties that is induced by the FE layer in the HS originates from interfacial charge transfer due to the proximity effect. This work offers a platform to fabricate a magnetoelectric coupling interaction in 2D multiferroic devices.},

  abstract     = {A resurgence of research on ferroelectric materials has recently occurred due to their potential to enhance the performance of memory and logic. For the design and commercialization of such technologies, it is important to understand the physical behavior of ferroelectrics and the interplay with device size, geometry, and fabrication processes. Here, we report a study of geometric factors that can influence the measurement of the remanent ferroelectric polarization, an important measurement for understanding wakeup, retention, and endurance in ferroelectric technologies. The areal size scaling of W/Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 /W capacitors is compared in two typical structures: an island top electrode with a continuous ferroelectric layer and an island top electrode/ferroelectric layer (etched ferroelectric layer). Error in the evaluation of the switched area leads to anomalous scaling trends and increasing apparent remanent polarization as capacitor sizes decrease, most strongly in continuous ferroelectric layer capacitors. Using TEM and electric field simulations, this is attributed to two effects: a processing artifact from ion milling that creates a foot on the top electrode and a fringe electric field penetrating outside of the capacitor area. With the correction of the switching area, the 2 P r for both samples agree (∼32 μ C cm −2 ) and is invariant in the capacitor sizes used (down to 400 nm diameter). Our work demonstrates that the determination of the actual capacitor structure and local electric field is needed to evaluate the intrinsic ferroelectric behavior at the nanoscale.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we delve into the complex dielectric behaviors of lanthanum (La)-doped PNN-PZT relaxor-ferroelectric ceramics under the influence of high AC fields. Our approach involves a meticulous design of dielectric measurements to scrutinize the decoupling phenomenon between local polarization oscillation and global polarization switching. Remarkably, the application of high AC fields (>0.5 kV/mm) causes a dramatic increase in the dielectric permittivity (2x), alongside pronounced frequency dispersion (>65 °C) and a permittivity hump below T m in 7% La-doped relaxor compositions. For relaxor-ferroelectric ceramics doped with lower La (<=5%) that are featured with tweed-like submicron domains as imaged in in situ transmission electron microscopy, the significantly enhanced dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss (>1) are induced under high AC fields (<0.5 kV/mm). A comparative study with a polarization loop in the time domain under various AC fields and DC bias demonstrates that the dielectric anomaly in the frequency domain is associated with global polarization switching, co-existing with polarization oscillation mechanism in various domains. This frequency domain method reveals threshold AC fields (0.25–0.5 kV/mm) above which polarization switching occurs in relaxor-FE compositions at elevated temperatures, complements the dynamic behaviors of P–E hysteresis, and cautions the control of AC fields in dealing with relaxor-ferroelectric materials for advanced electronic applications.},

In this work, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectricity of bilayer H–ScO 2 , which is formed by an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration of monolayer H–ScO 2 ferromagnetic material. The out-of-plane polarization results from charge transfer between the layers, causing an unequal charge distribution within them and yielding a polarization value of ± 1.26 pC/m. We found that increasing the doping concentration suppresses the polarization value. This phenomenon results from the differing occupancy ratios of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands after introducing electron or hole doping into the system. The closer the number of electrons in the conduction band is to that in the valence band, the more pronounced the suppression of polarization. Our work offers a perspective for the design of advanced van der Waals ferroelectric materials.},

The effect of O 2 concentration during SiO 2 deposition on the transistor performance was investigated. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy confirm that increasing O 2 concentration during deposition boosts the amounts of protons moving between the bridging oxygen in the Si–O–Si network, improving the electrical double layer capacitance of SiO 2 . Furthermore, SiN x in the stacked structure exhibits a higher relative permittivity than SiO 2 , resulting in a more concentrated electric field within the SiO 2 layer, facilitating proton ionization. SiO 2 /SiN x stacked film with SiO 2 deposited at the oxygen flow rate of 150  sccm exhibited the maximum capacitance of 2.87 μ F/cm 2 at 4 Hz. The transistor with SiO 2 deposited at the oxygen flow rate of 150  sccm achieved the maximum paired pulse facilitation index of 132.9% and the maximum A 50 /A 1 index of 155.4%.

We also measure the current dependent NLKI through CPW resonators that shift down in frequency with increased power applied through the CPW feedline. Using these measurements, we calculate the characteristic non-linear current parameter, I * ⁠ , for multiple CPW geometries. We find values for corresponding current density, J * = 12 – 22 MA/cm 2 , and a ratio of the critical current to the non-linear current parameter, I C / I * = 0.14 – 0.26 ⁠ , similar to or higher than values for other superconductors such as NbTiN and TiN.},

We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip-chip device using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting wiring layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer and not by the indium interconnect. We show that the pressed indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1 A due to its large size of about 500 μ m diameter. Our flip-chip assembly does require neither electroplating nor patterning of indium. The assembly process does not need a flip-chip bonder and can be realized with a transfer stage using a top chip with transparency or through-vias for alignment. These flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.},

Skyrmions in artificially synthesized antiferromagnets (SAFs) are particularly promising due to their ability to suppress the skyrmion Hall effect and achieve faster dynamics, making them highly attractive for spintronic devices. However, the critical current density required to drive SAF skyrmions using spin-transfer torque is significantly higher than in conventional ferromagnetic systems. In this work, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that the critical current density for SAF skyrmions can be significantly reduced by applying distinct currents to different layers within the system. This approach can be applied to periodically pinned skyrmions in SAFs, offering the dual benefits of a suppressed Hall effect and a reduced critical current density. Our findings pave the way for more efficient manipulation of SAF skyrmions in spintronic device architectures.},

In this work, a reliable design of all-spin spiking neural networks (SNN) based on spin–orbit torque (SOT) devices has been proposed in A1 CoPt single layer. The CoPt-SOT devices exhibited field-free SOT switching, and the magnetization reversal mechanism was inferred to be a combination of domain nucleation and domain-wall propagation as observed through magneto-optical Kerr microscopy images. Moreover, the current-induced SOT switching process of the device exhibited stable multistate magnetic switching behavior, which can be controlled by varying the amplitude and pulse width of the current pulse. Meanwhile, the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) curve was inverted when the SOT switching polarity was reversed by different magnetic fields, and the change in anomalous Hall resistances (ΔR H ) in the STDP curve was linearly related to the SOT switching ratio. In addition, at the zero magnetic field, we constructed an all-spin SNN using STDP synapses and leaky integrate-and-fire neurons of CoPt-SOT devices. The handwritten digits recognition rate of this all-spin SNN network was 89.9%. These results substantiate that the CoPt single layer represents a promising hardware solution for high-performance neuromorphic computing, with applicability in the domain of SNN.},

Microstructure analyses revealed that after MgO insertion, a homogeneous rock-salt structured Mg 0.55 Ga 0.45 O(001) barrier is formed, which differs from the nominal spinel crystal MgGa 2 O 4 . Elemental mapping of the MTJ showed that Ga diffusion into the adjacent Fe can be effectively suppressed while maintaining perfect lattice-matching at the Fe/barrier interfaces, thereby improving effective tunneling spin polarization through the barrier. The RA of the Mg 0.55 Ga 0.45 O (2.3 nm) MTJ is smaller than that of a comparable MgAl 2 O 4 barrier (2.3 nm), thanks to the lower barrier height of the Mg 0.55 Ga 0.45 O as confirmed by the current–voltage characteristics.},

Micromagnetic simulations and analytical calculations, utilizing the Smit–Beljers formalism, demonstrate good agreement with our experimental findings. In the magnetic switching regime, the spin-wave spectra indicate an antiparallel alignment between the two ferromagnetic layers. This configuration is highly sensitive to the field angle, suggesting the presence of multidimensional reconfigurations within the multilayer artificial spin ice. Furthermore, employing a minor loop field protocol, we show that the spin-wave modes associated with the antiparallel alignment remain reproducible, even after 100 minor loop cycles, providing intriguing possibilities for magnonic engineering.},

  abstract     = {The electrical spin injection and detection in perpendicularly magnetized Mn/Co/n-GaAs junction was investigated using a non-local method. Clear non-local spin-valve signals and Hanle effect signals were observed at 77 K, providing direct evidence of the injection and detection of perpendicularly polarized spins through all electrical methods. The magnitude of the spin-valve signal was one order of magnitude smaller than that observed in a reference sample with an in-plane magnetized CoFe due to the low spin polarization of the ultrathin Mn/Co electrodes. It was found that the spin polarization at the interface between Mn/Co electrode and n + -GaAs had a relatively weak bias-current dependence in contrast to that at CoFe/n + -GaAs interface. The estimated spin lifetime of perpendicular spins injected from the Mn/Co bilayer into n-GaAs was approximately 1.9 ns at 77 K. This value is similar to that of in-plane spins injected from CoFe, indicating that the spin lifetime was not strongly dependent on the spin orientation in the bulk GaAs channel.},

  abstract     = {THz spintronics is an emergent area of research aimed at bridging the gap between fifth- and sixth-generation wireless telecommunications by utilizing spintronic devices such as magnetic spin torque oscillators as a source of low powered THz emission. The realization of such devices using ferromagnetic metal thin films however requires magnetic materials with both large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and low Gilbert damping constants. In this Letter, we report on the development of L 1 0 -ordered FePt with an effective Gilbert damping constant as low as 0.033. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we characterized the magnetization dynamics of continuous L 1 0 -ordered FePt grown on MgO and SrTiO 3 substrates. By changing the substrate on which FePt is grown, the lattice mismatch and subsequent number of misfit dislocations at the interface and L 1 0 -ordering can be controlled. We found that fewer misfits and improved ordering in FePt lead to a reduced Gilbert damping constant due to reduced electron scattering but that FePt grown on SrTiO 3 also shows robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Importantly, these results demonstrate the ability to control the damping in FePt and similar materials by changing the number of misfit dislocations at the interface and the smaller damping in FePt opens up the possibility of using this material in spintronic materials in the THz wave range.},

By comparing the effect between MoGe films on different magnetic materials, we show that the amplitude of the spontaneous voltage generation is almost proportional to that of the nonreciprocal electric transport in MoGe, suggesting that the observed rectification mainly originates from the motion of superconducting vortex strings that can feel asymmetry in the magnetic environment between the MoGe surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory (VC-MRAM) is an emerging nonvolatile memory based on the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect. It has been garnering considerable attention because of its fast and low-power operation. However, two major issues must be addressed for practical applications. First, the voltage-induced switching of the free layer magnetization is sensitive to ultrashort voltage pulse duration. Second, the write error rate (WER) of the voltage-induced switching is high. To address these issues, a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure with an exchange coupled free layer, consisting of a precession layer with the VCMA effect and an anchor layer without the VCMA effect, is proposed. The anchor layer prevents the precession layer from returning to its initial direction, thereby reducing the WER without requiring the voltage pulse duration to be precisely controlled. The write operation of the proposed MTJ with an exchange coupled free layer was analyzed using the macrospin model. Using optimized MTJ parameters, a low WER of approximately 10 −6 was obtained for an 80 nm MTJ without requiring the pulse duration to be precisely controlled. These results facilitate the reduction of the WER for VC-MRAM and improve its usability, thereby expanding its range of applications.},

  abstract     = {Manipulating the thermal conductivity of materials and achieving a high thermal switching ratio is very important in fields such as thermal management and energy conversion. In this study, by utilizing first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, we find the lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ l ⁠ ) of monolayer boron sulfide (BS) can reach values as low as 0.11 Wm −1 K −1 at room temperature, significantly lower than that of well-known two-dimensional materials with low thermal conductivity such as SnSe. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the strong lattice anharmonicity, which is primarily induced by the lone electron pairs. The effect of biaxial strain on κ l is further investigated. It is found that a small strain of 2% can lead to a two orders of magnitude increase in κ l ⁠ . Moreover, this property remains stable within the strain range of 2%–7%, making it easier to achieve experimentally. The variation of κ l with strain is mainly determined by the change in phonon lifetime, which is governed by the competition between the reduction of anti-bonding valence band states and the enhanced coupling between soft optical and acoustic phonons. Our results indicate that monolayer BS is a promising candidate material for thermal switches and energy conversion devices.},

For devices based on Rayleigh-like plane waves, functionality is based on the fact that the Rayleigh wave mode is confined at the solid–air interface. However, to create advanced functionality through the use of phononic crystal structures, standard cylindrical inclusions have been shown to couple Rayleigh modes to the shear horizontal bulk modes and provide a significant pathway to energy loss. We introduce alternative inclusion shapes with a reduced two-fold symmetry that lowers the speed of the Rayleigh-like surface acoustic wave to below that of the shear horizontal mode. With an eigenfrequency below the sound line, the mode is confined to the surface with limited coupling and loss to the bulk. Based on these inclusions, an acoustic waveguide design is proposed, which demonstrates a strong confinement of wave energy both at the surface and within the waveguide.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic acoustic beam manipulation via tunable acoustic metasurfaces (AMs) has attracted significant attention. However, most current tunable AMs are primarily designed for airborne sound, feature complex structural components, and serve a singular purpose. This study proposes a coding Moiré metasurface (CMM) consisting of two cascaded acoustic coding metasurfaces (ACMs) to dynamically manipulate ultrasonic beams in water. The CMM merges the characteristics of Moiré AMs and coding and can achieve different ultrasonic beam manipulations by rotating the ACM and changing the coding sequence. This is demonstrated by presenting CMMs with stripe and checkerboard coding patterns: the former split an ultrasonic beam into two dynamically omnidirectional scanning beams, while the latter divided it into four sections. Finally, two coding bits are employed to construct the CMM samples: a water unit for bit “0” and a photosensitive resin unit for bit “1.” Experimental results demonstrate that the CMM can dynamically manipulate ultrasonic beams. The proposed CMMs hold substantial potential for acoustic communication and dynamic detection applications.},

Experimental results show that the NGV feature in honeycomb structure is unlike in isotropic plates, and it only appears in the front half of the hexagon hollow unit, which is surrounded by the honeycomb core. More notably, the NGV feature disappears in the skin–core debonding area and reappears in the intact area, suggesting potential applicability for detecting debonding defects.},

Our concern is not on the thermal properties at the nanoscale, but rather on relating thermal macroscopic properties to the microstructure for submicronic to micronic AlN films. As the mean free path for AlN material is about 100 nm, the thickness of our films lies between 400 nm and 2 μ m. The k measurements were conducted using the ultra-fast transient hot strip technique. It was found that the k values of the deposited films change depending on both the substrate type and the film thickness. For the 500 nm AlN thick film, k value was about 250 W m −1 K −1 for AlN-DCMS films grown on 10 nm AlN-MBE/Si against 90 W m −1 K −1 for those deposited on 200 nm AlN-Kyma/Si. The thermal boundary resistance has been computed equal to (0.25 ± 0.08) × 10 −9 K m 2 W −1 on 10 nm AlN-MBE/Si against (3.56 ± 1.50) × 10 −9 K m 2 W −1 on 200 nm AlN-Kyma/Si. Additionally, both pole figures and high resolution transmission electron microscopy confirm k results. In fact, pole figures confirm the good crystal quality of the film on both substrates, but HR-TEM analyses show that the AlN films grown on 10 nm AlN-MBE/Si template exhibit good crystalline quality with an epitaxial regrowth and abrupt interface compared to those obtained for 200 nm AlN-Kyma/Si. It also appears that the thermal boundary resistance plays a major role in the thermal properties of AlN films.},

However, the increase in vertical cell layers has also introduced challenges such as higher power consumption and diminished current levels, both of which compromise the reliability of memory cells. At the same time, the demand for high cell reliability and low power consumption has been growing, driven by the expanding needs of storage applications in big data and cloud services. In this study, we propose an optically readable light-emitting memory (LEM) as a unit cell within 3D-NAND architecture. This innovative design exhibits both effective memory performance and light-emitting capabilities. Unlike conventional memory cells that require all WLs to be biased during read operation, the LEM requires only a read bias on the selected WL to detect the light intensity, which directly correlates with the stored data state. By applying voltage only to the selected WL, power consumption is reduced by approximately 45%. In addition, issues such as read disturbances and low cell currents that affect cell reliability are effectively mitigated, resulting in an expected improvement in the read window.},

The thickness of a gallium oxide (GaO x ) layer at the SiO 2 /GaN interface was estimated and correlated with the hole trap generation. The 200 ° C -deposited SiO 2 /GaN MOS structures exhibited a smaller amount of fast hole traps and a thinner GaO x interlayer than the 400 ° C -deposited samples. In the 200 ° C -deposited samples, annealing at a temperature below 600 ° C did not lead to an increase in the fast hole trap and GaO x layer thickness, while the amount of fast traps significantly increased just after 800 ° C -annealing in O 2 ambient, accompanied by the growth of the GaO x interlayer. These findings suggest that the major origin of fast hole traps in SiO 2 /GaN MOS structures is a thermally induced defect existing inside a GaO x interlayer and that the low-temperature SiO 2 deposition is effective in reducing the fast traps.},

An inverse correlation was observed between 2DEG density and epitaxial thickness across all undoped In-alloyed samples. Furthermore, achieving high 2DEG densities (exceeding 10 13 cm −2 ) is significantly facilitated by n -type doping concentrations above 10 17 cm −3 in ε-InGaO. These insights not only augment the understanding of polarization effects in ε-Ga 2 O 3 heterostructures but also provide a strategic framework for enhancing 2DEG density in ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based devices, which offers significant potential for advancing ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based high electron mobility transistors for power and RF applications.},

  abstract     = {A metal/n-Ga 2 O 3 /p-diamond heterojunction diode with superior high-temperature performance was demonstrated in this work. The p-type diamond was lightly boron doped, and the Ga 2 O 3 film was grown via atomic layer deposition without intentional doping. The forward current density increased with temperature, while the reverse current decreased at elevated temperatures. This behavior was attributed to the distinct carrier ionization dynamics across varying temperature ranges. Under high reverse voltage stress, the reverse current remained relatively stable, with no breakdown occurring up to 498 K. An avalanche breakdown voltage of 186 V at 498 K indicates the diode's robust high-voltage endurance capability. These findings underscore the potential of the metal/n-Ga 2 O 3 /p-diamond heterojunction diode for high-temperature and high-voltage applications.},

  abstract     = {SrTiO 3 (STO) displays a broad spectrum of physical properties, including superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and photoconductivity, making it a standout semiconductor material. Despite extensive research, the oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity in STO has remained elusive. This study leverages first-principles calculations and systematically investigates the intrinsic defect properties of STO. The results reveal that V O , V Sr , and Ti Sr are the dominant intrinsic defects, influencing STO's conductivity under varying O chemical potentials (oxygen partial pressures). Under O-poor condition, V O is the predominant donor, while V Sr is the main acceptor. As the oxygen pressure increases, Ti Sr emerges as a critical donor defect under O-rich conditions, significantly affecting the conductivity. Additionally, the study elucidates the abnormal phenomenon where V Ti , typically an acceptor, exhibits donor-like behavior due to the formation of O-trimer. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of how intrinsic defects tune the Fermi level, thereby altering STO's conductivity from metallic to n-type and eventually to p-type across different O chemical potentials. These insights resolve the long-standing issue of oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity and explain the observed metallic conductivity in oxygen-deficient STO.},

  abstract     = {The fabrication of complex nano-scale structures, which is a crucial step in the scaling of (nano)electronic devices, often leads to residual stress in the different layers present. This stress gradient can change many of the material properties, leading to changes in device performance, especially in the active part of the transistor, the channel. Measuring, understanding, and, ultimately, controlling the stress fields is hence crucial for many design steps. The level of stress can in principle be measured by micro-Raman spectroscopy. This, however, requires a priori knowledge of the mechanical properties of the material. However, mechanical properties start to deviate from the bulk values when film dimensions become thinner than 5 nm. If this effect is ignored, errors of up to 400% can be introduced in the extracted stress profile. In this work, we illustrate this effect for a range of Si (001) slabs with different silicon film thicknesses, ranging from 5 to 0.7 nm and provide best practices for the proper interpretation of micro-Raman stress measurements.},

  abstract     = {Device applications of ultra-wide-bandgap diamond rely on the precise control of both carrier type and concentration. However, due to the strong covalent bonds in bulk diamond, conventional doping methods have struggled to achieve large-scale tuning of its properties. Surface charge transfer doping (SCTD) is seen as a simple and effective solution, leveraging energy-level differences between surface dopant and the semiconductor to regulate carrier properties efficiently. Here, we conducted a comprehensive theoretical study on p -type SCTD of hydrogen-terminated diamond (100) surface [diamond(100):H] using low-dimensional transition metal oxides. The doping effects of the molecular MoO 3 and monolayer MoO 3 were first explored. The areal hole density for molecular-MoO 3 -doped diamond(100):H sharply rises and then slightly decreases with increasing MoO 3 density, reaching a peak of 7.55 × 10 13 cm −2 —surpassing the maximum value achieved with a MoO 3 monolayer. For identical MoO 3 densities, a stronger interaction with diamond(100):H results in a greater areal hole density. We also studied one-dimensional chain-like CrO 3 and two-dimensional layered V 2 O 5 . However, a V 2 O 5 monolayer cannot achieve the saturation areal hole density due to the large energy separation between the conduction band minimum (CBM) of V 2 O 5 and the valence band maximum (VBM) of diamond(100):H. Increasing the number of V 2 O 5 monolayers will enhance the doping effect. Overall, optimal doping can be achieved with smaller dimensions, higher density and thickness of the transition metal oxides, stronger interactions with diamond(100):H, and a larger energy separation between the dopant's CBM and diamond(100):H's VBM. This study provides theoretical guidance to develop superior diamond-based electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {During the synthesis of tellurium (Te) crystals, the coexistence of multiple crystalline phases (α-Te, β-Te, and γ-Te) with diverse structures commonly occurs, leading to instability and complexity in the performance of Te-based optoelectronic devices. This study employs physical vapor deposition to synthesize Te crystals of various sizes and morphologies, followed by spatially and temperature-dependent evaluation using Raman mapping and infrared photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Spatially resolved results reveal that the size and morphology of Te crystals significantly influence the energy and peak profiles of Raman and PL spectra. Statistical analysis of spatially random sampling indicates the PL peak energies of Te crystals follow a lognormal distribution in terms of their occurrence frequencies, reflecting the complex interplay of multiple factors during crystal growth. This results in the coexistence of α-Te and β-Te phases, forming α/β-Te heterophase homojunction (HPHJ). Meanwhile, temperature-dependent PL results, obtained for the range of 3–290 K, reveal multi-peak competitive behavior in the PL spectra, accompanied by S-shaped shifts in peak energy. These features can be rationally explained by an interface transition-recombination mechanism based on the I-type α/β-Te HPHJ model. It also confirms infrared PL spectroscopy is an effective method for identifying the crystalline phase composition of Te crystals.},

  abstract     = {AlN stands out for its remarkable figures of merit for electronic and photonic devices, attributed to its ultrawide bandgap of ∼6.1 eV and an exceptionally high critical field of ∼15 MV/cm. More recently, zirconium (Zr) doped AlN (AlN:Zr) has also been identified as a promising material platform for the exploration of solid-state qubits for quantum information and technology, high performance piezoelectric acoustic wave resonators, and optically triggered ultrafast power switching devices facilitated by optically activating Zr related impurities. Despite the significant potential, the ability for producing AlN:Zr epitaxial structures has yet to be established. In this study, we have achieved AlN:Zr epilayers with a high Zr doping level [N Zr ] of up to 10 20 cm −3 using industrial standard metal-organic chemical vapor deposition growth technique. High crystalline quality of AlN:Zr was confirmed by x-ray diffraction, revealing a narrow full width at half maximum of the (002) rocking curve at 216 arcsec for 1.8 μ m thick epilayers deposited on sapphire at [N Zr ]=10 20 cm −3 . Zr doping was observed to slightly increase the c-lattice constant to 4.992 Å for AlN:Zr (at [N Zr ]=10 20 cm −3 ) compared to 4.980 Å for undoped AlN. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement results verified the substitution of Zr at the Al site (Zr Al ). The formation of (Zr Al –V N ) complexes, which are predicted to possess all the desired properties required by quantum qubits, was confirmed through optical absorption studies. The realization of high-quality AlN:Zr epilayers significantly broadens the scope of technologically significant device applications for AlN.},

Simultaneously, influenced by the slow-light effect of rubidium-dispersive vapor in the SA configuration, the fundamental repetition rate of the mode locking can vary between 261 and 228 MHz. Pulse delay tests conducted outside the resonator provide conclusive evidence of a gigahertz-bandwidth slow light within the Faraday laser. The mode-locking technique presented here can be applied to pulsed light sources of other quantum transition lines by setting appropriate atomic filter parameters.

In this study, using first-principles calculations, we investigated the effects of S and Cl co-doping on the electronic properties of CdTe Σ3 (112) Te-core GBs. The Σ3 (112) Te-core GBs present challenges due to deep gap states caused by Te-Te and Cd-Cd wrong bonds. Notably, the segregation behavior of S dopants within the GBs suggests their potential to significantly influence the electronic properties. When co-doped with Cl, it is evident that S is more likely to occupy interstitial sites rather than substituting for Te atoms under Te-rich conditions. The co-passivation of S and Cl at the GBs can eliminate all gap states, thereby enhancing electrical performance.

While existing piezoelectric FETs sense physiological signals based on pressure or compressive strain, movements such as bending of the elbow or knee joints are more common in physiological activities than external pressure. To address this, this study innovatively introduces FE-FETs that are regulated through the flexoelectric effect induced by bending. In this study, MoS 2 with flexoelectric properties is utilized as the channel region. By bending the FE-FETs, the flexoelectric effect is induced, generating a flexoelectric response voltage that alters the Schottky barrier. The results confirm that varying the bending angle of the FE-FETs effectively modulates their transconductance and carrier mobility. Remarkably, the combination of traditional gate voltage and the flexoelectric effect results in a maximum carrier mobility of 49.63 cm 2 /V · s within a drain voltage range of 0–1 V, which is approximately 10.6 times higher than the carrier mobility of 4.68 cm 2 /V·s under traditional gate voltage alone.

Conversely, higher supersaturation conditions restore desired step-flow morphology, resembling low-impurity growth states. It is also shown that the step-bunching formed under lower supersaturation conditions and high-impurity concentration might induce unwanted structural defects and compensate the free carriers. These findings underscore the delicate interplay between dopant concentrations, growth morphology, and supersaturation in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy-grown (100) β-Ga 2 O 3 films, providing a comprehensive understanding of optimizing their electrical properties with respect to power electronics applications.},

  abstract     = {Cubic barium stannate (BaSnO 3 ) has emerged as a promising platform for optoelectronic devices due to its remarkable room-temperature electron mobility, high transparency, excellent thermal stability, and flexible doping control. In this work, a photonic synaptic device—an image sensor integrating memory and processing—was proposed based on the persistent photoconductivity of oxygen-deficient BaSnO 3 thin films. The device demonstrated a light-tunable response, allowing it to replicate key functions of biological synapses. Importantly, this device can be utilized as a reservoir layer in a reservoir computing system, achieving a recognition accuracy of over 90% when identifying handwritten digit images. This work underscores the potential of BaSnO 3 for retinomorphic computing applications.},

We find that the L 2 1 phase is more stable than the XA phase across both ordered and disordered configurations. The variations in lattice parameters with off-stoichiometry are attributed to the atomic radii of the dopants. Our results indicate that Zn 2 Ru 1− x A x Mn alloys exhibit ferromagnetic metallic behavior, driven primarily by Mn-Mn, Ru-Mn, and A-Mn exchange interactions. These interactions are further analyzed to calculate the Curie temperature using the mean-field approximation. The Curie temperature for Zn 2 RuMn is found to be approximately 300 K, which increases to 428 K upon Co doping. Our findings suggest that doping provides a means to control the Curie temperature, offering substantial potential for applications in room-temperature magnetocaloric materials and shape memory alloys. This tunability enhances the functional versatility of these alloys, making them promising candidates for future technological applications.},

Single emission is a technique that involves the luminescence intensity ratio, so fluctuations in the intensity of the excitation radiation do not affect the result. This technique has the advantage of involving conventional methods and is not affected by optical dispersion, so it provides reliable results suitable for practical applications. Using this method, we investigate the temperature-sensing characteristics of Bi 24 Al 2 O 39 :0.5%Mn 5+ phosphors from 300 to 380 K. Under 970 nm excitation, the maximal relative sensitivity is 3.54% K −1 in the physiological temperature range (300–330 K) and reaches 3.98% K −1 at 351 K.

Considering this, we have probed electron–phonon interaction in halide perovskite systems with the introduction of defects and investigated the thermal effect on this interaction. Here, we report Raman spectroscopic study of the thermal evolution of electron–phonon coupling, which is tunable with the crystal growth conditions, in the halide perovskite systems Cs 2 AgInCl 6 and Cs 2 NaInCl 6 . The signature of electron–phonon coupling is observed as a Fano anomaly in the lowest frequency phonon mode (51 cm −1 ), which evolves with temperature. In addition, we observe a broad band in the photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the defect-mediated systems, which is otherwise absent in defect-free halide perovskite. The simultaneous observation of the Fano anomaly in the Raman spectrum and the emergence of the PL band suggests the defect-mediated midgap states and the consequent existence of electron–phonon coupling in the double perovskite.},

We quantified the glassy structure via the relaxation enthalpy, Δ rel H , which did not significantly change for MGs flash-annealed at a low number of cycles. Their hardness monotonically reduced. However, when more than ten FA cycles were applied, Δ rel H , perceivably decreased, while corresponding hardness increased. High-energy x-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the medium-range ordering of the corresponding structure initially rose and then decreased with an increasing number of FA cycles. This structural change is accompanied by first a hardness decrease followed by an increase. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that throughout the shift from low to high cycles, the structural non-uniformity changed from being non-uniform to more uniform. Through a combination of experiments and simulations, we have shown the non-monotonic relationship between the structural heterogeneity of MGs and cyclic treatments, contributing to a better understanding of the relationship between structural control techniques, microstructure, and properties.},

By fully implementing the direction-duplex strategy through these meta-atoms, we can directly assign asymmetric phase profiles to the Janus meta-lens in order to achieve a direction-selective focusing configuration, thereby effectively improving aperture utilization.

In this work, we achieved THz beam-splitting and field-induced nonlinear frequency shifting functions within a single THz nano-metasurface device. The device consists of single split-ring resonators (s-SRRs) with a nanogap on GaAs substrate. The pattern design based on the Pancharatnam–Berry (P-B) phase principle can split the incident wave into three beams. Meanwhile, its frequency shifting capability, which varies with the E-field, has been thoroughly investigated. The device performance was experimentally evaluated by an angle-resolved THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system and a strong-field THz-TDS system. This device could serve as a promising research platform for integrating THz with nano-optics and holds the potential for ultrafast modulation, offering application prospects in radar, wireless communication, and electromagnetic protection.},

Our findings reveal an apparent lubrication by single-layer graphene coating, as well as correlation between the COF and the brittleness of the substrate. Through a comprehensive characterization using Raman spectroscopy, we propose a protective mechanism by which graphene can effectively dissipate the resulting shear stress generated during friction and delay the wear generation until the graphene layer fails and the bare material surface starts to rub directly, which is confirmed by finite element analysis simulation.

Using synchrotron- and lab-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as x-ray-excited Auger electron spectroscopy, we observe distinct differences to RbF-PDT on absorber surfaces with the common GGI of ∼0.3. In particular, RbF-PDT reduces sodium and oxide content at the surface, while the copper concentration at the surface is not affected. We find no spectral evidence for the formation of a distinct Rb–In–Se surface layer. In addition, we observe that the GGI ratio at the surface is slightly decreased due to a reduction of the Ga and an increase in the In concentration, which may explain the observed improvement in the power conversion efficiency after the PDT (from 6.8% to 7.3%).},

Herein, we introduce a method of ink droplet manipulation via near infrared light-driven on lubricant infused surfaces. Rather than heating the substrate itself, this method uses near-infrared light to irradiate one end of an ink droplet, creating a temperature gradient inside it and forming a Marangoni flow that pushes the droplet forward. It is demonstrated that the ink droplets would experience two stages during sliding, and the movement ability of the ink droplets depends on their absorbance and size; specifically, the average acceleration and steady velocity of the droplets are both positively correlated with their absorbance and negatively correlated with their volume. The work not only proves that the method can realize conventional individual droplet manipulation such as controllable transport along arbitrary paths, but also proposes a unique customized transport and merging strategy for multiple ink droplets. This investigation offers a simple and versatile manipulation approach for ink droplets, and the relevant results have potential applications in the fields of precise maneuver of light-driven droplets and droplet-based inkjet printing.},

  abstract     = {We propose a serial-wedge-shaped groove with a wettability gradient to achieve continuous directional transport of droplets. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that this design provides a sustained driving force and reduces energy barriers at junctions, facilitating continuous droplet motion. Moreover, higher temperatures and greater wettability gradients are shown to enhance the efficiency of continuous transport. Theoretical analysis further reveals that increasing surface hydrophobicity, width ratio, and droplet size can reduce energy barriers, thereby improving transport performance. These findings are expected to improve the understanding of continuous directional droplet transport and shed light on its manipulation.},

This design incorporates an extended n-charge layer to decrease the breakdown voltage and optimizes the absorption region thickness to reduce the electron transit time. By applying three electrodes to individually modulate the electric fields in the absorption and avalanche region, respectively, both of low avalanche breakdown voltage (−8.1 V) and high bandwidth (20.4 GHz) of the surface-illuminated detector can be achieved. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of weak light detection is improved to −45 dBm. The responsivity of the APD is 60.76 A/W at 1550 nm when the voltage is biased at −13.5 V. The low voltage and improved bandwidth can meet the requirements for weak light detection and other applications demanding such sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Structured light adjusts optical trapping forces through flexible structure design. However, it is challenging to evaluate optical forces on microscopic particles in structured light due to high computational hardware requirements, prolonged computation times, and data inefficiencies associated with solving optical trapping forces using generalized Lorenz–Mie theory. We propose the use of deep neural networks for predicting and tuning the optical trapping force of cusp-catastrophe autofocusing beams on Mie particles. Inputs include beam's structural parameters, laser power, and the size of captured particle, while the output is the optical trapping force. Following iterative training, the neural network achieved a mean square error of 1.5 × 10 − 5 ⁠ . Evaluation using 150 sets of test data revealed that 95.3% of the predictions had a relative error of less than 1.8%, indicating a high prediction accuracy. In contrast to traditional computational methods, the neural network model demonstrates a remarkable efficiency improvement— 10 4 times faster in optimizing beams for optical trapping. This advancement demonstrates the advantage of deep learning neural networks for the application of structured light including autofocusing beams in optical tweezers.},

We demonstrate the alteration of delayed fluorescence dynamics by hybrid states formation through the interaction of light with a thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecule embedded in a conventional Fabry–Pérot cavity. The proximity of cavity resonance with the excited state absorption is modified by manipulating the incident angles (with sample) instead of varying the active layer thickness. The coupling-induced hybrid states are observed by angle-dependent emission spectroscopy and lifetime measurements. The variation in average emission lifetime with respect to incident angle is over 10 μ s and is accompanied by significant changes in the full width at half maxima (factor of three). The control of emission via a barrier-free route or reverse intersystem crossing transition is demonstrated from these measurements. These findings suggest the possibility of tailoring intermediate states for lasing, where exciton density inversion can enhance spontaneous emission.},

This paper realizes this imaging by a dual-mode imaging on optical parametric amplification (OPA) with a vortex laser pump. This design includes signal imaging and idler imaging, which have complementary point spread functions with each other. The signal acts as bright-field imaging to record morphologic information, whereas the idler does so for spiral phase contrast imaging to capture the featured details with high brightness and contrast, which has been experimentally confirmed with a target of herb tissue. By utilizing the coupling relation among the pump, signal, and idler, the information from the recorded signal and idler images can be merged, which allows us to reconstruct the target picture owning both high-contrast morphologies and high-brightness fine details. Due to high OPA gain, our imaging can work with weak illumination. Its field-of-view covers an area of 0.33 × 0.33 mm 2 with a spatial resolution up to 228 lp/mm. This OPA imaging also provides an effective way for the imaging required nonlinear frequency conversion.},

On-chip photonic integrated one-dimensional (1D) microcavities have great potential for high-performance mid-IR sensing because of their high sensitivity and compact structure. However, high-performance 1D microcavities based on the promising silicon-on-sapphire (SoS) MIR platform have not yet been designed or realized. Based on the photonic band structure induced by 1D photonic crystals (PhC), a high-performance Bragg reflector, an inward apodized Bragg grating, and a free spectral range (FSR)-free PhC microcavity integrated system operating in the MIR waveband were developed on the SoS platform. By carefully designing the period and penetration depth of the corrugation in the Bragg reflector, a stopband of 45 nm and an extinction ratio of −12 dB were achieved. The inward apodized Bragg grating was optimized by adjusting the apodization depth and the number of periods, resulting in a quality factor of 1043 at a wavelength of 3088.4 nm. Furthermore, introducing a Fabry–Pérot (F-P) cavity between two Bragg reflectors (with side-coupled light) and precisely tuning the stopband of the Bragg reflector and the FSR of the F-P cavity enabled the realization of an FSR-free PhC microcavity. This microcavity exhibited a single deep resonance dip with subnanometer bandwidth across a record-wide operational waveband from 3025 to 3200 nm, achieving a quality factor of approximately 5090. The MIR 1D PhC microcavities on the SoS platform hold great promise for high-performance gas detection and molecular sensing in future applications.},

While QHE has been predominantly observed in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems, recently, many efforts have been devoted to searching for the QHE in unconventional materials platforms beyond the classical framework to extend the horizon of the QHE. In this Perspective, we highlight recent important experimental discoveries and progress on the QHE material platforms beyond 2DEG platforms, such as three-dimensional QHE, Weyl-orbit-based QHE, and QHE in two-dimensional insulators. In addition, novel phenomena arising from incorporating QHE with other exotic quantum states, such as topological band structures and superconductivity, will be discussed. We also present the emerging field-free version of QHE–quantum anomalous Hall effect on its transport characteristics, working principles as well as potential applications in quantum metrology and quantum computing. With the exploration of these unconventional QHE hosts and the development of the understanding of new physics arising from the interplay between QHE and other physical systems, QHE will continue to play a critical role in both advancing fundamental physics and developing next-generation quantum technologies.},

In this work, we propose a similar method for realizing synthetic frequency dimensions on a phononic platform. Specifically, we design a parametrically driven phononic ring resonator composed of cantilever beams and conduct numerical investigations into the modal dynamics along this synthetic frequency dimension. Our approach employs detuned spatiotemporal stiffness modulation, which generates synthetic electric fields for the phononic modes. This modulation induces both harmonic and anharmonic Bloch oscillations along the synthetic frequency dimension. To elucidate these modal dynamics, we numerically construct and visualize a dynamic band structure within the Brillouin zone in the presence of synthetic electric fields.},

Results show that the voltage frequency has a significant influence on the vibration and discharge characteristics of the water droplet, and a strong correlation has been observed between these two characteristics. When approaching the dynamic natural vibration range, the droplet will cause a greater water loss due to intensive vibration, resulting in a smaller stable volume and, consequently, a smaller length vibration amplitude and discharge intensity. The forced vibration model has been enhanced to explain these phenomena. The findings further advanced the theory of electro-driven control of the water droplet in vibration and corona discharge.},

The results show that the proposed configuration can increase the thrust and induced flow velocity efficiently compared to the conventional one.

The 3ω method stands out as an ideal technique that meets these criteria, offering a simple and sensitive approach to assess the thermal properties of materials. In this study, we introduce a 3ω sensor fabricated on submicron-thick parylene substrates. The parylene substrate not only provides the necessary flexibility but also acts as an insulating layer, essential for the measurement of conductive materials. The sensor's sensitivity was enhanced by reducing the thickness of the parylene substrate. A thermal peeling film was utilized as a supporting substrate during the fabrication of the 3ω sensor with a thin parylene substrate, which has a thickness of 0.77 μ m.

  abstract     = {Ultra-broadband frequency entangled biphotons have exceptionally short temporal duration and can achieve narrow Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interference patterns, making them vital for quantum metrology applications. However, the bandwidth of previously demonstrated biphotons used for HOM interference has been limited to less than 400 nm, which is not wide enough to achieve ultra-high precision in quantum metrology. In order to push the precision to its limit, we have theoretically designed a 20-mm-long chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPPLN) crystal with type-II phase matching. Pumped by a 405 nm laser, the down-converted signal and idler photons can cover the wavelength range from 420 to 5200 nm, approaching the transparent upper bound of the LN crystal. In the simulated Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interference, the full-width at half-maximum of the interference pattern is 965 attoseconds, with a visibility of 99.44%. Following a similar approach, we also designed a type-0 CPPLN crystal to achieve higher brightness. These ultra-broadband biphoton sources can generate ultra-narrow quantum interference patterns, which have the potential for attosecond-level high-precision quantum metrology.},

  abstract     = {UV-induced degradation is an important factor affecting the stability of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. Many works investigated the root cause of this degradation previously, but its coupling with other external stress, such as temperature, has rarely been reported. Here, we examine the decrease in SHJ solar cells induced by UV irradiation at different temperatures (−30 and 80 °C) using ultraviolet lamps at 200 W/m 2 for 300 h. The results showed that the UV-induced degradation is more severe at low temperature (−30 °C), leading to a significant power decrease (13.5% on average) compared with the power attenuation of the solar cell at 80 °C (1.59% on average). At a low temperature (−30 °C), the V OC and FF evidently decrease much faster. Light soaking can repair the damage to some extent, but the power conversion efficiency cannot restore to the initial value. A 3D microscope confirmed this is because the silver metal electrodes are permanently degraded. These findings challenge the standard International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) stability test for solar cells, in other words, we have to take into account multi-field coupling to evaluate the long-term reliability of solar cells in real environments.},

Although there have been many studies on charge transport properties of devices based on traditional inorganic crystals and organic amorphous films, such charge behavior within emerging quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs)—which are composed of amorphous nanocrystal films with strong quantum confinement effects—has rarely been discussed. Here, we demonstrate that the tunneling effect really occurs in the hybrid QLEDs with ZnO as the electron-transport layer. By suppressing the thermal effect, a negative differential resistance (NDR) phenomenon is observed by decreasing the working temperature of the QLED low to 150 K. Two types of quantum dots (QDs) with different shell structures (i.e., different tunneling barrier) are used to comparatively examine the tunneling effect. The current density–voltage properties of the QLEDs reveal that the device based on QDs with the sharp core-shell structure (i.e., larger tunneling barrier) exhibits more obvious NDR behavior, which is attributed to the stronger tunneling effect. Our results offer significant insight into the charge dynamics and working mechanism in the QLEDs.},

  abstract     = {To develop low-power, miniature, nonvolatile memory resistor integrated devices for in-memory computing technologies, the exploration of atomic-scale ferroelectric channel semiconductor devices is necessary. We theoretically designed tunnel junction devices based on two-dimensional ferroelectric semiconductors, with two-dimensional metal TaSe 2 used as the top electrode and van der Waals bilayer boron arsenide (BAs) as the ferroelectric semiconductor channel, aiming to achieve high-performance, low-power, two-dimensional ferroelectric memory resistors. Our findings demonstrate that the bilayer BAs, upon contact with metal electrodes, can achieve two stable and switchable ferroelectric states. Interlayer relative sliding enables stable and alternating two-dimensional ferroelectric domains, altering the types of triple potential barriers at interfaces from Schottky contacts to Ohmic contacts. Thus, under the modulation of the “triple barrier” mechanism, control over channel carrier switching is achieved, resulting in a tunneling electroresistance of 10 4 %. Additionally, non-equilibrium Green's function results indicate nonlinear changes in the I–V curve when switching between the two stable ferroelectric states, highlighting the multi-resistive state nature of channel resistance. Our research underscores the potential of sliding ferroelectric tunnel junctions in integrating nonvolatile storage and computing units, emphasizing their innovative applications in in-memory computing technologies.},

However, the low reliability of HfO x -based memristors is the key factor hindering their widespread practical applications. Herein, amorphous HfO x (a-HfO x ) films are used as the switching layers to construct memristors, and the nitrogen treatment strategy is employed to enhance the switching characteristics. All the fabricated Al/a-HfO x /ITO memristors demonstrate bipolar digital RS behaviors, and specifically, the 500 °C-treated a-HfO x device exhibits highly reliable RS performance, including low cycle-to-cycle variability, concentrated distributions and low operating voltages, long-term retention capacity (>10 4 s), and good cycle endurance (>200 cycles). The mechanisms and physical models for enhanced switching performance are thoroughly elucidated, revealing that the formation of stable oxygen vacancy–dinitrogen complexes confines the conductive filament path and significantly reduces filament randomness during formation and rupture. This work renders an effective material engineering strategy for widening a path toward designing highly reliable nonvolatile data storage devices with striking switching performances.},

Two important parameters are the ion conductivity and the chemical stability over a wide range of operating conditions. In this vein, Rb 2 Ti 2 O 5 (RTO) has recently been found displaying remarkable properties such as superionic conduction and equivalent colossal dielectric constant. Here, an approach to the study of the electrical properties of the layered RTO 100-nm scale is presented. Characterizations by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements of mechanically exfoliated RTO micro-flakes via the so-called adhesive-tape technique are reported. Finally, the results of electrical measurements performed on an exfoliated RTO micro-flake are presented and are found to be consistent with the results obtained on macroscopic bulk crystals.},

The increment in α resulted in improved drain-to-source current ( I DS ) and extrinsic transconductance ( G m ). The voltage-blocking performance also showed significant enhancement with increasing α due to the mitigation of edge crowding, achieving a 40% increase in the breakdown voltage ( V BR ) for devices with an α of 15° and gate-to-drain length ( L GD ) of 10 μ m. A detailed simulation analysis of the electric field distribution within the fin at the gate electrode edge identified an optimal α of approximately 25°, which effectively mitigates electric field crowding and has the potential to enhance the DC performance of the MOSFETs.

However, only a sparse physically realized graphene-based synaptic H + -EGTs have been reported due to the difficulty of achieving a high concentration of protons at the electrolyte–graphene interface. Here, we have reported the H + -EGTs with a highly defective graphene channel and a gel electrolyte [H 3 PO 4 /poly(vinyl alcohol)], which is based on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of highly defected-graphene, performing the similar functions as the common artificial synaptic transistors, with good retention (<1% attenuation per minute), analog tunability (>200 nonvolatile states), and precisely controllable resistance (∼0.4% step flipped per synaptic event). In addition, the cyclic voltammetry test was applied to confirm the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the graphene channel. It is expected that this principle can provide ideas for designing graphene-based artificial synapses enabling integrated functions of in-memory computing and in-memory sensing for the neuromorphic system.},

However, the high sensitivity of perovskite films to the molecular groups and concentration limited their commercialization applications. Here, we develop a facile and low-cost passivation strategy that is compatible with traditional fabrication processes of PeLEDs. By depositing a thin LiF layer using vacuum thermal evaporation technique, the defects of perovskite film are effectively passivated. Simultaneously, the thin LiF layer protects the excitons formed in perovskite from quenching by the electron-transport layer. Due to the synergistic effect of LiF, an efficient green PeLED is achieved with a maximum current efficiency of 47.0 cd/A and luminance of 30 280 cd/m 2 , representing respective 65% and 166% increase than that of the control device without LiF modification layer (28.5 cd/A and 11 380 cd/m 2 ).

  abstract     = {Controllable operation between different magnetic topological states, such as skyrmions and bimerons, which share the same topological charge but exhibit distinct properties, has garnered extensive attention due to their potential applications in future high-density memory technologies. However, their remarkable origin mechanisms (e.g., in-plane and out-of-plane easy magnetic axis) make effective control of their switching a huge challenge. Based on first-principles calculations, we explore the 2D RuClBr/Ga 2 S 3 van der Waals heterostructure and find that the skyrmion and bimeron topological states could be switched instantaneously and efficiently by regulating the electric polarization of Ga 2 S 3 with an external electric field. Additionally, atomic spin dynamic simulations reveal that the evolved skyrmion and bimeron magnetic configurations are highly resistant to external disturbances, enduring external magnetic fields of up to 20 T. This efficient transformation between magnetic states is driven by magnetic anisotropy accompanying changes in the polarization state. Our work predicts that the RuClBr/Ga 2 S 3 system is an ideal platform for addressing this control problem.},

Recent studies have found that the van der Waals crystal material NbOCl 2 has a high efficiency in SHG, and this material does not undergo any change in electronic structure or weakening of excitonic effect during stacking, making it a scalable SHG crystal. Here, we designed and fabricated a single resonant Fabry–Pérot (FP) microcavity to enhance the SHG of NbOCl 2 by amplifying the local electric field of the excitation light. The cavity was fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and the deposition process was optimized to avoid the damage of the NbOCl 2 sample. Our measurements confirmed that the SHG of the NbOCl 2 sample can be amplified more than 30 times on the distributed Bragg reflector (half of the FP cavity), and more than 200 times inside the FP cavity. This method provides ideas for efficiently enhancing harmonics and directions for on-chip integrated photonic devices.},

To deepen our understanding of this transition and enable its functionalities, ultrafast dynamics, especially lattice dynamics of antiferroelectricity, are essential to be demonstrated. In this work, the picosecond acoustics technique is applied to measure the sound velocity of a high-quality PbZrO 3 epitaxial thin film with a thickness of ∼110 nm, determining it to be 5879 ± 11 m/s. More importantly, our in situ measurements reveal a reduction in sound velocity of approximately 6% during the AFE-FE phase transition under an external electric field of ∼364 kV/cm at ambient conditions. This reduction can increase to about 12% with an elevated electric field of approximately 545 kV/cm. Additionally, we found that this field-induced ferroelectric phase is metastable and the recovery takes up to tens of hours at ambient conditions, indicating a memory effect of the field-induced state. These findings suggest that the AFE-FE phase transition in PbZrO 3 thin films holds promise for applications in acoustic wave manipulation.},

Here, we investigate HOD-graphene, an emergent macroporous carbon material featuring a unique configuration of hexagonal, octagonal, and dodecagonal carbon rings. This distinctive structure imparts exceptional mechanical properties to the material. Using a combination of first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that HOD-graphene hosts multiple nodal lines within both its electronic and phononic spectra. For the electronic bands, three nodal lines and several Dirac points manifest near the Fermi energy, generating unconventional electronic properties and distinct topological characteristics. Likewise, the phonon spectrum displays pronounced nodal lines, intricately associated with the material's vibrational modes. Our findings provide a promising platform for exploring the coexistence of electronic and phononic multiple nodal lines in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues for realizing exotic quantum phenomena.},

  abstract     = {MXenes are a large family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides that possess excellent electrical conductivity, high volumetric capacitance, great mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity. In this work, we generalize the concept of multihyperuniformity, an exotic state that can exist in a disordered multi-component system, to MXenes. Disordered hyperuniform systems possess an isotropic local structure that lacks traditional translational and orientational order, yet they completely suppress infinite-wavelength density fluctuations as in perfect crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range order. In particular, we evaluate the static structure factor of the individual components present in the high-entropy (HE) MXene experimental sample TiVCMoCr based on high-resolution scanning electron microscope imaging data, which suggests that this HE MXene system is at least effectively multihyperuniform (MH). We then devise a packing algorithm to generate MH models of HE MXene systems. The MH HE MXenes are predicted to be energetically more stable compared to the prevailing (quasi)random models of the HE MXenes due to the hidden long-range order. Moreover, the MH structure exhibits a distinctly smaller lattice distortion, which has a vital effect on the electronic properties of HE MXenes, such as the density of states and charge distribution. This systematic study of HE MXenes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these systems and suggests possible exotic physical properties, as endowed by the multihyperuniformity.},

A remarkably high conductivity and nominal charge density has been found in the head-to-head ferroelastic domain wall of tetragonal barium titanate. Conductivity of this domain wall decreases by several orders of magnitude when the temperature drops down below about 5 °C when the tetragonal phase transforms to the orthorhombic one. We explored the evolution of these ferroelectric charged domain walls in BaTiO 3 crystals, while they undergo this phase transition by in situ optical microscopy. Our results reveal that, below the phase transition, the domains adjacent to charge domain walls become twinned, and the head-to-head charged domain wall transforms into a superdomain wall, which is broken into alternating micrometer-scale segments with and without the excess bound charge. Since the macroscopic conductive channel along such fragmented superdomain wall is disrupted, these observations explain the observed loss of the domain wall conductivity below the phase transition.},

Such structural phase transitions have conventionally been modulated by doping with additives or by controlling the composition. However, it is considered that the coexistence region between the R 3 c and P 4 bm phases is important for enhancing the energy storage behavior because the phase reversal between them, caused by the electric field, can cause the BNT-based ceramics to exhibit an antiferroelectric-like pinched hysteresis loop. In this study, the structural phase transition of BNT–BT ceramics is promoted through process control, that is, by adjusting the cooling rate, and then the stabilization of the P 4 bm phase and the expansion of the coexistence region of the R 3 c and P 4 bm phases were examined, which results in enhanced energy storage behavior. Consequently, BNT–BT ceramics prepared at a slower cooling rate (0.01 °C s −1 ) than that of normal firing (0.05 °C s −1 ) demonstrate the stabilization of the P 4 bm phase and expansion of the coexistence region of the R 3 c and P 4 bm phases.

This value for d eff in the paraelectric phase is significantly larger than that for other ferroelectrics measured so far. Our detailed investigation of symmetry-disallowed piezoelectricity indicates bias effects due to alternating current (AC) electric fields (100–800 kHz) and AC field cooling. The application of moderate AC fields (100–350 V/cm) gives rise to a nonlinear response of the piezoelectric effect, leading to an irreversible increase in the piezoelectric coefficient in the paraelectric phase. Along with changes in the elastic properties, the observed poling due to AC electric fields is reminiscent of irreversible ferroelectric–ferroelastic domain wall motion in ferroelectric phases. Such behavior is absent in cubic SrTiO 3 where precursor effects are commonly observed at much lower temperatures.},

In addition, recent studies reveal that the critical field needed during the transition process is inconsistent between in situ microstructure characterization and macroscopic polarization measurement. Consequently, the intricate field-induced phase transition in NN is perplexing. Based on high sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to symmetry breaking in lattices, this work systematically investigates the in situ Raman spectra of NN single crystals, analyzing the evolution and depolarization behavior of various phonons under an electric field. Correspondingly, the transition from P to Q phase is determinately identified, accompanied by in-depth understanding of the phonon dynamics of field-induced phase transition.

Recent research has highlighted the potential of “giant” electrostriction as an alternative approach, offering substantial electromechanical responses with more favorable electrical properties. This work investigates the electrostrictive and dielectric properties of non-textured and textured La 2 Ce 2 O 7 ceramics. Our findings reveal a substantial electrostrictive coefficient [ M 33 ≈ 10 −18 (m/V) 2 , exceeding conventional electrostrictive materials], coupled with a high effective piezoelectric response ( d 33 eff = 40 pm/V at E = 100 kV/cm) and a high effective piezoelectric voltage coefficient ( g 33 eff = 146–205 × 10 −3 Vm/N). Notably, [111]-texturing of La 2 Ce 2 O 7 significantly reduces dielectric losses, further enhancing its suitability for energy harvesting and actuator applications. The combination of electromechanical and dielectric properties creates conditions for high energy-harvesting performance, comparable to lead-containing ceramics and far superior to lead-free alternatives.

The out-of-plane polarization remains stable during torsion and can be adjusted through mechanical and electric fields to achieve multistability. This evolution behavior is attributed to the rapid increase in initial normal stress and continuous cyclic variation of shear stress during torsion.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of information technology, there is a pressing need to develop ultracompact and energy-efficient thin-film-based electro-optic (EO) devices. A high EO coefficient in ferroelectric materials is crucial. However, substrate clamping can positively or negatively influence various physical properties, including the EO response of these films, thus complicating the development of next-generation thin-film-based devices. This study demonstrates that reversible dynamic domain motion, achieved through substrate clamping, significantly enhances the EO coefficient in epitaxial ferroelectric rhombohedral Pb(Zr, Ti)O 3 thin films, where the (111) and ( ⁠ 11 1 ¯ ⁠ ) domains coexist with distinct optical axes. In principle, this approach can be applied to different film-substrate systems, thereby contributing to the advancement of sophisticated EO devices based on ferroelectrics.},

The detector has a lumped-element design comprising a large interdigitated capacitor in parallel with a narrow inductive strip. A fiber-coupled lens is used to focus the light onto the inductive absorber to minimize photon scattering. Detectors with different designs and film thicknesses are studied. From the histogram of the optimally filtered multi-photon response pulse height, we find that the square of the energy resolution of the n -photon peak Δ E n 2 increases linearly with the absorbed photon energy n h ν ⁠ . The detector made from a thicker Al film has a smaller slope of Δ E n 2 with n h ν ⁠ , suggesting lower phonon loss in a thicker absorber. We also discuss other factors that limit the energy resolution and maximum resolvable photon number, including the dark noise and position-dependent response.},

  abstract     = {SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high- Q , frequency-tunable resonator that is both resilient to magnetic field and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher H c metal such as niobium; however, the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tunability at T = 16 mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterize the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design that can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.},

  abstract     = {Competing interaction within magnetic materials leads to the formation of complex magnetic domain configurations such as stripe domains, labyrinthine domains, magnetic bubbles, and skyrmions, which are fingerprints of different magnetic materials. An effective tailoring of these competing interactions and the resultant magnetic domain configurations by extrinsically means is of current interest. Through depositing an interfacially asymmetric Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta multilayer on a rare-earth-doped yttrium iron garnet of composition SmLu: YIG film, we show that the magnetic domain configurations from the bottom SmLu: YIG film can be partly imprinted onto the top Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta multilayer. The formation of stochastic domain configurations, such as labyrinthine domains, parallel stripe domains, and magnetic bubbles in the Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta multilayer, is jointly studied by using polar magneto-optical Kerr effect microscope and anomalous Hall effect measurements. The underlying physics is attributed to the fluctuating interlayer dipole–dipole interaction that results in the partial imprinting, which could substantially modify the intrinsic magnetism of the top Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta multilayer and leading to the formation of stochastic domain configurations. Our results provide an effective approach for tailoring the competing interaction in magnetic materials and for application scenarios in which the formation of stochastic domain configurations is required.},

In our study on the Pt/Co/Ru/RuO 2 (101) system, we have demonstrated field-free switching via current injection along the RuO 2 [010] axis. We found that the system features a tilted easy axis, deviating from the out-of-plane orientation toward the RuO 2 [ 1 ¯ 01] direction. The application of current perpendicular to this tilted axis generates a significant out-of-plane effective field, enabling field-free magnetization switching. Our findings also suggest that fine-tuning the thickness of the Ru layer to change the tilt angle can substantially reduce the critical switching current density. This work offers a promising approach for controlling the tilting magnetization, which is vital for the development of RuO 2 -based magnetic devices.},

Both theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate the sonic topological valley-locked whispering gallery, in which the valley states propagate along the interfaces between a sonic crystal and a hard wall.

However, the premature breakdown deteriorated with the increase in device area, hindering the scale-up of the current rating. In this work, we unveil the formation and characteristics of killer defects responsible for the premature breakdown in an Si-doped (001) β -Ga 2 O 3 epitaxial layer grown by halide vapor phase epitaxy. The killer defects feature a line-shaped morphology along the [010] orientation. Specifically, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterization links the line-shaped defects to underlying voids. These voids are surrounded by amorphous phase regions, and the transition from amorphous phase to crystalline phase results in twins extending along the [010] orientation, which eventually become line-shaped defects on the wafer. Additionally, the defect area exhibits smaller capacitance and lower surface potential compared to the defect-free region. This is attributed to the absence of local ionized donors in the defect area, leading to electric field concentration in this region. This study systematically investigates a killer defect in β -Ga 2 O 3 , which contributes to the scale-up process of β -Ga 2 O 3 power devices and advances their application.},

A positive threshold voltage shift (ΔV TH ) of 8.9 V is achieved due to the charge-trapping effect. The device also shows a high I on /I off ratio of ∼10 10 , a low gate leakage current of ∼10 −7 mA/mm, and a relatively high BV DS of 400 V. The suppression of gate leakage current results in an ultra-high gate breakdown voltage of 22.5 V, owing to the superior current blocking capability of the O 3 -based Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 blocking layers and the interface improvement between dielectric and InAlN barrier achieved through in situ O 3 treatment. The time-dependent dielectric breakdown measurements reveal the quality and reliability of the dielectric layer, predicting a maximum V GS of 9.66 and 9.31 V for a 10-year lifetime at failure rates of 63.2% and 0.10%, respectively. Additionally, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and multi-frequency C–V measurements further verify the effectiveness of the in situ O 3 treatment in the optimization of the dielectric/GaN interface.

  abstract     = {It is well established that a number of techniques, including applied electric fields, interfacial engineering, structural torsion, and doping, can modulate the geometric and electronic structures of materials, thereby enhancing their photoelectronic properties in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites. Among these strategies, doping has proven to be an extremely effective approach; however, the precise mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated how heteroatom doping, specifically using Sn and Bi dopants, influences the excited-state dynamics of 2D (MA) 2 PbI 4 perovskites using ab initio calculations combined with real-time nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that the doped systems maintain the octahedral configuration characteristics of the parent material. Notably, doping leads to a significant electron–hole separation in real space, corresponding to an extended carrier lifetime of approximately 140–150 ns, compared to just 2.70 ns for pristine (MA) 2 PbI 4 perovskites. This behavior is primarily governed by a low-frequency vibration mode around ∼200 cm −1 . These calculations provide important insights into the potential for atomically modulating carrier behaviors to achieve excellent photovoltaic properties.},

Here, using first-principles calculations with van der Waals interactions, we systematically study the phase stability and transition behavior of (Bi x In 1− x ) 2 Se 3 alloys. Our results reveal a contrasting stability profile between Bi 2 Se 3 and In 2 Se 3 , with the former exhibiting a distinct preference for the β phase over the α phase, while the latter shows similar stabilities in both phases, thus partially addressing previously reported ground-state inconsistencies. Exploring composition–structure relationships, we demonstrate that Bi incorporation in low concentrations stabilizes the β phase, consistent with early experimental observations. Further analysis based on the cation orbital properties indicates that the preference of Bi for octahedral sites over tetrahedral ones drives the small critical composition for the α → β phase transition. This work enhances our understanding of phase stability in (Bi x In 1− x ) 2 Se 3 alloys, providing insights for future design of monophasic materials and advanced applications.},

The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high resolution x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentration resulting in reduced RMS roughness. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films.

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) NiO/β-Ga 2 O 3 p–n junction has recently emerged as a key building block for emerging electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the long-term reliability of this bipolar junction remains elusive. Here, the temporal evolution of the transient parametric shift is characterized in this junction under the prolonged forward- and reverse-bias stresses as well as in the post-stress recoveries. The temperature-dependent evolutions reveal the energy level and time constant of the dominant trap. The forward-bias stress is found to induce a negative turn-on voltage ( V ON ) shift, the magnitude of which correlates with the stressed current density, while the reverse-bias stress leads to the opposite effect. Such V ON shift is induced by an electron trap with an activation energy of 0.46 eV, which may originate from native point defects in β-Ga 2 O 3 near the junction interface. Under a high forward current stress of 1000 A/cm 2 , device failure is found to be located at the edge region with the thinnest NiO, which is likely to be caused by the injection of hot electrons that diffuse across the entire NiO layer. Overall, the magnitude of parametric shift is approaching or comparable to those reported in the native SiC and GaN p–n junctions, suggesting that the NiO/β-Ga 2 O 3 -based UWBG devices have good potential to achieve a reliability comparable to their WBG counterparts.},

  abstract     = {The effect of doping on the lowest quantum state of hot electron trapped in the semiconductor shell of small size hybrid nanoparticles is investigated. Assuming a spherical Ag-AgBr hybrid nanoparticle with a metal core and a semiconductor shell, we study the changes in the spatial profile of the contact electric potential in the Schottky barrier as a function of the doping density under the Sze approximation of a completely depleted layer. The energy of the lowest quantum state of an electron in the semiconductor shell is estimated along with the tunneling time into the metal core. It is found that when the characteristic size of the depletion layer of the Schottky barrier exceeds the size of the semiconductor shell, this energy varies throughout the Schottky barrier height by changing the shell thickness and the doping density, with the tunneling lifetime varying from subpicoseconds to submicroseconds. This possibility can be exploited to improve the efficiency of plasmonic photocatalysis with small-sized hybrid nanoparticles: By adjusting the energy of the discrete electron state to the given lowest unoccupied molecular orbit level of the chemical adsorbed on the surface of the hybrid nanoparticle, one should expect the resonance transfer of an electron, thus a dramatic increase in the rate of photocatalysis. The proposed method introduces Quantum-Size Resonance-Enhanced Photocatalysis in the hybrid structure.},

Recently, it was discovered that Bi 3+ , with its lone-pair electrons, can effectively enhance the PR speed of LN crystals. However, this enhancement is only effective in the short-wavelength range of visible light, and the response time remains inadequate for full-color dynamic displays. In this paper, a theoretical framework is established to guide the shallow energy-level PR doping of LN crystals. We simulate the energy band structure, electron mobility, and other properties of LN crystals doped with Tl, Pb, and Sb ions, which feature lone-pair electrons, using first-principles calculations. The theoretical results indicate that when Sb occupies the Nb site ( ⁠ Sb Nb 0 ⁠ ), the defect level position in the bandgap is shallow, and the electron mobility is 79.029 cm 2 V –1 s –1 subsequently, we grew a series of LN:Sb and LN:Sb,Mg crystals and characterized their crystalline quality and PR properties. High-resolution x-ray rocking curve results demonstrate that all the as-grown crystals exhibit excellent crystalline quality, with FWHM values ranging from approximately 0.007 ° to 0.008 ° ⁠ . Notably, the LN : Sb 1.0 , Mg 6.0 crystal demonstrates a rapid PR response time of 1.67 s at 671 nm, nearly three times faster than that of the LN : Bi 1.0 , Mg 6.0 crystal.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ), have gained considerable attention due to their versatile electrical and optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for next-generation nano(opto)electronic devices. This study investigates the impact of 10 MeV proton irradiation on the electrical and optoelectronic properties of WS 2 , focusing on the controlled introduction of defects, primarily sulfur vacancies, which are crucial for tailoring material properties and enhancing their capabilities. By varying proton fluences from 1 × 10 13 to 5 × 10 14 cm −2 at an energy of 10 MeV, the defect density was precisely modulated. The effects of this defect-engineering strategy were characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy, low-temperature photoluminescence, and density functional theory calculations. Both electronic (field-effect transistor) and optoelectronic (photodetector) devices fabricated with defect-engineered WS 2 exhibited a 24-fold decrease in contact resistance and a fivefold improvement in photogain. These results demonstrate the potential of proton irradiation as a powerful tool for defect engineering in TMDs. The findings underscore the promise of this approach for optimizing TMD-based devices for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications, paving the way for tailored material properties in next-generation technologies.},

  abstract     = {Ultraviolet-C (UVC) photons play a key role in many fields such as covert communication, bacterial inactivation, information storage, and encryption. Because the UVC component of solar spectrum is almost absorbed by the ozone layer around our earth, there is little natural UVC light on the earth. Therefore, developing artificial UVC light source is of great significance. The visible-to-UVC upconversion mechanism has been demonstrated to be a useful strategy. Here, we introduce a visible-to-UVC upconversion system, that is, CaSrSiO 4 :Pr 3+ . Under excitation of both commonly used laser and light-emitting diode at 450 nm, CaSrSiO 4 :Pr 3+ emits UVC photons. The presence of UVC light of CaSrSiO 4 :Pr 3+ has also been confirmed by a solar blind camera, in addition to an optical spectrometer. Moreover, experimental results show that the UVC emission of CaSrSiO 4 :Pr 3+ is assigned to a two-photon assisted upconversion mechanism. In the end, we demonstrate the potential applications of CaSrSiO 4 :Pr 3+ for information encryption and sterilization.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic heterojunctions with large exchange bias have promising applications in magnetic sensing and data storage. Ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) heterojunctions are often used to generate exchange bias. However, the requirement of thermal manipulation makes controlling exchange bias in FM/AFM heterojunctions inconvenient. Herein, a Fe 3 GeTe 2 /Fe 3 GaTe 2 FM/FM heterojunction is constructed to generate large exchange bias and reflected magnetic circular dichroism and magneto-optical Kerr effect techniques are used for the magnetic characterization of the heterojunction. The results show that strong magnetic coupling occurs at the Fe 3 GeTe 2 /Fe 3 GaTe 2 interface when the temperature is <80 K. By fixing the spin direction of Fe 3 GaTe 2 , large exchange bias can be generated in Fe 3 GeTe 2 because of the magnetic pinning effect. Furthermore, the strength of exchange bias can be manipulated by applying an ultralow current between Fe 3 GeTe 2 and Fe 3 GaTe 2 layers without changing the temperature. These results provide potential ways for generating and manipulating exchange bias in two-dimensional (2D) materials and pave the way for implementing the 2D van der Waals exchange bias effect in spintronic devices.},

The RMS comprises an optically transparent metasurface absorber (OTMA) based on indium tin oxide materials and a voltage-doubling rectifier circuit. The proposed RMS features several advantages, including polarization insensitivity, wide incidence angle coverage, low profile, and the ability to operate at low incident power densities. Utilizing a stacked structure, the RMS and the solar cell can provide a more hybrid output power to accommodate more application scenarios. To validate its performance, a prototype 3 × 3 OTMA array was designed, fabricated, and measured. Results demonstrate that the fabricated RMS achieves RF to DC efficiencies of 19.64% at 2.4 GHz and 7.92% at 5.8 GHz, with an impressive 80% optical transparency. Furthermore, solar energy harvesting tests show that the measured maximum power point for the RF/solar hybrid energy harvesting is 13.11% higher than that of a single solar panel under a light intensity of 257 lux.},

  abstract     = {In modern imaging systems, the application of multispectral imaging technologies is pervasive, furnishing an enhanced spectrum of information. Multispectral methods typically employ arrays of filters to selectively exclude light from undesired spectral bands, thus facilitating the capture of discrete narrowband data. However, the inherent multi-channel filtering process limits their energy utilization efficiency, a constraint that is magnified by the current trend of miniaturization in imaging devices. In this work, we have developed a pixel-level, metal-based, mid-infrared router by employing an inverse design method. This design achieved peak spectral efficiencies of 58.61% and 67.35% within the operational bands of 3.5–4.2 and 4.4–5 μ m, respectively, and an average energy utilization efficiency across the entire operational range of 3.5–5 μ m was elevated to 72%, which is 1.44 times higher than that of conventional filter-based systems. The designed routers were realized by standard nanofabrication processes that transfer the designed patterns into a gold film on a ZnS substrate. The spectral measurements show that the fabricated routers have a routing performance close to the simulation results.},

The numerical results show that vector waves with spatial polarization mode orders of ±1 and ±2 can be accurately realized using compact, high-precision Jones matrix metasurfaces with orders of ±1 and ±2. In principle, Jones matrix metasurfaces can realize vector vortex waves of arbitrary order described in the HOP sphere. Two prototypes, namely, high-precision Jones matrix metasurfaces with orders of +1 and +2, are fabricated and experimentally investigated with various polarization morphologies.

The independent phase gradients are superimposed on a single-layer structure for three non-orthogonal polarization states, and we solved the supercell structure of the metasurface by Least Squares Approximation and Gradient Descent Algorithm to effectively suppress the crosstalk between non-orthogonal modes. The experimental results show that the deflection angles on different linear polarization states and frequencies can cover the angle range of 15°–50° in the broadband range of 0.3–0.5 THz, and the maximum crosstalk between channels is −27.84 dB at the center frequency of 0.4 THz. The proportion of beam energy correctly multiplexed by each channel reaches >80%. This non-orthogonal polarization multiplexing mechanism is of great value for THz metasurface multi-channel wavefront manipulation.},

  abstract     = {With rapid advancement in ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), the demand for multispectral stealth technology has become urgent. In the field of radar stealth, 3D metamaterial absorbers have garnered significant attention due to their ultra-wideband microwave absorption. However, they face the challenge of restricted multispectral-compatible stealth capabilities, elevating the risk of being detected under ISR technology. In this study, we propose a solution by covering the absorber with a structural topology-based pixelated color-changing layer (STPCL), providing environmental camouflage and enhancing absorption intensity. Multiwall carbon nanotubes/spherical carbonyl iron/silicone rubber composites and thermochromic capsules/polydimethylsiloxane composites are used to fabricate the absorber and the STPCL, respectively. The STPCL not only provides adaptive camouflage in grassland and desert environments but also increases the characteristic dimensions to tune the absorption peaks and incorporates a grading circuit with stepped impedance to enhance impedance matching. As a result, the absorption bandwidth is slightly extended from 3.28–40 to 2.87–40 GHz, while the average reflection loss is improved from −13.55 to −16.83 dB. This approach demonstrates the potential to enhance the functionality and adaptability of metamaterial microwave absorbers in diverse operational environments.},

This study presents a measurement approach tailored for quantifying TBR in thick-film diamond heterostructures, focusing on diamond-on-silicon (Diamond-on-Si) systems with a silicon nitride barrier layer. Compared to conventional methods, such as transient thermoreflectance techniques, which often exhibit limited sensitivity for thick layers, this approach demonstrates greater reliability and applicability.

An authentic leaf skeleton innovatively serves as the mask during photolithography complemented by O 2 -plasma treatment, enabling precise design of superhydrophilic SiO 2 structures with a hierarchy of vein orders forming reticulate meshes on a hydrophobic Si substrate. This design facilitates enhanced water collection through intricate reticulate meshes and directional droplet transport along the abundant multi-order veins. Such AWH surface shows a water-harvesting efficiency of 172 mg cm −2 h −1 , increasing up to 62% and 58% over the pristine SiO 2 /Si wafer and Si wafer, respectively. Additionally, the role of structure orientation in the open-surface droplet transport is explored while the AWH surface is vertically placed during the water-harvesting process. This work highlights the potential of using meticulous natural designs, like leaf skeletons, to improve AWH surfaces, with broad applications in compact devices, such as on-chip evaporative cooling and planar microfluidics manipulation.},

At room temperature, significant carrier-mobility reduction is observed for the OTFTs with gate doping concentrations of 1.75 × 10 18 and 4.19 × 10 18 cm −3 due to enhanced remote phonon scattering resulting from the resonance between the surface plasmons of the gate electrode and the phonons of the HfLaON gate dielectric (from Hf-O and La-O bonds) and the silicate interlayer (from Si-O bond), respectively, namely the anti-screening effect (ASE). This ASE can be further supported by increasing the measurement temperature from room temperature to 40, 60, and 80 °C, under which the frequency of gate-electrode plasmon increases (due to higher electron thermal energy and also higher electron concentration produced by stronger ionization of dopants in the gate electrode) to enhance, weaken, or create the resonance, resulting in stronger ASE, reduced ASE, or ASE with another phonon mode in the gate dielectric, respectively, in the OTFT.

However, many van der Waals materials' unique properties are most prominent at cryogenic temperatures. This presents a particular challenge for polaritonics research, as reliable optical constant data are required for understanding light-matter coupling. This paper presents a cryogenic Fourier transform infrared microscope design constructed entirely from off-the-shelf components and associated fitting procedures for determining optical constants in the infrared. Data correction techniques were developed to directly quantify systematic errors in the fitting procedure. We use this microscope to present the first temperature-dependent characterization of the optical properties of hexagonal boron nitride enriched with isotopically pure boron. Our full analysis of the infrared dielectric function shows small but significant tuning of the optical constants, which is highly consistent with Raman data from the literature. We then use this dielectric data to perform and analyze the polariton propagation properties, which agree exceptionally well with published cryogenic scattering-type near-field microscopy results. In addition to the insights gained into hyperbolic polaritons in hBN, our paper represents a transferable framework for characterizing exfoliated infrared polaritonic materials and other infrared devices. This could accelerate discoveries in different material systems, especially those that are spatially inhomogeneous or cannot be prepared as large single crystals.},

Imaging with single-pixel detection, e.g., ghost imaging (GI), emerges as a solution in recent years. Here, we report a unified GI framework based on untrained neural networks (UNNs) to eliminate the effect of complex environments and realize high-resolution object reconstruction. Two UNNs are designed to respectively estimate the corrected realizations and a series of dynamic scaling factors from the collected realizations. A GI-formation-based physical model is incorporated into the network to ensure the validity of the corrected realizations and enable object reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and robust for high-resolution and high-contrast object reconstruction in complex environments, i.e., dynamic scattering media with high-randomness light disturbance. In addition, the proposed method is validated at low sampling ratios to alleviate data acquisition burden. With the advantages in the integration, adaptability, and efficiency, the proposed method provides a promising solution for GI in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {In InGaN/GaN micro-light-emitting diodes ( μ LEDs), the size-dependent efficiency loss is commonly attributed to carrier diffusion within quantum wells (QWs). When the μ LED size is sufficiently small, carriers can diffuse laterally to reach defective sidewalls, leading to non-radiative recombination. This challenges earlier assumptions of short-range carrier diffusion in InGaN/GaN QWs. However, recent studies have demonstrated the potential for long-range diffusion, prompting further investigation into how QW design and growth conditions influence carrier diffusion length and μ LED efficiency. This paper contributes to this investigation by examining carrier diffusion in c -plane InGaN/GaN single QW samples using photoluminescence experiments. By varying the QW thickness, we observe an increase in diffusion length with thicker QWs, consistent with the increased radiative recombination lifetime due to the quantum confined Stark effect. This suggests that reducing QW thickness could mitigate the size-dependent efficiency loss in μ LEDs. As the substrate type plays a crucial role in advancing the industrialization of μ LEDs, we compare carrier diffusion in QWs grown on a substrate of different nature: sapphire, freestanding GaN, and Si (111). Our results demonstrate that the three types of substrates enable long-range diffusion. Finally, analyzing the evolution of carrier diffusion length with carrier density reveals two opposite regimes. In the high-excitation regime, carrier diffusion length decreases by increasing the excitation power, which is in agreement with previous studies and supported by a diffusion–recombination model. However, in the low-excitation regime, carrier diffusion length unexpectedly increases by increasing the excitation power.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of display technologies has boosted the demand for efficient and high-resolution color conversion techniques. However, conventional approaches such as photolithography and inkjet printing are constrained by limitations in pixel size and material compatibility, making it difficult to meet the demands of industrialization. Due to the low luminescence efficiency of the red quantum dot (QD) material, an innovative quantum dot color conversion (QDCC) layer structure was proposed in this study. The red QD film was prepared in pixel pits below the glass surface using electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing, thus integrating the QD film into the glass substrate. This results in a more vivid and accurate full-color display. The results indicate that the fabricated QDCC layer achieves a pixel size of 216 × 116 μ m 2 , with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.81% and a luminance of 1 315 205 cd/m 2 . To improve the performance of the device, the transparent photoresist used for leveling between the LEDs was substituted with a black photoresist. Although the EQE changes to 3.93% and the luminance changes to 1 206 038 cd/m 2 , the color coordinates move closer to the red region, changing from (0.4396, 0.2089) to (0.4786, 0.2258). This innovative method significantly not only reduces the thickness and weight of the display but also improves its color performance. This research lays the foundation for high-performance displays, paving the way for ultra-thin and energy-efficient display technologies.},

Using the femtosecond laser direct writing technology, we establish two distinct types of nontrivial bilayer SSH lattices with varying interlayer couplings, allowing us to observe two different types of topological edge states. Interestingly, we find that these topological edge states can either remain within the bandgap or transition into gapless bound states in the continuum without hybridization under different interlayer couplings. Our work illustrates a scheme to investigate topology and bound states in the continuum physics in artificial systems, potentially opening up many possibilities in topology-driven photonic devices.},

  abstract     = {A “whitebody” can transform into a “blackbody” under intense light exposure, and the temperature of photoinduced blackbodies deviates significantly from Planck's law. This discovery necessitates the consideration of light excitation's impact on the radiation spectrum of a blackbody when applying Planck's formula. Under the adiabatic approximation, this paper theoretically derives the relationship between the temperature of photoinduced blackbodies and the intensity of excitation light field. The actual temperature of a photoinduced blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth root of the excitation light power. Experimental data demonstrate that this relationship can more accurately describe the temperature characteristics of a photoinduced blackbody in intense light fields. These results provide a theoretical foundation for further investigation into photoinduced blackbody radiation, contribute to an enhanced comprehension of the underlying physical mechanism behind this phenomenon, and may have significant implications for celestial temperature measurements based on Planck's law.},

  abstract     = {Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), especially the ptychography, has been widely used in quantitative phase imaging. However, in traditional diffractive imaging schemes, a highly coherent light source is required for a better-posed inverse problem. Considering that the high coherence cannot be guaranteed in all cases and to avoid the multi-mode of low-coherence light sources complicating the iterative modeling of diffractive imaging, we proposed an overlap-scanning self-referencing diffractive imaging. As a non-iterative partially coherent diffractive imaging method, self-referencing diffractive imaging was combined with the procedure of overlap-scanning ptychography. It does not require prior knowledge of light source coherence, and only a coherent inverse problem was needed to be solved in the final stitching. It has been demonstrated to be able to recover the complex amplitude of objects illuminated by various low-coherence light sources. This study presents significant potential for applications in phase imaging with a wide-field of view under incoherent illuminations.},

  abstract     = {High optical-to-terahertz (THz) conversion efficiency is crucial for generating THz waves. Strong-field ionization using a bi-focal bi-chromatic geometry produces cascading plasmas, leading to amplified THz generation and extended THz bandwidth. We investigate the effect of focal length in this bi-focal geometry on THz intensity. The results show that the THz intensity produced with non-identical focal lengths of the bi-chromatic fields is 25% higher than that of identical focal lengths, and 15 times higher than traditional bi-chromatic THz generation. The electro-optic sampling measurements reveal that the THz-electric-field intensity generated by the bi-focal bi-chromatic field exhibits periodic oscillations, which results from the modulation of the photoelectron's asymptotic velocity by the relative phase of the bi-chromatic pulses, and are consistent with the photocurrent model. The photocurrent simulations indicate that the self-compression of the second harmonic pulse significantly enhances THz amplification and extends the THz bandwidth. These findings deepen understanding of the THz generation mechanism and suggest potential avenues for optimizing THz sources.},
