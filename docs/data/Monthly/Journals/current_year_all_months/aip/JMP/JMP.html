We focus particularly on the structure of the associated conformal factors and examine several nontrivial special cases. By utilizing the symmetries of affine geometry, we construct an affine connection on the Newtonian gauge space-time without imposing common geometric constraints such as flatness, metric compatibility, or torsion-freeness. From this general connection, we derive a statistical connection, thereby establishing a statistical structure on the Newtonian gauge. Within this framework, we analyze the conformal symmetry of the tensor field K , defined as the difference between the statistical connection and the Levi–Cività connection. Moreover, we characterize the conditions under which a conformal Killing vector field on the underlying manifold also serves as a statistical conformal Killing vector field in the induced statistical geometry.},

First, we derive the infinite RCS model from the kinetic RCS model with non-compact support through the particle-in-cell method, and then we show that the diameter and radius of the velocity variable in the RCS model are non-increasing. Next, we construct a system of dissipative differential inequalities via the finite truncation of the proposed infinite RCS model. This overcomes the difficulty brought by the inaccessibility of infinite norms, which enables us to analyze the solution’s flocking behaviors. Finally, we establish the model’s classical limit and derive the optimal convergence rate in terms of the speed of light, which is the same as a finite-time classical limit.},

Our method follows the second moment approach developed recently in Arous et al. [Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 73 (8), 1732–1828 (2020)], from which the ground state energy can be derived for the pure - like mixed p -spin model. By analyzing the complexity function with given radial derivative and energy, we derive the convergence of the Hessian spectrum from the vanishing mean number of critical points. For the 1-RSB model, the ground state energy was explicitly computed in Huang and Sellke [arXiv:2311.15495 (2023)]. Combined with the complexity function of local maxima with given radial derivative obtained in Belius and Schmidt [arXiv:2207.14361 (2022)], this allows us to obtain the corresponding results more directly. Our result extends those corresponding results in the regime of topology trivialization.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability. The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler–Poincaré variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin–Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model’s Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map. Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie–Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie–Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler–Poincaré principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints. The dual Euler–Poincaré/Lie–Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.},

Due to the shortage of the compactness of Sobolev embedding theorem, the asymptotic compactness of the corresponding semigroup generated by problem (1.1) can not be obtained by the method of contraction function in the case that the exponent of the source term is critical. In this paper, we first prove the corresponding dynamical system is a gradient system. By the abstract results about the existence of global attractor, we will establish a quasi-stability inequality by using the global L r -regularity ( r ≥ 2) in time of the nonlocal Balakrishnan-Taylor term under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear damping term, which is sufficient to show the existence of a finite dimensional global attractor for such system.},

Despite its simplicity, it exhibits remarkably rich dynamical behavior, including the interplay between regular and chaotic orbital dynamics, resonances, and stochastic regions in phase space, which have inspired extensive research in nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we investigate the system’s solutions at small energy levels, deriving asymptotic constants of motion that remain valid over remarkably long timescales—far exceeding the range of validity of conventional perturbation techniques. Our approach leverages the system’s inherent two-scale dynamics, employing a novel analytical framework to uncover these long-lived invariants. The derived formulas exhibit excellent agreement with numerical simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the system’s long-term behavior.},

For practical application, a stochastic quasi-positive equilibrium N * is defined. By solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation, we obtain an approximate expression of the density function of the stationary distribution around N *. Finally, some numerical examples are performed to demonstrate our theoretical results.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an equivalent characterization of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators with L p potentials. Viewing eigenvalues as nonlinear functionals of potentials, we use the complete continuity of eigenvalues to deduce a family of critical systems consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are dependent on the exponent p ∈ (1, ∞) of the Lebesgue spaces and m free parameters. The problem of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators can be transformed into the solvability of critical systems. Based on this relation, for p = 2 we can theoretically obtain the optimal potential from the integrability theory of Hamiltonian systems point of view. Finally, we observe the numerical experiments for the critical systems to propose the future direction.},

In these applications, the tensor powers of the defining representation seem particularly important. The representation theory of these tensor powers is understood in two regimes. 1. For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n : Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the η -correspondence ). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t = 4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the η correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.},

In the quantum information community, it is commonly believed that SIC-POVMs exist in all dimensions; however, the general proof of their existence is still an open problem. By mapping SIC-POVMs onto the generalized Bloch sphere, we prove two geometric existence statements associated with the SIC-POVM existence problem. First, we prove the Knaster’s conjecture for n vertices of an n -simplex and use that to prove the existence of a continuous family of general SIC-POVMs where the trace of the k th power of the operators is the same for ( n 2 − 1) of the elements. Furthermore, by using numerical methods, we show that in dimensions 3 and 4, a regular simplex can be constructed on the Bloch sphere such that all its vertices correspond to density matrices having the same trace of ρ 3 . In the three-dimensional Hilbert space, we generate 10 4 general SIC-POVMs for where all the elements have the same set of randomly chosen eigenvalues, indicating the continuous set of general SIC-POVMs can be constructed for all possible values of trace of ρ 3 .},

Under the condition that the embedded eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator lies away from the thresholds of the continuous spectrum, we show that the set of nearby potentials for which the embedded eigenvalue persists forms a smooth manifold of finite and even codimension. The proof employs tools from Floquet theory, exponential dichotomies, and Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction.

Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form t r − α for any α > 0, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at α = 1 in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.},

This yields an explicit basis of the complete 27 ⊗ 27 color space (defined as the space of 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 color maps) in terms of orthogonal multiplets. This study shows that even complex color structures can be addressed, with the help of the birdtrack pictorial technique, using only elementary tools. In particular, we highlight the usefulness of the quadratic Casimir operator, whose eigenspaces allow efficient filtering of all projectors and transition operators, and of the permutation operators that further improve this filtering. The product 27 ⊗ 27 also has an interesting feature: three equivalent irreps 27 appear in the decomposition, two of which are symmetric and can therefore be distinguished neither by the quadratic Casimir operator nor by their symmetry under permutation. In this case, it is convenient to use Clebsch–Gordan coefficients to derive the two associated, symmetric projectors. The latter are not uniquely determined (only their sum is), and we give the set of all solutions. Finally, we explicitly derive the soft anomalous dimension matrix associated with 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 , whose block-diagonal main structure is easy to understand, but whose detailed spectrum properties remain intriguing. The approach presented for 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 could in principle be applied to any product of SU( N ) irreps, and eventually automated.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the isentropic Euler system for the Born-Infeld equation of state with friction, for which the Riemann problem is solved by applying the variable substitution method. The non-self-similar Riemann solutions with five different structures are obtained. Although the considered system with non-negative pressure is strictly hyperbolic with two genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, the delta shock wave still occurs in the solutions. For the delta shock wave, the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition are clarified. Under the impact of the friction term, the rarefaction waves and shock waves as well as delta shock wave are bent into parabolic curves. Also, it is shown that as the pressure goes to zero, the non-self-similar solutions of the considered system just converge to the non-self-similar solutions of the zero-pressure Euler system with friction.},

  abstract     = {Whether smooth solutions of partially dissipative 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations develop singularities in finite time has been a long-standing open problem. Since the pioneering work by Cao and Wu [Adv. Math. 226 , 1803–1822 (2011)], such problem has garnered much more attention. When the magnetic field is close to an equilibrium state, the study of stability and large-time behavior provides a significant example of the stabilizing effects of the magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids. In this paper, we consider the global well-posedness for 2D partially dissipation MHD equations around a uniform magnetic field in R + 2 with no-slip boundary condition. An efficient Stokes estimate is developed, which can be used to obtain the global low order ( H 2 ) energy for the partially dissipative MHD system with physical boundary. In addition, we obtain an explicit decay rate for the linear system using spectral analysis methods. We also observe that the half-space shares some similarities with the Cauchy problem, but exhibits some differences, especially when considering spatial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss lattice energy minimization problems for various interacting potentials, including Born-Mayer, Coulomb, Lennard-Jones, and Rydberg potentials. The main methods and techniques used in this paper are derived from Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016). Based on this, we derive a more comprehensive attractive-repulsive model that can be understood in the sense of exponential decay. Our research leads to a new lower bound for the inverse density of the triangular lattice when the Lennard-Jones potential with exponential decay is minimal, which is a significant improvement over previous results. More specifically, in Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016), the degree of the lowest order term of the Lennard-Jones potential is to satisfy x 1 > 3/2, but our result covers the interval (1, 3/2], making it the optimal case with a lower bound of 1. We extend the results for Morse potential to derive the optimal attractive-repulsive correlation coefficient conditions, i.e., ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 2.3853 and ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 7.3069. Also, our findings provide the first-ever inverse density bound when the triangular lattice is optimal for the Coulomb and Rydberg potentials, while the former gives global optimality without density constraints, and the latter gives upper and lower bounds on the density interval for optimality. Finally, we present numerical estimates of the inverse density, and these findings have critical applications in improving numerical simulations of radiation defects in crystals, especially in the α -iron lattice, and better understanding the properties of rare gases. Our solutions and improved estimates will enable researchers to better understand lattice energy minimization.},

On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable.

  abstract     = {We obtain a tail bound for the least non-zero singular value of A − z when A is a random matrix and z is an eigenvalue of A in a neighborhood of a given point z 0 in the bulk of the spectrum. The argument relies on a resolvent comparison and a tail bound for Gauss-divisible matrices. The latter can be obtained by the method of partial Schur decomposition. Using this bound we prove that any finite collection of components of a right eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue uniformly sampled from a neighborhood of a point in the bulk is Gaussian. A byproduct of the calculation is an asymptotic formula for the odd moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of real Gauss-divisible matrices.},

Their solutions, called hypergeometric class functions, include the Gauss hypergeometric function and its various limiting cases. The paper presents a unified approach to these functions. The main structure behind this approach is a family of complex four-dimensional Lie algebras, originally due to Willard Miller. Hypergeometric class functions can be interpreted as eigenfunctions of the quadratic Casimir operator in a representation of Miller’s Lie algebra given by differential operators in three complex variables.

It is shown that eigenvalue problems with real spectrum are, under very mild assumptions, self-adjoint in an adjustment of the inner-product. In this connection, the geometrical treatment of C n involves two inner-products. In non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and in using the finite element method, there is a strong incentive to recover these inner-products. The task consists of finding a certain Gram matrix of eigenvectors. This, however, can be converted into a computational geometric problem of positive definiteness on the kernel of an elementary operator, requiring solving Hermitian extreme eigenvalue problems only. Well compressible inner-products are sought in terms of a preconditioner up-dated by small rank corrections. Classical properties of self-adjoitness are retained, such as orthogonality of eigenvectors, variational principles for eigenvalues and iterative methods attaining cubic convergence.},

It examines how these transformations and infinitesimal symmetries affect the system’s geometry and evolution. The paper then turns to the concept of master symmetries and presents a method for finding master symmetries of Hamiltonian systems. Finally, the paper addresses the relationship between the existence of constants of motion (first integrals), infinitesimal symmetries and the properties of infinitesimal canonoid symmetries. To formalize this connection, a family of boundary and coboundary operators is introduced, which help to uncover the deeper geometric and algebraic structures underlying the infinitesimal symmetries and conserved quantities in Hamiltonian systems.},

The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantization of massless particle’s helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantization conditions. The relation for the minimal space cell volume, similar to the minimal phase-space cell of Heisenberg is suggested.},

  abstract     = {This article delves into the concept of quantum contextuality, specifically focusing on proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem obtained by assigning Pauli observables to hypergraph vertices satisfying a given commutation relation. The abstract structure composed of this hypergraph and the graph of anticommutations is named a hypergram. Its labelings with Pauli observables generalize the well-known magic sets. A first result is that all these correct quantum labelings of a given hypergram inherently possess the same degree of contextuality. Then we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such quantum labelings and an efficient algorithm to find one of them. We finally attach to each assignable hypergram an abstract notion of contextuality degree. By presenting the study of observable-based Kochen-Specker proofs from the perspectives of graphs and matrices, this abstraction opens the way to new methods to search for original contextual configurations.},

  abstract     = {The existence problem for maximal sets of equiangular lines (or SICs) in complex Hilbert space of dimension d remains largely open. In a previous publication we gave a conjectural algorithm for how to construct a SIC if d = n 2 + 3 = p , a prime number. Perhaps the most surprising number-theoretical aspect of that algorithm is the appearance of Stark units in a key role: a single Stark unit from a ray class field extension of a real quadratic field serves as a seed from which the SIC is constructed. The algorithm can be modified to apply to all dimensions d = n 2 + 3. Here we focus on the case when d = n 2 + 3 = 4 p , p prime, for two reasons. First, special measures have to be taken on the Hilbert space side of the problem when the dimension is even. Second, the degrees of the relevant ray class fields are “smooth” in a sense that facilitates exact calculations. As a result the algorithm becomes easier to explain. We give solutions for 17 different dimensions of this form, reaching d = 39 604. Several improvements relative to our previous publication are reported, but we cannot offer a proof that the algorithm works for any dimensions where it has not been tested.},

We show that this family of fidelities generalizes standard quantum fidelities such as Uhlmann-, Holevo-, and Matsumoto-fidelity and demonstrate that it satisfies analogous celebrated properties. The generalized fidelity naturally arises from a generalized Bures distance, the natural distance obtained by linearizing the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We prove various invariance and covariance properties of generalized fidelity as the point of linearization moves along geodesic-related paths. We also provide a Block-matrix characterization and prove an Uhlmann-like theorem, as well as provide further extensions to the multivariate setting and to quantum Rényi divergences, generalizing Petz-, Sandwiched-, Reverse sandwiched-, and Geometric-Rényi divergences of order α .},

  abstract     = {In 1968, Dashen and Sharp obtained a certain singular Lie algebra of local densities and currents from canonical commutation relations in nonrelativistic quantum field theory. The corresponding Lie group is infinite dimensional: the natural semidirect product of an additive group of scalar functions with a group of diffeomorphisms. Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities – notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics. We also consider the relationship of our development to Heisenberg quantization.},

We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with x , admitting a singularity at x = 0. The associated potential is also singular at x = 0, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., x > 0 and x < 0. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the x > 0 branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral to the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels. The spacing between the energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator à la von Roos.},

There is a rather complete asymptotic analysis when the constant magnetic field tends to + ∞ and some inequalities seem to hold for any value of this magnetic field, leading to rather simple conjectures. Our goal is to explore these questions by revisiting a classical picture of the physicist Saint-James theoretically and numerically.

First, we prove the existence of the steady state solutions (with zero velocity) by constructing the suitable sub and super solutions for the Neumann problem of the associated second order elliptic equation in the 3-D exterior domain. Second, we establish the global existence of strong solutions near a steady state solution by some new techniques to obtain a priori estimates, especially some refined elliptic estimates and the estimates on the boundary. One feature of the problems considered in this paper is that the doping profile is allowed to have arbitrarily large variation and so does the steady state equilibrium.},

Formally, as the Debye length tends to zero (i.e., the quasineutral limit), we see that the full quantum hydrodynamic system can be reduced to the incompressible nonisentropic Euler type equation. Based on the existence of the solutions for the full quantum hydrodynamic system and the incompressible nonisentropic Euler type equation, the quasineutral limit of the full quantum hydrodynamic system with the well-prepared initial data is rigorously showed by the method of asymptotic expansion and energy methods. The main ingredient of the proof is some rigorous uniform estimates on the error functions with respect to the Debye length. It is demonstrated that the quantum effect and the electrostatic potential do play important roles in the estimates, and we need to choose the appropriate Sobolev spaces and use the curl-div decomposition of the gradient.},

In this paper, we investigate Weyl points for a large class of admissible potentials which are characterized only by certain symmetries. A rigorous justification for the existence of the three-fold Weyl points is provided in general three-dimensional problems for the first time. The existing results mainly focus on the weak potential or tight-binding regime. This paper provides a comprehensive proof of the existence in the generic regime. Our proof relies on the analytical structure of the energy bands and the corresponding Bloch modes in terms of the parameters. A renormalized determinant of the operator is used to characterize the energy. For the presence of local conical structures, we use the local analyticity of the corresponding eigenfunctions which are obtained through appropriate truncation. With the help of nice properties of analytical functions, we extend the existence of Weyl points from the weak potential limit to a generic regime. Our analysis lay a foundation for analyzing conically degenerate points in higher dimensions and with more symmetries. Some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our analysis.},

  abstract     = {General higher-order semi-rational rogue wave solutions within one-dimensional three-wave resonant interaction systems are investigated, utilizing the bilinear Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy reduction method. These solutions, formulated as determinants involving Schur polynomials and exponential functions, are classified into three distinct categories: (i) N 1 -th order rogue waves with one simple root, accompanied by N 2 -th order breathers and N 3 -th order dark solitons as coexisting backgrounds; (ii) ( N ̃ 1 , N ̃ 2 ) -th order rogue waves with two simple roots, accompanied by N 2 -th order breathers as backgrounds; and (iii) ( N ̃ 1 , N ̃ 2 ) -th order rogue waves with one double root, accompanied by N 2 -th order breathers as backgrounds. The results demonstrate that pure rogue waves, pure breathers, pure dark solitons, and their various combinations can be derived from these general higher-order semi-rational rogue wave solutions by selecting appropriate nonzero integers N 1 , N 2 , N 3 , N ̃ 1 and N ̃ 2 ⁠ . A significant advancement is the introduction of generalized tau functions, which improve the representation of diverse solitary wave solutions within the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction framework. This methodological innovation applies to other one-dimensional integrable systems, expanding the exploration of general higher-order semi-rational rogue wave solutions. As an application, the intricate patterns and dynamic behaviors of these rogue waves, accompanied by dark solitons, breathers, and their coexistence, are analyzed and visualized through several illustrative figures.},

By using the ladder operators for the associated monic orthogonal polynomials and three compatibility conditions, we express the recurrence coefficients in terms of the 2 N auxiliary quantities which are introduced in the ladder operators and shown to satisfy a system of difference equations. Combining these results with the differential identities obtained from the differentiation of the orthogonality relations, we deduce the Riccati equations for the auxiliary quantities. From them we establish a system of second order partial differential equations (PDEs) which are reduced to a Painlevé V equation for N = 1. Moreover, we derive the second order PDE satisfied by the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant, from which the limiting PDE is obtained under a double scaling. When N = 1, these two PDEs are reduced to the σ -form of a Painlevé V and III equation respectively. When the dimension of the Hermitian matrices from the corresponding deformed Laguerre unitary ensemble is large and λ k ≥ 0, based on Dyson’s Coulomb fluid theory, we deduce the equilibrium density for the eigenvalues.},

This is linked to the fact that the classic method, based from the work by De Almeida and Thouless (from which the critical stability line takes its name), is cumbersome to generalise for the next assumptions. In this paper we devise a new straightforward method inspired to the work by Toninelli in 2002 to recover the critical line in order to inspect the stability first between the second and the first steps of Replica Symmetry Breaking and then, we generalise to K th step, with K finite.},

To overcome the difficulty in lacking compactness of the semiflow, instead of using the non-compactness measures under the framework of nonlinear semigroups, we apply the global exponential attractor theories of non-autonomous dissipative evolution equations. Firstly, we study the well-posedness of the model, and then the existence of the principal eigenvalue λ * of the corresponding linear system is discussed by the Krein–Rutman theorem. Secondly, we establish the existence of the global attractor for the system. Further, the long-term threshold dynamics of the system in terms of λ * are obtained: the disease-free steady-state is globally asymptotically stable when λ * < 0, and the system is uniformly persistent when λ * > 0. Finally, some numerical simulations indicate that increasing the VCT awareness, ART treatment rate and treatment level can play an important role in controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS.},

  abstract     = {In our life there are various infectious diseases which lead to negative effects on the economy. Therefore, it is highly important to develop mathematical models to describe the spread of the pandemic. In this study, we first develop a deterministic SEI 1 I 2 R epidemic model incorporating double epidemic hypothesis. We first verify that there exists a unique global positive solution of the system with any positive initial value, then we investigate the local and global asymptotical stability of the equilibria. Following that, we incorporate the inherent stochasticity of the virus spread by reinterpreting the previous SEIR-type epidemic model of infectious diseases as stochastic systems modelled via the log-normal standard Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. After that we study the stochastic dynamics of the model in detail. More precisely, we first analyze the existence and uniqueness of the global solution of the system. Then by using the Markov semigroup theory, we establish sufficient criteria for the existence and uniqueness of an invariant probability measure of the system, which implies the persistence of the disease in a community. Especially, under the same conditions as the local asymptotical stability of the endemic equilibrium, we get the specific form of the local probability density function around the quasi-endemic equilibrium of the stochastic system. Meanwhile, we also verify that the invariant global probability density function can be approximated by the local probability density function as the noise intensity tends to zero. In addition, we give some sufficient conditions for elimination of the disease. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the derived results and the availability of the proposed models by using MATLAB. This work can improve our insight into epidemic dynamics and help us implement interventions to regulate the disease dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We study the emergent dynamics of the (time-) discrete infinite Cucker–Smale model (in short DICS model), such as the existence of quasi-steady velocity configuration, mono-cluster flocking behaviors, uniform-in-time stability, and uniform-in-time continuous transition from discrete dynamics to continuous dynamics. First, we provide sufficient frameworks for quasi-steady velocity configuration in both continuous and discrete infinite Cucker–Smale models, showing that weak network connectivity can prevent mono-cluster flocking by keeping the velocity diameter unchanged. We also present a framework for flocking dynamics in the DICS model, which can be applied to the discrete finite Cucker–Smale model. Without requiring average velocity conservation, we construct a system of dissipative differential inequalities (SDDI) to derive an exponential decay of velocity diameter. Additionally, we explore two uniform-in-time stability and continuous transition under the sender network. By using the flocking estimate and conservation of the average velocity, we construct corresponding SDDI to show the uniform-in-time stability. We also derive the uniform-in-time continuous transition using the flocking estimate and classical finite-in-time transition result.},

In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch–Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch’s asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch’s approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.},

The extension occurs by means of the high boost limit in a covariant manner. Towards a localization in maximal achronal surfaces a simple but emblematic case shows that normalization, demanded by causality, is preserved. Moreover the existence of the high boost limit, as a consequence of causality, implies the phenomenon of Lorentz contraction discussed in detail. In conclusion, these considerations constitute a clear plea for the concept of achronal localization.},

We then proceed with the quantization of this Hamiltonian density using the pre-canonical quantization procedure. The resulting Schrödinger-like equation was found to take the form of a confluent Heun equation. By employing the functional Bethe-Ansatz method, we explicitly obtain the ground state and first excited state of the system.

The Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation for this algebra, denoted as U q [ o s p ( 2 m + 1 | 2 n ) ( 1 ) ] ⁠ , was originally introduced by Yamane. We provide the definition of the Drinfeld presentation U q [ o s p ( 2 m + 1 | 2 n ) ( 1 ) ] ⁠ . To establish the isomorphism between the Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation and the Drinfeld presentation of the quantum affine superalgebra for type o s p ( 2 m + 1 | 2 n ) ⁠ , we introduce a braid group action to define quantum root vectors of the quantum superalgebra. Specifically, we present an efficient method for verifying the isomorphism between two presentations of the quantum affine superalgebra associated with the type o s p ( 2 m + 1 | 2 n ) ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the 3D ultra-relativistic sonic-supersonic flow through an axisymmetric slender body. Given the sound speed of 3D axisymmetric steady full ultra-relativistic Euler (URE) equations, we seek sonic-supersonic solutions of URE equations in the supersonic region near the sonic curve. Sonic-supersonic solutions are significant for establishing the piecewise smooth solutions to the ultra-relativistic transonic flow problem. Under the condition of non-swirl, the problem is transformed into proving the existence of a classical solution for a boundary value problem (BVP) of 4 × 4 hyperbolic system with two independent variables. The difficulty in addressing this issue arises from the parabolic degeneracy of the equations on the sonic boundary coupled with the emergence of singularities. To overcome this difficulty, inspired by Hu and Li [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 235 , 1819–1871 (2020)]. We consider reformulating the system with novel variables to isolate the singular terms. We first introduce the Mach angle ϖ , the flow angle ϑ , the functions B and S in ultra-relativistic flow, transforming the 3D axisymmetric steady full URE equations without swirl into an equivalent system with variables ( S , B , ϑ , ϖ ). Next, utilizing characteristic decomposition and the hodograph transformation ( t , ξ ) ↦ (cos ϖ , ϑ )( x , r ), we further transform the system into a 3 × 3 closed first-order hyperbolic system with a distinct singularity-regularity structure. Subsequently, the existence of a local classical solution for the BVP of 3 × 3 system is proved in a weighted metric space. Finally, using the invertibility of the hodograph transformation, a sonic-supersonic solution on the original physical plane is obtained.},

The primary concept involves employing the Fourier–Legendre series expansion of the integral kernel of the transmutation operator. It is demonstrated that the problem can be transformed into an infinite system of linear equations, which possesses a unique solution if the original problem does. The solution of this linear system allows one to reconstruct the characteristic determinant and hence to obtain the eigenvalues as its zeros and to compute the corresponding norming constants, transforming the origin problem into an inverse problem with a given spectral density function. The reconstruction approach delineated in this paper offers a robust numerical framework for addressing a variety of inverse spectral problems, while simultaneously minimizing the reconstruction error associated with the recovered potential to the greatest extent feasible.},

This equation is regarded as a higher-order extension of the modified μ -Camassa-Holm equation, and possesses the Hamiltonian structure shared by the μ -Camassa-Holm and modified μ -Camassa-Holm equations. We first present the existence of periodic peakons and conserved densities for the generalized equation. By constructing the appropriate inequalities related to the maximal and minimal values of solutions with the first three conservation laws, we then demonstrate that the periodic peakons are orbitally stable under small perturbations in the energy space.},

The method used in the proof is based on the duality principle by Frank–Sabin and Kato’s smooth perturbation theory. Then we apply it to the magnetic Schrödinger operator or the Schrödinger operator with potentials with critical singularities. We also deduce the refined Strichartz estimates for the Schrödinger operator in terms of the Besov space. In the process of their proofs, some estimates associated with the Besov space or the Triebel-Lizorkin space defined by the Schrödinger operator are deduced. Finally we prove the global existence of a solution for the Hartree equation with electromagnetic potentials describing the dynamics of infinitely many fermions. This would be the first result on the orthonormal Strichartz estimates for the Schrödinger operator with general time-independent potentials including very short range and inverse square type potentials.},

We show the existence of weak asymptotic solutions to the initial value problem to the system using a regularization, by a vanishing viscosity method when the initial velocity is bounded measurable, the initial volume fraction is integrable and the boundary data are bounded measurable. Here we use a generalization of the Hopf-Cole transformation. We also derive an explicit formula for the weak solution when the initial data are functions of bounded variation, the boundary datas are bounded and locally in the class of Lipschitz continuous functions. This construction involves the Hopf-Lax formula for the boundary value problem for the Burgers equation and the product of a bounded variation function with derivative of another bounded variation function using non-conservative Volpert product.},

Firstly, we obtain these weak solutions are regular in the interior if the L t p L x q ( Q 1 ) norm of the velocity is sufficiently small by applying Wolf’s pressure decomposition, where 2 p + 4 q = 2 and 3 ≤ q < ∞ . They improved some previous results of Dong–Du [Theorem 2.2, Commun. Math. Phys. 273 , 785 (2007)] or Dong–Gu [Theorem 1.2, Dyn. Partial Differ.

Second, leveraging these sharp exponential growth estimates, an approximate solution to the perturbation equations of the fluid model in polar coordinates is developed. Furthermore, an error estimate for the perturbation equations is established in the Cartesian coordinate system. Finally, these results are utilized to derive the nonlinear instability of the Rayleigh–Taylor instability in the Hadamard sense.},

  abstract     = {In 1796, Pierre S. de Laplace conjectured [de Laplace, Exposition du Systéme du Monde (Courcier, Paris, 1796), pp. 387–397] that originally the Sun was a cloud of gas having a very large radius. As the cloud cooled off, it contracted inwards and proceeded to cast off a family of gas rings from which the planetary system later condensed. In 2014, such a system of ring-like structures was discovered by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to orbit around the 1 million year old protostar HL Tau in the constellation of Taurus [ALMA Partnership et al. , Astrophys. J. Lett. 808 (1), L3 (2015)]. Unfortunately, no planets were discovered in the bright denser rings. Moreover, the total mass of dust of the ring system was much less than that expected for giant planets to form. Most likely, the structures observed by ALMA were left over material from a much earlier epoch of planet formation [Dipierro et al. , Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.: Lett. 453 , L73–L77 (2015)]. Good fortune returned for the Laplace hypothesis with the discovery of a ring system around the very young Class I protostar IRS 63 (age < 0.5 million years old) in the constellation of Ophiuchus [Segura-Cox et al. , Nature 586 , 228–231 (2020)]. The mass of the dust in the IRS 63 ring system was sufficient for giant planet formation by the process of “core accretion” [Pollack et al. , Icarus 124 , 62–85 (1996)]. Segura-Cox et al. conjectured that planet formation was taking place within the bright dense rings and that the rings had formed by the migration of dust toward the orbital radii of gas-pressure maxima in the gas disk, in line with Laplace’s hypothesis. In this paper, we examine the Laplace conjecture within the mathematical framework of the Euler–Poisson equations for the motion of self-gravitating matter in a rotating gas disk. We show that this model does lead to the creation of patterns of pressure maxima in the disk, which are not dissimilar to those conjectured by Laplace, despite being derived from a different physical basis. We hope that this paper may encourage a reawakening of interest in the Laplace hypothesis for the origin of the solar system.},

We first prove the existence and uniqueness of random attractors for these systems under suitable assumptions on the weight function and coupling parameters of long-range interactions. We then show these attractors are backward compact and asymptotically autonomous, respectively, as the time-dependent forcing term converges to its time-independent counterpart.},

  abstract     = {To explore the spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of syphilis in Xinjiang Province, we establish a multi-stage infection syphilis reaction-diffusion model that incorporates demographic and geographic data. The well-posedness of the system is studied. Then, we derive the basic reproduction number R 0 ⁠ , which serves as the critical threshold for disease outbreak or extinction. We also prove the global dynamics of the homogeneous model parameters and heterogeneous diffusion coefficients case by constructing the feasible Lyapunov functional. Finally, based on data from Xinjiang Province from 2004 to 2018, we estimate model parameters via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The effects of treatment and intervention measures on syphilis spread are explored from both one-dimensional and two-dimensional perspectives. One-dimensional numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and show that increasing treatment coverage and strengthening public health interventions reduce syphilis infections. A two-dimensional simulation of syphilis transmission is conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics software and the finite element method, incorporating Xinjiang Province’s population and geographic data to capture regional differences. Our results suggest: (1) Syphilis infection is more severe in the southern region of Xinjiang Province than in the northern region. (2) Syphilis treatment measures in Xinjiang Province should be tailored to local conditions. Specifically, syphilis prevention efforts should focus on enhancing local healthcare and public awareness, while addressing regional disparities through tailored control strategies in Xinjiang Province.},

First, we show the existence and uniqueness of the global solution. Then, through constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions, we establish sufficient condition for the existence of stationary distribution. Biologically, the existence of stationary distribution indicates the persistence of microorganisms. In quick succession, we derive the exact expression of probability density function around the positive equilibrium of a corresponding deterministic system. Besides, the extinction of species is discussed in two cases. Theoretical analysis indicates that the dynamics of the considered model is determined by four crucial parameters R 0 s ⁠ , R ̃ 0 s ⁠ , R 1 s ⁠ , and R ̃ 1 s ⁠ . The conditions presented for the persistence and extinction of microorganisms improve and generalize the previous results.

Based on an extension of some known models, we investigate the effect of the long-distance dispersal on population spread in a stream, using a time-periodic reaction-advection-diffusion system with nonlocal dispersal. We establish the existence of the upstream and downstream spreading speeds and show the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the noncritical periodic traveling fronts. Of particular interest is the influence of the nonlocal dispersal on the upstream spreading speed whose sign determines the persistence of the population. We find that, in the autonomous case, the strength of the nonlocal dispersal will increase the spreading speeds and if it is strong enough, then the upstream spreading speed is positive, which yields that the population can always persist.},

The present computation of the heat coefficient relies on Juhl’s explicit formula for GJMS operators, Gilkey’s expression for the integrated heat coefficient of higher-order Laplacians, and the conformal principle developed by Branson and Ørsted. The predicted total derivative coefficient stems from an explicit computation of the improved Casimir (or vacuum) energy on a sphere, which accounts for the multiplicative anomaly among the (shifted) Laplacian factors of the GJMS operators. Through the Cappelli–Coste relation, this coefficient is associated with the Euler density coefficient and the total derivative term in the 4D trace anomaly.},

Recently the solutions of these equations for scalar field theory have been analysed rigorously without recourse to perturbation theory, at the cost of restricting to the mean-field approximation [Kopper, Ann. Henri Poincare 23 , 3453–3492 (2022)]. In particular it was shown there that one-component φ 4 -theory in four dimensions is trivial if the bare coupling constant of the UV regularized theory is not large. This paper presents progress w.r.t. [Kopper, Ann. Henri Poincare 23 , 3453–3492 (2022)]: (1) The upper bound on the bare coupling is sent to infinity and the proof is extended to O ( N ) vector models. (2) The unphysical infrared cutoff used in [Kopper, Ann. Henri Poincare 23 , 3453–3492 (2022)] for technical simplicity is replaced by a physical mass.},

Irreps are labeled by pairs ( C , π ) ⁠ , where C is a conjugacy class in the role of a mass-shell, and π is a representation of the isotropy group C G in the role of spin. The geometric picture entails as a quantum homogeneous bundle where the base is G / C G , and D ∨ ( G ) → C ( G ) as another homogeneous bundle with base the group algebra C G as noncommutative spacetime. Analysis of the latter leads to a duality whereby the differential calculus and solutions of the wave equation on C G are governed by irreps and conjugacy classes of G respectively, while the same picture on C ( G ) is governed by the reversed data. Quasiparticles as irreps of D ( G ) also turn out to classify irreducible bicovariant differential structures Ω C , π 1 on D ∨ ( G ) and these in turn correspond to braided-Lie algebras L C , π in the braided category of G -crossed modules, which we call “braided racks” and study.

  abstract     = {In the context of C * dynamical systems, we consider a locally compact group G acting by *-automorphisms on a C* algebra U of observables, and assume a state of U that satisfies the clustering property with respect to a net of group elements of G . That is, the two-point connected correlation function vanishes in the limit on the net, when one observable is translated under the group action. Then we show that all higher order connected correlation functions (Ursell functions, or classical cumulants) and all free correlation functions (free cumulants, from free probability) vanish at the same rate in that limit. Additionally, we show that mean clustering, also called ergodicity, extends to higher order correlations. We then apply those results to equilibrium states of quantum spin lattice models. Under certain assumptions on the range of the interaction, high temperature Gibbs states are known to be exponentially clustering w.r.t. space translations. Combined with the Lieb-Robinson bound, one obtains exponential clustering for space-time translations outside the Lieb-Robinson light-cone. Therefore, by our present results, all the higher order connected and free correlation functions will vanish exponentially under space-time translations outside the Lieb-Robinson light cone, in high temperature Gibbs states. Another consequence is that their long-time averaging over a space-time ray vanishes for almost every ray velocity.},

We fully exploit the symmetry group isomorphic to Sp ( 4 , R ) ⁠ , that is, the two-fold covering of SO 0 (2, 3) [Sp ( 4 , R ) ∼ SO 0 ( 2 , 3 ) × Z 2 ], recognized as the relativity/kinematical group of motions in AdS 4 spacetime. In particular, we discuss that the group coset Sp ( 4 , R ) / S U ( 1 ) × S U ( 2 ) ⁠ , as one of the Cartan classical domains, can be interpreted as a phase space for the set of free motions of a test massive particle on AdS 4 spacetime; technically, in order to facilitate the computations, the whole process is carried out in terms of complex quaternions. The (projective) unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp ( 4 , R ) group, describing the quantum version of such motions, are found in the discrete series of the Sp ( 4 , R ) UIRs. We also describe the null-curvature (Poincaré) and non-relativistic (Newton-Hooke) contraction limits of such systems, on both classical and quantum levels. On this basis, we unveil the dual nature of “massive” elementary systems living in AdS 4 spacetime, as each being a combination of a Minkowskian-like elementary system with positive proper mass, with an isotropic harmonic oscillator arising from the AdS 4 curvature and viewed as a Newton-Hooke elementary system. This matter-vibration duality will take its whole importance in the quantum regime (in the context of the validity of the equipartition theorem) in view of its possible rôle in the explanation of the current existence of dark matter.},

A more complex and interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time (FPT) for process of upper bounds on the moments and FPT of the observable A , which are obtained by calculating the moments and FPT of the process of upper bound. Characteristic functions, average values and variances of the FPT of reaching fluctuations of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative levels are also obtained.

Although stochastic comparison results are well known in Laguerre ensembles (for β = 1, 2, 4) using the last passage percolation models, our results are novel even for β = 1, 2, 4, in Hermite ensembles. Taking the limit, we recover a stochastic domination result for Tracy–Widom distributions obtained in Pedreira [J. Theor. Probab. 38 (22), 10 (2025)]. Using this, we also obtain a result on the signs of means of Tracy–Widom distributions. Our methods also provide stochastic domination results for spiked beta ensembles as well. We compare ordering of all the eigenvalues collectively, with β as a parameter, by proving ordering of the moments of Hermite and Laguerre β -ensembles. In order to generalize the stochastic domination results of Pedreira, to higher order analogs of Tracy–Widom distributions, we study tail estimates of these distributions. We show that the description of these distributions as eigenvalues of a stochastic operator is inconsistent with the known tail estimates. As a result, we disprove a conjecture of Krishnapur et al.

This article examines the existence of a mild solution and the Ulam–Hyers stability of non-autonomous stochastic fractional differential system driven by fractional Brownian motion involving non-instantaneous impulses. The notion of mild solution for the considered system is explored via the operators induced by the closed linear operator and the probability density function. The existence of solution is investigated by the successive approximation method. We additionally study the Ulam–Hyers stability for the aforementioned system. The results are derived under the Lipschitz condition by using Borel–Cantelli’s lemma, Gronwall’s, and Chebyshev’s inequalities.

One satisfies the translation symmetry but is broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group, which contains the local Lorentz symmetry.

Our results partially reproduce and extend beyond results by Cederbaum and by Cederbaum and Galloway. In the positive and negative mass cases, we give three proofs which are based on the approaches to proving black hole uniqueness by Israel, Robinson, and Agostiniani–Mazzieri, respectively. In the zero mass case, we give four proofs. One is based on the positive mass theorem, the second one is inspired by Israel’s approach and in particular leads to a new proof of the Willmore inequality in ( R 3 , δ ) ⁠ , under a technical assumption. The remaining two proofs are inspired by proofs of the Willmore inequality by Cederbaum and Miehe and by Agostiniani and Mazzieri, respectively.

We develop a method to find boundary conditions relying on the simple form of the metric near the center of the black hole. This solution is evolved in the radial coordinate r , after a Fourier transform in time t is applied with periodic boundary conditions, combining a high order Runge–Kuta scheme with a novel implementation of the Frobenius method to avoid singular points. We present three distinct examples of the evolution of the norm | R NL | in terms of t and r , with values of the parameter L = 1, 2, 3; the mass m = 1; the Hayward’s characteristic length ℓ = 0.001; and the cosmological parameter Λ = 1000. The numerical simulation starts at r 0 = ℓ /10. The solutions suggest that oscillations, immediately after passing through the Schwarzschild radius, grow stronger and become more pronounced as the parameter L increases. Additionally, in the radial coordinate, the further | R NL | progresses, the less it oscillates, indicating a decaying behavior for larger r . Whereas the time evolution shows the anticipated periodic behavior and similarly for bigger L these ripples are more prominent.},

They are of great importance in Geometry (e.g., Lorentzian holonomy) and in Physics (General Relativity as well as alternative gravity theories). Our contribution in the present paper aims at a rigorous mathematical treatment focusing on completeness of Killing fields, and globality of coordinates. Equivalence of different approaches to plane waves is by no means easy to handle. We use here cohomogeneity one Heisenberg actions to introduce a point of view from which one can see plane waves as a deformation of Minkowski spacetime. We determine the identity component of the isometry group of a 1-connected non-flat homogeneous plane wave, which establishes a correspondence between these spaces and certain 1-parameter groups of automorphisms of the Heisenberg group. The extendibility of spacetimes (when incomplete) is a natural, important and delicate question. One of our main results is the proof of the C 2 -inextendibility of non-flat homogeneous plane waves. We also prove that they are geodesically complete if and only if the lightlike parallel vector field is preserved by the identity component of the isometry group. Finally, we show that a 1-connected homogeneous plane wave admits global Brinkmann coordinates.},

It is shown that the dynamics of these systems converges to the spatially homogeneous dynamics for increasing regions and particle numbers and a variety of boundary forces. The corresponding correlation functions of thermal equilibrium states also converge in this limit. Adding to the regions further particles, the limits are steady states, including Bose–Einstein condensates. They can either be spatially homogeneous, or they are inhomogeneous with varying, but finite local particle densities.

For a nearly minimal edge coloring, the running time is O ( μ 2 D 4 ), where μ is the number of edges in one cell (or “basis graph”) of the lattice graph and D is the maximum distance between two cells connected by an edge. Crucially, this complexity depends only on local properties of the lattice graph, making it independent of the total graph size. As a result, the method applies even to infinite lattice graphs with finite maximum degree. For minimal edge coloring, we lack a rigorous upper bound on the running time, which we find poses no limitation in practice; we use the method to minimally edge color the meshes of all k -uniform tilings of the plane for k ≤ 6 with modest computational resources. We find that all these lattice graphs belong to Vizing class I. By relating edge colorings to quantum circuits, our work has direct applications in quantum computation, including quantum simulation of condensed matter, cluster-state preparation, error characterization, and error correction.},

In general the one dimensional (1D) cubic Schrödinger equation has been left aside because of its complete integrability. In a series of papers of the last six years that we survey here for the special issue of the ICMP 2024, we considered, together with the 1D cubic Schrödinger equation, the binormal flow, which is a geometric flow explicitly related to it. We displayed rigorously a large range of complex behavior as creation of singularities and unique continuation, Fourier growth, Talbot effects, intermittency and multifractality, justifying in particular some previous numerical observations. To do so we constructed a class of well-posedness for the 1D cubic Schrödinger equation included in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space F L ∞ and in supercritical Sobolev spaces with respect to scaling. Last but not least we recall that the binormal flow is a classical model for the dynamics of a vortex filament in a three dimensional fluid or superfluid, and that vortex motions are a key element of turbulence.},

Specifically, we obtain the blow-up criterion in terms of the gradient of the velocity, the first order time derivative and first order spacial derivative of the square root of the density, and the gradient of direction field, where the last one satisfies the Serrin-type blowup criterion.

  abstract     = {The problem of nonintegrability of the circular restricted three-body problem is very classical and important in dynamical systems. In the first volume of his masterpieces, Henri Poincaré showed the nonexistence of a first integral, which is functionally independent of the Hamiltonian and real-analytic in a small parameter representing the mass ratio as well as in the state variables, in the planar case. However, his proof was very complicated and unclear. In this paper, we give a new and simple proof of a very similar result for both the planar and spatial cases, using an approach that the author developed recently for nearly integrable systems. The recent result of Yagasaki [Ergod. Theory Dyn. Syst. 44 , 3012–3049 (2024)] on this problem removes the dependence of the first integral on the small parameter, but it is limited to a small region in the phase space. We will see that the progress in the theory of nonintegrability of dynamical systems since the seminal work of Ziglin [Funct. Anal. Appl. 16 , 181–189 (1982)] can now simplify the proof of Poincaré’s result drastically.},

This enables us to derive the large n asymptotics of the recurrence coefficients via Dyson’s Coulomb fluid approach.

  abstract     = {The Boltzmann’s formula, formally known as S = log W , provides a basic concept of a relation between the logarithmic number of micro states log W and the thermodynamic entropy S . In this paper, we prove the Boltzmann’s formula in quantum unbounded lattice systems that includes not only the quantum anharmonic oscillator but also the Bose–Hubbard type model with negative interactions. Our approach is based on a particle number cut-off method, mini-max theory, and convex analysis. In particular, the cut-off method, nurtured in my previous work on classical non-compact spin systems [T. Kajisa. Rev. Math. Phys. 36 (08), 2450021 (2024)] is well harmonized with the non-commutative approximation method developed in [Stachura et al. , J. Math. Phys. 61 (11), 113303 (2020)]. Finally, we present how to relax the assumption of the negativity of interactions.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic helicity is a quantity that underpins many theories of magnetic relaxation in electrically conducting fluids, both laminar and turbulent. Although much theoretical effort has been expended on magnetic fields that are everywhere tangent to their domain boundaries, many applications, both in astrophysics and laboratories, actually involve magnetic fields that are line-tied to the boundary, i.e., with a non-trivial normal component on the boundary. This modification of the boundary condition requires a modification of magnetic helicity, whose suitable replacement is called relative magnetic helicity. In this work, we investigate rigorously the behaviour of relative magnetic helicity under turbulent relaxation. In particular, we specify the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundary and consider the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit of resistivity tending to zero in order to model the turbulent evolution in the sense of Onsager’s theory of turbulence. We show that relative magnetic helicity is conserved in this distinguished limit and that, for constant viscosity, the magnetic field relaxes in a weak, time-averaged sense to a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium.},

The first type of parameter-plane diagram, established by qualitative analysis combined with the center manifold theorem and the normal form theory, systematically characterizes clearly the types of fixed point and possible bifurcation curves. The second diagram, generated numerically, visually delineates stability domains for periodic solutions, quasi-periodic solutions, and chaotic orbits. Notably, three types of classical routes to chaos, period-doubling bifurcation, intermittency, and quasi-periodicity are all identified in the chaotic Rulkov neuron model. The third diagram employs color-coded representations of the largest Lyapunov exponent values across parameter space, revealing a comb-shaped chaotic region interspersed with periodic windows of varying periods. Particularly significant is the observation of successive period-adding and period-doubling bifurcations within each periodic window, demonstrating complex dynamical transitions in the Rulkov neuron model.},

  abstract     = {Reaction-diffusion processes on networked systems have received mounting attention in the past two decades, and the corresponding network dynamics theories have been continuously enriched with the advancement of network science. Recently, time-varying feature and many-body interactions have been discovered on various and numerous networks in real world like biological and social systems, and the study of contemporary network science has gradually moved away from the historically static network frameworks that are based on pairwise interactions. We are aimed to propose a general and rudimentary framework for Turing instability of reaction-diffusion processes on higher-order temporal networks. Firstly, we define a brand Laplacian to depict higher-order temporal diffusion behaviors on networks. Furthermore, the general form of higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion systems with frequency of oscillation is defined, and a time-independent and concise form is obtained by equivalent substitution and method of averaging. Next, we discuss the two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous network systems and give the equivalent conditions of Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Finally, in the numerical simulation part, we verify and discuss the validity of the above theoretical framework and study the effect of the frequency of oscillation of higher-order temporal network on reaction-diffusion processes. Our study has revealed that higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion, which takes into account both time-varying feature and many-body interactions, can formulate innovative and diversified patterns. Moreover, these are significantly differences from patterns in continuous space and patterns on traditional networks.},

To investigate the asymptotic behavior of strong solutions, the modifying factors F N ( ‖ v ‖ W 1 , 2 ( 1 + 2 ε ) 1 + 2 ε ) and F N ( ‖ v ‖ W 1 , 2 ( 1 + 2 ε ) 1 + 2 ε + ‖ T ‖ W 1 , 2 ( 1 + 2 ε ) 1 + 2 ε ) are introduced into the time fractional primitive equations. The global existence of strong solutions is established for the globally modified time fractional primitive equations. Subsequently, the existence and uniqueness of local (or global) strong solutions to the time fractional primitive equations are presented for any (or small) initial data and external force, in which we do not add any modifying factor on the nonlinear terms. Then after constructing a positively invariant absorbing set, we show the existence of a global attracting set for the globally modified time fractional primitive equations.},

  abstract     = {Previously, it was noticed that in some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, small or even zero in the static frame, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. If some components in the frame attached to a free-falling observer formally diverge, although scalar invariants remain finite, such space-times was named “truly naked black holes” (in mathematical language, one can speak about non-scalar singularity). Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. Our approach essentially uses the Newman-Penrose formalism, so we analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.},

Our main contribution is the derivation of the classical dynamics of a particle-field system as an effective equation of the quantum microscopic Nelson model, in the classical limit where the rescaled value of the Planck constant approaches zero ( ℏ → 0). Thus, we prove the validity of Bohr’s correspondence principle, that is to establish the transition from quantum to classical dynamics. We use a Wigner measure approach to study such transition. Then, as a consequence of this interplay between classical and quantum dynamics, we establish the global well-posedness of the classical particle-field interacting system.},

We show that the complex trajectories arises as a consequence of using the Bargmann–Segal (complex wave) representation of the bath. In particular, we construct a reproducing kernel Hilbert space for the bath auto-correlation and realize the space of complex trajectories as a Hilbert subspace. The reproducing kernel naturally arises from a feature space where the underlying feature map is the free dynamical evolution in the one-particle Hilbert space of the bath quanta. We exploit this to derive the unraveling of the open quantum system dynamics and show equivalence to the equation of Diósi and Strunz. We also give an explicit expression for the reduced dynamics of a two-level system coupled to the bath via a Jaynes–Cummings interaction and show that this does indeed correspond to an exact solution of the Diósi–Strunz equation. Finally, we discuss the physical interpretation of the complex trajectories and show that they are intrinsically unobservable.},

We derive in the weak coupling limit the reservoir statistics, which is determined by whose terms in the multi-point correlation functions of the reservoir which are non-zero in the WCL. Then we prove that the resulting reduced system dynamics converges to unitary dynamics (such behavior sometimes called as Quantum Cheshire Cat effect) with a modified Hamiltonian which can be interpreted as a Lamb shift to the original Hamiltonian. We obtain exact form of the modified Hamiltonian and estimate the rate of convergence to the limiting dynamics. For Fermi reservoir, we prove the convergence of the full Dyson series.

  abstract     = {This paper provides an estimation of the convergence rate to the steady state for the two-species Vlasov–Poisson–Boltzmann system. By leveraging methods used by Desvillettes and Villani for the Boltzmann equation and applying a quantitative H-theorem to the two-species solutions, we establish a series of second-order differential inequalities to estimate the duration of time intervals over which the relative entropy decreases to a constant multiple of itself, thereby achieve an almost exponential convergence rate of the solutions. This result is applicable to large initial data since the proof does not employ linearization around the stationary state. The main challenge of this work lies in handling interactions between particles and elucidating the relationship between the macroscopic quantities of different particles.},

The deformation-curl decomposition developed in [S. Weng and Z. Xin, Sci. Sin. Math. 49 , 307 (2019)] is utilized to effectively decouple the elliptic-hyperbolic mixed structure in the steady compressible Euler equation. A key parameter in the helical symmetry is the step (denoted by σ ), which denotes the magnitude of the translation along the symmetry axis after rotating one full turn. It is shown that the step determines the type of the first order partial differential system satisfied by the radial and vertical velocity. There exists a critical number σ * depending only on the background transonic flows, such that if 0 < σ < σ * , one can prove the existence and uniqueness of smooth helically symmetric transonic flows with nonzero vorticity.},

In particular, the initial data can be arbitrarily large. Moreover, it is obtained that both velocity and temperature decay exponentially as time tends to infinity.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, motivated by point interaction, we propose a new and explicit approach to inverse Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems under Dirichlet boundary. More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with δ -function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function , by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations with non-trivial positive integrable weights, which provide the possibility of the further study of inverse spectral problems for more general measure differential equations.},

In particular, under the assumption of spatial translation invariance, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the von Neumann entropy for large subsystem lengths and prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species underlying the right mover/left mover system. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states. Moreover, for general Fermi functions, we derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for the von Neumann entropy density to vanish.},

The probability mass function is generalised using the q -deformed algebra developed within the framework of nonextensive statistics, leading to the emergence of a family of divergence measures in the asymptotic limit as the system size increases. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when q is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation. Some fundamental properties of these extended divergences are also explored.},

We show that the matching conditions cannot be satisfied by the fluid with radial pressure, while the axial and azimuthal cases with a lapse function depending only on the time coordinate do satisfy these constraints.

We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold M , in the spirit of Lerner’s [Commun. Math. Phys. 32 , 19 (1973)], and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold Σ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite “large” in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when Σ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension. The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione’s [Indiana Univ.

The idea is to first define an “elementary” channel Φ 2 and then to analyze when Φ Φ 2 − 1 is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way—which even yields an explicit factorization of Φ—is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors x , x ⊥ such that 〈 x ⊥ | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = 〈 x | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = { 0 } where K Φ is the Kraus subspace of Φ and K Φ ⊥ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application—if possible—results in a factorization of Φ into in some sense “simple” channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.},

We establish the completeness relations for squared solutions to the Lax spectral problem and determine the Poisson brackets between the scattering data. Action-angle variables, expressed through the scattering data, are constructed based on these Poisson brackets. It is noteworthy that the analyticity of scattering data differs from that of the AKNS-type spectral problem, necessitating adjustments to the integral paths when deriving the completeness relations. Interestingly, the conservation laws for the equation can be expressed in terms of either the spectral parameter or the potential functions, revealing the connection between the potential functions and the scattering data.},

After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of PT -quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.},

This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of 1-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the 1-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H 2 and HeH + ), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the 4-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.},

In uniform internally heated convection, the supply of heat equally leaves the domain entirely by conduction in the absence of a flow. When the heating, quantified by the Rayleigh number, R , becomes sufficiently large, turbulent convection ensues, reducing the heat leaving the domain through the bottom boundary. In the case of no-slip boundary conditions, with the background field method, we prove that F B ≳ R − 2 / 3 − R − 1 / 2 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 2 / 3 ) ⁠ , up to a positive constant independent of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. Whereas between stress-free boundaries we show that, F B ≳ R − 40 / 29 − R − 35 / 29 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 40 / 29 ) ⁠ . We perform a numerical study of the system in two dimensions up to a Rayleigh number of 5 × 10 9 using the spectral solver Dedalus. The numerical investigations indicate that F B ∼ R − 0.092 and F B ∼ R − 0.12 for the two kinematic boundary conditions respectively.

  abstract     = {There have been several attempts in recent years to extend the notions of symplectic and Poisson structures in order to create a suitable geometrical framework for classical field theories, trying to achieve a success similar to the use of these concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics. These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.},

The radial equation is simply related to the famous hypergeometric equation, and our work is carried out in this general setting. We find several families of infinite sets of special parameter values for which Liouvillian solutions exist, and we demonstrate how to generate these solutions recursively. The solutions are related to hypergeometric polynomials and in some cases can be constructed explicitly. For some of the families, the Liouvillian solutions exactly satisfy the boundary conditions for quasinormal modes, a fundamental set of damped, outgoing wave-functions that depend only on the background spacetime and scalar field parameters. In these families we obtain agreement with published results on the scalar quasinormal modes of the pure de Sitter spacetime. For other families, we establish conjectures regarding the factorization of the parameter constraints required for existence of Liouvillian solutions. Our results are consistent with published results on the hypergeometric equation and the well known Pöschl–Teller equation. Our new contributions are to demonstrate how to generate the hypergeometric Liouvillian solutions recursively, to completely solve the quasinormal mode problem with Liouvillian solutions, and to analyze the Liouvillian parameter constraints for the hypergeometric equation, including the case of the physical de Sitter parameters. This work contributes new knowledge to the fields of special functions and general relativity.},

The quantum and classical systems share the entire eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are related one to one. When the birth rate B ( x ) and the death rate D ( x ) are chosen to be the coefficients of the difference equation governing the orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, the quantum system is exactly solvable. The eigenvectors are the orthogonal polynomials themselves and the eigenvalues are given analytically. Many examples are periodic since their eigenvalues are all integers, or all integers for integer parameters. The situation is very similar to the exactly solvable one dimensional quantum mechanical systems.

  abstract     = {The inclusion of spatial smoothing in finite-dimensional particle-based Hamiltonian reductions of the Vlasov equation and related models is considered. This work investigates the underlying Hamiltonian structure of such smoothed particle-based methods for Hamiltonian systems and the small-scale regularization such methods implicitly make in approximating the continuum theory. In the context of the Vlasov–Poisson equation and other mean-field Lie–Poisson systems, of which Vlasov–Poisson is a special case, smoothing amounts to a convolutive regularization of the Hamiltonian. This regularization may be interpreted as a change of the inner product structure used to identify the dual space in the Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian formulation. In particular, the shape function used for spatial smoothing may be identified as the kernel function of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space whose inner product is used to define the Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure. It is likewise possible to introduce smoothing in the Vlasov–Maxwell system, but in this case the Poisson bracket must be modified rather than the Hamiltonian. The smoothing applied to the Vlasov–Maxwell system is incorporated by inserting smoothing in the map from canonical to kinematic coordinates. In the filtered system, the Lorentz force law and the current, the two terms coupling the Vlasov equation with Maxwell’s equations, are spatially smoothed.},

When the matrix-valued potential is selfadjoint, is integrable, and has a finite first moment, the relevant transformations are constructed through the development of the Gel’fand–Levitan method for the corresponding Schrödinger operator. In particular, the bound-state normalization matrices are constructed at each bound state for any multiplicity. The transformations are obtained for all relevant quantities, including the matrix potential, the Jost solution, the regular solution, the Jost matrix, the scattering matrix, and the boundary condition. For each bound state, the corresponding dependency matrix is introduced by connecting the normalization matrix used in the Gel’fand–Levitan method and the normalization matrix used in the Marchenko method of inverse scattering. Various estimates are provided to describe the large spacial asymptotics for the change in the potential when the bound states are removed or added or their multiplicities are modified. An explicit example is provided showing that an asymptotic estimate available in the literature in the scalar case for the potential increment is incorrect.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study four kinds of polynomials: orthogonal with the singularly perturbed Gaussian weight w SPG ( x ), the deformed Freud weight w DF ( x ), the jumpy Gaussian weight w JG ( x ), and the Jacobi-type weight w JC ( x ). The second order linear differential equations satisfied by these orthogonal polynomials and the associated Heun equations are presented. Utilizing the method of isomonodromic deformations given by Dereziński et al. [Symmetry Integr. Geom. Methods Appl. 17 , 056 (2021)], we transform these Heun equations into Painlevé equations. It is interesting that the Painlevé equations obtained by the way in this work are same as the results satisfied by the related three term recurrence coefficients or the auxiliaries studied by other authors. In addition, we discuss the asymptotic behaviors of the Hankel determinant generated by the first weight, w SPG ( x ), under a suitable double scaling for large s and small s , where the Dyson’s constant is recovered.},

These solutions encompass diverse forms such as one-soliton, stationary and moving breathers, and two-soliton solutions, each demonstrating distinct properties.

We give a unified description for spacetime metric tensor with either Minkowski or Euclidean signature. The partial- p operation in the remaining diagrams of the two-point vertex part eliminates its overlapping divergences. We show how the parametric dissociation transform effectively removes the external momentum dependence of the coefficient of the squared bare mass after performing the partial- p operation in the two-point vertex part diagrams. The resemblance of this method with a minimal subtraction scheme in the massless theory is pointed out. We derive the Callan-Symanzik equations using minimal subtraction arguments and discuss the scaling limit in the ultraviolet region. We apply the method to determine critical exponents for an O ( N ) internal symmetry at least up to two-loop order with a flat Euclidean metric and find perfect agreement with all previous results in the literature.},

We present a novel and general mathematical framework with easily checked Lyapunov stability conditions that ensure the uniform-in-time convergence of Diffusion Monte Carlo estimates towards the top of the spectrum of Schrödinger operators. For transient free evolutions, we also present a divergence blow up of the estimates with respect to the time horizon even when the asymptotic fluctuation variances are uniformly bounded.

This paper is the first mathematical attempt to consider the Black–Karasinski process as the random effect in the modeling of epidemic transmission. It turns out that Black–Karasinski process is a both biologically and mathematically reasonable assumption compared with existing stochastic modeling approaches. We derive two critical values R 0 S and R 0 E to classify the long-term properties of the model. It is shown that (i) if R 0 E < 1 ⁠ , the brucellosis will die out exponentially; (ii) if R 0 S > 1 ⁠ , the stochastic model has a stationary distribution ϖ (·), which means the brucellosis prevalence; (iii) R 0 E = R 0 S = R 0 if there are no random fluctuations in brucellosis transmission, where R 0 is the basic reproduction number of its deterministic system. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to support our findings. It should be highlighted that our theoretical methods and techniques used can be applied to other complex high-dimensional epidemic models perturbed by Black–Karasinski process.},

  abstract     = {For Fuchsian differential equations with N singularities at finite points we display two simply expressed conditions on coefficients which guarantee equivalence, under a certain inversion transformation, to a differential equation with N − 1 singularities at finite points. For the radial and angular differential equations that govern perturbations of Kerr–Newman–de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes we find that these two conditions are satisfied identically for arbitrary values of all the parameters in the differential equations, including pole locations, with regular singularities and non-zero cosmological constant. From this we generalize the results of Suzuki, Tarasugi, and Umetsu, Prog. Theor. Phys. 100 , 491 (1998) and find 128 Heun equations which are equivalent to the equations which govern the perturbations of the KN(A)dS spacetimes.},

  abstract     = {We link the QUMOND theory with the Helmholtz–Weyl decomposition and introduce a new formula for the gradient of the Mondian potential using singular integral operators. This approach allows us to demonstrate that, under very general assumptions on the mass distribution, the Mondian potential is well-defined, once weakly differentiable, with its gradient given through the Helmholtz–Weyl decomposition. Furthermore, we establish that the gradient of the Mondian potential is an L p vector field. These findings lay the foundation for a rigorous mathematical analysis of various issues within the realm of QUMOND. Further, we prove that the once weakly differentiable Mondian potential solves a second-order partial differential equation in distribution sense. Thus, the question arises whether the potential has second-order derivatives. We affirmatively answer this question in the situation of spherical symmetry, although our investigation reveals that the regularity of the second derivatives is weaker than anticipated. We doubt that a similarly general regularity result can be proven without symmetry assumptions. In conclusion, we explore the implications of our results for numerous problems within the domain of QUMOND.},

The technique generalizes the well-known Frobenius trial series method used successfully on, e.g., the hydrogen atom and the Simple Harmonic Oscillator problems, where each of these potentials have one term. In these simple systems, the energy is quantized by the requirement of normalizability of the wave function. Our method uses this same idea, but is applied to potentials with an arbitrary number of terms, where here these terms are monomials of integer powers of r . Upon applying our technique to these more complicated potentials, we find quantization and relationships between not only the energy but also the various coupling constants. We apply our method to the two-dimensional exciton potential and to a family of two-dimensional potentials related by the Hurwitz transformation. We also suggest families of potentials functionally invariant, or periodic, to Hurwitz transformations. Finally, we treat a three-dimensional potential of interest in nuclear physics, and the three-dimensional sextic double-well potential.},

Additional assumptions on the ellipticity/parameter-dependent ellipticity of the differential complexes provide a wide range of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic operators. In particular, most equations related to modern mathematical physics are generated by the de Rham complex of differentials on exterior differential forms. These include the equations based on elliptic Laplace and Lamé type operators; the parabolic heat and mass transfer equations; the Euler type and Navier-Stokes type equations in hydrodynamics; the hyperbolic wave equation and the Maxwell equations in Electrodynamics; the Klein–Gordon equation in relativistic quantum mechanics; and so on. The advantages of our approach are that (1) the proposed method of PDE generation covers a broad class of generated systems, especially in high dimensions, due to different underlying algebraic structures and (2) it enables a direct constructing of the fundamental solutions/parametrices for the generated systems.},

Due to the lack of dissipation for velocity field, this stability problem is not trivial. In the absence of the stress tensor, the fluid velocity is governed by the compressible Euler equation. And it is widely known that solutions to the compressible Euler equations in all dimensions have been shown to develop finite-time singularities from smooth initial data such as shocks and cusps. Our result in this paper subsequently indicates the stabilizing effect of the stress tensor for viscoelastic fluids.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the blowup phenomenon of stochastic parabolic equations both on bounded domain and in the whole space. We introduce a new method to study the blowup phenomenon on bounded domain. Compared with the existing results, we delete the assumption that the solutions to stochastic heat equations are nonnegative. Then the blowup phenomenon in the whole space is obtained by using the properties of heat kernel. We obtain that the solutions will blow up in finite time for nontrivial initial data.},

  abstract     = {To explore the effects of individual diffusion patterns, transient immunity and acquired immunity, this paper focuses on a reaction-diffusion Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible epidemic model with transfer from infectious to susceptible and logistic source in a heterogeneous environment. First, the uniform bounds of solutions are obtained by using Moser–Alikakos iteration method and then the threshold dynamics is established based on the basic reproduction number. After investigating the asymptotic profiles of endemic steady states for small or large motility rates, it is found that regardless of whether the diffusion rates are minimal or maximal, the disease may persist globally, which means that the restriction on the migration of population is not an effective strategy. Next, some bifurcation analysis is conducted by taking transient/acquired immunity coefficient as bifurcation parameter. Finally, the impact of spatial heterogeneity, large/small diffusion rates on the disease transmission as well as bifurcation dynamics are explored via some numerical simulations for system on a one-dimensional domain.},

  abstract     = {Static black holes contain regions of spacetime, which not even light can escape from. In the center of mass frame, these blocks are separated from each other by event horizons. Unlike pointlike particles, fields can spread and interact non-causally across the horizons. The microlocal theory of this is somewhat incomplete, however. For instance, the theory of real principal type operators does not apply on the horizon. In this article, we address this issue for the extremal rotating black hole. Namely, we show that null covectors on the horizon of the extremal Kerr spacetime form an involutive double characteristic manifold and then extend the construction of parametrix across the event horizon. This provides a mathematical basis for the asymptotic oscillatory solutions in the region. Such approximations are central in quantum mechanics. In contrast to the real principal case, solutions near the horizon admit two channels for propagation of singularities. Indeed, there is additional propagation along the double characteristic variety.},
