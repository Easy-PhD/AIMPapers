  abstract     = {Machine translators have emerged as valuable tools for overcoming language barriers and facilitating communication across cultures. However, the effectiveness of these tools can vary considerably depending on the language pair (Arabic and English) and the type of text being translated (idiomatic expressions and proverbs). This study examines how idioms are translated by Google Translate (GT) and Gemini (GEM). A corpus of 100 commonly used Arabic idioms was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative section identifies how frequently each tool applies various approaches. The qualitative analysis examines several examples to determine whether the intended communicative sense was properly conveyed. The approaches fell under three main strategies: literal and word-for-word translations, sense-based translations, and figurative translations. The findings showed that GT showed a tendency towards literal translation at 37%. GEM, on the other hand, leaned towards the employment of figurative translation at 47%. GEM employed sense-based translation frequently at 3%. The qualitative analysis showed GT suffering from several issues that require improvements regarding lexical choice, grammar, and sentence structure. Although the majority of GEM’s translations were accurate, they sometimes showed inaccuracies and mistranslations in selecting the correct idioms. The findings of this study can benefit users and developers of AI by determining the strengths and weaknesses of each AI technology, giving an overview of the quality of their translations when dealing with fixed expressions.},

  abstract     = {Traditional mobile learning is constrained by the need to update its content manually and frequently due to rigid structures. Conversely, integrating LLMs with mobile learning applications is expected to provide a catalyst for both developers and teachers on programming and technical perspectives for such applications by considering automatic content generation, dynamic assessments, and reducing technical complexities. This study presents the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, with mobile learning applications developed for chemistry courses. The provided solution leverages LLM’s ability to provide content generation and real-time responses related to queries about the periodic table, electron configuration, chemical equations and game-based assessment, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness and engagement of mobile learning. An experimental evaluation was conducted to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT’s responses within the mobile learning application for chemistry. The results demonstrated that ChatGPT achieves an impressive 93.33% accuracy in providing information about elements and their categories from the periodic table. However, the accuracy rates for the chemical equation balancing and electron configuration tasks were relatively low, at 75.71% and 68.91%, respectively, indicating areas for further optimization and refinement. This research highlights the technical implications of LLM integration with mobile learning applications, including potential challenges and opportunities for developers and educators in terms of API communications, prompt engineering, and the quality and accuracy of AI-generated responses.},

  abstract     = {Computer numerical control (CNC) machining plays a crucial role in contemporary manufacturing with high precision and automation. The conventional CNC programming techniques, though, do not optimize tool path planning, and hence machining time, energy utilization, and tool wear are increased. This paper introduces a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization approach to minimize the cutting tool travel path (CTTP) in CNC machining. The CTTP problem is represented as a type of traveling salesman problem (TSP), with the machining operations represented as nodes and the goal being to determine the minimum tool path length while respecting operational constraints. The GA-based optimization framework employs effective chromosome representation for operation order, a multi-objective fitness function, and adaptive crossover and mutation operators. Experimental confirmation was performed on two case studies: a low-scale CNC machining facility with restricted operations and a high-scale facility with numerous planes of cutting. The outcome illustrated notable enhancements in machining effectiveness. Particularly, CTTP decreased by 12% in Case Study 1 and by 13% in Case Study 2. Machining time decreased by 36% in Case Study 1 and by 33% in Case Study 2. The energy efficiency was also enhanced with a 12% reduction in energy consumption in Case Study 1 and 13% in Case Study 2. The GA-based optimization performed better compared with conventional techniques with a 30%–40% decrease in machining time, improving tool life, and ensuring accuracy. Future research will investigate hybrid optimization methods, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, for real-time process adjustment.},

The evolution of motion capture technologies and wearable sensors has made real-time data analysis a valuable resource for both coaches and athletes. This paper introduces a new sports motion analysis approach based on a hybrid model that integrates the AlexNet and TabNet architectures. The method utilizes high-performance motion capture data, including joint angles, acceleration, and body posture, acquired via wearable sensors and processed using sophisticated feature extraction methods, such as wavelet transforms. The Lyrebird Optimization Algorithm (LOA) is used to select features, ensuring that only the most relevant data are utilized in the analysis. Our experimental outcomes demonstrate that our hybrid AlexNet-TabNet model achieves 98.85% accuracy, accompanied by equally high precision (98.60%) and sensitivity (98.61%), making it highly efficient for assessing sports performance.

  abstract     = {In this research, we assess the impact of training One-Class Classification (OCC) algorithms on the majority class versus the minority class, by employing highly imbalanced large and big datasets. It is worth highlighting that the accessibility of class data can be a major hurdle in training models. Depending on the situation, it may be possible to obtain one class within a reasonable time frame while not obtaining another. Our study centers around detecting fraudulent activities using the Credit Fraud Detection Dataset and a dataset derived from Medicare Part B, Part D, and the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) data, combined with the labels of the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) records. The Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, with its real-world transactional data and pronounced class disparity, serves as a benchmark for fraud detection. Notably, it stands as the only large-scale public dataset tailored for credit card fraud analysis. In Part B, Part D, and DMEPOS, researchers can investigate national trends and patterns based on Medicare big data. For our experiments, we use One-Class Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), One-Class Adversarial Nets (OCAN), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM). Their classification performance is evaluated with the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Given the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets, our results indicate that strategically focusing training on the majority class yields better results.},

On the other hand, for researchers faced with the task of building Machine Learning models for identifying fraud, when only legitimate transaction data is available, One-Class Classifiers are indispensable. We investigate the efficacy of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as a feature selection technique for One-Class classification tasks. In this study we utilize authentic data from the Credit Card fraud and Medicare insurance fraud application domains. Our contribution is to show that researchers can use SHAP in conjunction with One-Class Classifiers to do feature selection on highly imbalanced datasets, and then build models, with the selected features, that yield performance similar to, or better than, models built using all features. Our results in Big Medicare data fraud detection show that an over 90% data reduction through feature selection can nevertheless coincide with the best performance in terms of Area under the Precision Recall Curve.},

The process of turning a silkworm into a mature Bombyx mori moth yields peace of silk. Silkworms are more valuable because of their nutritional makeup, which includes vitamins, oils, proteins, minerals, and other beneficial elements. Silkworm diseases constitute a significant threat to the sericulture industry, causing substantial economic losses. However, there were research gaps in the areas of environmental factors and disease outbreaks. Existing diagnostic tools are limited in understanding complex disease interactions related to silkworm rearing. Addressing these research gaps is essential for improving silkworm disease prevention, control, and overall sericulture sustainability. Visual and time-consuming classification methods lead to errors, and it reduces productivity. Transfer learning was implemented for image classification. Gender classification of silkworm pupae using ResNetV2 architecture achieved 97% accuracy. The development of an automated system is done by employing a robotic arm integrated with a camera, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino Uno. A camera coupled with a Raspberry Pi captures high-resolution images of the pupae, subsequently processed for classification. Arduino Uno controls the robotic arm’s movements to classify each silkworm pupa by the category, like male, female or diseased. This automated AI based embedded hardware efficiently classifies the gender of silkworm pupa and hence reduces human intervention. The quality of silk production will be improved.},

  abstract     = {Crime analysis and predictive modeling in criminology face challenges due to data scarcity and privacy limitations. This happens due to a lack of comprehensive datasets that capture the complex aspects of crime. This research aims to develop a Multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network (MM-GAN) framework to accurately model complicated synthetic crime data. The goal of MM-GAN, which integrates several GAN architectures, is to provide varied and high-fidelity data depicting many crime elements in a unified model. These features include geographical distribution, temporal patterns, and category information. MM-GAN uses Conditional GANs (cGANs) to regulate the kinds of data produced according to crime characteristics like time, place, and kind. To further enhance the usability of the produced data for model training and guarantee that it properly represents real-world classifications, Auxiliary Classifier GANs (AC-GANs) are included to classify synthetic data. As a data format bridge, CycleGAN allows MM-GAN to represent various sources by facilitating cross-domain conversions between structured and unstructured. The model’s capacity to simulate seasonality and trends is enhanced by adding temporal GAN layers, which allow the model to capture sequential crime patterns. A strong resource for predictive analysis, risk assessment, and simulation training, MM-GAN-generated synthetic data closely matches real crime patterns, according to experiments. This framework provides a user-friendly and privacy-protecting tool for creating enhanced datasets, which is useful for criminology academics and law enforcement authorities. MM-GAN provides a scalable solution via synthetic data simulation to empower secure environments with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven insights and models.},

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by decreased Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and structural deterioration, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), often fail to detect osteoporosis at an early stage due to their limited sensitivity and accessibility. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL), and Machine Learning (ML) have shown significant potential in improving osteoporosis detection. However, existing models face challenges related to data privacy, explainability, computational complexity, and generalizability across diverse populations. This study introduces Federated Graph-based Multimodal Osteoporosis Diagnosis (FGMOD), a novel AI-driven framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced osteoporosis risk assessment. Unlike traditional DL models that rely on centralized training, FL ensures privacy-preserving learning across multiple hospitals and institutions. Simultaneously, GNNs model trabecular bone connectivity, offering deeper insights into microarchitectural changes in osteoporotic bones. Multimodal data fusion, incorporating structured clinical data, DXA scans, and biochemical markers, significantly improves prediction accuracy and interpretability. The proposed FGMOD model was validated on a real-world dataset comprising 10 000 patient records, 5000 DXA scans, and biochemical profiles. Comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art AI models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.2% accuracy, 93.4% precision, 93.1% recall, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96. Unlike CNN-based models, which rely heavily on high-resolution images, FGMOD effectively extracts clinically relevant features from graph-based bone connectivity analysis, ensuring robust and interpretable predictions. Furthermore, the use of SHAP-based feature importance analysis provides clinicians with an explainable AI decision-making process, enhancing trust in the model’s recommendations. Performance comparisons against CNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Transfer Learning models revealed that FGMOD outperformed all baselines, particularly in privacy-aware federated training, osteoporosis risk stratification, and real-time inference on edge AI devices. Additionally, FGMOD reduced inference latency to 45 ms per sample, making it suitable for real-time clinical deployment. FGMOD represents a significant advancement in AI-powered osteoporosis detection, addressing key challenges such as privacy, generalizability, and interpretability. Future research should focus on expanding FL collaborations across global hospitals, integrating wearable sensor data for continuous bone health monitoring, and enhancing GNN-based osteoporosis modeling for faster inference on mobile healthcare platforms. This study paves the way for clinically reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable AI solutions in osteoporosis risk assessment and early detection.},

A lightweight attention mechanism combining space and channel was designed based on RetinaNet, which makes the network pay more attention to pin regions and improve feature utilization. The combination of K-Means and differential evolution algorithm is used to derive anchor ratio, reduce anchor box search time, and improve detection efficiency. By improving the Canny Franklin moment and performing subpixel edge detection on pins, the chip pins are positioned more accurately while ensuring efficiency.

  abstract     = {In the symphony of human communication, the fusion of words and gestures creates a nuanced expression that transcends mere verbal exchange. Replicating this intricate dance in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a compelling challenge, with innovations aiming to make digital experiences more human-centric. This work addresses the challenge of gesture recognition by leveraging 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze hand gestures, focusing on time-series data derived from human pose detection. While both 3DCNN and LSTM have been used separately in related fields, their combination for gesture recognition has not been widely explored. The proposed model effectively extracts spatial features using 3DCNN and captures temporal dynamics with LSTM, leading to a 94% accuracy in ten-class classification using a five-fold cross-validation on 400 videos from four participants. Consequently, this work potentially marks a transformative era in gesture recognition, enabling contactless operation of hardware devices for more interactive experiences.},

  abstract     = {The intricate and recursive nature of deep learning models often obscures their inner workings, limiting their applications in high-risk domains like medical image analysis. The development of Explainable AI (XAI) methods has addressed this limitation by providing human-readable insights into these black-box models, which are widely used in image-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and localization. One popular and effective XAI technique is Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE), which uses a large number of random masks to visualize model behavior. However, RISE’s requirement for numerous masks leads to high space complexity. In this paper, we propose a modified RISE technique that optimizes the use of a relatively small number of masks through a Genetic Algorithm to enhance comprehensibility. Experiments with state-of-the-art classifier models on a publicly available Chest X-ray dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms other commonly used post hoc model-agnostic and non-model-agnostic techniques in terms of explanation quality and faithfulness metrics.},

  abstract     = {Low-resource Indian language development is a crucial and challenging task due to the linguistic diversity within India. This paper overviews the work and the importance of creating technologies and resources for these languages. India has about 19,500 languages, yet only 122 are considered significant. Many languages lack comprehensive linguistic resources, such as linguistic tools, well-annotated corpora, and natural language processing (NLP) models. These essential resources are missing for numerous languages, hindering the development of NLP systems. Of the approximately 1.4 billion people in India, only 20% are proficient in English, which is the dominant language of many online resources. Therefore, translating content into local languages is crucial for improving communication. For several reasons, it is crucial to develop technologies and resources for underrepresented Indian languages. This review focuses on (1) A comprehensive analysis of machine translation systems, (2) Key challenges in interface-equipped machine translation systems, (3) The application of automated machine translation, (4) Difficulties with automated machine translation, and (5) A thorough description of the methodologies and results related to machine translation. The paper analyzes several concerns and proposes efficient solutions to address these challenges.},

  abstract     = {As the population of older adults increases worldwide, the number of individuals afflicted with cardiovascular issues and diseases is also increasing. The rate at which individuals worldwide succumb to cardiovascular disease (CVD) is rising as well. That is, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the number one cause of death globally is from CVD either in the form of myocardial infarctions or strokes. The primary ways of assisting individuals with CVD are from either improved treatments, monitoring research, or primary and secondary prevention measures. In the form of cardiovascular structural monitoring, ultrasonography is very prevalent and allows for multiple configurations, is the least expensive, and has no detrimental side effects to the patient. This is the proof of concept study that investigates how we can combine a wearable ultrasound vest of multiple 2D transducers to create a 3D model of the heart for continuous monitoring. Furthermore, we create functional models to represent the states the heart can be in both respect to normal operations as well as Atrial Fibrillation. Using the wearable ultrasound vest created in our previous work, a 3D model is created via a structure from motion approach with synthetic data. Also, a denoising process is created to assist the modeling process. The 3D model is constructed with up to three views. That is, via the parasternal, frontal, and apical views where the frontal view is the halfway point between the apical and parasternal views. Furthermore, stochastic petri nets (SPN) are created to represent the cyclic states of the heart. The experimental results show a 3D model of the synthetic heart constructed from a point cloud created by the structure from the motion approach. Then, it is successfully denoised with our outlier detection and removal process. The resulting 3D model allows us to calculate surface areas and perform the continuous monitoring we initially set out to do. Finally, multiple SPN models are created for functional feature extraction as well as to assist medical professionals in continuous cardiovascular monitoring. In this paper, we demonstrated the structure from the motion approach to create a 3D model of the heart with our wearable ultrasound vest construction. Furthermore, we provided multiple SPN models for functional feature extraction and to monitor a normal heart and a heart affected by Atrial Fibrillation.},
